in my handkerchief  besides what I have on  For I had   all this time worn my own bought clothes  though my master would have   had it otherwise often  but I had put up paper  ink  and pens  however       So down I went  and as I passed by the parlour  she stepped in  and   said  Sir  you have nothing to say to the girl before she goes  I heard   him reply  though I did not see him  Who bid you say  the girl  Mrs    Jewkes  in that manner  She has offended only me       I beg your honour s pardon  said the wretch  but if I was your honour    she should not  for all the trouble she has cost you  go away scot free    No more of this  as I told you before  said he  What  when I have such   proof  that her virtue is all her pride  shall I rob her of that   No    added he  let her go  perverse and foolish as she is  but she deserves   to go honest  and she shall go so       I was so transported with this unexpected goodness  that I opened the   door before I knew what I did  and said  falling on my knees at the   door  with my hands folded  and lifted up  O thank you  thank your   honour  a million of times   May God bless you for this instance of your   goodness to me  I will pray for you as long as I live  and so shall my   dear father and mother  And  Mrs  Jewkes  said I  I will pray for you   too  poor wicked wretch that you are       He turned from me  and went into his closet  and shut the door  He need   not have done so  for I would not have gone nearer to him       Surely I did not say so much  to incur all this displeasure       I think I was loath to leave the house  Can you believe it   What could   be the matter with me  I wonder   I felt something so strange  and   my heart was so lumpish   I wonder what ailed me   But this was so   unexpected   I believe that was all   Yet I am very strange still    Surely  surely  I cannot be like the old murmuring Israelites  to long   after the onions and garlick of Egypt  when they had suffered there such   heavy bondage   I ll take thee  O lumpish  contradictory  ungovernable   heart  to severe task  for this thy strange impulse  when I get to my   dear father s and mother s  and if I find any thing in thee that should   not be  depend upon it thou shalt be humbled  if strict abstinence    prayer  and mortification  will do it       But yet  after all  this last goodness of his has touched me too   sensibly  I wish I had not heard it  almost  and yet  methinks  I am   glad I did  for I should rejoice to think the best of him  for his own   sake       Well  and so I went out to the chariot  the same that brought me down    So  Mr  Robert  said I  here I am again  a poor sporting piece for the   great  a mere tennis ball of fortune  You have your orders  I hope  Yes    madam  said he  Pray  now  said I  don t madam me  nor stand with your   hat off to such a one as I  Had not my master  said he  ordered me not   to be wanting in respect to you  I would have shewn you all I could    Well  said I  with my heart full  that s very kind  Mr  Robert       Mr  Colbrand  mounted on horseback  with pistols before him  came up to   me  as soon as I got in  with his hat off too  What  monsieur  said I    are you to go with me   Part of the way  he said  to see you safe  I   hope that s kind too  in you  Mr  Colbrand  said I       I had nobody to wave my handkerchief to now  nor to take leave of  and   so I resigned myself to my contemplations  with this strange wayward   heart of mine  that I never found so ungovernable and awkward before       So away drove the chariot   And when
