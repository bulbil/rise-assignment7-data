to alarm them  On this  they fled  and I heard them say  Let us make off  we have done his business  Incensed at the villainy  I pursued and came up with one of them  who turned upon me  I beat down his trombone  a kind of blunderbuss  just as he presented it at me  and had wounded and thrown him on the ground  but seeing the other russian turning back to help his fellow  and  on a sudden  two others appearing with their horses  I thought it best to retreat  tho  I would sain have secured one of them  My servants then seeing my danger  hastened  shouting  towards me  The bravoes  perhaps apprehending there were more than two  seemed as glad to get off with their rescued companion  as I was to retire  I hastened then to the unhappy man  But how much was I surprised  whe• I found him to be the Barone della Porretta  who  in disguise  had been actually pursuing his amour   He gave signs of life  I instantly dispatched one of my servants to Cremona  for a surgeon  I bound up  mean time  as well as I could  two of his wounds  one in his shoulder  the other in his breast  He had one in his hip joint  that disabled him from helping himself  and which I found beyond my skill to do anything with  only endeavouring  with my handkerchief  to stop its bleeding  I helped him into my chaise  stept in with him  and held him up in it  till one of my men told me  they had  in another part of   177 the thicket  found his servant bound and wounded his horse lying dead by his side  I then alighted  and put the poor fellow into the chaise  he being stiff with his hurts  and unable to stand   I walked by the side of it  and in this manner moved towards Cremona  in order to shorten the way of the expected surgeon   My servant soon returned with one  Jeronymo had sainted away  The surgeon dressed him  and proceeded with him to Cremona  Then it was  that  opening his eyes  he beheld  and knew me  and being told  by the sugeon  that he owed his preservation to me  O Grandison  said he  that I had followed your advice  that I had kept my promise with you —How did I insult you —Can my deliverer forgive me  You shall be the director of my future life  if it please God to restore me   His wounds proved not mortal  but he never will be the man he was  Partly from his having been unskilfully treated by this his first surgeon  and partly from his own impatience  and the difficulty of curing the wound in his hip joint  Excuse this particularity  madam  The subject requires it  and Signor Jeronymo now deserves it  and all your pity   I attended him at Cremona  till he was fit to remove  He was visited there by his whole family from Bologna  There never was a family more affectionate to one another  The suffering of one  is the suffering of every one  The Barone was exceedingly beloved by his father  mother  sister  for the sweetness of his manners  his affectionate heart  and a wit so delightfully gay and lively  that his company was sought by every body   You will easily believe  madam  from what I have said  how acceptable to the whole family the service was which I had been so happy as to render their Jeronymo  They all joined to bless me  and the more  when they came to know that I was the person   178 whom their Jeronymo  in the days of our intimacy  had highly extolled in his Letters to his sister  and to both brothers  and who now related to them  by word of mouth  the occasion of the coldness that had passed between us  with circumstances as honourable for me  as the contrary for himself  Such were his penitential confessions  in the desperate condition to which he found himself reduced   He now  as I attended by his bed or his couchside  frequently called for a repetition of those arguments which he had  till now  derided  He besought me to forgive him for treating them before with levity  and me with disrespect  next  as he said  to insult  And he begged his family to consider me not only as the preserver of his life  but as the restorer of his morals  This gave the whole family the highest opinion of mine  and still more to strengthen it  the generous youth produced to them  tho   as I may say  at his own expence  for his reformation was sincere   a Letter which I wrote to lie by him  in hopes to enforce his temporary convictions  for he had a noble nature  and a lively sense of what was due to his character  and to the love and piety of his parents  the Bishop  and his sister  tho  he was loth to think he could be wrong in those pursuits in which he
