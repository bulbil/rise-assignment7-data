 it cost me fifty Obans  and I had not time to taste a morsel —Well  then  I have watched that my fellow subjects should sleep  I have fasted that they should feed —I have not only watched and fasted  but I have prayed—no  not much of that—yes  by the Lord  I have prayed as it were—I have ejaculated—I have danced and sung at the Matsuris  which  you know  are religious rites—I have headed the multitude     96 and treated all the ragamuffins in Japan —To be certain  I could not do too much for our most excellent and sublime emperor  an emperor unequalled in wisdom  and unrivalled in generosity —Were I to expatiate from the rising of the sun to the setting thereof  I should not speak half his praise —O happy nation  O fortunate Japan  happy in such a Dairo to wield the sceptre  and let me add   vanity apart  fortunate in such a Cuboy to conduct the administration —Such a prince  and such a minister —a ha  my noble friend Soo san sin o  I see your Dayship smile—I know what you think  ha  ha —Very well  my Lord—you may think what you please  but two such head pieces—pardon  my royal master  my presumption in laying our heads together  you wo n t find again in the whole universe  ha  ha —I ll be damn d if you do  ha  ha  ha    The tumult without doors    97 was  by this time  increased to such a degree  that the Cuboy could utter nothing more ab anteriori  and the majority of the members sat aghast in silence  The Dairo declared he would throw his cap out of the window into the midst of the populace  and challenge any single man of them to bring it up  but he was dissuaded from hazarding his sacred person in such a manner  Quamba cun dono proposed to let loose the guards among the multitude  but Fika kaka protested he could never agree to an expedient so big with danger to the persons of all present  Sti phi rum poo was of opinion  that they should proceed according to law  and indict the leaders of the mob for a riot  Nin kom poo po exhorted the Dairo and the whole council to take refuge on board the fleet  Gotto mio sweated in silence  he trembled for his money bags  and dreaded another encounter with the mob  by whom    98 he had suffered severely in the flesh  upon a former occasion  The president shrugged up his shoulders  and kept his eye fixed upon a postern or back door  In this general consternation  Foksi roku stood up and offered a scheme  which was immediately put in execution    The multitude  my Lords   said he  is a many headed monster—it is a Cerberus that must have a sop —it is a wild beast  so ravenous that nothing but blood will appease its appetite —it is a whale  that must have a barrel for its amusement —it is a daemon to which we must offer up human sacrifice  Now the question is  who is to be this sop  this barrel  this scape goat —Tremble not  illustrious Fika kaka—be not afraid—your life is of too much consequence —But I perceive that the Cuboy is moved—an unsavoury odour assails my nostrils—brief let me be—Bihn goh must be the victim—happy     99 if the sacrifice of his single life can appease the commotions of his country  To him let us impute the loss of Motao —let us  in the mean time  soothe the rabble with solemn promises that national justice shall be done —let us employ emissaries to mingle in all places of plebeian resort  to puzzle  perplex  and prevaricate  to exaggerate the misconduct of Bihn goh  to traduce his character with retrospective reproach  strain circumstances to his prejudice  inflame the resentment of the vulgar against that devoted officer  and keep up the flame by feeding it with continual fuel      The speech was heard with universal applause  Foksi roku was kicked by the Dairo and kissed by the Cuboy  in token of approbation  The populace were dispersed by means of fair promises  Bihn goh was put under arrest  and kept as a malefactor in close prison  Agents were    100 employed through the whole metropolis to vilify his character  and accuse him of cowardice and treachery  Authors were enlisted to defame him in public writings  and mobs hired to hang and burn him in effigie  By these means the revenge of the people was artfully transferred  and their attention effectually diverted from the ministry  which was the first object of their indignation  At length  matters being duly prepared for the exhibition of such an extraordinary spectacle  Bihn goh underwent a public trial  was unanimously found guilty  and unanimously declared innocent  by the same mouths condemned to death and recommended to mercy  but mercy was incompatible with the designs of the ad—n  The unfortunate Bihn goh was crucified for cowardice  and bore his fate with the most heroic courage  His behaviour at his death was so inconsistent with the crime    101 for which he was doomed to die  that the emissaries of the Cuboy were fain to propagate a report  that Bihn goh had bribed
