 LETTER XXXVI  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Friday  Feb  24   MY cousin Reeves has given assurance to the sister of that Wilson  that he may  unmolested by any of us  pursue the best means he can fall upon for the obtaining of an honest livelihood   In every thing it is determined to follow the advice of my deliverer   What a letter is that fellow s  What men are there in the world   Of such we have read  But I hoped  that I might have escaped suffering by any such   We are extremely disturbed at the fellow s postscript  and the more  as we are told by several people  that Sir Hargrave will not sit down quietly  but threatens vengeance upon Sir Charles  I wish I had not come to London   I hope my grandmamma s spirits are not affected by what she knows of the matter  It was very good of my aunt Selby to take the measures she did  in softening every circumstance  and not to let her know anything till the danger was over  But indeed it was but the natural effect of that prudence which regulates all the actions of my honour d aunt   My grandmamma has such strength of mind  that now she knows I am safe  and not unhappy  I dare say she will by degrees bear to hear my narrations read  She will be more uneasy if she thinks any thing is kept from her   Yet I know that her tenderness and her love for her Harriet will cost her some anguish  some sighs  some tears  as she reads  or hears read  the cruelty her girl has been treated with  Who  so tenderly brought up  so greatly indulg d  never before knew what harshness   249 was  and had only read of the words cruelty  barbarity  and such like words  But then she will have more joy I hope  in my deliverance than she will have pain in my sufferings  And pray let her know  that I am every day less and less sensible of the pain in my stomach  of which I was so apprehensive  as really at the time to think it a mortal blow  My grandmamma has told us girls  you know  my Lucy  twenty and twenty frightful stories of the vile enterprizes of men  against innocent creatures  and will therefore call to mind stories which have concluded much worse than  blessed be God  mine has done   JUST now I have received a congratulatory pacquet of Letters   One from my aunt Selby  such a sweetly kind  such a truly maternal Letter   One from my dearest grandmamma  I will put it next my heart  whenever I feel there any of that pain  of which she is so kindly apprehensive   One from Nancy—Dear girl —She is very  very generous to forget her own malady to condole and congratulate me  Your brother James  my Lucy  has written me a very kind Letter  He is a good young man  God keep him so  What a mischievous creature is a bad man   I have a charming Letter  by the post  from my godfather Deane  He has heard nothing of what has happened  and I am sure is too sollicitous for my welfare  to take it well  if I do not let him know something about it  I will therefore soon write to him   But your Letter  my Lucy —What  I warrant  you thought I had forgot your Letter in the enumeration of the contents of the precious pacquet  If I had  your goodness  your love  might have made you forgive me  But I never would have forgiven myself   But you and I  my dear  write for all to see what we write  And so I reserved yours to be last mention d    250 Only I slid in my godfather Deane s between  not because I love him better than I do my Lucy—No  that is impossible —But because I had a mind to shew you  that I was hastening to be quite well  and so assumed my little saucy tricks  and surprizes  as if it were possible for me to be heedless  where my love to my Lucy was in the question   And so you expect the particular character and description of the persons of this more than amiable brother and sister  Need you to have told me that you do  And could you think that after having wasted so many quires of paper in giving you the characters of people  many of whom deserved not to be drawn out from the common croud of mortals  I would forbear to give you those of persons who adorn the age in which they live  and even human nature   You don t question  you say  if I begin in their praises  but my gratitude will make me write in a sublime stile  so you phraise it  and are ready  you promise me  to take with allowance  all the fine things from me  which Mr  Reeves has already taught you to expect   You may be right  in your expectations  as far as I know  for my grandfather  so many years ago
