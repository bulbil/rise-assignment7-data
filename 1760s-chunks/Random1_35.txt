poor unfortunate woman   answered Mrs  Weazel  upon whom I beg you for Christ s sake  to have compassion  —   Are you maid or wife    said he —   Wife to my sorrow    cried she  —   Who  or where is your husband    continued he  —   My husband   replied Mrs  Weazel  is an officer in the army  and was left sick at the last inn where we dined  —   You must be mistaken  madam   said he  for I myself saw him get into the waggon this afternoon —But pray what smell is that  Sure your lapdog has befoul d himself —let me catch hold of the nasty cur  I ll teach him better manners  —    92 Here he laid hold of one of Weazel s legs  and pulled him from under his wife s petticoats where he had concealed himself —The poor trembling captain being detected in this inglorious situation  rubbed his eyes  and affecting to wake out of sleep  cried    What s the matter —What s the matter  —   The matter is not much   answered the horseman  I only called in  to enquire after your health  and so adieu  most noble captain  —  Having said this  he clapped spurs to his horse  and was out of sight in a moment —It was some time before Weazel could recollect himself  but at length  re assuming the big look  he said    Damn the fellow  why did he ride away  before I had time to ask how his lord and lady do —Don t you remember Tom  my dear    x addressing himself to his wife —   Yes   replied she  I think I do remember something of the fellow —but you know I seldom converse with people of his station  —   Hoy day   cried Joey  do yaw knaw the young mon  coptain  —   Know him   said Weazel  many a time has he filled a glass of Burgundy for me  at my lord Trippit s table  —   And what may his neame be  coptain    said Joey     His name —his name  replied Weazel  is Tom Rinser —   Waunds   cried Joey  a has changed his true neame then  for I se lay any wager he was christened John Trotter  —  This observation raised the laugh against the captain  who seemed very much disconcerted  when Isaac broke silence  and said    It was no matter who or what he was  since he had not proved the robber we suspected —And that we ought to bless God for our narrow escape  —   Bless   93 God   said Weazel  bless the devil  for what  had he been a highwayman  I should have eat his blood  body and guts  before he had robbed me  or any one in this Diligence  —   Ha  ha  ha   cried miss Jenny  I believe you will eat all you kill indeed  captain  —  The usurer was so pleased at the event of this adventure  that he could not refrain from being severe  and took notice that captain Weazel seemed to be a good Christian  for he had armed himself with patience and resignation  instead of carnal weapons  and worked out his salvation with fear and trembling —This piece of satire occasioned a great deal of mirth at Weazel s expence  who muttered a great many oaths  and threatned to cut Isaac s throat —which the usurer taking hold of  said    Gentlemen and ladies  I take you all to witness  that my life is in danger from this bloody minded officer —I ll have him bound over to the peace    This second sneer  procured another laugh against him  and he remained crest fallen during the remaining part of our journey       94  CHAP  XIII   Strap and I are terrified by an apparition—Strap s conjecture—the mystery explained by Joey—we arrive at London—our dress and appearance described—we are insulted in the street—an adventure in the ale house—we are imposed upon by a waggish footman—set to rights by a tobacconist—take lodgings—dive for a dinner—an accident at our ordinary   WE arrived at our inn  supped and went to bed  but Strap s distemper continuing  he was obliged to get up in the middle of the night  and taking the candle in his hand  which he had left burning for the purpose  he went down to the house of office  whence in a short time he returned in a great hurry  with his hair standing on end  and a look betokening horror and astonishment  Without speaking a word  he set down the light  and jumped into bed behind me  where he lay and trembled with great violence —When I asked him what was the matter  he replied  with a broken accent     God have mercy on us  I have seen the devil  —  Though my prejudice was not quite so strong as his  I was not a little alarmed at this exclamation  and much more so  when I
