used to grow spontaneously before  Now I am sufficiently orthodox in sound Doctrine  tho  I have not a Leprosy of Faith about me  and  if this moral Exercise  both of Body and Mind  was meant as a Curse  how comes it to be attended with so much rational and philosophick Pleasure  If the Mind of Man was changed  at the same Time  so as to accommodate itself to this Employment  what is become of the Curse  There is such a natural Sense of these Pleasures implanted in our Souls  that we are struck with it  at first Sight  we know not how  we feel a vague Kind of Admiration  we know not why  and are sensible of a certain Earnestness of Affection  we know not for what  not unlike the first Longings of a Maid  How high then must this natural Pleasure be  when it becomes a rational one  when we are able to contemplate the Beauties of the Creation in a philosophick Light  to explore the admirable Contrivance of Providence  and investigate the hidden Causes of all natural Effects —But I am going too far  and detaining myself from the Enjoyment of a Pleasure  in the Contemplation of it  so shall take my   215 Leave of it  and you  in order to prepare myself more speedily for the charming Possession of both  which  if I could enjoy together  would form the highest Satisfaction  I am  at present  capable of   Adieu   my Eloise   LETTER CXVI   Belvidere — My dear FANNY   IF you observe  I generally accost you by the Stile above mentioned  because it is the first that occurs to me  The Noms d Amour of Eloise  or Sappho  may be more according to the Rules of Gallantry  But as in the latter Titles you are considered as a personated Character  and in the Former a real One  I chuse to address you in the familiar Phrase  as I well know  you have more Charms in Reality  than it is in the Power of Fiction to give you  In short  my dear Girl  according to an elegant Description in some of the Classicks  in the Novel you are formosa  but in yourself  ipsa Forma  The making Use of Latin Sentences to you may  perhaps  appear a little pedantick  but there is indeed  in your Understanding  so little of Effeminacy  that I frequently consider you  not only as a Man  but a Man of Letters too  and I remember  I once threatened  — that  if at any Time you should say or do any Thing   216 rude to me  I believed  I should be brave enough to draw my Sword on you   Some elegant Author says  that  in Waiting for his Mistress  all the rest of Life is but Attending  till the comes  so I confess sincerely to you  that  in your Absence  I have no Enjoyment of myself  but in this distant Intercourse between us  for  when I am at Leisure to retire within myself  you are the only Object placed there  which I find any Pleasure to converse with   I have observed  since the Inter regnum of our Loves  a certain good Breeding in my Manners  and Complacency of Address towards you  which I am extremely pleased with  which shews the Difference between a Triumph over our Persons  and a Conquest over our Minds  In a Word  the Redintegration of our Affections  like a mutual Triumph  is to be considered more as an Alliance  than a Conquest  and  for my own Part  I confess that the Regaining of your Regard and Esteem  like a Conquest over one s own Passions  has such a Resignation to Sense and Virtue  that it inspires me with a calm  humble Pride  very different from the Exultation we feel  upon ordinary Triumphs   I received your Letter  but could not answer it  last Post  as my Head  Heart  and Hand were taken up  to serve a Relation and Friend   Adieu   Henry     217  LETTER CXVII   My dear HARRY   I CONFESS that  like you  I am fonder of this simple Appellation  than all the florid Names  that ever graced Romance  but  like your Complaisance  this Fondness bears but a late Date  For I well remember a Time  when I would have exchanged the most advantageous Proposal of Marriage  for a Letter signed Orondates  Cyrus  or any other heroick Name  I can now  with great Pleasure  boast a Change in my Disposition  almost to a direct Contradiction of my former Sentiments  and can assure you  that I think it a very high Triumph for a Woman  under five and Twenty  to have surmounted all the Romance  which could possibly be crammed into a little female Soul   Hurried as I am  and plagued with Business more than ever I was in my Life  I pass many Hours in silent Conversations with you  and  when I start from my Reveries  am surprized  and sorry at not finding you  close by my Side   —My being immersed in Business  as it
