the same whom we have seen  upon a former occasion  trusted by the old Pretender  and betraying him by taking possession of the castle of Stirling for King George  This nobleman  true to neither party  had again altered from his attachment to the house of Hanover  and  in secret  aided the young Chevalier  studious only for his own interest  he exerted all the arts of low cunning  to appear an open enemy to the rebellion  yet to give it secret assistance   While the young Pretender thus trifled away the time at Edinburgh   for all delays in dangerous enterprizes are even worse than defeats  the ministry of Great Britain took every possible measure to defeat his intentions  Six thousand Dutch troops that had come over to the assistance of the crown  were sent northward  under the command of General Wade  but  as it was then said  these could lend no assistance  as they were  properly speaking  prisoners of France  and  upon their parole  not to oppose that power for the space of one year  However this be  the Duke of Cumberland soon after arrived from Flanders  and was followed by another detachment of dragoons and infantry  voluntiers in different parts of the kingdom employed themselves n the exercise of arms  and every county exerted … generous spirit of indignation  both against the mbition  the religion  and the allies of the young dventurer   It would be illiberal and base  to deny this enter…ising youth that praise which his merit may deserve    178 Though he might have brought civil war  and all the calamities attending it  with him  into the kingdom  yet we must consider  that he had ever been taught that bathing his country in blood was but a just assertion of his right  that altering the constitution and  perhaps  the religion of his supposed dominions was a laudable object of ambition  Thus inspired he went forward with vigour  and resolving to make an irruption into England  he entered it by the western border  on the sixth day of November  Car¦lisle was invested  and  in less than three days  it surrendered  Here he found a considerable quantity o arms  and was declared King of Great Britain  Ge¦neral Wade being apprized of his progress  advance across the country from the opposite shore  but  re¦ceiving intelligence that the enemy were two day march before him  he retired to his former station The young Pretender now resolved to proceed  hav¦ing received assurances from France that a consider¦able body of troops would be landed on the souther coast of Britain  to make a diversion in his favour and  flattered with the hopes of being joined by … large body of English malecontents  as soon as h should make his appearance among them  Leavin therefore a small garrison in Carlisle  which he shoul rather have left defenceless  he advanced to Penrit… marching on foot in an Highland garb  and continue his irruption till he came to Manchester  where h established his head quarters  He was here joine by about two hundred English men  who were forme into a regiment  under the command of Colon… Townley  From hence he prosecuted his route t Derby  intending to go by the way of Chester int Wales  where he hoped for a great number of adhe¦rents  He was  by this time  advanced within a hundred miles of the capital  which was filled wit terror and confusion  The King resolved to take th field in person  The voluntiers of the city were in¦corporated   179 into a regiment  The practitioners of the law resolved to take the field  with the judges at their head  Even the managers of the theatres offered to raise a body of their dependants for the service of their country  Yet these combinations only served as instances of the national terror  for the trading part of the city  and those concerned in the money corporations  were overwhelmed with dejection  They could hope for little safety in the courage or discipline of a militia  especially as they  every hour  dreaded an invasion from France  and an insurrection of the Roman Catholics  and other friends to the expelled family  This therefore was the moment for the advancement of the adventurer s enterprize  Had he marched up to the capital  he would undoubtedly have been joined by several  secretly attached to his cause  But he determined to retreat once more to Scotland  and thus his scheme was defeated  In fact  he was but nominally the leader of his forces  His Generals  the chiefs of Highland Clans  were  from their education  ignorant  and  from their independency  obstinate  They each embraced peculiar systems  and began to contend with each other for the pre eminence  so that after violent disputes  they resolved to march back  They effected their retreat to Carlisle without any loss  and from thence crossed the rivers Eden and Solway into Scotland  In this irruption  however  they preserved all the rules of war  they desisted  in a great measure  from rapine  levied contributions  and  in the usual form  left a garrison at Carlisle in their retreat  which  a short time after  to the number of four hundred  surrendered  to the Duke of Cumberland
