  I never saw so   affectionate a husband  and so tender a father  Our conversation   at dinner turned on the manners and customs of the inhabitants   of the neighbourhood  You would really think that Mr  Brooke   was talking of his own children  they were all so dear to him    He prayed for them  and blessed them over and over again  with   tears in his eyes    He was so tender hearted  they say  that   Mrs  Brooke was always afraid to tell him of the death of a neigh    bouring cottager     That evening we walked into the garden      b         m PREFACE      His favourite flowers were those that were planted by the hands   of his wife and daughter  I was astonished at his skill m botany    He dwelt on the virtues of the meanest weeds  and then launched   out into such a panegyric on vegetable diet  that he almost made   me a Pythagorean    We came to a little gurgling   stream Mr  Brooke  who was from youth a fine Italian scholar    gazed on it for some moments  and then repeated these lines out   of Metastasio       1 Copre in van le basse arena   Picciol rio con velo ondoso    Che rivela in fondo algoso   La chiarezza dell  umor                 u And Noah was a just man  and perfect in his generations   and   Noah walked with God   Even such was Henry Brooke  though    like Noah  he saw cause to be deeply dissatisfied with the state of   the world around him  and gave much excellent advice in his   time  for which he was only laughed at  Surely the thousands    probably exaggerated by the ardent imagination of the Milesian     which are said to have passed through his hands  were not alto    gether ill spent  of squandering there is no proof   if they had   bought that which is above all price  the love and prayers of every   human being round   if they had gone to soften and develop the   humanity of those poor savage oppressed Celts  Had the money   been invested in business  and lost  as men of business now a days   are wont to lose   in the normal and respectable way of bankruptcy    no one would have thought the worse of him  And surely Henry   Brooke  like every man in a free country  had a right to spend his   money as seemed best to him  When he owed he paid  though it   cost him great sacrifices   he had to the last enough whereon to   live honoured  and to die happy   and what does man want more     There always have been  and there always will be  those who   having food and raiment  fitted at least for their station  are there    with content  because they prefer the making of human characters    their own and others  to the making of money   and find that one   human brain cannot attend to both occupations at once  Of such   was Henry Brooke      Of his later publications I shall say but little   a clever political   opera of his   Jack the Giant queller   was acted in Dublin as   early as 1748  full if not of humour  still of fluent Irish wit  thrown   into comic songs  of his usual lofty morality  The censor of the   Dublin stage  to do him justice  must have been far more liberal   than the English Lord Chamberlain  or the Giant queller would   have been a co martyr with Gustavus Vasa  There are several   more tragedies and comedies from his pen  seemingly first printed         PREFACE  liii     m 1778  when he had ceased to write  and a novel    Juliet Gren    ville  or the History of the Human Heart   published 1774  in   which his biographers only see   the ruins of genius       Of his last years  which were spent in Dublin with his only sur    viving daughter  no record remains  Mrs  Brooke died in 1772    and a very dear daughter just before her  His only surviving son    Arthur  was serving in the army in Canada  and he was left alone   with Charlotte  now the only girl  an accomplished woman of   genius  and author of the earliest translations of Irish poetry  From   the time of his wife s death he shut himself up from the world  and   was thought by many to be dead
