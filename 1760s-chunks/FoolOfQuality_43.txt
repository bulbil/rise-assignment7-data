bred  and had received all his nourishment  So  when he   came down  he happened to alight among dry sands and rocks    where there was not a bit to eat  nor a drop of water to drink     and so there he lay faint and tired  and unable to rise  gasping   and fluttering and beating himself against the stones  till at length   he died in great pain and misery      Now the second silver trout  though he was not so high minded   as the first little proud trout  yet he did not want for conceit   enough   and he was  moreover  a narrow hearted and very selfish   little trout  and  provided he himself was snug and safe  he did   not care what became of all the fishes in the world  So he says   to God    May it please your honour  I don t wish  not I  for wings to fly   out of the water  and to ramble into strange places  where I don t   know what may become of me  I lived contented and happy   enough till the other day  when  as I got under a cool bank from   the heat of the sun  I saw a great rope coming down into the   water  and it fastened itself  I don t know how  about the gills   of a little fish that was basking beside me  and he was lifted out   of the water  struggling and working in great pain  till he was   carried  I know not where  quite out of my sight   so I thought in   my own mind  that this evil some time or other may happen to   myself  and my heart trembled within me  and I have been very   sad and discontented ever since  Now  all I desire of you is  that   you would tell me the meaning of this  and of all the other dangers   to which you have subjected us  poor little mortal fishes   for then   I shall have sense enough to take care of my own safety  and   I am very well able to provide for my own living  I warrant you      No sooner said than clone  God immediately opened his under    standing   and he knew the nature and meaning of snares  nets    hooks  and lines  and of all the dangers to which such little trouts   could be liable      At first he greatly rejoiced in this his knowledge   and he said   to himself Now surely I shall be the happiest of all fishes  for   as I understand and am forewarned of every mischief that can         10 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      come near me  I m sure I love myself too well not to keep out   of harm s way      From this time forward he took care not to go into any deep   holes  for fear that a pike or some other huge fish might be   there  who would make nothing of swallowing him up at one     He also kept away from the shallow places  especially in hot   weather  lest the sun should dry them up  and not leave him   water enough to swim in  When he saw the shadow of a cloud   coming and moving upon the river Aha   said he to himself  here   are the fishermen with their nets   and immediately he got on one   side and skulked under the banks  where he kept trembling in his   skin till the cloud was past  Again  when he saw a fly skimming   on the water  or a worm coming down the stream  he did riot dare   to bite  however hungry he might be No  no  said he to them    my honest friends  I am not such a fool as that comes to neither     go your ways and tempt those who know no better  who are not   aware that you may serve as baits to some treacherous hook that   lies hid for the destruction of those ignorant and silly trouts that   are not on their guard      Thus this over careful trout kept himself in continual frights   and alarms  and could neither eat  nor drink  nor sleep in peace    lest some mischief should be at hand  or that he might be taken   napping  He daily grew poorer and poorer  and sadder and   sadder  for he pined away with hunger  and sighed himself to skin   and bone   till  wasted almost to nothing with care and melan    choly  he at last died  for fear of dying  the most miserable of all   deaths      Now  when God came to the youngest silver trout  and
