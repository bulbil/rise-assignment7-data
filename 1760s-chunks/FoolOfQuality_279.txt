  that you yourselves erected      As how  my dear young mentor  By being over bounteous in   paying former friends  and by being still more profuse in procuring   new adherents  Child of honour  cried the earl  another less   elegant than yourself would have said  that we are sapping the   constitution by bribery and corruption  You have indeed  my Harry    delicately tempered your admonitions even like the cup of life   the sweets with the bitters  But what say you  gentlemen  shall a   babe lately from the breast bear away the whole palm from people   grown grey in politics       The young gentleman  says Mr  Veer  the principal of the court   writers   talks wonderfully for one not versed in the subject of   which he treats  The people of England are stupidly proud and   licentiously ungovernable   they are the most ignorant  and yet most   obstinate  of any people upon earth  It is only by their being   selfish that they become in any degree manageable  If their voices   were not bought  they would either give them to persons of their   own stupid cast  unknowing in our laws or pur constitution  or to   men of anti monarchical and republican spirit  who would be per    petually putting rubs before the wheels of good government      I never knew till now  sir  returned Harry  that  in order to make   people true to their country and their king that is  in order to   make men honest it was necessary to corrupt them  But I have   still good hopes that the picture which you have drawn of our   governors is not altogether a just one      Governors   cries Veer  I spoke not a word of governors  You   spoke of the people  sir  says Harry  and they  as I take it  are our   governors  The people our governors   this is the most wonderful   and the newest doctrine that ever I heard  A doctrine even as old   as the constitution  rejoins Harry  They are not only our governors    but more absolutely so than any so styled  His lordship is the only   man in company whose person  in some instances  is exempt from   their jurisdiction   but his property remains still subjected to their   decision      No law can be made in Britain but by the people in their proxies     and  when those laws are made  the people are again constituted   the judges thereof on their jury tribunals  through their respective   shires   as also judges of facts and rights  whether civil or criminal    throughout the realm          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  301     Thus their privilege of making laws for themselves in PAE    UAMENT  and of judging of the said laws  when made  on JUEIES    composes  as it were  a rudder  whereby the people are admitted    gloriously  to steer the vessel of their own commonwealth      Would it not be a pity  then  that so great a people should be no   other than such as Mr  Veer has described them a parcel of   ignorant  licentious  selfish  base  venal prostitutes  unenlightened   by reason  and uninfluenced by conscience       If they should be reduced if it is possible  I say  that they   should ever be reduced to so very vile and deplorable a state  it   can only be by the very measures that Mr  Veer has recommended    The character  as ye know  of a certain old tempter  is not over   amiable  and 1 should be sorry that any whom I love and respect   should follow in his steps      And now  gentlemen  take the argument home to yourselves    The people have the disposal of our lives  liberties  and properties    Which of you  then  would like to have life itself  and all that is   valuable in it  at the arbitration of a pack of wretches  who  being   wholly selfish  can have no kindred feelings or compassion for you     who  being themselves devoid of honour and equity  cannot judge   according to the one or the other   who  being already accustomed   to influence and prostitution  have their ears and hands open to all   who would whisper or bribe them to your prejudice       I  as a fool  gentlemen  utter the dictates of wisdom   for I speak   the sentiments of a much wiser and much better man than myself    Should a general corruption take place in the land  adieu to all   virtue   adieu
