you what will surprise you  and you on your part shall give me your sincere opinion about the two women with whom you have brought me acquainted  Between ourselves  I suspect them to be no better than they should be  with so much the more of the knave in their composition  because they affect the simpleton  If my conjecture be right  the Prince of Spain has no great reason to be delighted with my activity  for I will own to you frankly  that it was for him I spoke to you about a mistress  I brought him to see Catalina  and he is over head and ears in love with her  Sir  answered Scipio  you have dealt so handsomely by me  that I shall act upon the square with you  I had yesterday a private inter view with the abigail  and she gave me a most entertaining history of the family  You shall have it briefly  though it did not come briefly to me   Catalina was daughter to a sort of gentleman in Arragon  An orphan at fifteen  with no fortune but a pretty face  she lent a complying ear to an officer who carried her off to Toledo  where he died in six months  having been more like a father than a husband to her  She collected his effects together  consisting of their joint wardrobe and three hundred pistoles in ready money  and then went to housekeeping with Signora Mencia  who was still in fashion  though a little on the wane  These sisters  every way but in blood  began at length to attract the attention of the police  The ladies took umbrage at this  and decamped in dudgeon for Madrid  where they have been living for these two years  without making any acquaintance in the neighbourhood  But now comes the best of the joke  they have taken two small houses adjoining each other  with a passage of communication through the cellars  Signora Mencia lives with a servant girl in one of these houses  and the officer s widow inhabits the other  with an old duenna  whom she passes off for her grandmother  so that her versatile child of nature is sometimes a niece brought up by her aunt  and sometimes an orphan under her grandam s fostering wing  When she enacts the niece  her name is Catalina  and when she personates the grand daughter  she calls herself Sirena   At the grating sound of Sirena I turned pale  and interrupted Scipio  saying    What do you tell me  Alas  it must be so  This cursed imp of Arragon is Calderona s charming Siren  To be sure she is  answered he  the very same  I thought you would be delighted at the news  Quite the reverse  replied I  It portends more sorrow than laughter  do not you anticipate the consequences  None of any ill omen  rejoined Scipio  What is there to be afraid of  It is not certain that Don Rodrigo will rub his forehead  and in case any good natured friend should show it him in the glass  you had better let the minister into the secret beforehand  Tell him all the circumstances straightforward as they happened  he will see that there has been no trick on your part  and if after that Calderona should attempt to do you an ill office with his excellency  it will be as clear as daylight that he is only actuated by a spirit of revenge   Scipio removed all my apprehensions by this advice  which I followed  in acquainting the Duke of Lerma at once with this unlucky discovery  My aspect  while telling my tale  was sorrowful  and my tone faltering  in evidence of my contrition for having unadvisedly brought the prince and Don Rodrigo into such close quarters  but the minister was more disposed to roast his favourite than to pity him  Indeed  he ordered me to let the matter take its own course  considering it as a feather in Calderona s cap to dispute the empire of love with so illustrious a rival  and not to be worse used than his lawful prince  The Count de Lemos  too  was informed how things stood  and promised me his protection  if the first secretary should come at the knowledge of the intrigue  and attempt to undermine me with the duke   Trusting to have secured the frail bark of my fortunes by this notable contrivance from the rocks and quicksands that threatened it  my mind was once more at rest  I continued attending the prince on his visits to Catalina  sirenlike in nature as in nickname  who was fertile in quaint devices to keep Don Rodrigo away from next door  whenever the course of business required her to devote her nights to his royal competitor       CH  XIII     Gil Blas goes on personating the great man  He hears news of his family  a touch of nature on the occasion  A grand quarrel with Fabricio   I MENTIONED some time ago  that in the morning there was usually a crowd of people in my ante chamber  coming to negotiate little private concerns in the way of politics  but I would never suffer them to open their business by word of mouth  but adopting court precedent  or rather giving myself the airs of
