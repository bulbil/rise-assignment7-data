Wales they gained on that of Scotland  the histories of those times are filled with the petty victories and defeats on either side  in these wars  but  as they neither served to alter nor transfer power  they scarce deserve a place in the chronicles of a kingdom   While Henry was employed in those unavailing campaigns  a more dangerous strom threatened him from his own subjects  He claimed the prisoners that were taken from the Scotch by the Earl of Northumberland  for himself  while the Earl  flushed with victory  and considering himself as the supporting column of Henry s throne  resented his demand  A scheme was laid  in which the Scotch and Welch were to combine their forces  and assist Northumberland in elevating Mortimer  as the true heir to the English throne  As soon  therefore  as the confederates were prepared  the   156 Piercies of Northumberland suddenly appeared in arms in the North  but  the Earl himself falling ill  his brother and son marched with his troops to join the Welch  who were advanced as far as Shropshire  Upon the junction of these two armies  they published a manifesto  which complained of many real grievances  and aggravated others  Henry  who had received no intelligence of their designs  was extremely surprized at the news of this rebellion  but  fortunately  having an army in readiness  he marched towards Shrewsbury to meet the rebels  who were there encamped  Upon coming up to them  proposals for a mediation were offered  and such favourable terms promised  that it was thought it would end in a reconciliation  but distrust on both sides soon broke off the treaty  and the battle soon began  In this Henry obtained a complete victory  and Hotspur  the Earl of Northumberland s son  so renowned for former successes  was slain  Mean time the Earl of Northumberland  being recovered  was advancing with a body of troops to reinforce the army of the malecontents  and take upon him the command  but  hearing by the way of his son s and brother s misfortune  he dismissed his troops  not daring to keep the field with so few forces before a victorious army  The King  to terminate this troublesome affair as soon as possible  promised the Earl an absolute pardon  in case he obeyed without delay  menacing him with utter ruin  should he refuse the proffered favour  The Earl  finding himself without resource  chose rather to throw himself upon the King s mercy  than lead a precarious and indigent life in exile  he therefore repaired to York  and threw himself at the King s seet  who punctually performed his promise  Probably   157 he thought the criminal was already sufficiently punished in the death of his son and brother   The extinction of one rebellion only seemed to give rise to new  the Archbishop of York  being dissatisfied  and eager to revenge the King s death  by whom he was promoted  entered into a confederacy  with some other lords  to dethrone Henry  Northumberland  though pardoned  was again among the number  they were  however  once more prematurely discovered  and most of the conspirators died by the hands of the executioner  but Northumberland had the good fortune to escape into Scotland   While the kingdom was thus torn by faction  and threatened with foreign invasions  a still more terrible calamity threatened it from the clergy  Since Wickliffe published his opinions  about the end of the reign of Edward III  his doctrine was so spread  that the clergy were in continual apprehensions of its prevailing  Henry was now to catch at every assistance  in order to strengthen his usurped power  among others  that of the clergy was not to be despised  he therefore earnestly recommended to his parliament the care of the church s conservation  How reluctant soever the house of commons might be to prosecute a sect  whose only crime was error  the credit of the court  and the cabals of the clergy  obtained  at length  an act for the burning obstinate heretics  This statute was no sooner passed  than William Sawfre  a follower of Wickliffe  was burned alive  by virtue of the King s writ  delivered to the mayor of London  This was the first man in England who suffered death for the sake of religion  but  the fires once kindled  the clergy would not   158 suffer them soon to be extinguished  they readily perceived  that a power of burning their enemies would revive that temporal power which they possessed about three centuries before  in this they were not mistaken  they again  by this means  renewed their pristine authority  but with this difference  that as  in the times of the Saxon heptarchy  their power was founded in the love of the people  in the present case  it had its original wholly in their fears   By these means Henry survived all his troubles  and the kingdom enjoyed tranquility  He had nothing to fear from France  distracted by its own intestine divisions  the Welch sued for peace  the regent of Scotland dreaded a rupture with England  lest Henry should send home the King of Scotland  whom he had made his prisoner  and thus terminate the regent s delegated power  Add
