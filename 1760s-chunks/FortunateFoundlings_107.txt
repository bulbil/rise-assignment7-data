Mattakesa took it with a greedy pleasure  and found it contained these   lines        To  EDELLA       Madam           I left you in a place  furnished  as I thought    with every thing necessary for your satisfaction    but I find I was mistaken in your constitution    and that there was something wanting    which  rather than not possess  you must have   recourse to a prison to procure   ungrateful   as you are to the affection I have treated you   with  I am sorry for your ill conduct  and could   with you had been  at least  more private in   your amours  few men but would have sent an   order for removing you and the persons  for   whose sake you have made these false steps    into a place where you would have cause to   curse the fatal inclination that seduced you    think therefore how much you owe a prince    who  instead of punishing your faults  contents   himself with letting you know he is not ignorant   of them   If you make a right use of   the lenity I shew on this occasion  you may   perhaps retrieve some part of the influence you   once had over me  but see the Swedish prisoners   no more  if you hope or desire ever to see      MENZIKOFF           Mattakesa affected the greatest astonishment on having read this letter    and after having cursed the persons that put such vile suspicions into   the prince s head  asked her what she intended to do       What can I do  answered the sorrowful Edella  but write to my lord all   the assurances that words  can give him  which heaven knows I can truly   do  that I never wronged him even in wish or thought  and that since   there are people so cruel to misinterpret to my dishonour  what was   nothing but mere charity  to obey his commands with the utmost   punctuality  and never set my foot into that prison more       Her false friend could not but applaud her resolution  yet told her it   was pity that ill tongues should deprive those unfortunate gentlemen of   the relief she had hitherto afforded them  or herself of the pleasure   she took in their conversation       As for the first  said Edella  heaven may perhaps raise the mother   friends more capable of lifting them  and as to the other  were it   infinitely greater  it would be my inclination  as it is my duty  to   sacrifice every thing to the will of a prince whom I love  and to whom I   am so much obliged       Mattakesa having thus compared her design  so far as to be under no   apprehensions of being interrupted by her imagined rival  tho  she had   rather she had been poisoned or strangled  went directly to the prison   and told the gentlemen  it was with the utmost concern she must acquaint   them that Edella would never visit them any more  nor continue the   weekly pension she had hitherto allowed them       Those among them who understood her  and the others to whom Horatio   interpreted what she said  looked one upon another with a great deal of   consternation  as imagining one of them had done something to offend   her  and thereby the rest were thought unworthy of her   favours   Everyone endeavoured to clear himself of what he easily saw   his companions suspected him guilty of  till Mattakesa  with a scornful   smile  told them  that it was not owing to the behaviour of any of them    but to Edella s own inconstant disposition  that they owed the   withdrawing of her bounty  but to console them for the loss of it  she   promised to speak to some of her friends in their behalf  and also to   contribute something herself towards alleviating their misfortunes  but    added she  I am not the mistress of a prince and first favourite  so   have it not in my power to act as the generosity of my nature   inclines me to do       She stayed with them a considerable time  and entertained them with   little else than railing on Edella  and to make her appear as odious and   contemptible as she could to Horatio  insinuated that it was for the   sake of a young needy favourite she had been obliged to withdraw the   allowance they had from her       On taking leave she found means to slip a little billet into Horatio s   hands  unperceived by any of the company  which  as soon as he had a
