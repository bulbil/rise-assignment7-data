in  and the attempts he hesitatingly made to excuse himself  had Page  162 been listening to what passed between the Lady and me  Pity  that a well intended zeal should make a good man do mean things   No apologies  my dear Father  said I  If you doubted my honour  I can think myself  in some measure  obliged to your condescension  for taking this method to prove me  Allow me  my dear Sir  to say  It is to Father Marescotti  that the man  who  in the greater actions of his life  thinks himself under the Allseeing Eye  will not be afraid of a fellow creature s ear   I beg a thousand pardons  said he  hesitating  and in confusion  But I will confess the truth  I believed it was next to impossible  that a young man  whose Love to one of the most excellent of women is not to be questioned  should be able to keep the conditions prescribed to him  and forbear to make use of the power she acknowleges he has over her affections—But forgive me  Chevalier   Forgive yourself  my dear Father  I do most heartily forgive you   I led him down to Jeronymo s chamber  begging of him not to say a syllable more of this matter  and not to let me suffer in his esteem by this accident   I have more than once  Dr  Bartlett  experienced the irreconcileable enmity of a man whom I have forgiven for a meanness  and who was less able to forgive me my forgiveness  than I was him his fault  But Father Marescotti cannot be such a man  He is capable of generous shame  He could hardly hold up his head all the time I staid   I related to the family  in the presence of the Father  the substance of what passed between the Lady and me  They seemed surprised at her stedfastness  The Bishop told me  that he had dispatched a messenger post to the General  with a Letter  in which he had written a faithful account of their present situation  He would shew me a copy of it  if I pleased  Page  163 I was sure  I said  I could depend upon his generosity and honour  and should be glad to know the sentiments of the General and his Lady upon it  when they returned an answer   I promised to attend them in the morning  And going to my lodgings  found there  waiting for me  the Count of Belvedere  Saunders  and his gentleman  were both together below stairs  waiting for  yet dreading  as they said  my return  Saunders had told the Count  it was uncertain  But he declared that he would wait for me  were it ever so late  They both besought me to take care of my own safety  His gentleman told me  that his master had been very much disturbed in his mind ever since he was with me last  declaring often  that his life was a burden to him  He believed  he said  he had a brace of pistols with him  And then again expressed his care for my safety  as well as his Lord s  Fear not  said I  The Count is a man of honour  I would not  for the world  hurt him  And I dare say he will not hurt me   I hastened up  Why  my Lord  said I  taking his unwilling hands  each in mine  for a double reason  did you not let me know you intended me this honour  Or why did not your Lordship send for me  as soon as you came   Send for you  with a melancholy air  What from your Clementina  No —But tell me what is concluded upon  My soul is impatient to know  Answer me like a man  Answer me like a man of honour   Nothing  my Lord  is concluded upon  Nothing can be concluded upon till Lady Clementina s mind be fully known   If that be all the obstacle—  Not a slight one  I assure you  that Clementina knows her own worth  She will put a just value upon herself  In her unhappy delirium  she always preserved a high sense of that delicacy  which distinguishes the woman of true honour  It shines forth now in all her Page  164 words and actions with redoubled lustre  She will make the more difficulties  as her friends make less  Nothing can be done soon  And if it will make your Lordship easier  for I see you are disturbed  I will acquaint you when any thing is likely to be carried into effect   And is nothing yet concluded on  And will you give me such notice   I will  my Lord   Upon your honour   Upon my honour   Well then  I have some days longer to crawl upon this earth   What means my Lord   This I mean  withdrawing his hands from mine  and taking out of his pockets two pistols  I came resolved  that you should take one of these  at your choice  had the affair been concluded upon  as I dreaded it would  I am
