her peace   was the first step she ought to take  but how little is a heart    possessed of the passion her s was  capable of judging for itself  or   maintaining any resolutions in prejudice of the darling object   she had   no sooner set it down as a rule to avoid him  than she began to wish for   his presence  and contented herself with thinking she desired it only   out of curiosity to hear what he would say  and to have an opportunity    by a rallying manner of behaviour  to destroy whatever conjectures he   might have form d in favour of his passion  but all this time she   deceived herself  and in reality only longed for an interview with him    in hopes he would find means to justify himself  Horatio  who was   impatient to attempt it  seeing her at a distance walking on the terrass   with no other company than mademoiselle de Coigney  went immediately to   join them  thinking that if the presence of this lady might be a bar to   many things he wanted to say to Charlotta  it would be of service to him   another way  by preventing her from making him any reproaches       As soon as he came near  I owe you little thanks  Horatio  said   mademoiselle de Coigney laughing  for the interruption you gave me last   night  In the multiplicity of those reflections which his own affairs   had occasioned him  he had entirely forgot the lady in the window  and   imagining some other accident had happened which should make him appear   yet more guilty in the eyes of Charlotta  ask d her  with some   impatience  what she meant  don t you remember  answered she  that you   brought me a message from a certain lady  Yes  madam  said he  and in   that  thought I did no more than my duty obliged me to  as she seemed   under some perplexity  which I supposed she was impatient to   acquaint you with       You judged rightly  indeed  resumed de Coigney  but had you known how   gladly I would have dispensed with the honour of her confidence  I dare   answer you would have spared it me   I ll tell you  my dear  pursued she   turning to Charlotta  for the secrets of this lady are pretty universal    and I am certain that I have heard from no less than fifty different   persons  that very affair she was in such a hurry to inform me of last   night  you must needs have heard of the amour between madam la Boissy   and the chevalier de Mourenbeau  frequently  replied Charlotta  her   ridiculous jealousies of him have long been the jest of the whole court    and I never go to Marli or Versailles  but I am told of some new   instance of it  And yet to relate a long story of her passion  and his   ingratitude  said mademoiselle de Coigney  was I last night dragged into   a dark corner  and deprived for an hour together of all the pleasures of   the masquerade  it seems she had over heard some gallant things between   him and the daughter of the count de Granpree  and that gave her the   occasion of running into a recapitulation of all the professions of   constancy he had made to herself  the proofs she had given him of a too   easy belief  and the little regard he now paid to her peace of mind   I   was obliged to affect a pity for her misfortunes  and gratitude for the   trust she reposed in me  tho  neither the one or the other merited in   reality any thing but contempt       One often suffers a good deal from one s complaisance this way  said   Charlotta  and for my part there is nothing I would more carefully avoid   than secrets of this nature  but you have not told me how far Horatio   was accessary to bringing you into this trouble       He them said that he would save mademoiselle de Coigney the labour  and   immediately related how the lady they were speaking of threw herself   upon him  and afterwards enjoined him to deliver the message  But  added   he  I think last night was one of the most unfortunate ones I have ever   known  since  with all the care I could take  I was continually   prevented by other people s concerns from prosecuting my own   I was not   only insulted and reproached for being mistaken for some other person    for it could happen no other way  but also soon after received a letter   no less mysterious to me than the blow  which doubtless came from the   same quarter  as there is no name subscribed  or if there were  I should   look on
