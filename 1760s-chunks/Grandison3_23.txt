with the affecting subject  had recourse to my pen   Do  my Lucy  and do you  my grandmamma  my aunt  my uncle  more than give me leave  bid me  command me  if it shall be proposed  to bring down with me my Emily  And yet she shall not come  if you don t all promise to love her as well as you do  Your for ever obliged HARRIET BYRON   LETTER VIII  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Monday  Mar  20   THE active  the restless goodness  of this Sir Charles Grandison  absolutely dazles me  Lucy   The good Dr  Bartlett has obliged us all with the sight of two letters  which give an account of what he has done for Lord W  his uncle  He has been more than a father to his uncle  Does not that sound strange  But he is to be the obliger of every body   The Doctor said  that since Miss Grandison had claimed the benefit of her brother s permission for him to use his own discretion in communicating to us   56 such of the letters as he was favoured with by Sir Charles  he believed he could not more unexceptionably oblige Lord L  and the sisters  than by reading to them those two letters  as they were a kind of family subject   After the Doctor had done reading  he withdrew to his closet  I stole up after him  and obtained his leave to transmit them to you   Lucy  be chary of them  and return them when perused   There is no such thing as pointing out particular passages of generosity  justice  prudence  disinterestedness  beneficence  that strike one in those letters  without transcribing every paragraph in them  And  ah Lucy  there are other observations to be made  mortifying ones  I fear   Only let me say  That I think  if Sir Charles Grandison could and would tender himself to my acceptance  I ought to decline his hand  Do you think  if I were his  I should not live in continual dread of a separation from him  even by that inevitable stroke which  alone  could be the means of completing his existence   This is the man  ye modest  ye tender hearted fair ones  whom ye should seek to entitle to your vows  Not the lewd  the obscene libertine  soul Harpy  son of Riot  and of Erebus  glorying in his wickedness  triumphing in your weakness  and seeking by storm to win an heart that ought to shrink at his approach  Shall not Like cleave to Like  —Henceforth may it be so  wishes  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER  IX  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT   Sat  Night  Mar  18   AS soon as I had seen Mrs  Jervois to her chair  I went to attend Lord W     57 He received me with great expressions of esteem and affection   He commanded his attendants to withdraw  and told me  taking my hand  that my character rose upon him from every mouth  He was in love with me  he said  I was my mother s son   He commended me for my oeconomy  and complimented into generosity the justice I had done to some of my friends   I frankly own  said he  that at your first arrival  and even till now  that I am determined to be the man you  cousin  would wish me to be  I had thought it but prudent to hold back  For I imagined  that your father had lived at such a rate  that you would have applied to me  to extricate you from difficulties  and particularly  for money to marry your elder sister  at least  I took notice  young man  proceeded he  and I heard others observe  that you had not eyes to see any of your father s faults  either when he was living  or departed  and this gave me reason to apprehend  that you had your father s extravagant turn  And I was resolved  if I were applied to  to wrap myself close about in a general denial  Else  all I had been gathering together for so many years past  might soon have been dissipated  and I should only have taken a thorn out of the foot of another  and put it into my own   And then he threw out some disagreeable reflexions on my father s spirit   To those I answered  That every man had a right to judge for himself  in those articles for which he himself only is accountable  My father  and your Lordship  continued I  had very different ways of thinking  Magnificence was his taste  Prudence  so your Lordship must account it  is yours  There are people in the world  who would give different names to both tastes  But would not your Lordship think it very presumptuous in any man to arraign you at the   58 bar of his judgment  as mistaken in the measures of your prudence   Look you  ne hew  I don t well know what to make of your speech  but I judge
