for a   tolerable apartment at two guineas per week   and  putting on the   best cheer I could affect before my wife  I sent out for a nourishing   dinner   for I judged it late to be frugal when death was at our   door  and I had determined not to survive my Arabella a moment      The day following  I procured copies of the depositions of the         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  101     three witnesses  the first of whom was our own servant maid    These I laid before two of the most learned in the law  but   received no consolation from their report  They told me that  had   my wife been actually guilty of the robbery as alleged  she might   have had some prospect of being acquitted of the murder  by being   enabled to bribe off the evidence  But that  if she was really   innocent of the robbery  as I affirmed  it then became the very   cause as well as interest of the guilty evidence to have her con    demned on both articles of accusation      As the fearful day approached  I bought at second hand two   decent suits of mourning  with the requisite appendages for my   wife and myself  Whenever I could get apart  I was drowned in   my tears  and half sufibcated by my sobs   and I did every thing   but pray for my Arabella   for I could not think of lifting my heart   to heaven  where I had lost all dependence      In the mean time my beloved daily recovered flesh and health    Her eyes grew more brilliant  her complexion more clear  her   countenance was as the surface of a depth of peace   and I gathered    I knew not why  a kind of reflected confidence by beholding her   aspect      Early on the fatal morning  when I had left her within at her   prayers  and had pulled my hat over my eyes  and sat down in a   corner to vent the throbbings of my heart  I cast my eye on a   paper that appeared from under the door  I took it up with   precipitation  and in it found the following lines           Though mountains threat thy naked head      Though circling gulfs around thee close    Though help is distant  hope is dead      Though earth and hell are sworn thy foes      n      Yet  Heav n their malice shall defy      And  strong in last extremes  to save    Shall stand with guardian seraphs nigh      And with thy sland rers glut the grave      I had no sooner read this paper  than I dropped down involun    tarily on my knees  My hands clenched together   and I breathed   up a most ardent petition  that some over ruling power would take   my Arabella under his protection      Soon after she came forth  adorned like the moon when girt   about with clouds  through whose blackness her beauty breaks   forth with improved lustre      While we sat at breakfast I presented her with the verses  She   read them over and over with deep attention   and then returning   them with a smile This  says she  has been the stratagem of some   very charitable person  who judged that hope was wanting to   support me at such a trial      As the dreadful hour was at hand  and as I had considered before   now that at last it must come  I had prepared a small bottle of   salts and a cordial  to support myself as well as my wife from an   unseemly dejection of spirits in court      Ah  sir  can you tell me how one thing should come to pass  can         102 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      you account for this most extraordinary of all the workings in   human nature  that a man at some times should more feelingly   live  or die in others  than in himself  Had I been called to my last   audit  had the decision of my own existence been at stake  my   apprehensions  as I think  could not have equalled what I felt at   that period      At length the keeper appeared  and warned my Arabella that she   must speedily set out  I turned instantly cold and pale   and it was   long before I recovered strength to rise from my chair  In the   mean time my wife returned to our bed chamber  and  bringing   out her infant  gave him in charge to
