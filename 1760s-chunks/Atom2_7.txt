the blame of neglect from his own shoulders to those of a person who could not answer for   37 himself —In the same manner  your general A—y acquitted himself of the charge of misconduct for the attack of T—a  by accusing his engineer  who  having fallen in the battle  could not contradict his assertion  In regard to the affair with the Mantchoux  Brut an tiffi was resolved to swear truth out of Tartary by meer dint of impudence  In the very article of running away  he began to propagate the report of the great victory he had obtained  He sent the Dairo a circumstantial detail of his own prowess  and expatiated upon the cowardice of the Mantchoux  who he said had vanished from him like quick silver  at the very time when they were quietly possessed of the field of battle  and he himself was calling upon the mountains to cover him  It must have been in imitation of this great original  that the Inspector  of tympanitical   38 memory  assured the public in one of his lucubrations  that a certain tall Hibernian was afraid of looking him in the face  because the said poltroon had kicked his breech the night before in presence of five hundred people   Fortune had now abandoned the Chinese in good earnest  Two squadrons of their Fune had been successively taken  destroyed  or dispersed  by the Japonese commanders Or nbos and Fas khan  and they had lost such a number of single junks  that they were scarce able to keep the sea  On the coast of Africa they were driven from the settlement of Kho rhé  by the commander Kha fell  In the extremity of Asia  they had an army totally defeated by the Japonese captain Khutt whang  and many of their settlements were taken  In Fatsisio  they lost another battle to   39 Yan oni  and divers strong holds  In the neighbourhood of Yesso  Bronxi tic  who commanded the mercenary army of Japan on that continent  had been obliged to retreat before the Chinese from post to pillar  till at length he found it absolutely necessary to maintain his position  even at the risque of being attacked by the enemy  that outnumbered him greatly  He chose an advantageous post  where he thought himself secure  and went to sleep at his usual time of rest  The Chinese general resolving to beat up his quarters in the night  selected a body of horse for that purpose  and put them in motion accordingly  It was happy for Bron xi tic that this detachment fell upon a quarter where there happened to be a kennel of Japonese dogs  which are as famous as the bull dogs of England  These animals  ever on the watch  not only   40 gave the alarm  but at the same time fell upon the Chinese horses with such impetuosity  that the enemy were disordered  and had actually fled before Bron xi tic could bring up his troops to action  All that he saw of the battle  when he came up  was a small number of killed and wounded  and the cavalry of the enemy scampering off in confusion  tho  at a great distance from the field  No matter —he found means to paint this famous battle of Myn than in such colours as dazzled the weak eye sight of the Japonese monster  which bellowed hoarse applause through all its throats  and in its hymns of triumph equalled Bron xi tic even to the unconquerable Brut an tiffi  which last  about this time  received at his own door another beating from the Mantchoux  so severe that he lay for some time without exhibiting any signs of   41 life  and  indeed  owed his safety to a very extraordinary circumstance  An Ostrog chief called Llha dahn  who had reinforced the Mantchoux with a very considerable body of horse before the battle  insisted upon carrying off the carcase of Brut an tiffi  that it might be hung up on a gibbet in terrorem  before the pavilion of the great Khan  The general of the Mantchoux  on the other hand  declared he would have it flayed upon the spot  and the skin sent as a trophy to his sovereign  This dispute produced a great deal of abuse betwixt those barbarians  and it was with great difficulty some of their inferior chiefs  who were wiser than themselves  prevented them from going by the ears together  In a word  the confusion and anarchy that ensued  afforded an opportunity to one of Brut an tiffi s partisans to steal away the   42 body of his master  whom the noise of the contest had just roused from his swoon  Llha dahn perceiving he was gone  rode off in disgust with all his cavalry  and the Mantchoux  instead of following the blow  made a retrograde motion towards their own country  which allowed Brut an tiffi time to breathe  Three successive disasters of this kind would have been sufficient to lower the military character of any warrior  in the opinion of any public that judged from their own senses and reflexion  but  by this time  the Japonese had quietly resigned all their natural perceptions  and paid the most implicit faith to every article broached by their apostle Taycho  The more it seemed to contradict common reason and common evidence  the more greedily was it swallowed as a
