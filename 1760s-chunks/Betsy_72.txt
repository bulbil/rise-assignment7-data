to Miss Betsy  under the   pretence of coming to enquire if her health had not suffered by being   abroad in the night air  and how she had rested  She received him with a   great deal of sprightliness  and replied  she found herself so well   after it  as to be ready for such another jaunt whenever he had a fancy   for it   I take you at your word  Madam   cried he  transported to hear   she anticipated what he came on purpose to intreat   I am ready this   moment  if you please   continued he   and we will either take a barge    and go up the river  or a coach to Hampstead  just to diversify the   scene  you have only to say which you chuse        She then told him there was a necessity of deferring their ramble till   the afternoon  because Miss Flora was abroad  and would not return till   dinner time   As to what route we shall take  and every thing belonging   to it   said she   I leave it entirely to you  I know nobody who has a   more elegant taste  or a better judgment     I have taken care   replied   he   to give the world a high opinion of me in both  by making my   addresses to the amiable Miss Betsy  but  Madam   pursued he   since we   are alone  will you give me leave to tell you how I have employed my   hours this morning     Why  in dressing  breakfasting  and  perhaps  a   little reading   answered she   A small time  Madam  suffices for the   two former articles with me   resumed he   but I have  indeed  been   reading  happening to dip into the works of a poet  who wrote near a   century ago  I found some words so adapted to the situation of my heart    and so agreeable to the sense of the answer I was about to make   yesterday to what you said  concerning the persistence of a lover  that   I could not forbear putting some notes to them  which I beg you will   give me your opinion of        In speaking these words  he took a piece of paper out of his pocket  and   sung the following stanza           I            The patriarch  to gain a wife         Chaste  beautiful  and young        Serv d fourteen years  a painful life          And never thought it long           II           Oh  were you to reward such cares        And life so long would stay        Not fourteen  but four hundred years        Would seem but as one day        Mr  Trueworth had a fine voice  and great skill in musick  having   perfected himself in that science from the best masters when he was in   Italy  Miss Betsy was so charmed both with the words and the notes  that   she made him sing them several times over  and afterwards set them down   in her musick book  to the end that she might get them by heart  and   join her voice in concert with her spinnet       Mr  Trueworth would not make his morning visit too long  believing it   might be her time to dress against dinner  as she was now in such a   dishabille as ladies usually put on at their first rising  so  after   having received a second promise from her of giving him her company that   day abroad  took his leave  highly satisfied with the progress he   imagined he had made in her good graces       The wind happening to grow a little boisterous  though the weather   otherwise was fair and clear  made Mr  Trueworth think a land journey   would be more agreeable to the ladies  than to venture themselves upon   the water  he therefore procured a handsome livery coach  and  attended   by his two servants  went to Mr  Goodman s  The ladies were already in   expectation of him  and did not make him wait a moment       Nothing extraordinary happening at this entertainment  nor at those   others  which  for several succeeding days  without intermission  Mr    Trueworth prevailed on his mistress to accept  it would be superfluous   to trouble the reader with the particulars of them       Mr  Staple
