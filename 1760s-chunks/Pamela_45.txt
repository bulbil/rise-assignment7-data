that I have been   practising  will make me but ill company for my milk maid companions   that are to be  To be sure I had better  as things stand  have learned   to wash and scour  and brew and bake  and such like  Put I hope  if I   can t get work  and can meet with a place  to learn these soon  if   any body will have the goodness to bear with me till I am able  For    notwithstanding what my master says  I hope I have an humble and   teachable mind  and  next to God s grace  that s all my comfort  for I   shall think nothing too mean that is honest  It may be a little hard at   first  but woe to my proud heart  if I find it so on trial  for I will   make it bend to its condition  or break it       I have read of a good bishop that was to be burnt for his religion  and   he tried how he could bear it  by putting his fingers into the lighted   candle  So I  t other day  tried  when Rachel s back was turned  if   I could not scour a pewter plate she had begun  I see I could do t by   degrees  It only blistered my hand in two places       All the matter is  if I could get plain work enough  I need not spoil   my fingers  But if I can t  I hope to make my hands as red as a   blood pudding  and as hard as a beechen trencher  to accommodate them to   my condition   But I must break off  here s somebody coming        Tis only our Hannah with a message from Mrs  Jervis   But  hold  here s   somebody else  Well  it is only Rachel       I am as much frighted  as were the city mouse and the country mouse  in   the same book of fables  at every thing that stirs  O  I have a power of   these things to entertain you with in winter evenings  when I come home    If I can but get work  with a little time for reading  I hope we shall   be very happy over our peat fires       What made me hint to you  that I should bring but little with me  is   this       You must know  I did intend to do  as I have this afternoon  and that   is  I took all my clothes  and all my linen  and I divided them into   three parcels  as I had before told Mrs  Jervis I intended to do  and   I said  It is now Monday  Mrs  Jervis  and I am to go away on Thursday   morning betimes  so  though I know you don t doubt my honesty  I beg you   will look over my poor matters  and let every one have what belongs to   them  for  said I  you know I am resolved to take with me only what I   can properly call my own       Said she   I did not know her drift then  to be sure she meant well    but I did not thank her for it  when I did know it   Let your things be   brought down in the green room  and I will do any thing you will have me   do       With all my heart  said I  green room or any where  but I think you   might step up  and see  em as they lie       However  I fetched  em down  and laid them in three parcels  as before    and  when I had done  I went down to call her up to look at them       Now  it seems  she had prepared my master for this scene  unknown to   me  and in this green room was a closet  with a sash door  and a curtain   before it  for there she puts her sweet meats and such things  and   she did it  it seems  to turn his heart  as knowing what I intended  I   suppose that he should make me take the things  for  if he had  I should   have made money of them  to help us when we got together  for  to be   sure  I could never have appeared in them       Well  as I was saying  he had got  unknown to me  into this closet  I   suppose while I went to call Mrs  Jervis  and she since owned to me  it   was at his desire  when she told him
