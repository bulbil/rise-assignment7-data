which bespoke respect and  love  His tears flowed instantly at the mention of my misfortunes  his  eyes were lighted up with indignation  at the very name of my enemy  If  we spoke of his cruelty  he trembled  if of his cowardice  he smiled  with contempt  or frowned with stern abhorrence  In a word  the ardor of  his affection seemed not so much the effect of humanity  as of a long   an intimate and tender friendship  Les Roches admired the virtues of  this D Aumont  nor could my heart refuse it s full return of affection  and gratitude to such exalted goodness  D Aumont became our friend and  counsellor  he shared our thoughts and directed our actions      We  were now happily •••ived at Rochelle  where I  embraced my countrymen  whose suspense and apprehensions were at length  dispelled  Filled with joy and gay expectations  we all advanced forward  towards the domain of our kind protector  confident of comfort and  security under his hospitable roof  His followers  no longer deeming  their services necessary to their Lord  and impatient to revisit their  several habitations  separated in their march  and left us  not wholly  unattended  but at the head of an inconsiderable body  when we at length  arrived at the castle of Les Roches  Here we had been taught to expect  the cheerful welcome of affection  and here we now looked for joy and  congratulation  the kind greetings of friends  and the officious cares  of domestics  But alas  we had entered the mansion of sorrow  On every  face sat silent grief and consternation  and chilled our souls with  terrible apprehensions  My friend cast his eyes round with the most  earnest anxiety  sometimes they turned on me  now on his attendants  At  length he rushed precipitately from us  and traversed the apartments  as  if in search of something particularly dear to him  I looked upon  D Aumont  who seemed equally astonished and equally uninformed of the  cause of this strange disorder  Some few broken exclamations of surprize  and sollicitude were all that my tongue could utter  Tortured with  expectation  and impatience to know the worst that fortune threatened   I eagerly waited the return of my friend  certain to receive the news of  some calamity  but utterly incapable of forming the least conjecture of  its nature  circumstances or extent  Les Roches prolonged his absence to  a tedious and afflicting length  At last a domestic appeared  and called  for D Aumont  who as he departed  turned upon me with a look of  surprize and concern  then vanished  and lest me to all the torture of  uncertainty  A thousand extravagant conjectures did my fancy form  and  reject by turns  My countrymen  equally perplexed and agitated  gazed  on me and each other in silent astonishment   Good  heaven  what new wonders  for what are we reserved   Thus did I exclaim   and in that moment some attendants entered  and with courteous and  gentle demeanour inviting us to follow  conducted us to several chambers  where refreshment was provided with all hospitable care  yet in all the  silence and solemnity of sorrow  Thrice did I essay to speak my wonder   and as often did fear suppress my voice  Still my friend delayed his  appearance  but after a tedious and distracting interval  D Aumont at  length stood before me  with an aspect which redoubled all that horror  which my soul had for some time felt  I eagerly enquired about Les  Roches  Alas  said he  I know not what sudden gloom hath possessed this  Baron  He hath long since departed with a few attendants  on me devolves  the command of this castle  I am now his officer  and must implicitly  obey his orders  and his orders are that the Lord of Salisbury should be  entertained with all due honours  a prisoner indeed  but a noble  prisoner  the rigours of his consinement must be duly allayed  by  respect and careful attention   I started and exclaimed— Prisoner   Confinement  Explain this wonder    Such  said he  are the commands of  Les Roches  This chamber must content thee  The guards who are to  confine thee within these bounds are enjoyned the strictest vigilance   yet with due deference and care to do thee service   Do I dream  cried  I  is this real  is this my hospitable reception   Then pressing the  hand of D Aumont  whose dejected looks seemed to promise sympathy  and  tender pity  I eagerly urged him to give me the whole story of this  surprizing change  Again indulging my distractions   Is Les Roches false  to me  said I  O no  it cannot be  the good  the tender  the  affectionate Les Roches  my friend  my preserver  Do not wrong his  virtues  It cannot be  Where is he  why delays he  O wretch  why dost  thou torment my soul with idle terrors     The Frenchman
