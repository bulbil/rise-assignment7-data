his book  And  it seems  it was so   contrived  for Mr  Peters had been  as I since find  desired to tell him   to be in that walk at such an hour in the morning       So  old acquaintance  said my master  again have I met you in this   place  What book are you now reading  He said  it was Boileau s Lutrin    Said my master  You see I have brought with me my little fugitive    that would have been  While you are perfecting yourself in French  I am   trying to learn English  and hope soon to be master of it       Mine  sir  said he  is a very beautiful piece of French  but your   English has no equal       You are very polite  Mr  Williams  said my master  And he that does not   think as you do  deserves no share in her  Why  Pamela  added he  very   generously  why so strange  where you have once been so familiar  I   do assure you both  that I mean not  by this interview  to insult Mr    Williams  or confound you  Then I said  Mr  Williams  I am very glad   to see you well  and though the generous favour of my good master has   happily changed the scene  since you and I last saw one another  I am   nevertheless very glad of an opportunity to acknowledge  with gratitude    your good intentions  not so much to serve me  as me  but as a   person  that then had great reason to believe herself in distress  And   I hope  sir  added I  to my master  your goodness will permit me to say   this       You  Pamela  said he  may make what acknowledgments you please to Mr    Williams s good intentions  and I would have you speak as you think    but I do not apprehend myself to be quite so much obliged to those   intentions       Sir  said Mr  Williams  I beg leave to say  I knew well  that  by   education  you was no libertine  nor had I reason to think you so by   inclination  and  when you came to reflect  I hoped you would not be   displeased with me  And this was no small motive to me  at first  to do   as I did       Ay  but Mr  Williams  said my master  could you think I should have had   reason to thank you  if  loving one person above all her sex  you had   robbed me of her  and married her yourself   And then  said he  you are   to consider  that she was an old acquaintance of mine  and a quite   new one to you  that I had sent her down to my own house  for better   securing her  and that you  who had access to my house  could not effect   your purpose  without being guilty  in some sort  of a breach of the   laws of hospitality and friendship  As to my designs upon her  I own   they had not the best appearance  but still I was not answerable to Mr    Williams for those  much less could you be excused to invade a property   so very dear to me  and to endeavour to gain an interest in her   affections  when you could not be certain that matters would not turn   out as they have actually done       I own  said he  that some parts of my conduct seem exceptionable  as   you state it  But  sir  I am but a young man  I meant no harm  I had no   interest  I am sure  to incur your displeasure  and when you think of   every thing  and the inimitable graces of person  and perfections of   mind  that adorn this excellent lady   so he called me   you will    perhaps  find your generosity allow something as an extenuation of a   fault  which your anger would not permit as an excuse       I have done  said my master  nor did I meet you here to be angry with   you  Pamela knew not that she should see you  and now you are both   present  I would ask you  Mr  Williams  If  now you know my honourable   designs towards this good girl  you can really be almost  I will not say   quite  as well pleased with the friendship of my wife  as you could be   with the favour of Mrs  Andrews       Sir  said he  I will answer you truly
