 that Sense  Philosophy  and Virtue will make any Reading an higher Entertainment to you  and Page  272 that you are capable of receiving Pleasure or Amusement from many Writings  which are capable of instructing half the World  This was what I meant to hint to you  by any of my Letters on this Subject  that the utile was not inconsistent with the dulce  as I was too anxious for even your Amusements  to leave them to Chance or Carelessness for the Hap  I recommended some Papers to you lately  which  I flattered myself  would have highly amused you  as I am sure the Comments  I expected from you  upon them  would have greatly entertained me  But I will not presume to set you Tasks — Your own good Sense be your Guide   I am sincerely concerned to find you still in that plaintive Mood of   Misfortunes  Anxiety of Mind   c    I hope  and believe  that you are not in any Circumstance of Life  which can provoke such melancholy Reflections  In short  I have observed  that there is a great deal of Sense and Virtue  with some Smattering of Philosophy  in the World  but that great  noble  and comprehensive Quality  called Fortitude  seems to have quite forsaken Mankind  and Scarron might well say  if  in Truth  he could even say so much   None  but myself  could e er that Pitch attain   To sport with Misery  and jest in Pain     Page  273May Heaven  most earnestly solicited by my Prayers  defend my dearest  amiable Love from both  and from every Evil  natural and moral  except the Penalties  which she deserves herself  and then surely her Happiness here will be an Earnest of that Bliss  which perfect Spirits enjoy hereafter  Amen to that sweet Prayer   Sir Francis Bacon has a fine Passage  which may be quoted here  as a noble Definition of that Constancy  and Fortitude of Mind  which I am lamenting    prepared for every Event  armed in all Fortunes  foreseeing without Fear  enjoying without Satiety  and suffering without Impatience   This great Character is in the Power of so small a Portion of Sense and Virtue to attain to  that  for my Part  I am resolved to commence Hero from the Date of this Letter  Adieu     Henry   LETTER CCXCII   My Dearest FANNY   TUESDAY s Post did not bring me any Letter from you  In your present Situation  you may judge how uneasy I must be  upon such an Occasion  Accordingly I sat down to scold  or complain  which are synonymous Terms — Page  274 But stay  says I  Before my Letter need go  another Post may come in  and many Accidents may have prevented her writing  or made the Letter miscarry  without her Illness or Neglect  Thus  my Pet  do I always deal with you  and would sooner suspect Improbabilities  or even my own Senses  than your Truth  and should  in like Circumstances  behave  with regard to you  like that noble Venetian  who  seeing a Looking glass make some Reflections on his Wife  broke it with his Cane  crying out   Thou lyest    Farewell  my dearest Life  I am not less your s than ever  and need no more to assure you  I am totally  and for ever  your s   Henry   LETTER CCXCIII   I HAD the provoking Pleasure of receiving two Letters from my dear Harry  by Yesterday s Post  Tho  they were of different Dates  the Post Mark was the same on both  so that these teizing Delays must be owing to the Person  you send with your Letters   We do indeed too often misapprehend each other  I make no Doubt but the Fault lies chiefly on my Side  for I am conscious I have too much Quickness in my Disposition  which  Page  275 joined to the earnest Desire I have to render myself agreeable to you  puts me on endeavouring to justify or explain away my Faults  perhaps  with too much Warmth  It is long since I have agreed with my dear Preceptor  in owning that Trifles will not  even for the present Moment  amuse a rational Mind  There is a Kind of Self contempt inseparable from the mis spending our Time  in Pursuit of any Thing  which does not tend to make us wiser or better  and  of course  happier  But this Feeling is  I believe  only known to intelligent Minds  tho  I have heard People complain of throwing away their Time on a Book  that did not please them  who were utterly incapable of making any Reflection  or forming any Sentiment from Milton  Shakespeare  or Addison   It is  indeed  as my sweet Love observes  not in the Power of Trifles to relieve or calm the Sorrows of the Mind  or divert the Thoughts from bodily Pain  It is only in the Power of Religion  Philosophy  and Sense  to aid us in surmounting present Ills  by teaching us to look forward to an happy Futurity
