making him happy—But do you say  that I ought to give the example —Impossible  Honour  and the punctilio of woman  will not permit me to do that —       But thus pressed  thus dreading again to see a kneeling Father  a weeping Mother  and having reason to think I may not live long  that a relapse into my former malady  with the apprehensions of which Father Marescotti terrifies me  may be the punishment of my disobedience  Cruel Father Marescotti  to terrify me with an affliction I so much dread    and that it will be a consolation to me  in my departing hour  to reflect that I have obeyed my parents  in an article on which their hearts are immoveably fixed  and still further being assured  that they will look upon my resignation as a compensation for all the troubles I have given them  for many   90 many months passed—God enable me  I pray  to resign to their will  But if I cannot  shall I be still entreated  still persuaded —I hope not —I will do my endeavour to prevail on myself to obey—But whatever be the event of my Self contendings  Grandison must give the example      How did we congratulate ourselves  when we read this paper  faint as are the hopes it gives us   Our whole endeavour is now  to treat her with tender observance  that she may not think of receding  Nor will we ask her to see the person she knows we favour  till we can assure her  that you will set her the example  And if there be a Lady with whom you think you could be happy  may not this  my dear Grandison  pleaded by you  be a motive with her   The Count of Belvedere has made overtures to us  which are too great for our acceptance  were this alliance to take place  We have been told  but not by himself  the danger to which his dispair had subjected him  in more than one visit to you at Bologna  had you not borne with his rashness  You know him to be a man of probity  of piety  He is a zealous Catholic  and you must allow  that a religious zeal is a strengthener  a confirmer  of all the social sanctions  He is learned  and  being a domestic man  he  contrary to the Italian custom  admires in a wife those intellectual improvements which make a woman a fit companion for her husband  You know how much the Marchioness excells almost all the women of quality in Italy  in a taste for polite literature  You know she has encouraged the same taste in her daughter  and the Count considers her as the only woman in Italy with whom he can be happy   As you  my Grandison  cannot now be my brother by marriage  the Count of Belvedere is the only man in the world I can wish to be so  He is of Italy  My sister  always so dear to us  and he  will be ever   91 with us  or we with them  He knows the unhappy way she has been in  and was so far from making that an objection  that when her malady was at the height  being ecouraged by physicians to hope that her recovery would be the probable consequence  he would have thought himself the happiest of men  could he have been honoured with her hand  He knows her Love of you  He adores her for her motive of refusing you  He loves you  and is confident of the inviolable honour of both  Whose alliance  on all these considerations  can be so desirable to us as that with the Count of Belvedere   Surely  my dear friend  it must be in your power to set the example  In yours  who could subdue a whole family of zealous Catholics  and keep your own religion  and who could engage the virgin heart of one of the most delicate women in the world  What woman  who has a heart to bestow  what family  that has a daughter or sister to give  can withstand you  Religion and Country of both the same   Give us hope  therefore  my dear Grandison  that you will make the effort  Assure us  that you will not scruple  if you can succeed  to set the example  and on this assurance we will claim from Clementina the effects of the hope she has given us  And if we can prevail  will in England return you thanks for the numberless favours you have conferred upon us   Thus earnestly  as well from inclination  as in compliance with the pressing entreaties of every one of a family which I hope are still  and ever  will be  dear to you  do I  your Jeronymo  your Brother  your Friend  solicit you  Mrs  Beaumont joins with us  She scruples not  she bids me tell you  to pronounce  that you and Clementina will both be more happy  she  with the Count of Belvidere  your respective Countries so distant  your Religion so different   you  with an Englishwoman  than you could have been with each other  Mrs  Beaumont
