which was drawn payable  upon demand  The debtor  who had gone to bed half distracted with his  misfortune  finding himself waked with such a disagreeable dun  lost  all patience  cursed Pickle  threatened his messenger  blasphemed with  horrible execrations  and made such a noise as reached the ears of his  father  who  ordering his son to be called into his presence  examined  him about the cause of that uproar  which had disturbed the whole  family  The young gentleman  after having essayed to amuse him with  sundry equivocations  which served only to increase his suspicion and  desire of knowing the truth  acknowledged that he had lost some money  overnight at cards  to a gamester who had been so impertinent as to send  a message  demanding it that morning  though he had told the fellow that  it would not suit him to pay him immediately  The father  who was a  man of honour  reproached him with great severity for his profligate  behaviour in general  and this scandalous debt in particular  which he    6 22 15  3 45 PM   believed to be some trifle  then giving him a bank note for five hundred  pounds  commanded him to go and discharge it without loss of time  This  well principled heir took the money  but  instead of waiting upon  his creditor  he forthwith repaired to the gaming house  in hopes of  retrieving his loss  and  before he rose from the table  saw his note  mortgaged for seven eighths of its value   Meanwhile  Pickle  incensed at the treatment which his servant had  received  and informed of his lordship s second loss  which aggravated  his resentment  determined to preserve no medium  and  taking out a  writ the same day  put it immediately in execution upon the body of  his debtor  just as he stepped into his chair at the door of White s  chocolate house  The prisoner  being naturally fierce and haughty   attempted to draw upon the bailiffs  who disarmed him in a twinkling   and this effort served only to heighten his disgrace  which was  witnessed by a thousand people  most of whom laughed very heartily at  the adventure of a lord s being arrested   Such a public transaction could not long escape the knowledge of his  father  who that very day had the satisfaction to hear that his son was  in a spunging house  In consequence of this information  he sent  his steward to learn the particulars of the arrest  and was equally  offended  surprised  and concerned  when he understood the nature of the  debt  which he imagined his son had already discharged  Unwilling to  pay such a considerable sum for a spendthrift  whom he had but too much  indulged  and who in less than one week might involve himself in such  another difficulty  the old gentleman wrote a letter to Peregrine   representing what a hardship it would be upon him to forfeit such sums  by the indiscretion of a son  whose engagements he was not bound to  fulfil  and desiring some mitigation in his demand  as it was not a debt  contracted for value received  but incurred without subjecting him to  the least damage or inconvenience   Our adventurer no sooner received this letter  than he went in person  to wait upon the author  to whom he  in a candid manner  related the  particular circumstances of the match  together with the ingratitude and  audacity of his son  which he owned had stimulated him to such measures  as he otherwise would have scorned to take  The nobleman acknowledged  that the revenge was hardly adequate to the provocation  and condemned  the conduct of his son with such justice and integrity  as disarmed  Peregrine of his resentment  and disposed him to give an undoubted  proof of his own disinterestedness  which he immediately exhibited  by  producing the note  and tearing it to pieces  after having assured his  lordship that the writ should be withdrawn  and the prisoner discharged  before night   The earl  who perfectly well understood the value of money  and was no  stranger to the characters of mankind  stood amazed at the sacrifice   which Pickle protested was offered by his esteem for his lordship  and   after having complimented him upon his generosity  in a very uncommon  strain of encomium  begged the favour of his acquaintance  and insisted  upon his dining with him next day  The youth  proud of having met  with such an opportunity to distinguish himself  in less than an hour  performed every article of his promise  and in the morning was visited  by the debtor  who came  by the express order of his father  to thank  him for the obligation under which he was laid  and to ask pardon for  the offence he had given     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This condescension was very glorious for our hero  who graciously  received his submission  and accompanied him to dinner  where he was  caressed by the old earl with marks of particular
