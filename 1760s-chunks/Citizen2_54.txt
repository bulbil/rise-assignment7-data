There are some here  who  I am told  make a tolerable subsistence by the credulity of their countrymen  as they find the public fond of blood  wounds and death  they contrive political ruins suited to every month in the year  this month the people are to be eaten up by the French in flat bottomed boats  the next by the soldiers  designed to beat the French back  now the people are going to jump down the gulph of luxury  and now nothing but an herring subscription can fish them up again  Time passes on  the report proves false  new circumstances produce new changes  but the people never change  they are persevering in folly   In other countries those boding politicians would be left to fret over their own schemes alone  and grow splenetic without hopes of infecting others  But England seems to be the very region where spleen delights to dwell  a man not only can give an unbounded scope to the disorder in himself  but may  if he pleases  propagate it over the whole kingdom  with a certainty of success  He has only to cry out  that the government  the government is all wrong  that their schemes are leading to ruin  that Britons are no more  every good member of the commonwealth thinks it his duty  in such a case  to deplore the universal decadence   167 with sympathetic sorrow  and  by fancying the constitution in a decay  absolutely to impair its vigour   This people would laugh at my simplicity  should I advise them to be less sanguine in harbouring gloomy predictions  and examine cooly before they attempted to complain I have just heard a story  which  though transacted in a private family  serves very well to describe the behaviour of the whole nation  in cases of threatened calamity  As there are public  so there are private incendiaries here  One of the last  either for the amusement of his friends  or to divert a fit of the spleen  lately sent a threatening letter to a worthy family in my neighbourhood  to this effect    SIR  Knowing you to be very rich  and finding myself to be very poor  I think proper to inform you  that I have learned the secret of poisoning man  woman  and child  without danger of detection  Don t be uneasy  Sir  you may take your choice of being poisoned in a fortnight  or poisoned in a month  or poisoned in six weeks  you shall have full time to settle all your affairs  Though I m poor  I love to do things like a gentleman  But  Sir  you must die  I have determined it within my own breast that you must die  Blood  Sir  blood is my trade  so I could wish you would this day six weeks take leave of your friends  wife  and family  for I cannot possibly allow you longer time  To convince you more certainly of the power of my art  by which you may know I speak truth  take this letter  when you have read it  tear off the seal  fold it up  and give it to your favourite Dutch mastiff that sits by the fire  he will   168 swallow it  Sir  like a butter d toast  in three hours four minutes after he has taken it  he will attempt to bite off his own tongue  and half an hour after burst asunder in twenty pieces  Blood  blood  blood  so no more at present from  Sir  your most obedient  most devoted humble servant to command till death   You may easily imagine the consternation into which this letter threw the whole good natured family  The poor man  to whom it was addressed  was the more surprised  as not knowing how he could merit such inveterate malice  All the friends of the family were convened  it was universally agreed  that it was a most terrible affair  and that the government should be solicited to offer a reward and a pardon  a fellow of this kind would go on poisoning family after family  and it was impossible to say where the destruction would end  In pursuance of these determinations the government was applied to  strict search was made after the incendiary  but all in vain  At last  therefore  they recollected that the experiment was not yet tried upon the dog  the Dutch mastiff was brought up  and placed in the midst of the friends and relations  the seal was torn off  the pacquet folded up with care  and soon they found to the great surprize of all— that the dog would not eat the letter   Adieu     169  LETTER CV  To the same   I HAVE frequently been amazed at the ignorance of almost all the European travellers  who have penetrated any considerable way eastward into Asia  They have been influenced either by motives of commerce or piety  and their accounts are such as might reasonably be expected from men of very narrow or very prejudiced education  the dictates of superstition or the result of ignorance  Is it not surprizing  that in such a variety of adventurers not one single philosopher should be found  for as to the travels of Gemelli  the learned are long agreed that
