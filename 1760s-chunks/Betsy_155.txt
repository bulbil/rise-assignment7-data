 my dear sister  your very        affectionate brother  and humble servant            F  THOUGHTLESS            P S  Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty are both from home at this time  or        I am certain their good wishes  if no more  would have joined mine         that you may never cease to enjoy whatever it becomes you to        desire  My dear Betsy  adieu        The joy which this letter would have afforded Miss Betsy had been   compleat  if not somewhat abated by the apprehensions of what her   brother would have to say to her when he should find she was indeed   entirely broke off with Mr  Trueworth  but as the reader may probably   desire to know in what manner he passed his time after that event  and   the motives which induced him to stay in London  it is now highly proper   to say something of both                CHAPTER XXI       The author is under some apprehensions  will not be quite pleasing to   the humour of every reader          It is certain that Mr  Trueworth  at the time of his writing his last   letter to Miss Betsy  was fully determined to go into the country  and   was already beginning to make such preparations as he found necessary   for his journey  when an accident of a very singular nature put a sudden   stop to them  and to his intentions       He was one day just dressed  and going out  in order to dine with some   company   for he now chose to be as little alone as possible  when one   of his servants delivered a letter to him  which he said was brought by   a porter  who waited below for an answer  As the superscription was in a   woman s hand  and he was not accustomed to receive any billets from that   sex  he broke it open with a kind of greedy curiosity  and found in it   these lines             To Charles Trueworth  Esq            Sir            I am a woman of fortune  family  and an unblemished character  very        young  and  most people allow  not disagreeable  you have done me        the greatest injury in the world without knowing it  but I take you        to be more a man of honour than not to be willing to make what        reparation is in your power  If the good opinion I have of you does        not deceive me  you will readily accept this challenge  and not        fail to meet me about eleven o clock in the morning  at General        Tatten s bench  opposite Rosamond s Pond in St  James s Park  there        to hear such interrogatories as I shall think fit to make you  and        on your sincere answer to which depends the whole future peace  if        not the life of her  who at present can only subscribe herself  in        the greatest confusion  Sir  your unfortunate and impatient            INCOGNITA        Mr  Trueworth was a good deal surprized  but had no occasion to consult   long with himself in what manner it would become a man of his years to   behave in such an adventure  and therefore sat down and immediately   wrote an answer in these terms             To the fair Incognita            Madam            Though a challenge from an unknown antagonist might be rejected        without any danger of incurring the imputation of cowardice  and         besides  as the combat to which I am invited is to be that of        words  in which your sex are generally allowed to excel  I have not        any sort of chance of overcoming  yet  to shew that I dare        encounter a fine woman at any weapon  and shall not repine at being        foiled  will not fail to give you the triumph you desire  and
