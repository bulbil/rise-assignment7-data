you think you should have but the shadow of a hope  to induce your compliance  that my Lord s death would be more agreeable to you than his life  then would I not  for your morality s sake  wish you to engage  In a word  I address myself to you  Miss Mansfield  as to a woman of honour and conscience  If your conscience bids you doubt  reject the proposal  and this not only for my Lord s sake  but for your own   Consider  if  without too great a force upon your inclinations  you can behave with that condescension and indulgence to a man who has hastened advanc d age upon himself  which I have thought from your temper I might hope   I have said a great deal  because you  ladies  were silent  and because explicitness in every case becomes the proposer  Give me leave to withdraw for a few moments   I withdrew  accordingly  to the brothers and sister  I did not think I ought to mention to them the proposal I had made  It might perhaps have engaged them all in its favour  as it was of such evident advantage to the whole family  and that might have imposed a difficulty on the Lady  that neither for her own sake  nor my Lord s  it would have been just to lay upon her   Lady Mansfield came out to me  and said  I presume  Sir  as we are a family which misfortune  as well as love  has closely bound together  you will allow it to be mentioned—  To the whole family  madam —By all means    17 I wanted only first to know  whether Miss Mansfield s affections were disengaged  And now you shall give me leave to attend Miss Mansfield  I am a party for my Lord W   Miss Mansfield is a party  Your debates will be the more free in our absence  If I find her averse  believe me  madam  I will not endeavour to persuade her  On the contrary  if she declare against accepting the proposal  I will be her advocate  tho  every one else would vote in its favour   The brothers and sister looked upon one another  I left the mother to propose it to them  and stept into the inner parlour to Miss Mansfield   She was sitting with her back to the door  in a meditating posture  She started at my entrance   I talked of indifferent subjects  in order to divert her from the important one  that had taken up her whole attention   It would have been a degree of oppression to her to have entered with her upon a subject of so much consequence to her while we were alone  and when her not having given a negative  was to be taken as a modest affirmative   Lady Mansfield soon joined us—My dear daughter  said she  we are all unanimous  We have agreed to leave every thing to Sir Charles Grandison  And we hope you will   She was silent  I will only ask you  madam  said I  to her  If you have any wish to take time to consider of the matter  Do you think you sh ll be easier in your mind  if you take time —She was silent   I will not at this time  my good Miss Mansfield  urge you farther  I will make my report to Lord W  and you shall be sure of his joyful approbation of the steps I have taken  before your final consent shall be asked for  But that I may not be employed in a doubtful cause  let me be commissioned to tell my Lord  that you are disengaged  and that you wholly resign yourself to your mother s advice     18 She bowed her head   And that you  madam  to Lady Mansfield  are not averse to enter into treaty upon this important subject   Averse  Sir  said the mother  bowing  and gratefully smiling   I will write the particulars of our conversation to Lord W  and my opinion of settlements  and advise him  if I am not forbid  to make a visit at Mansfieldhouse  I stopt  they were both silent   If possible  I will attend my Lord in his first visit  I hope  madam  to Miss Mansfield  you will not dislike him  I am sure he will be charmed with you  He is far from being disagreeable in his person  His temper is not bad  Your goodness will make him good  I dare say that he will engage your gratitude  and I defy a good mind to separate love from gratitude   We returned to company  I had all their blessings pronounced at once  as from one mouth  The melancholy brother was enlivened  Who knows but the consequence of this alliance may illuminate his mind  I could see by the pleasure they all had  in beholding him capable of joy on the occasion  that they hoped it would  The unhappy situation of the family affairs  as it broke the heart of the eldest brother  fixed a gloom on the temper of this gentleman   I was prevailed upon to dine with them  In the conversation we
