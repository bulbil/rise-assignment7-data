or like  Pygmalion  become enamoured of a Statue of her own inlivening   Perhaps  you are very little concerned about all this Danger  and  lest you should lead the Way in the high Road of Inconstancy  I think it would be prudent to take Prior s Advice      85Change thou the first  nor wait thy Lover s Flight     Besides  it is a good Maxim  that they  who are first cured  are best cured  which  I hope  is pretty much my Case  Thanks to some Part of of your late Behaviour  which has been the most efficacious Medicine  and  perhaps  the only one  which could possibly advance my Recovery — so far I am your much obliged Debtor   I wrote to you last Tuesday  but was then so much in the Elegiack Strain  that  I fear  it was a dismal penned Piece  I am not much in a gayer Mood  at present  than at that Time  but why should I complain  where I can hope for no Redress  but merely to have my Griefs insulted by Philosophick Lectures   Indifference  clad in Wisdom s Guise   All Fortitude of Mind supplies   It is easy for us to bear what we do not feel  and they are best capable to give Advice  who are not concerned  However  I cannot help acknowledging the Generosity of your Behaviour upon such Occasions  for surely it is kind to take even so much Trouble in Matters  where you seem to have no Sort of Interest   Adieu   my dear Stoick   Your s  Fanny     86  LETTER LI   I AM extremely sorry for the Disorder you complain of  as I know your Frame delicate  and your Constitution tender  your present State of Health is indeed a proper Apology for your Lowness of Spirits  but  at the same Time  a strong Reason for your exerting them to the utmost   As for the Gentleman  who  you say  has attempted in some Particularities  as the Phrase is  to take me off  I beg you  in Return  will present him with my Thoughts  upon his Pantomime Art  in the following Essay   If Fools are not the only Mimicks  they certainly are the best in the World  for  having no Characters of their own  they can  with more Ease  adopt another s  like the Cameleon  which has no Colour itself  and is reported to catch the Hue of any Object near it   To shew the Trivialness of this Art  Children are observed to be the most natural Mimicks  and a Girl in Leading strings  will shew you how Mama  and how Dada  dances or takes Snuff   Even in mimick Life  where one should expect this Practice to be in most Esteem  among Stage players  the Mimick is held among the lowest Class  for  in the same Proportion as   87 the representing the Excellencies of human Nature is the noblest Part  so is ridiculing its Foibles the meanest   A Buffoon  who values himself upon this Imperfection  has the same Pride with a Baboon  who itself the most ridiculous Animal in the whole Creation  is  notwithstanding  the highest Caracatura upon the human Species   Adieu   LETTER LII   MY dear Harry may see  by the Quickness of my Dispatch  the Pleasure I take in obeying his Commands  for  tho  I have not any Thing to say  yet I should think it a Breach of them to omit a Post  But  not to take more Merit upon me  than I deserve  I will honestly own that Self love dictates most of my Letters  and I undergo the Fatigue of writing many a tedious   in order to purchase a few Lines from you   Point de Rose  sans Pique   and am as well pleased  with the Exchange  as the French and Spaniards have Reason to be with their Traffick to the Indies  where they purchase Gold and Jewels  by Toys and Baubles   I was a great deal worse  when I wrote last  than I owned at that Time  for I apprehended an   88 Inflammation on my Lungs  which  I was in Hopes  would have proved mortal    For I am weary of this earthly Clay   Want higher Joys  and long to wing away     My Reason for not telling you  was  because I was unwilling to anticipate your Pleasure on the Occasion  besides  when People are surprized  they generally make a Simile  and  tho  I could not be sensible of what you might have said  I have too much Regard to Posterity  to prevent their Profiting by your Wit  I am still as ill  as a violent Cough  Shortness of Breath  sore Throat  and Lowness of Spirits can make me  and yet I am mightily afraid  I shall recover  and so I suffer to no End  but to make me despise Life still more  if possible   I assure you this is not Raillery  for I was so serious  as to make my Will  and
