What pains have I taken  to conquer those sudden gusts of passion  to which  from my early youth  I have been subject  as you have often heard me confess  yet to find  at times  that I am unequal—to myself  shall I say —To myself  I will say  since I have been so much amended by your precepts  and example  But I will give you the occasion   My guests  and you  had but just left me  when the wretched Jervois  and her O Hara  and another bullying man  desired to speak with me   I bid the servant shew the woman into the drawingroom next my study  and the men into the adjoining parlour  but they both followed her into the drawing room  I went to her  and  after a little stiff civility  I could not help it  asked  If these gentlemen had business with me     93 That gentleman is Major O Hara  Sir  He is my husband  That gentleman is Captain Salmonet  He is the Major s brother in law  He is an officer  of equal worth and bravery   They gave themselves airs of importance and familiarity  and the Major motioned  as if he would have taken my hand   I encouraged not the motion  Will you  gentlemen  walk this way   I led the way to my study  The woman arose  and would have come with them   If you please to stay where you are  madam  I will attend you presently   They entered  and  as if they would have me think them connoisseurs  began to admire the globes  the orrery  the pictures  and busts   I took off that sort of attention—Pray  gentlemen  what are your commands with me   I am called Major O Hara  Sir  I am the husband of the Lady in the next room  as she told you   And what  pray  Sir  have I to do  either with you  or your marriage  I pay that Lady  as the widow of Mr  Jervois  200l  a year  I am not obliged to pay her more then one  She has no demands upon me  much less has her husband   The men had so much the air of bullies  and the woman is so very wicked  that my departed friend  and the name by which she so lately called the poor Emily  were in my head  and I had too little command of my temper   Look ye  Sir Charles Grandison  I would have you to know—  And he put his left hand upon his sword handle  pressing it down  which tilted up the point with an air extremely insolent   What am I to understand by that motion  Sir   Nothing at all  Sir Charles—D n me  if I mean any thing by it—    94 You are called Major  you say  Sir—Do you bear the king s commission  Sir   I have borne it  Sir  if I do not now   That  and the house you are in  give you a title to civility  But  Sir  I cannot allow  that your marriage with the Lady in the next room gives you pretence to business with me  If you have  on any other account  pray let me know what it is   The man seemed at a loss what to say  but not from bashfulness  He looked about him  as if for his woman  set his teeth  bit his lip  and took snuff  with an air so like defiance  that  for fear I should not be able to forbear taking notice of it  I turned to the other  Pray  Captain Salmonet  said I  what are your commands with me   He spoke in broken English  and said  He had the honour to be Major O Hara s brother  He had married the Major s sister   And why  Sir  might you not have favoured me with the company of all your relations —Have you any business with me  Sir  on your own account   I come  I come  said he  to see my brother righted  Sir—  Who has wronged him —Take care  gentlemen  how—But Mr  O Hara  what are your pretensions   Why look ye  Sir Charles Grandison  throwing open his coat  and sticking one hand in his side  the other thrown out with a flourish  Look ye  Sir  repeated he—  I found my choler rising  I was afraid of my self   When I treat you familiarly  Sir  then treat me so  Till when  please to withdraw—  I rang  Frederick came in   Shew these gentleman into the little parlour—You will excuse me  Sirs  I attend the Lady   They muttered  and gave themselves brisk and angry airs  nodding their heads at each other  but followed the servant into that parlour     95 I went to Mrs  O Hara  as she calls herself   Well  madam  what is your business with me  now   Where are the gentlemen  Sir
