 for  having plundered the people in this manner  which was so impudent  and barefaced  as plainly to prove they were certain of escaping  with impunity  and that they were old offenders in the same degree of  delinquency  He said  that the greatest man in Athens would have been  condemned to perpetual exile  and seen his estate confiscated for public  use  had he dared in such a licentious manner to violate the rights of  a fellow citizen  and as for the little affronts to which a man may  be subject from the petulance of the multitude  he looked upon them as  glorious indications of liberty  which ought not to be repressed  and  would at any time rejoice to find himself overthrown in a kennel by the  insolence of a son of freedom  even though the fall should cost him a  limb  adding  by way of illustration  that the greatest pleasure he ever  enjoyed was in seeing a dustman wilfully overturn a gentleman s coach   in which two ladies were bruised  even to the danger of their lives   Pallet  shocked at the extravagance of this declaration   If that be the  case   said he   I wish you may see every bone in your body broke by the  first carman you meet in the streets of London    This argument being discussed  and the reckoning discharged without any  deduction  although the landlord  in stating the articles  had an eye  to the loss he had sustained by his own countrymen  they departed  from Arras  and arrived in safety at Lisle  about two o clock in the  afternoon   They had scarce taken possession of their lodgings  in a large hotel in  the Grande Place  when the innkeeper gave them to understand  that  he kept an ordinary below  which was frequented by several English    6 22 15  3 45 PM   gentlemen who resided in town  and that dinner was then set upon  the table  Peregrine  who seized all opportunities of observing new  characters  persuaded his company to dine in public  and they were  accordingly conducted to the place  where they found a mixture of Scotch  and Dutch officers  who had come from Holland to learn their exercises  at the academy  and some gentlemen in the French service  who were upon  garrison duty in the citadel  Among these last was a person about the  age of fifty  of a remarkably genteel air and polite address  dignified  with a Maltese cross  and distinguished by the particular veneration of  all those who knew him  When he understood that Pickle and his friends  were travellers  he accosted the youth in English  which he spoke  tolerably well  and  as they were strangers  offered to attend them in  the afternoon to all the places worth seeing in Lisle  Our hero thanked  him for his excess of politeness  which  he said  was peculiar to the  French nation  and  struck with his engaging appearance  industriously  courted his conversation  in the course of which he learned that this  chevalier was a man of good sense and great experience  that he was  perfectly well acquainted with the greatest part of Europe  had lived  some years in England  and was no stranger to the constitution and  genius of that people   Having dined  and drunk to the healths of the English and French kings   two fiacres were called  in one of which the knight  with one of his  companions  the governor  and Peregrine seated themselves  the other  being occupied by the physician  Pallet  and two Scottish officers   who proposed to accompany them in their circuit  The first place they  visited was the citadel  round the ramparts of which they walked   under the conduct of the knight  who explained with great accuracy the  intention of every particular fortification belonging to that seemingly  impregnable fortress  and  when they had satisfied their curiosity   took coach again  in order to view the arsenal  which stands in another  quarter of the town  but  just as Pickle s carriage had crossed the  promenade  he heard his own name bawled aloud by the painter  and   ordering the fiacre to stop  saw Pallet  with one half of his body  thrust out at the window of the other coach  crying  with a terrified  look   Mr  Pickle  Mr  Pickle  the for the love of God halt  and prevent  bloodshed  else here will be carnage and cutting of throats   Peregrine   surprised at this exclamation  immediately alighted  and  advancing to  the other vehicle  found one of their military companions standing upon  the ground  at the farther side of the coach  with his sword drawn  and  fury in his countenance  and the physician  with a quivering lip  and  haggard aspect  struggling with the other  who had interposed in the  quarrel  and detained him in his place   Our young gentleman  upon inquiry  found that this animosity had sprung  from a dispute that happened upon
