think I in end to do with it —It is already disposed of     132 I ll be hanged  said Lady G  if this good creature has not given it to her husband   Indeed  Charlotte  I have  I gave it to him before I slept   I thought so  She laughed—And Lord L  took it  Did he   To be sure he did  I should otherwise have been displeased with him   Dear  good soul —And so you gave him a thousand pounds to take part of it back from him  by four or five paltry guineas at a time  at his pleasure   Lord L  and I  Charlotte  have but one purse  You may perhaps  know how we manage it   Pray  good  meek  dependent creature  how do you manage it   Thus  Charlotte  My Lord knows that his wife and he have but one interest  and from the first of our happy marriage  he would make me take one key  as he has another  of the private drawer  where his money and money bills lie  There is a little memorandum book in the drawer  in which he enters on one   the money he receives  on the opposite  the money he takes out  And when I want money  I have recourse to my key  If I see but little in the drawer  I am the more moderate  or  perhaps  if my want is not urgent  defer the supplying of it till my Lord is richer  But little  or much  I minute down the sum  as he himself does  and so we know what we are about  and I never put it out of my Lord s power  by my unseasonable expences  to preserve that custom of his for which he is as much respected  as well served  not to suffer a demand to be twice made upon him where he is a debtor   Good soul —And  pray  don t you minute down too the use to which you put the money you take out   Indeed I often do  Always indeed  when I take out more than five guineas at one time  I found my Lord did so  and I followed the example of my own accord     133 Happy pair  said I—O Lady G  what a charming example is this —I hope you ll follow it   Thank you  Harriet  for your advice  Why  I can t but say  that this is one pretty way of coaxing each other into frugality  But don t you think▪ that where an honest pair are so tender of disobliging  and so studious of obliging each other  that they seem to confess that the matrimonial good understanding hangs by very slender threads   And do not the tenderest friendships  said I  hang by as slender  Can delicate minds be united to each other but by delicate observances   Why thou art a good soul  too  Harriet —And so you would both have me make a present to Lord G  of my thousand pounds before we have chosen our private drawer  before he has got two keys made to it   Let him know  Charlotte  what Lord L  and I do  if you think the example worth following—And then—  Ay  and then give him my thousand pounds for a beginning  Lady L  —But see you not that this proposal should come from him  not from me —And should we not let each other see a little of each other s merits  first   See  first  the merits of the man you have married  Charlotte   Yes  Lady L —But yesterday married  you know  Can there be a greater difference between any two men in the world  than there often is between the same man  a lover  and an hustand —And now  my generous advisers  be pleased to continue silent  You cannot answer me fairly  And besides  wot ye not the indelicacy of an early present  which you are not obliged to make   We were both silent  each expecting the other to answer the strange creature   She laughed at us both  Soft souls  and tender    134 said she  let me tell you  that there is more in delicacy  than you very delicate people are aware of   You  Charlotte  said Lady L  have odder notions than any body else  Had you been a man  you would have been a sad rake   A rake perhaps I might have been  but not a sad one  Lady L   Lady G  can t help being witty  said I  It is sometimes her misfortune  sometimes ours  that she cannot  However  I highly approve of the example set by Lord L  and followed by Lady L   And so do I  Harriet  And when Lord G  sets the example  I shall—consider of it  I am not a bad oeconomist  Had I ten thousand pounds in my hands  I would not be extravagant  Had I but one hundred  I would not be mean  I value not money but as it enables me to lay an obligation
