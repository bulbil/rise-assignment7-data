II  died in the 77th year of his age  and the 33d of his reign  in the midst of victory  and  at that very period  when the universal enthusiasm of conquest began to subside for more sober reflexions  If any Monarch was happy in the peculiar mode and time of his death  it was he  The factions which had been nursing in his reign  had not yet come to maturity  and all their virulence threatened to fall upon his successor  He was himself of no shining abilities  and  consequently  while he was suffered to guide his German dominions  he entrusted the care of Britain to his ministers at home  However  as we stand too near this Monarch to view his   248 real character without partiality  take the following characters of him  by two writers of opposite sentiments      As to the extent of his understanding  says one  or the splendour of his virtue  we rather wish for opportunities of praising  than undertake the task ourselves  His public character was marked with a predilection for his native country  to which he sacrificed all other motives      On the other hand  says his panegyrist     On whatever side we look upon his character  we shall find ample matter for just and unsuspected praise  None of his predecessors in the throne of England lived to so great an age  or enjoyed longer felicity  His subjects were still improving under him in commerce and arts  and his own oeconomy set a prudent example to the nation  which  however  they did not follow  He was  in his temper  sudden and violent  but this  though it influenced his behaviour  made no change in his conduct  which was generally guided by reason  He was plain and direct in his intentions  true to his word  steady in his favour and protection to his servants  nor parting even with his ministers till compelled to it by the violence of faction  In short  through the whole of life he appeared rather to live for the cultivation of useful virtues than splendid ones  and  satisfied with being good  left others their unenvied greatness      I am   c     249  LETTER XXX   I Am sorry that praise bestowed on living merit is often found to injure the goodness it applauds  The character of the successor of George the second deserves the warmest panegyric  and all who love their country only wish for a continuance of that spirit  and that virtue which has hitherto appeared in him  Never did Monarch come to the throne at a more critical period  the nation  flushed with conquest  yet tired of war  expecting the lowest submission from their humbled enemies  yet murmuring under the immense load of their taxes  One part of the people acquiring immense wealth by the continuance of hostilities  another reduced almost to bankruptcy  Besides this  he saw the throne hedged round by ignorance and faction  men intent only on their own interests  and willing to persuade Monarchy that whatever conduced to their own wishes was directed for the welfare of the kingdom  It was in this disposition of things  that George III  came to the crown  The kingdom began to divide into two parties  or  more properly speaking  the very same individuals seemed to wear  at once  a face of joy and discontent  They felt all the triumphs of their successes  but justly dreaded the consequences of an expensive continuance of them  The numberless victories they gained by sea continued to keep them in spirits  and induced them to supply the immense expences of the year with chearfulness  During the whole period of the war succeeding the execution of Admiral Byng  nothing could be carried on with more spirit and resolution  than all our naval engagements  In every enterprize the superior bravery  skill  and dexterity of the English were obvious  Often with forces very much disproportioned  they   250 took their adversaries ships  and effectually disabled the enemies force by sea   No history can furnish examples of such numerous fleets  or more active commanders  This desire for victory seemed even to diffuse itself to the lowest officers  and the captains of privateers seemed as much enamoured of conquest as with a desire of gain  The Admirals  Hawke  Howe  Boscawen  Pocock   c  were always victorious  the Captains  Tyrrel  Foster  Gilchrist  Lockhart  and others  often fought at a disadvantage  but never without honour  As an instance of the intrepid spirit of our seamen in this war  I shall mention one action which posterity  if it were only singly supported  might look upon as incredible  The annals of mankind cannot shew an effort of more desperate courage than was exerted under the command of captain William Death  commander of the Terrible privateer  He had  in the beginning of his cruize  made prize of a rich merchant ship  and with this was returning home to England in triumph  when he had the misfortune to fall in with the Vengeance privateer of St  Malo  much his superior in force  he having but twenty six guns  the enemy thirty six  and a proportionable number of men  The Terrible s prize
