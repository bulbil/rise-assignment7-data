  could not be persuaded to re enter the banqueting room  until Peregrine  undertook to procure his pardon from those whom he had injured  Having  assured him of this indulgence  our young gentleman led him in like a  criminal  bowing on all hands with all air of humility and contrition   and particularly addressing himself to the count  to whom he swore in  English  as God was his Saviour  he had no intent to affront man  woman   or child  but was fain to make the best of his way  that he might not  give the honourable company cause of offence  by obeying the dictates of  nature in their presence   When Pickle interpreted this apology to the Italian  Pallet was forgiven  in very polite terms  and even received into favour by his friend the  doctor  in consequence of our hero s intercession  so that all the  guests forgot their chagrin  and paid their respects so piously to the  bottle  that in a short time the Champagne produced very evident effects  in the behaviour of all present   CHAPTER XLV    The Painter is persuaded to accompany Pickle to a Masquerade in  Woman s Apparel   Is engaged in a troublesome Adventure  and  with his  Companion  conveyed to the Bastille   The painter  at the request of Pickle  who had a design upon the count s  sense of hearing  favoured the company with the song of Bumper Squire  Jones  which yielded infinite satisfaction to the baron  but affected  the delicate ears of the Italian in such a manner  that his features  expressed astonishment and disquiet  and by his sudden and repeated  journeys to the door  it plainly appeared  that he was in the same  predicament with those who  as Shakespeare observes   when the bagpipe  sings in the nose  cannot contain their urine for affection    With a view  therefore  of vindicating music from such a barbarous  taste  Mr  Pallet had no sooner performed his task  than the count  honoured his friends with some favourite airs of his own country  which  he warbled with infinite grace and expression  though he had not energy  sufficient to engage the attention of the German  who fell fast asleep  upon his couch  and snored so loud  as to interrupt  and totally annul   this ravishing entertainment  so that they were fain to have recourse  again to the glass  which made such innovation upon the brain of the  physician  that he sang divers odes of Anacreon to a tune of his own  composing  and held forth upon the music and recitative of the ancients  with great erudition  while Pallet  having found means to make the  Italian acquainted with the nature of his profession  harangued upon  painting with wonderful volubility  in a language which  it was well for  his own credit  the stranger did not understand   At length the doctor was seized with such a qualm  that he begged  Peregrine to lead him to his chamber  and the baron  being waked   retired with the count  Peregrine  being rendered frolicsome with  the wine he had drunk  proposed that he and Pallet should go to a  masquerade  which he recollected was to be given that night  The painter    6 22 15  3 45 PM   did not want curiosity and inclination to accompany him  but expressed  his apprehension of losing him in the ball  an accident which could  not fail to be very disagreeable  as he was an utter stranger to the  language and the town  To obviate this objection  the landlady  who was  of their council  advised him to appear in a woman s dress  which would  lay his companion under the necessity of attending him with more care   as he could not with decency detach himself from the lady whom he  should introduce  besides  such a connection would hinder the ladies of  pleasure from accosting and employing their seducing arts upon a person  already engaged   Our young gentleman foreseeing the abundance of diversion in the  execution of this project  seconded the proposal with such importunity  and address  that the painter allowed himself to be habited in a suit  belonging to the landlady  who also procured for him a mask and domino   while Pickle provided himself with a Spanish dress  In this disguise   which they put on about eleven o clock  did they  attended by Pipes   set out in a fiacre for the ball room  into which Pickle led this  supposititious female  to the astonishment of the whole company  who had  never seen such an uncouth figure in the appearance of a woman   After they had taken a view of all the remarkable masks  and the painter  had been treated with a of glass of liqueur  his mischievous companion  gave him the slip  and  vanishing in an instant  returned with  another mask and a domino over his habit  that he might enjoy Pallet s  perplexity  and be at hand to protect him from insult  The poor painter   having lost his guide
