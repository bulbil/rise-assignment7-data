the whole parish        My mother s good nature had like to have lost her her   lodger  for  as soon as the doctor was gone  he gave her warning     but upon her promising never to be guilty of the like indis    cretion again  nor to trouble herself any further about him    than just to give him what he should call for  he consented   to stay        Erom that time he Uved among us as unnoticed as he could   desire  following his business without disturbance from any   one  nor appearing to give himself the least trouble about   that of any other person hving  except it was me  whom he    taught to read  and said he would make his heir  Aa unhappy   heirship  I am sure  for me   for it hindered my marrying    Jack Twist  the rope maker  who was the toppingest man in   all Eadolifi Highway  and then ofEered to take me in my   shift        But there s no help for that now   Luck is all   to be sur     we thought he must be some extraordinary man  for he never   wanted money  and then we used to hear him talk to himself   sometimes  as if all the world was his own  of building colleges     and churches  and houses  and altering St Paul s  and I do    not know what great things   and one day in particular  I   remember he said before us all  that before seven years  he   would hire an army that should drive the pope and the Devil      Lord bless us    out of Rome   for to be sxire  he would talk   before us  as if we could not hear him  as we would also do   anything before him as freely as if he was a cat or a dog I   Well  as I was saying  it was no wonder  to be sure  that such   ignorant poor folks as we should think much of him  especially   after what the doctor said  and accordingly built great hopes   upon his promises        He went on thus for near twenty years  no soul ever coming          3T3Ti PRE F AGE     near him  nor he going out above once or twice in a year  and   then not staying above an hour or two at a time        At length his health began to break very much  which   made my mother often speak to him  not to work so hard    for he had been with us so long  and was so quiet  and paid   so honestly  that we all loved him as if he was our father  But   her advice was all to no purpose   he still went on  bidding   her not trouble herself  nor be afraid about him  But this did   not satisfy her   and one day  when he had been locked up    from the morning before  without having any victuals or going   to bed  she resolved to break through his orders and call him    to dinner        When she came to the turret  which he called his laboratory    she tapped gently at the door   but receiving no answer  nor   hearing any noise within  she was so frightened  that she called   me to fetch the kitchen poker  with wHch we made a shift to   force it open  when we found the poor man stretched at his   length upon the floor  to all appearance dead        This shocked us greatly   but we did not alarm the neigh    bours  as we imagined there were things of value there  that   might be misplaced  or taken away in the confusion   we    therefore raised him up ourselves  and  after a little while    perceiving signs of life  carried him in  and laid him in our own   bed  and  pouring some drops into his mouth and nose  at   length brought him to himself  when his first care was to   inquire for the key of the turret  whether any one else had been   there  or anything in it stirred  Our answers satisfying him   he seemed quite easy  and in a little time recovered  to all    appearance as well as ever        From this time  he changed his way of life a good deal     and though he was much in the turret  which we observed   he ever after called his study  and not his laboratory  he never   sat
