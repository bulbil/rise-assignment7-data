 but for five minutes  That was the petition which was denied her  as I mentioned in my last   Camilla was afraid that she would go into a gloomy fit upon it  as I told you—She did  but it lasted not long  For she made an effort  soon after  to go out of   357 the house by way of the garden  The gardener refused his key  and brought Camilla to her  whom she had  by an innocent piece of art  but just before  sent to bring her something from her toilette   The General went with Camilla to her  They found her just setting a ladder against the wall  She heard them  and screamed  and  leaving the ladder  ran  to avoid them  till she came in sight of the great cascade  into which  had she not by a cross alley been intercepted by the General  it is feared she would have thrown herself   This has terrified us all  She begs but for one interview  one parting interview  and she promises to make herself easy  But it is not thought adviseable  Yet Father Marescotti himself thought it best to indulge her  Had my mother been earnest  I believe it had been granted  But she is so much concerned at the blame she met with on permitting the last interview  that she will not contend  tho  she has let them know  that she did not oppose the request   The unhappy girl ran into my chamber this morning—Jeronymo  He will be gone  said she  I know he will  All I want is  but to see him  To wish him happy  And to know  If he will remember me when he is gone  as I shall him —Have you no interest  Jeronymo  Cannot I once see him  Not once   The Bishop  before I could answer  came in quest of her  followed by Laurana  from whom she had forcibly disengaged herself  to come to me   Let me have but one parting interview  my Lord  said she  looking to him  and clinging about my neck  He will be gone  Gone for ever  Is there so in being allowed to say  Farewel  and be happy  Grandison  and excuse all the trouble I have given you —What has my brother s preserver done  what have I done  that I must not see him  nor he me  for one quarter of an hour only   Indeed  my Lord  said I  she should be complied with  Indeed she should     358 My Father thinks otherwise  said the Bishop  The Count thinks otherwise  I think otherwise  Were the Chevalier a common man  she might  But she dwells upon what passed in the last interview  and his behaviour to her  That  it is plain  did her harm   The next may drive the thoughts of that out of her head  returned I   Dear Jeronymo  replied he  a little peevishly  you will always think differently from every body else  Mrs  Beaumont comes to morrow   What do I care for Mrs  Beaumont  said she —I don t love her  She tells every thing I say   Come  my dear love  said Laurana  you afflict your brother Jeronymo  Let us go up to your own chamber   I afflict every body  and every body afflicts me  and you are all cruel  Why  he will be gone  I tell you  That makes me so impatient  and I have something to say to him  My father won t see me  My mother renounces me  I have been looking for her  and she hides herself from me —And I am a prisoner  and watched  and used ill   Here comes my mother  said Laurana  You now must go up to your chamber  cousin Clementina   So she does  said she  Now I must go  indeed —Ah  Jeronymo  Now there is no saying nay —But it is hard  Very hard —And she burst into tears  I won t speak tho   said she  to my aunt  Remember  I will be silent  madam —Then whispering me  My aunt  brother  is not the aunt she used to be to me —But hush  I don t complain  you know   By this I saw that Lady Sforza was severe with her   She addressed herself to her aunt  You are not my mamma  are you  madam   No  child   No  child  indeed  I know that too well  But my brother Giacomo is as cruel to me as any body  But hush  Jeronymo —Don t you betray me —Now my   359 aunt is come  I must go —I wish I could run away from you all   She was yesterday detected writing a Letter to you  My mother was shewn what she had written  and wept over it  My aunt took it out of my sister s bosom  where she had trust it  on her coming in  This she resented highly   When she was led into her own chamber  she refused to speak
