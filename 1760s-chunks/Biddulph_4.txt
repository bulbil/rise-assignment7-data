sorrow which I ever experienced  has been induced to quit her beloved retirement  and come on purpose to London  to rouze up my spirits  and  as she expresses herself  to keep me from the sin of murmuring   Avaunt then complainings  Let me rest assured that my Cecilia is happy in her pursuits  and let me resolve on making myself so in mind   April 3  We have had a letter from my brother George  he is landed  and we expect him hourly in town  As our house is large enough  I hope he will consent to take up his quarters with us while we stay in London  My mother intends to request it of him  she says it will be for the reputation of a gay young man to live in a sober family  I know not how Sir George may relish the proposal  as our hours are not likely to correspond with those which I suppose he has been used to since he has been absent from us  But perhaps he may not refuse the compliment  Sir George is not averse to oeconomy —How kind  how    indulgent  is this worthy Parent of mine  she will not suffer me to stay at home with her  nay scarce allows me time for my journal  ‘Sidney I won’t have you stay within  I won’t have you write  I won’t have you think—I will make a rake of you  you shall go to the play to night  and I am almost tempted to go with you myself  though I have not been at one since your father’s death ’—These were her kind expressions to me just now —I am indeed indebted to her tenderness  when she relaxes so much of her usual strictness  as even to think of such a thing   April 5  My brother returned to us this day  thank God  in perfect health  Never was there such an alteration seen in a man  he is grown fat  and looks quite robust  He dropped in upon us just as we sat down to dinner  what a clutter has his arrival made  my mother was so rejoyced  and so thankful  and so full of praises  and asked so many questions  that George could hardly find words enough to answer the over flowings of her kind inquisitiveness  which lasted all dinner time   When the cloth was removed  my mother proposed his taking up his abode with us  you see  said she  your sister and I have got here into a large house  there is full room enough in it for you and your servants  and as I think in such a town as this it will be a reputable place for you to live in  I shall be glad of your company  provided you do not encroach upon my rules by unreasonable hours  or receiving visits from such as I may not approve of for the acquaintance of your sister  I was afraid Sir George would disrelish the terms  as perhaps some of his acquaintance  though far from faulty ones  might fall within my mother’s predicament  but I was mistaken  he accepted of the invitation  after making some slight apologies about the inconvenience of having so many servants  this however was soon got over   To say the truth  I am very glad that my brother has consented to be our guest  as I hope by his means our circle of acquaintance will be a good deal enlarged  There is no pleasure in society  without a proper mixture of well bred sensible people of both sexes  and I have hitherto been chiefly confined to those of my own   I asked Sir George jocosely  what he had brought me home  He answered  perhaps a good husband —My mother catched up the word—What do you mean  Son  I mean  madam  that there is come    over with me a gentleman  with whom I became acquainted in Germany  who  of all the men I ever knew  I should wish to have for a brother  If Sidney should fortunately be born under the influence of uncommonly good stars  it may happen to be brought about  I can tell you  applying himself to me  he is prepossessed in your favour already  I have shewn him some of your letters  and he thinks you a good sensible girl  I told him you were very well in your person  and that you have had an excellent education  I hope so  said my mother  looking pleased  and what have you to tell us of this wonderful man that so much surpasses every body  Why  madam for your part of his character  he is the best behaved young man I ever saw  I never knew any body equal to him for sobriety  nor so intirely free from all the other vices of youth  as I lived in the same house with him for some months  I had frequent opportunities of making my observations  I have known him to avoid many irregularities  but never saw him guilty of one   An admirable character indeed said my mother  So thought I too  but I wanted to know a little more of him  Now Sidney for your share in the description  I must tell you he is most exquisitely handsome  and extremely sensible
