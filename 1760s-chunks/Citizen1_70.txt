distorting the face  Item  the whole art of love made perfectly easy by a broker of  Change Alley  Item  the proper manner of cutting black lead   221 pencils  and making crayons  by the Right Hon  the Earl of      Item  the muster master general  or the review of reviews —  Sir  cried I  interrupting him  my curiosity with regard to title s is satisfied  I should be glad to see some longer manuscript  an history  or an epic poem — Bless me  cries the man of industry  now you speak of an epic poem  you shall see an excellent farce  Here it is  dip into it where you will  it will be found replete with true modern humour  Strokes  Sir  it is filled with strokes of wit and satire in every line   Do you call these dashes of the pen strokes  replied I  for I must confess I can see no other   And pray Sir  returned he  what do you call them  Do you see any thing good now a days that is not filled with strokes — and dashes —Sir  a well placed dash makes half the wit of our writers of modern humour  I bought last season a piece that had no other merit upon earth than nine hundred and ninety five breaks  seventy two ha ha s  three good things  and a garter  And yet it played off  and bounced  and cracked  and made more sport than a firework   I fancy then  Sir  you were a considerable gainer   It must be owned the piece did pay  but upon the whole I cannot much boast of last winter s success  I gained by two murders  but then I lost by an ill timed charity sermon I was a considerable sufferer by my Direct road to an estate  but the Infernal Guide brought me up again  Ah  Sir  that was a piece touched off by the hands of a master  filled with good things from one end to the other  The author had nothing but the jest in view  no dull moral lurking beneath  nor ill natured satyr to sour the reader s good humour  he wisely considered   222 that moral and humour at the same time were quite over doing the business   To what purpose was the book then published  cried I   Sir  the book was published in order to be sold  and no book sold better  except the criticisms upon it  which came out soon after  Of all kinds of writing that goes off best at present  and I generally fasten a criticism upon every selling book that is published   I once had an author who never left the least opening for the critics  close was the word  always very right  and very dull  ever on the safe side of an argument  yet  with all his qualifications  incapable of coming into favour  I soon perceived that his bent was for criticism  and as he was good for nothing else  supplied him with pens and paper  and planted him at the beginning of every month as a censor on the works of others  In short  I found him a treasure  no merit could escape him  but what is most remarkable of all  he ever wrote best and bitterest when drunk   But are there not some works  interrupted I  that from the very manner of their composition must be exempt from criticism  particularly such as profess to disregard its laws   There is no work whatsoever but he can criticise  replied the bookseller  even though you wrote in Chinese he would have a pluck at you  Suppose you should take it into your head to publish a book  let it be a volume of Chinese letters for instance  write how you will  he shall shew the world you could have written better  Should you  with the most local exactness  stick to the manners and customs of the country from whence you come  should you confine   223 yourself to the narrow limits of eastern knowledge  and be perfectly simple  and perfectly natural  he has then the strongest reason to exclaim  He may with a sneer send you back to China for readers  He may observe  that after the first or second letter the iteration of the same simplicity is insupportably tedious  but the worst of all is  the public in such a case will anticipate his censures  and leave you with all your uninstructive simplicity to be mauled at discretion    Yes  cried I  but  in order to avoid his indignation  and what I should fear more  that of the public  I would in such a case write with all the knowledge I was master of  As I am not possessed of much learning  at least I would not suppress what little I had  nor would I appear more stupid than nature made me   Here then  cries the bookseller  we should have you entirely in our power  unnatural  uneastern  quite out of character  erroneously sensible would be the whole cry  Sir  we should then hunt you down like a rat   Head of my father  said I  sure there are but the two
