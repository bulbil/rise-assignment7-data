 She speaks to herself  and answers herself  and  as I guess  repeats part of the talk that passed between Father Marescotti and her  But still  To be despised  are the words she oftenest repeats—Jesu  once  said she—To be despised  —And by an English Protestant  Who can bear that   In this way  Sir  is Lady Clementina  The sweetest creature  I see  I see  you have compassion  Sir  You never wanted humanity  Generosity is a part of your nature  I am sure you love her—I see you love her—I pain your noble heart  Indeed  indeed  Sir  Lady Clementina s Love extended beyond the limits of this world  She hoped to be yours to all eternity   Well might Camilla  the sensible  the faithful  the affectionate Camilla  the attendant from insant years of her beloved Clementina  thus run on  without interruption  I could not speak  And had I been able  to what purpose should I have pleaded to Camilla the superior attachement which occasioned an anguish that words cannot describe     271 What can I say  but thank you  my good Camilla  for your intention  I hope you have eased your own heart  but you have loaded mine—Nevertheless  I thank you  Would to Heaven that your Lady s own wishes had been complied with  that she had been encouraged to go to the excellent Mrs  Beaumont  The first natural impulses of the distressed heart often point out the best alleviation  Would to Heaven they had been pursued  I have great dependence on the generous friendship of Signor Jeronymo  All that is in my power to do  I will do  I honour  I venerate  every one of the truly noble family  I never can deserve their favour  On all occasions  Camilla  let them know my devotion to them   I beg of God  said me  to put it into your hear••o restore the tranquillity of a family that was  till lately  the happiest in Bologna  It may not be yet too late  I beg you to excuse my officiousness  Pray take no notice that I have waited on you  I shall be wanted   She was hastening away  Good Camilia  said I  taking a ring of some value from my finger  and forcing it upon hers  she is above accepting of pecuniary presents  and struggled against this   Accept this as a remembrance  not acknowlegement  I may be forbid the palace of the Marquis della Porretta  and so have no opportunity again to see the equally faithful and obliging Camilla   What other conditions could have been prescribed  Dr  Bartlett  that I should have refused to comply with  How was I anew distressed  at the account Camilla gave me  But my great consolation in the whole transaction is that my own heart  on the maturest deliberation  acquits me  And the rather  as it is impossible for me to practise a greater piece of self denial  For can there be on earth a nobler Lady than Clementina   The next morning  early  Mr  Grandison received the following Letter from his friend Signor Jeronymo    272 I translated it  my good Miss Byron  at the time I received it  I will send you the translation  only   My dear Chevalier   SHALL I blame you —I cannot  Shall I blame my father  my mother —They blame themselves  for the free access you were allowed to have to their Clementina  yet they own  that you acted nobly  But they had forgot that Clementina had eyes  Yet who knew not her discernment  Who knew not her regard for merit where ever she found it  Can I therefore blame my sister —Indeed  no  Has she a brother whom I can blame —No  But ought I not to blame myself  The dear creature owned  it seems  to Mrs  Beaumont  that my declaration in your favour  which was made long before you knew it  was one of her influences  Must I therefore accuse myself —If I regard my intention  gratitude  for a life preserved by you  and for a sense of my social duties  soul as well as body indebted to you  tho  a Protestant yourself  will not suffer it  Is there then nobody whom we can blame for the calamity befallen us —How strangely is that calamity circumstanced   But is there so irreconcileable a difference between the two religious —There is  The Bishop says there is  Clementina thinks there is  My father  my mother  think there is   But does your father think so  Will you put the whole matter on that issue  Chevalier   O no  you will not  You are as determined as we are  Yet  surely  with less reason   But I debate not the matter with you  I know you are a master of the question   But what is to be done  Shall Clementina perish  Will not the gallant youth  who ventured his life so successfully to save a brother  exert himself to preserve a sister     273 Come  and see the way she is in—Yet they will not admit you into her presence while she
