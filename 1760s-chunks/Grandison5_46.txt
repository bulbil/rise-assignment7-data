hours ago  a kind of fit  The first reflexion that crossed me  when he was at worst  was this—What a wretch was I  to vex this poor man as I have done —Happy  happy is the wife  in the depth of her affliction  on the loss of a worthy husband  happy the husband  if he must be separated from a good wife  who has no material cause for self reproach to imbitter reflexion  as to his or her conduct to the departed  Ah  Caroline  how little do we know of ourselves  till the hour of trial comes  I find  I find  I have more Love for Lord G  than I thought I had  or could have  for any man   How have I exposed myself —But they none of them upbraid me with my apprehensions for the honest man  He did fright me —A wretch —In his childhood he was troubled with these oddities  it seems —He is so well  that I had a good mind to quarrel with him for terrifying me as he did  For better and for worse —A cheat —He should have told me that he had been subject to such an infirmity —And then  from his apprehended fits  tho  involuntary  I should have claimed allowance for my real  tho  wilful ones  In which  however  I cheated not him  He saw me in them many and many a good time  before marriage   Page  115 I have this moment yours  I thought what would be the case with Olivia  She has certainly heard of the happy turn at Bologna  or she would not think of leaving England so soon  when she had resolved to stay here till my brother s return  Unhappy woman  Harriet pities her —But she has pity for every one that wants it   Repeatedly all here are earnest to get you and your Lord with us  Do  come if you can—Were it but for one week  and perhaps we will go up together  If you don t come soon  your folks will not suffer you to come one while  After all  my dear  these men are  as aunt Nell would say  odious creatures  You are a good forgiving soul  but that am not I  In a few months time I shall be as grave as a cat  I suppose  But the sorry fellow knows nothing of the matter as yet   Adieu  Lady L   LETTER XVIII  From the Countess of D  To Miss BYRON     Inclosed in the preceding    July 1   MY dear Harriet has allowed me to write to her with the affectionate freedom of a mother  As such  I may go on to urge a subject disagreeable to her  when not only the welfare of both my children is concerned in it  but when her own honour  her own delicacy of sentiment  is peculiarly interested   Pure and noble as your heart is  it is misleading you  my Love  Oh  my Harriet  into what a labyrinth —Have you kept a copy  my dear  of your last Letter to me  It is all amiable  all yourself—But it is Harriet Byron again  in need of a rescuer—Shall I  my child  save you from being run away with by these tyrannous  over refinements  Yes  you will say  could I do it Page  116disinterestedly  Well  I will  if I can  imagine myself quite disinterested  suppose my son out of the case  And since I have told you  more than once  that I cannot allow the sacredness young people are apt to imagine in a first Love  I must  you know  take it for granted  that even his to you is not absolutely unconquerable   Let us then consider a little the bright fairy schemes  for so I must call them  which you have formed in the Letter that lies before me  a   Do not your excellent grandmamma and aunt see them in the same light  I dare say they do  But to one I love so dearly  how can I omit to offer my hand to extricate her out of a maze of bewildering fancy  in which she may else tread many a weary step  that ought to be advancing forward in the paths of happiness and duty   Think but  my dear child  what fortitude of soul  what strength even of constitution  you answer for  when you talk of living happy in friendship with two persons  when they are united by indissoluble ties  the very thought of whose union makes your cheek fade  and your health languish  Ah  my beloved Harriet  is not this a fairy scheme   Mistake me not  my love  I suspect not that your sentiments would want any thing of the purity  the generosity  the true heroism required in the idea of a friendship  like that you talk of  I suspect not in the noble pair  Does that phrase hurt you  my Miss Byron  Think then how your heart would suffer in the lasting conflict that must accompany the situation which you have proposed to yourself  I suspect not  in either of them  sentiments or behaviour unsuitable to your excellence  Yet let
