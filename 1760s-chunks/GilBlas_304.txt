man of sanctity turns out to be   As I had not been able to complete my view of the city on the preceding day  I got up betimes in the morning with the intention of taking another walk  In the street I remarked a Carthusian friar  who doubtless was thus early in motion to promote the interests of his order  He walked with his eyes fixed on the ground  and a gait so holy and contemplative  as to inspire every passenger with religious awe  His path was in the same direction as mine  I looked at him with more than ordinary curiosity  and could not help fancying it was Don Raphael  that man of shifts and expedients  who has already secured so honourable a niche in the temple of fame   See Books I  to VI  of my Memoirs    I was so utterly astonished  so thrown off my balance by this meeting  that instead of accosting the monk  I remained motionless for some seconds  which gave him time to get the start of me  Just heaven  said I  were there ever two faces more exactly alike  I do not know what to make of it  It seems incredible that Raphael should turn up in such a guise  And yet how is it possible to be any one else  I felt too great a curiosity to get at the truth not to pursue the inquiry  Having ascertained the way to the monastery of the Carthusians  I repaired thither immediately  in the hope of coming across the object of my search on his return  and with the full intent of stopping and parleying with him  But it was quite unnecessary to wait for his arrival to enlighten my mind on the subject  on reaching the convent gate  another physiognomy  such as few persons had read without paying for their lesson  resolved all my doubts into certainty  for the friar who served in the capacity of porter was unquestionably my old and godly visaged servant  Ambrose de Lamela   Our surprise was equal on both sides at meeting again in such a place  Is not this a play upon the senses  said I  paying my compliments to him  Is it actually one of my friends who presents himself to my astonished sight  He did not know me again at first  or probably might pretend not to do so  but reflecting within himself that it was in vain to deny his own identity  he assumed the start of a man who all at once hits upon a circumstance which had hitherto escaped his recollection  Ah  Signor Gil Blas  exclaimed he  excuse my not recognizing your person immediately  Since I have lived in this holy place  every faculty of my soul has been absorbed in the performance of the duties prescribed by our rules  so that by degrees I lose the remembrance of all worldly objects and events   After a separation of ten years  said I  it gives me much pleasure to find you again in so venerable a garb  For my part  answered he  it fills me with shame and confusion to appear in it before a man who has been an eye witness of my guilty courses  These ghostly weeds are at once the charm of my present life  and the condemnation of my former  Alas  added he  heaving a righteous sigh  to be worthy of wearing it  my earlier years should have been passed in primitive innocence  By this discourse  so rational and edifying  replied I  it is plain  my dear brother  that the finger of the Lord has been upon you  that you are marked out for a vessel of sanctification  I tell you once again  I am delighted at it  and would give the world to know in what miraculous manner you and Raphael were led into the path of the righteous  for I am persuaded that it was his own self whom I met in the town  habited as a Carthusian  I was extremely sorry afterwards not to have stopped and spoken to him in the street  and I am waiting here to apologize for my neglect on his return   You were not mistaken  said Lamela  it was Don Raphael himself whom you saw  and as for the particulars of our conversion  they are as follow  After parting with you near Segorba  we struck into the Valencia road  with the design of bettering our trade by some new speculation  Chance or destiny one day led our steps into the church of the Carthusians  while service was performing in the choir  The demeanour of the brethren attracted our notice  and we experienced in our own persons the involuntary homage which vice pays to virtue  We admired the fervour with which they poured forth their devotions  their looks of pious mortification  their deadness to the pleasures of the world and the flesh  and in the settled composure of their countenances  the outward sign of an approving conscience within   While making these observations  we fell into a train of thought which became like manna to the hungry and thirsty soul  we compared our habits of life with the employments of these holy men  and the wide difference between our spiritual conditions filled us with confusion and affright  Lamela  said Don Raphael  as we went out of church  how do you
