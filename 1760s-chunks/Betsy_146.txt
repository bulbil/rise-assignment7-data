warning he had given her of the danger  it must be confessed    she had a right to think the provocation too slight to draw from him   such resentful expressions  much less to induce him to abandon her        Ungrateful man   said she  bursting into tears of mingled grief and   spite   to treat me thus  when I was just beginning to entertain the   kindest thoughts of him  When I was ready to acknowledge the error I was   guilty of  in not following his advice  and had resolved never to throw   myself into such inconveniences again   Tis plain he never loved me  or   he would not have taken so poor  so trifling  a pretence to break with   me        Thus  for some moments  did she bewail  as it were  the ill treatment   she thought she had received from him  Then looking over the letter   again   With what a magisterial air   cried she   with what an   affectation of superiority  does he conclude   With the most friendly   wishes  my humble servant   Good lack  friendly  Let him carry his   friendly wishes to those he may think will receive them as a favour        Upon revolving in her mind all the circumstances of her behaviour   towards Mr  Trueworth  she could find nothing  except what passed at his   last visit  that could give him any occasion of disgust  and even that   she looked upon as a very insufficient plea for that high resentment he   now expressed  much more for his resolving to throw off a passion he had   a thousand and a thousand times vowed should be as lasting as his life       The anonymous letter sent her by Miss Flora  some time since  now came   fresh into her head  that passage in it which insinuated that Mr    Trueworth had no real design of marrying her  that he but trifled with   her  and on the arrival of her brothers would find some pretence or   other to break entirely with her  seemed now to tally exactly with his   present manner of proceeding   The devil   said she   may sometimes   speak truth  Mr  Trueworth has but too well verified the words of that   malicious girl  and what she herself then thought a falsehood is now   confirmed by fact  yet  wherefore   cried she   did he take all this   pains  if he never loved me  never hoped any recompense for his   dissimulation  what end could he propose by practicing it  What   advantage  what pleasure  could it give him to affront the sister of his   friend  and impose upon the credulity of a woman he had no design upon     It would be endless to repeat the many contradictory surmizes which rose   alternately in her distracted mind  so I shall only say  she sought  but   the more she did so  the more she became incapable of fathoming  the   bottom of this mysterious event       The butler was laying the cloth in the parlour for supper when she came   home  Mr  Goodman had waited for her some time  thinking she might be   undressing  and now sent to desire she would come down  but she begged   to be excused  said she could not eat  and then called for Nanny  who   was the maid that usually attended her in her chamber  to come up and   put her to bed       This prating wench  who would always know the whole secrets of every   body in the family  whether they thought fit to entrust her with them or   not  used frequently to divert Miss Betsy with her idle stories  but it   was not now in her power  that young lady had no attention for any thing   but the object of her present meditations  which the other not happening   to hit upon  was answered only with peevishness and ill humour       But as every little circumstance  if any was adapted to the passion we   at that time are possessed of  touches upon the jarring string  and   seems a missionary from fate  an accident  the most trifling that can be   imagined  served to renew in Miss Betsy  the next morning  those   anxieties which sleep had in some measure abated       A ballad singer happening to be in the street  the first thing she   heard  on her waking  was these words  sung in a sonorous voice  just   under the window             Young Philander woo d me long        I was peevish  and forbade him        I would not
