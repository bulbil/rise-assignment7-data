 a flood of   316 tears  and that now she frequently wept  and lamented to her  What should she do  Her mamma did not love her  and her mamma talked against the Chevalier  She wished to be allowed to see him  Nobody now would love her but the Chevalier and Jeronymo  It would be better for her to be in England  or any where  that to be in the sweetest country in the world  and hated   Camilla told me  that the Marquis  the Count his brother  and the General  had indeed blamed the Marchioness for permitting the interview  but were pleased that I was refused taking leave of the young Lady  when she seemed disposed to dwell on the contents of the note she had made me sign  They seemed now all of a mind  she said  That were I to comply with their terms  the alliance would not  by any means  be a proper one  Their rank  their degree  their alliances  were dwelt upon  I found that their advantages  in all these respects  were heightened  my degree  my consequence  lowered  in order to make the difference greater  and the difficulties insuperable   Clementina s uncle  and his eldest son  both men of sense and honour  who used to be high in her esteem  had talked to her  but could get nothing from her but No  and Yes  Her father had talked to her alone  but they melted each other  and nothing resulted of comfort to either  Her mother joined him  but she threw herself at her mother s feet  besought her to forgive her  and not to chide her again  They had intended to discourage her from thinking of me upon any terms  The General and the Bishop were to talk to her that morning  They had expressed displeasure at Signor Jeronymo  for his continued warmth in my favour  Father Marescotti was now consulted as an oracle  And I found  that  by an indelicacy of thinking  he imagined  that the husband would set all right  and was for encouraging the Count of Belvedere  and getting me at distance     317 Camilla obligingly offered to acquaint me  from time to time  with what occurred  but I thought it was not right to accept of a servant s intelligence out of the family she belonged to  unless some one of it authorized her to give it me  Yet  you must believe  I wanted not anxious curiosity on a subject so interesting  I thanked her  but said  that it might  if discovered  lay her under inconveniencies which would grieve me for her sake  She had the good sense to approve of my declining her offer   In the morning of the same day  I had a visit made me which I little expected  It was from Father Marescotti  It is a common thing to load an enemy  especially if he be in Holy Orders  and comes to us in the guise of friendship  with the charge of hypocrisy  But partiality may be at the bottom of the accusation  Father Marescotti is a zealous Roman Catholic  I could not hope either for his interest  or affection  He could not but wish to frustrate my hopes  As a man in earnest in his own principles  and who knew how stedfast I was in mine  it was his duty to oppose this alliance  He is  perhaps  the honest man for knowing but little of human nature  and of the tender passions  As to that of Love  he seemed to have drawn his conclusions from general observations  He knew not how to allow for particular constitutions  nor to account for the delicacy of such a heart as Clementina s  He thought that Love was always a poor blind boy  led in a string  either by Folly  or Fancy  and that once the impetus got over  and the Lady settled into the common offices of life  she would domesticate herself  and be as happy with a Count of Belvedere  especially as he is a very worthy man  as if she had married the man once most favoured  On this presumption  it was a condescension  in such a man  to come to me  and to declare himself my friend  and advise me what to do for promoting the peace of a family which I professed to venerate  and   318 hear that his condescension was owing to a real greatness of mind   I was  from the moment of his entrance  very open  very frank  more so than he expected  as he owned  He told me  that he was afraid I had conceived prejudices against him  The kinder then in him  I said  that he condescended to make me so friendly a visit  I assured him  that I regarded him as a good man  I had indeed sometimes thought him severe  but that convinced me that he was very much in earnest in his religion  I was sensible  I said  that we ought always to look to the intention  To put ourselves in the situation of the persons of whose actions we presumed to judge  and even to think well of austerities  which had their foundation in virtue
