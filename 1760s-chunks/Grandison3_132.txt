 could have been so firm  But these thoughts are all over—This  however  exposes me to the more reproaches   We were high  and my mother and uncle came in to mediate between us   I would not  I could not  renounce my friend  the friend of my soul  as in our first acquaintance  and the preserver of my life —Miserable as that has been  the preserver of it  at a time when I was engaged in an unlawful pursuit  in which I had perished  what might I have now been  and where   I ventured to give my opinion in favour of my sister s marriage with you  as the only method that could be taken to restore her  who  I said  loved you because you were a virtuous man  and that her Love was not only founded in virtue  but was Virtue itself   My brother told me  that I was as much beside myself with my notions of gratitude  as my sister was with a passion less excusable   I bid him forbear wounding a wounded man   Thus high  ran words between u•   The Bishop  mean time  went on with a true Church subtlety  to get out of the innocent girl her whole mind   He boasted afterwards of his art  But what was   329 there in it to boast of  A mind so pure and so simple as Clementina s ever was  and which only the pride of her Sex  and motives of Religion  had perhaps hindered her from declaring to all the world   He asked her  If she was willing to leave her father  mother  brothers  and country  to go to a strange land  to live among a hated People   No  she said  you would not wish her to go out of Italy  You would live nine months out of twelve in Italy   He told her  That she must  when married  do as her husband would have her   She could trust to your honour   Would she consent that her children should be trained up Heretics   She was silent to this question  He repeated it   Well  my Lord  if I must not be allowed to choose for myself  only let me not hear the Chevalier spoken of disrespectfully  He does not deserve it  He has acted by me with as much honour  as he did by my brother  He is an uniformly good man  and as generous as good—And don t let me have other proposals made me  and I will be contented  I had never so much distinguished him  if every body had not as well as I   He was pleased to find her answers so rational  He pronounced her quite well  and gave it as his opinion that you should be desired to quit Bologna  And your absence  and a little time  he was sure  would secure her health of mind   But when her aunt Sforza and her cousin Laurana talked with her next morning  they found her  on putting questions about you  absolutely determined in your favour   She answered the objections they made against you  with equal warmth and clearness  She seemed sensible of the unhappy way she had been in  and would have it  that the last interview she had with you  had   330 helped to calm and restore her  And she hoped that she should be better every day  She praised your behaviour to her  She expatiated upon  and pitied  your distress of mind   They let her run on till they too had obtained from her a confirmation of all that the Bishop had reported  and  upon repeating the conversation  would have it  upon experience  that soothing such a passion was not the way to be taken  but that a high hand was to be used  and that she was to be shamed out of a Love so improper  so irreligious  so scandalous  to be encouraged in a daughter of their house with an Heretic  and who had shewn himself to be a determined one   They accordingly entered upon their new measures  They forbad her to think of you  They told her  That she should not upon any terms be yours  not now  even if you would change your religion for her  They depreciated your family  your fortune  and even your understanding  and brought to prove what they said against the latter▪ your obstinate adherence to your mushroom religion  so they called it  a religion that was founded in the wickedness of your VIIIth Henry  in the superstition of a child his successor  and in the arts of a vile woman who had martyred a Sister Queen  a better woman than herself  They insisted upon her encouraging the Count of Belvedere s addresses  as a mark of her obedience   They condemned  in terms wounding to her modesty  her passion for a foreigner  an enemy to her saith  and on her earnest request to see her father  he was prevailed upon to refuse her that favour   Lady Juliana Sforza and her daughter Laurana  the companion of her better hours  never see her  but they inveigh against you as an artful  an interested
