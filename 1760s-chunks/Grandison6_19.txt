my Lucy  he shall not have her  He is not worthy of her   The friendship and favour of Lady W  is one of the great felicities which seem to offer to bless my future lot   Mr  Greville is the most persevering  as well as most audacious of men  As other men endeavour to gain a woman s affections by politeness  he makes pride  ill nature  and impetuosity  the proofs of his Love    47 and thinks himself ill used  especially since his large acquisition of fortune  that they are not accepted as such  He has obliged Mr  Deane to hear his pleas  and presumed to hope for his favour  Mr  Deane frankly told him  that his interest lay quite another way  He then insolently threatened with destruction  the man  be he who he will  that shall stand in his way  He doubts not  he says  but Sir Charles Grandison is the man designed  But if so cool a Lover is to be encouraged against so servent a one as himself  he is mistaken in all his notions of womens conduct and judgments in Love matters  A discrect Lover  he says  is an unnatural character  Women  the odious wretch says  love to be devoured  Is he not an odious wretch   and if Miss Byron can content herself with another woman s leavings  for that  he says  he is well informed is the case  he knows what he shall think of her spirit  And then he threw out  as usual  reflections on our Sex  which had malice in them   This man s threats disturb me  God grant that your brother may not meet with any more embarrasments from insolent men  on my account   If these men  this Greville in particular  would let me be at peace  I should be better  I believe  in my health  But Lady Frampton is his advocate  by Letter  He watches my footsteps  and  in every visit I make  throws himself in the way  And on Sundays he is always ready with his officious hand  as I alight to enter the church  and to lead me back to my uncle s coach  My uncle cannot affront him  because he will not be affronted by him  He rallies off  with an intrepidity that never was exceeded  all that my aunt says to him  I repulse him with anger everywhere but in a place so public  and so sacred  He disturbs my devotion  with his staring eyes  always fixed on our pew  which draw every one s after them  He has the assurance  when he intrudes himself into my company  to laugh off my anger  telling me    48 that it is what he has long wished for  and that now he is so much used to it  that he can live on my frowns  and cannot support life without them  He plainly tells me  that Mr  Fenwick s arrival from abroad  and another certain person s also  are the occasion of his resumed sedulity   Every body about us  in short  is interested for or against him  He makes me appear coy and ridiculous  He—But no more of this bold man  Would to Heaven that some one of those who like such  would relieve me from him   Visiters  and the post  oblige me  sooner than I otherwise should  to conclude myself  my dear Lady G   Ever Yours  HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XIII  Mr  DEANE  To Sir CHARLES GRANDISON    Selby house  Tuesday  Oct  3   AN alliance more acceptable  were it with a prince  could not be proposed  than that which Sir Charles Grandison  in a manner so worthy of himself  has proposed with a family who have thought themselves under obligation to him  ever since he delivered the darling of it from the lawless attempts of a savage Libertine  I know to whom I write  and will own  that it has been my wish  in a most particular manner   As to the surviving part of the family  exclusive of Miss Byron  for I will mention her parents by and by  it is  in all its branches  worthy  Indeed  Sir  your wish of a relation to them  is not a discredit to your high character  As to the young Lady—I say nothing of her—Yet how shall I forbear—O Sir  believe me  she will dignify your choice  Her duty   49 and her inclination through every relation of life  were never divided   Excuse me  Sir—No parent was ever more fond of his child than I have been  from her infancy  of this my daughter by adoption  Hence  Sir  being consulted on this occasion  as my affection I will say for the whole family deserves  I take upon me to acquaint you  before any further steps are taken  what our dear child s fortune will be  For it has been always my notion  that a young gentleman  in such a case  should  the moment he offers himself  if his own proposals are acceptable  be spared the indelicacy of asking questions as to fortune  We know
