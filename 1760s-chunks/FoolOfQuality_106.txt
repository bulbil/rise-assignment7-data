to undertake our cause  which is by   much the more reasonable and orderly side of the argument   in   short  we want you to refute your own papers      O  my lord   I answered  I should think it an honour to serve   your lordship or the ministry on any other occasion  But in a   matter that must bring public infamy upon me  indeed  my lord    you must excuse me  I should be pointed at  as an apostate and   prostitute  by all men  and bring my person and writings into   such disgrace  as would for ever disable me from serving either   myself or your lordship      Well  sir  replied my lord  I will not then insist on a formal   refutation of your own writings  I only ask  if you are willing to   engage in our quarrel  as far as is consistent with honour and truth    I am  my lord  I rejoined  as far as is consistent with my own   credit and the good of my country      The good of your country  Mr  Clement   says my lord  I hope   you do not think that government is contrary to the good of your   country  Pray  in what do you make this LIBERTY consist  of   which you are become so eminent a patron      There are two sorts of LIBEKTY  my lord  I answered  the first   constitutes the duty and happiness of a man  independent of com    munity   the second constitutes the privilege and happiness of a man    merely as he is a member of any state or commonwealth      Independent of community  a man is so far free  and no further    than he acts up to the dictates of reason and duty  in despite of   inward appetite and outward influence          88 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      As a member of community  a man is so far free  and no further    than as every other member of that community is legally restrained   from injuring his person  or encroaching on his property      Inimitably well defined   cried his lordship  I have read volumes    in folio  upon the subject  but never knew what LIBEBTY was   before  Well  Mr  Clement  as this LIBERTY of yours is  in all   respects  so opposite to the licentiousness I was talking of  it cannot   but make mainly in favour of good government  I therefore   request you to write a treatise to the purpose of your definition     and to take us with you  as far as you can  We shall not be un    grateful   we are good paymasters  sir  Why do you hesitate   Did   you not tell me you were disposed to serve us       My lord  I replied  I fear I should fall greatly short of your   expectations  I am not studied in the constitution of modern states     and how shall I be able to justify any government with respect to   measures that  perhaps  are a secret to all except the ministers    I must further observe to your lordship  that my former field would   be greatly contracted on this occasion  It is very easy and obvious   to find fault and to call in question   but to vindicate truth itself   against popular prejudice  hoe opus  Me labor est      Mr  Clement  says my lord  I am proud that we have got a gen    tleman of so much honesty and ingenuity to befriend us  It shall   be my care to provide you with materials  and I am confident that   so great a master of his instrument as you are  will make excellent   music on a few fundamental notes  Here are twenty guineas   earnest  and ten guineas shall be paid you weekly  till we can fix   you in some station of due honour and advantage  I will take a   glass or a dish of tea with you in a few days  and I wish you a   good evening      On the third morning after this interview  my lord returned   with a large bundle of antipatria pamphlets in his chariot  and   some manuscript notes and hints for my instruction  He break    fasted with us  and was easy  polite  and cheerful      I now entered on my new province  but not with usual ardour    As I had formerly lashed the insolence  encroachments  and rapa    ciousness of power  less ambitious of conquest over aliens and   enemies  than over the very people it was ordained to protect   I   now  on the
