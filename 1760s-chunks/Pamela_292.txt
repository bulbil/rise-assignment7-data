noble stand you have made to preserve your virtue  and the steps by   which his pride was subdued  and his mind induced to honourable love    till you were made what you now are  for it must be a rare and uncommon   story  and will not only give me great pleasure in reading  but will   entirely reconcile me to the step he has taken  and that  let me tell   you  is what I never thought to be  for I had gone a great way in   bringing about a match with him and Lady Betty    and had said so much   of it  that the earl  her father  approved of it  and so did the Duke of         her uncle  and Lady Betty herself was not averse  and now I shall   be hunted to death about it  and this has made me so outrageous as you   have seen me upon the matter  But when I can find  by your writings    that your virtue is but suitably rewarded  it will be not only a good   excuse for me  but for him  and make me love you  There is nothing that   I would not do  said I  to oblige your ladyship  but my poor father and   mother  who would rather have seen me buried quick in the earth  than   to be seduced by the greatest of princes  have them in their hands at   present  and your dear brother has bespoken them  when they have done   reading them  but  if he gives me leave  I will shew them to your   ladyship  with all my heart  not doubting your generous allowances  as   I have had his  though I have treated him very freely all the way  while   he had naughty views  and that your ladyship would consider them as   the naked sentiments of my heart  from time to time delivered to those    whose indulgence I was sure of  and for whose sight only they were   written       Give me a kiss now  said her ladyship  for your cheerful compliance  for   I make no doubt my brother will consent I shall see them  because they   must needs make for your honour  and I see he loves you better than any   one in the world       I have heard  continued her ladyship  a mighty good character of your   parents  as industrious  honest  sensible  good folks  who know the   world  and  as I doubt not my brother s generosity  I am glad they will   make no ill figure in the world s eye       Madam  said I  they are the honestest  the lovingest  and the most   conscientious couple breathing  They once lived creditably  and brought   up a great family  of which I am the youngest  but had misfortunes    through their doing beyond their power for two unhappy brothers  who are   both dead  and whose debts they stood bound for  and so became reduced    and  by harsh creditors   where most of the debts were  not of their own   contracting   turned out of all  and having  without success  tried to   set up a little country school   for my father understood a little of   accounts  and wrote a pretty good hand   forced to take to hard labour    but honest all the time  contented  never repining  and loving to one   another  and  in the midst of their poverty and disappointments  above   all temptation  and all their fear was  that I should be wicked  and   yield to temptation for the sake of worldly riches and to God s grace    and their good lessons  and those I imbibed from my dear good lady    your ladyship s mother  it is that I owe the preservation of my   innocence   and the happy station I am exalted to       She was pleased to kiss me again  and said  There is such a noble   simplicity in thy story  such an honest artlessness in thy mind  and   such a sweet humility in thy deportment  notwithstanding thy present   station  that I believe I shall be forced to love thee  whether I will   or not  and the sight of your papers  I dare say  will crown the work    will disarm my pride  banish my resentment on Lady Betty s account  and   justify my brother s conduct  and  at the same time  redound to your own   everlasting honour  as well as to the credit of our sex  and so I make   no doubt but my brother will let me see them       Worden  said my lady  I can say any thing before you  and
