he enjoyed life without abridging it by intemperance  and though his desires when young were very prevalent  he called in the assistance of the rational to check the wild sallies of the animal  Hence he long reigned ths favourite of the women and envy of the men  till he gradually sunk into years  and continued lively in disposition  though feeble in body  at the age of seventy two  He loved  however  in   45 his gayer hours to bill a little  and wisely considering that his company could not be very agreeable to sportive youth  generously compensated their trouble  which rendered him a desirable acquaintance to female town adventurers   Lord R—hf—d was robust at the age of sixty  and capable of enjoying the caresses of a female charmer  His greatest pleasure was to sacrifice to Venus  nor did he stick at any expence  to obtain a first rate beauty  who  when in his possession  could mould him as she pleased  being extremely pliant in a female hand  though in other respects stern and resolute   These are the characters to whom Miss ELLIOT  according to Jack s promise  was introduced  as company most adapted to answer her lucrative views  Not to dwell on the disgusting theme of what passed between the enamoured dotards and the artful courtezan  it will suffice to remark  that as she was engaged by prior contract to Sir Thomas S—  she spent the evening in company with the debilitated fake  mortified the whole time    46 with his nauseous talk  and more insupportable behaviour   Nor did Sir Thomas s engrossing her till next morning cool the passion which Lord R—hf—d had conceived for her  he sent for her the following evening to the same place  and having regaled her with a very elegant supper  passed the night with her in abundant delight  insomuch that he took her into keeping  presented her with an immoderate quantity of rich cloaths  and valuable jewels  so that few women appeared in public more elegantly dressed  nor was the taste of any woman more applauded or imitated   This lucky incident enabled her to supply Mr  C—ke with more than he could reasonably demand  and the connexion between them was very artfully preserved  for Miss ELLIOT  too wise to trust any servant with that  the knowledge of which always rendered them insolent  as it gives them a power to injure a mistress in the most essential concern  carried on her intrigues by means of Jack  who conveyed her letters to Mr  C—rke  and   47 thereby obviated all possibility of detection   As she reaped great advantages from this connexion  she made Lord R—hf—d s will her pleasure  and studied by every endearing instance of behaviour to improve the esteem he had conceived for her   This conduct greatly redounded to her interest  for Lord R—hf—d  grateful in disposition  and profusely generous in love  was daily loading her with presents  insomuch  that notwithstanding her disbursements to Mr  C—rke  whom she now maintained in splendor  she amassed a very considerable sum   Thus she passed about six months with Lord R—hf—d  till an imprudent step occasioned a separation  His lordship went out of town  with intention  as was supposed  to stay a month  He had determined to leave his charmer in London  lest she should attract the notice of some other gentlemen younger than himself  and thereby endanger his loss of what he deemed an invaluable possession     48As things were in this situation  and there was hardly cause for suspicion of detection  our heroine ventured to Vauxhall with Mr  C—rke  but ill luck brought Lord R—hf—d there also  One of the very first objects that presented itself to his lordship  amidst so great a variety  was his mistress téte a téte with Mr  C—rke  using such freedoms as were far from being agreeable  and gave him no little cause of uneasiness  as they did her of future repentance   This unlucky accident struck both Miss ELLIOT and her favourite with amazement and confusion  they therefore immediately retired from the gardens  in order to consult on the most probable means of averting Lord R—hf—d s resentment  After much deliberation it was agreed  that she should hasten home  and anticipate his reproof  by assuring him of the continuance of her esteem and veneration for him  and desiring that the late circumstance might not be construed as any deviation from the duty she owed him  as she was only in company with a first cousin  who   49 had insisted on attending her to Vauxhall   Miss ELLIOT  pursant To this resolution  made all the haste she could home  and upon his lordship s arrival  notwithstanding his stern contracted brow  thus addressed him    My dear Lord  if your countenance be the index of your mind  something hath much displeased you  I trust it is not owing to any suspicion of my being defective either in duty or love  If it is  permit me to assure you  that I retain the esteem and veneration for you I have always professed  and that all jealousy on account of seeing me at the gardens is groundless  as I was then in company with a first cousin  a married man  and person whom I never considered in any
