 and granted his  request  at once overcame the disapprobation of the misanthrope  who   with a relaxation in his countenance  which had never been perceived  before that instant  thanked her in the most polite terms for such  an agreeable mark of distinction  He accordingly led her to the  dining room  where the ceremony was performed without delay  and after  the husband had asserted his prerogative on her lips  the whole company  saluted her by the name of Mrs  Pickle   I shall leave the sensible reader to judge what passed at this juncture  within the bosoms of the new married couple  Peregrine s heart was fired  with inexpressible ardour and impatience  while the transports of the  bride were mingled with a dash of diffidence and apprehension  Gauntlet  saw it would be too much for both to bear their present tantalizing  situation till night  without some amusement to divert their thoughts   and therefore proposed to pass part of the evening at the public  entertainments in Marylebone gardens  which were at that time frequented  by the best company in town  The scheme was relished by the discreet  Sophy  who saw the meaning of the proposal  and the bride submitted  to the persuasion of her sister  so that  after tea  two coaches were  called  and Peregrine was forcibly separated from his charmer during the  conveyance   The new married couple and their company having made shift to spend  the evening  and supped on a slight collation in one of the boxes   Peregrine s patience was almost quite exhausted  and taking Godfrey  aside  he imparted his intention to withdraw in private from the sea wit  of his friend Hatchway  who would otherwise retard his bliss with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   unseasonable impediments  which  at present  he could not possibly bear   Gauntlet  who sympathized with his impatience  undertook to intoxicate  the lieutenant with bumpers to the joy of the bride  and  in the  meantime  desired Sophy to retire with his sister  under the auspices of  Cadwallader  who promised to squire them home   The ladies were accordingly conducted to the coach  and Jack proposed  to the captain  that  for the sake of the joke  the bridegroom should  be plied with liquor  in such a manner as would effectually disable him  from enjoying the fruits of his good fortune for one night at least   Gauntlet seemed to relish the scheme  and they prevailed upon Pickle to  accompany them to a certain tavern  on pretence of drinking a farewell  glass to a single life  there the bottle was circulated  till Hatchway s  brain began to suffer innovation  As he had secured our hero s hat and  sword  he felt no apprehension of an elopement  which  however  was  effected  and the youth hastened on the wings of love to the arms of his  enchanting bride  He found Crabtree in a parlour waiting for his return   and disposed to entertain him with a lecture upon temperance  to which  he paid very little attention  but ringing for Emilia s maid  desired to  know if her mistress was in bed  Being answered in the affirmative  he  sent her up stairs to announce his arrival  undressed himself to a loose  gown and slippers  and  wishing the misanthrope good night  after having  desired to see him next day  followed in person to the delicious  scene  where he found her elegantly dished out  the fairest daughter of  chastity and love   When he approached  she was overwhelmed with confusion  and hid her  lovely face from his transporting view  Mrs  Gauntlet  seeing his eyes  kindled at the occasion  kissed her charming sister  who  throwing her  snowy arms about her neck  would have detained her in the room  had  not Peregrine gently disengaged her confidante from her embrace   and conducted her trembling to the door  which having bolted and  barricadoed  he profited by his good fortune  and his felicity was  perfect   Next day he rose about noon  and found his three friends assembled  when  he learned that Jack had fallen in his own snare  and been obliged to  lie in the same tavern where he fell  a circumstance of which he was so  much ashamed  that Peregrine and his wife escaped many jokes  which he  would have certainly cracked  had he not lain under the imputation of  this disgrace  In half an hour after he came down  Mrs  Pickle appeared  with Sophy  blushing like Aurora or the goddess of health  and sending  forth emanations of beauty unparalleled  She was complimented upon her  change of situation by all present  and by none more warmly than by  old Crabtree  who declared himself so well satisfied with his friend s  fortune  as to be almost reconciled to that institution  against which  he had declaimed during the best part of his life   An express was immediately despatched to Mrs  Gauntlet  with an account  of her daughter s marriage  a town house was hired  and a handsome
