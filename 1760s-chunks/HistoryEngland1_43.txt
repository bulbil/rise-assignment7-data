began his reign by reducing them to the most distressful circumstances  and once more brought them to acknowledge his sovereignty over their crown  But he was soon drawn off from these conquests to objects of greater victories  a new scene began to be opened in France  and Europe  in suspense  began to doubt whether Edward s claims to that kingdom were secured to him by right of inheritance  or by the rights of conquest  France  at that time  was by no means so extensive as at present  it comprehended neither Dauphine  nor Provence  nor Franche Comte  It was rendered still more feeble  from the nature of its government  several powerful neighbours  who pretended to be vassals of that crown  rather served to weaken than strengthen the monarchy   The people of that kingdom were unhappy  from their mutual divisions  and the King  at that time  was still more so  The three sons of Philip the Fair  in full parliament  accused their wives of adultery  they were each condemned  and ordered to be imprisoned for life  Lewis Huttin  the eldest son  caused his wife to be strangled  her lovers died by a new kind of punishment  they were flead alive   After the death of Lewis Huttin  King of France  a question arose about the validity of the Salic law  a law made in the early period of French Monarchy  importing  that no woman should rule  As this is a subject of some importance in the English history  it is necessary to expatiate here a little    127 they had hitherto never inquired  in France  whether a female could succeed in the kingdom  Laws are only made to regulate what may happen by what has happened already  and  as an instance of this kind had never occurred  there were no laws to direct them  Precedents  in lesser instances  were the only guides in such a circumstance  but these precedents had varied with the occasion  The parliament of France had often adjudged the succession to women  as Artois was formerly given to a female in prejudice of the male heir  The succession of Champagne had been  on some occasions  given to the daughters  and  on others  they were held unqualified to succeed  We thus see that right changed with power  and justice  in such a case  was either unknown or disregarded   Lewis Huttin left an only daughter  and two brothers  the elder  Philip the Tall  assumed the crown  in prejudice of Huttin s daughter  and attempted to cover his usurpation by the Salic law  The younger brother  Charles the Fair  jealous of his elder brother s fortune  opposed his pretensions  and asserted the daughter s right to succeed  This cause was carried before the French parliament  and decided in favour of Philip  This Monarch enjoyed the crown but a short time  and  dying  left only daughters to succeed him  Charles the Fair  however  was now of a different sentiment from what he had been formerly  he now maintained the law for the exclusion of females  because it made in his favour  He seized the crown without opposition  and enjoyed it for some time  but  dying  left his wife with child  As there was now no apparent heir  the next heir to the crown was to be regent  and two persons asserted their claim upon this occasion  Edward III    128 laid his claim  as being  by his mother Isabella  who was daughter of Philip the Fair  and sister to the three last Kings of France  rightful heir to the crown  Philip Valois  on the other hand  had seized upon it  as being the next heir by the male succession  The claims of Philip were preferred  he was constituted regent of France  and  the Queen being unfortunately brought to bed of a daughter  he was unanimously elected King  He was crowned by his subjects with universal satisfaction  had the appellation of Philip the Fortunate given him  and to this he added those which might merit good fortune  virtue and justice  Among other instances of his felicity  he might reckon that of the homage paid him by Edward  his rival  which he came to offer at Amiens  however  this homage was soon followed by a war  and Edward disputed that crown  of which he had just before declared himself the vassal   A brewer at Ghent was one of those who gave the greatest assistance to Edward in this war  and determined him to assume the title of King of France  This citizen s name was James Ardevet  grown too powerful for a subject  and one of those  according to Machiavel  whom Kings ought to flatter or destroy  Thus assisted  Edward made a powerful invasion  upon landing  he was challenged by Philip to try their fortune upon equal terms  in some appointed plain  Edward accepted the challenge  for in every action this Prince affected the hero  but  some obstacles intervening  the war was prosecuted in the usual manner  by taking every advantage where it happened to offer   In these battles there are little materials for instruction  nor can they afford any thing more entertaining  than the history of
