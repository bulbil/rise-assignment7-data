light    and attributed to cowardice what was really the effect of courage      You seem surprised at my saying that his declining to fight was   the effect of courage  but reflect a moment  and you will see that   it is the motive of fighting  and not the mere fighting  that constitutes   true ooui age   and that the fashionable courage of venturing life   for punctilios of imaginary honour is real cowardice  as it proceeds   solely from fear of the false censure of the world  and therefore    that to brave that censure in such oases is the highest courage    I would not be imderstood by this to declare absolutely against   a man s fighting in his own cause  in all cases indiscriminately    Different circumstances make an essential difference in things which   superficially appear to be alike  A man s venturing his life  as I   have said  in vindicating empty punotihos of imaginary honour    or in support of injustice  is the highest and most ungratefiil insult   to the author of that life  who has made the preservation of it the   first principle of action  and conseqiiently an indispensable duty    when it can be preserved  without violation of those greater duties   wliich he has thought proper to prescribe        i e  the Scots  against whom the Norili Briton was primarily directed        Captain Forbes  a Scot in the French service  who challenged Wilkes   in the streets of Paris  for having attacked his country in the North   Briton   The French government putting them on parole not to fight   in that country  Wilkes offered to fight this bravo in Asia  Africa    America  or any other country in Europe  Forbes followed his enemy to   LoD don  but received a hint from the government that he had better leave   the country  He afterwards became a general in the Portuguese army          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 483     But  as there are other things more valuable than life  because   without them life would lose its value  reason  which is the voice   of Heaven  permits to hazard the lesser good for the preservation   of the greater  and this is the justification of war between different   states  To prevent the evils  which such a recourse between in    dividuals in the same state must be attended with  laws are established   to preserve those rights and redress injuries which they may offer   to each other   to these laws  therefore  it is an indispensable duty   to recur for such redress and preservation  where they are able to   effect them  but this duty does not seem to extend so far as ab    solutely and indiscriminately to preclude the other method of a man s   striving at the hazard of his life to effect them himself  when   the laws cannot do it  as is too often the case  it being impossible   for human wisdom to make provision for every occurrence  which   in the complication and extensiveness of human action may require   it  An opinion so contrary to that professed by all who have under    taken to discuss this subject  however consonant to the sense of   mankind in general  as shown in their practice  should be supported   by the plainest and most convincing reasons      A good name is the immediate jewel of the soul   it is the first   fruit and the reward of virtue   the preservation of it  therefore  is   indisputably worth hazarding life for  where the laws have not   sufficiently provided for its defence  as is the case in many of the   most delicate and tender points  If a man  for instance  is un    justly accused of a fact that ruins his good name  at the same time   that the accusation comes not within the reach of any law  from   which he may receive redress  can reason say that he is not justifiable   in striving for that redress himself  and vindicating his good name    at the hazard of his life  when that life would be only misery without   it   But here another difficulty occurs  Shall a man  it is said    put himself on a level with his injurer  and risk a second injury    in seeking satisfaction for the first   This certainly is an evil  but   must be submitted to  to prevent a greater      If a man were permitted to redress himself absolutely  without   such a risk  the consequence would be that partiality to himself   would make him think everything that should displease him an   injury sufficient to merit such a redress  whereby mm ders would   be multiplied to the reproach of humanity  and ruin of the state
