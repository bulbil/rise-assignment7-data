 setting a lovely   example       My good father performed his part with great applause  making the   responses  as if he had been a practised parish clerk  and giving the   xxiiid psalm            The Lord is only my support           And he that doth me feed         How can I then lack any thing          Whereof I stand in need         In pastures green he feedeth me           Where I do safely lie         And after leads me to the streams           Which run most pleasantly            And when I find myself near lost           Then home he doth me take         Conducting me in his right paths           E en for his own name s sake         And tho  I were e en at death s door           Yet would I fear no ill         For both thy rod and shepherd s crook          Afford me comfort still            Thou hast my table richly spread          In presence of my foe         Thou hast my head with balm refresh d           My cup doth overflow         And finally  while breath doth last           Thy grace shall me defend         And in the house of God will I          My life for ever spend        which consisted of but three staves  we had it all  and he read the   line  and began the tune with a heart so entirely affected with the   duty  that he went through it distinctly  calmly  and fervently at the   same time  so that Lady Jones whispered me  That good man were fit for   all companies  and present to every laudable occasion  And Miss Darnford   said  God bless the dear good man   You must think how I rejoiced in my   mind       I know  my dear mother  you can say most of the shortest psalms by   heart  so I need not transcribe it  especially as your chief treasure is   a bible  and a worthy treasure it is  I know nobody makes more or better   use of it       Mr  Williams gave us an excellent discourse on liberality and   generosity  and the blessings attending the right use of riches  from   the xith chapter of Proverbs  ver  24  25  There is that scattereth  and   yet increaseth  and there is that withholdeth more than is meet  but   it tendeth to poverty  The liberal soul shall be made fat  And he that   watereth  shall be watered also himself  And he treated the subject   in so handsome a manner  that my master s delicacy  who  at first  was   afraid of some personal compliments  was not offended  Mr  Williams   judiciously keeping to generals  and it was an elegant and sensible   discourse  as my master said       My father was in the clerk s place  just under the desk  and Lady Jones    by her footman  whispered him to favour us with another psalm  when the   sermon was ended  He thinking  as he said afterwards  that the former   was rather of the longest  chose the shortest in the book  which you   know is the cxviith            O all ye nations of the world           Praise ye the Lord always         And all ye people every where          Set forth his noble praise            For great his kindness is to us           His truth doth not decay         Wherefore praise ye the Lord our God           Praise ye the Lord alway        My master thanked Mr  Williams for his excellent discourse  and so did   the ladies  as also did I most heartily  and he was pleased to take my   dear father by
