 we shall see them as thick as brass nails in a sedan chair  And then we are all to walk so majestically thus  this foot always behind the foot before  The ladies are to fling nosegays  the court poets to scatter verses  the spectators are to be all in full dress  Mrs  Tibbs  in a new sacque  ruffles  and frenched hair  look where you will  one thing finer than another  Mrs  Tibbs curtesies to the Duchess  her Grace returns the compliment with a bow  Largess  cries the Herald  Make room cries the Gentleman Usher  Knock him down  cries the guard    160 Ah  continued he  amazed at his own description  what an astonishing scene of grandeur can art produce from the smallest circumstance  when it thus actually turns to wonder one man putting on another man s hat    I now found his mind was entirely set upon the fopperies of the ant  and quite regardless of the real meaning of such costly preparations  Pageants  says Bacon  are pretty things  but we should rather study to make them elegant than expensive  Processions  cavalcades  and all that fund of gay frippery  furnished out by taylors  barbers  and tire women  mechanically influence the mind into veneration  an Emperor  in his night cap  would not meet with half the respect of an Emperor with a glittering crown  Politics resemble religion  attempting to divest either of ceremony  is the most certain method of bringing either into contempt  The weak must have their inducements to admiration as well as the wise  and it is the business of a sensible government to impress all ranks with a sense of subordination  whether this be effected by a diamond buckle  or a virtuous edict  a sumptuary law  or a glass necklace   This interval of reflection only gave my companion spirits to begin his description afresh  and as a greater inducement to raise my curiosity  he informed me of the vast sums that were given by the spectators for places   That the ceremony must be fine  cries he  is very evident from the fine price that is paid for seeing it  Several ladies have assured me  they could willingly part with one eye  rather than be prevented from looking on with the other  Come  come  continues he  I have a friend    161 who  for my sake  will supply us with places at the most reasonable rates  I ll take care you shall not be imposed upon  and he will inform you of the use  finery  rapture  splendour  and enchantment of the whole ceremony better than I    Follies often repeated lose their absurdity  and assume the appearance of reason  his arguments were so often and so strongly enforced  that I had actually some thoughts of becoming a spectator  We accordingly went together to bespeak a place  but guess my surprise  when the man demanded a purse of gold for a single seat  I could hardly believe him serious upon making the demand   Prithee  friend  cried I  after I have paid twenty pounds for sitting here an hour or two  can I bring a part of the Coronation back   No  Sir   How long can I live upon it after I have come away   Not long  Sir   Can a Coronation cloath  feed  or fatten me   Sir  replied the man  you seem to be under a mistake  all that you can bring away is the pleasure of having it to say  that you saw the Coronation   Blast me  cries Tibbs  if that be all  there s no need of paying for that  since I am resolved to have that pleasure  whether I am there or no    I am conscious  my friend  that this is but a very confused description of the intended ceremony  You may object  that I neither settle rank  precedency  nor place  that I seem ignorant whether Gules walks before or behind Garter  that I have neither mentioned the dimensions of a Lord s cap  nor measured the length of a Lady s tail  I know your delight is in minute description  and this I am unhappily disqualified from furnishing  yet    162 upon the whole  I fancy it will be no way comparable to the magnificence of our late Emperor Whangti s procession  when he was married to the moon  at which Fum Hoam himself presided in person  Adieu   LETTER CIII  To the same   IT was formerly the custom here  when men of distinction died  for their surviving acquaintance to throw each a slight present into the grave  Several things of little value were made use of for that purpose  perfumes  reliques  spices  bitter herbs  camomile  wormwood  and verses  This custom however is almost discontinued  and nothing but verses alone are now lavished on such occasions  an oblation which they suppose may be interred with the dead  without any injury to the living   Upon the death of the great therefore  the poets and undertakers are sure of employment  While one provides the long cloak  black staff  and mourning coach  the other produces the pastoral or elegy
