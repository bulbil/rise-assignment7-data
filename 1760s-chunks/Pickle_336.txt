assembly  a deputation of the most  judicious members being sent weekly to each theatre  with a view of  making remarks upon the performance of the actors  The censors for the  preceding week were accordingly called upon to give in their report  and  the play which they had reviewed was  the Revenge     Mr  Q     said the second censor   take him all in all  is certainly  the most complete and unblemished performer that ever appeared on our  stage  notwithstanding the blind adoration which is paid to his rival   I went two nights ago  with an express design to criticise his action  I  could find no room for censure  but infinite subject for admiration  and applause  In Pierre he is great  in Othello excellent  but in Zanga  beyond all imitation  Over and above the distinctness of pronunciation     6 22 15  3 45 PM   the dignity of attitude  and expression of face  his gestures are so  just and significant  that a man  though utterly bereft of the sense of  hearing  might  by seeing him only  understand the meaning of every word  he speaks  Sure nothing can be more exquisite than his manner of telling  Isabella how Alonzo behaved  when he found the incendiary letter  which he had dropped by the Moor s direction  and when  to crown his  vengeance  he discovers himself to be the contriver of all the mischief  that had happened  he manifests a perfect masterpiece of action  in  pronouncing these four little monosyllables   Know  then   twas  I     Peregrine having eyed the critic some minutes   I fancy   said he    your praise must be ironical  because  in the very two situations you  mention  I think I have seen that player outherod Herod  or  in other  words  exceed all his other extravagances  The intention of the author  is  that the Moor should communicate to his confidant a piece of  information contained in a few lines  which  doubtless  ought to  be repeated with an air of eagerness and satisfaction  not with the  ridiculous grimace of a monkey  to which  methought  his action bore an  intimate resemblance  in uttering this plain sentence              He took it up        But scarce was it unfolded to his sight        When he  as if an arrow pierc d his eye        Started  and trembling dropp d it on the ground    In pronouncing the first two words  this egregious actor stoops down   and seems to take up something from the stage  then proceeding to repeat  what follows  mimics the manner of unfolding a letter  when he mentions  the simile of an arrow piercing the eye  he darts his forefinger towards  that organ  then recoils with great violence when the word  started  is  expressed  and when he comes to  trembling dropp d it on the ground   he  throws all his limbs into a tremulous motion  and shakes the imaginary  paper from his hand  The latter part of the description is carried on  with the same minute gesticulation  while he says          Pale and aghast awhile my victim stood        Disguis d a sigh or two  and puff d them from him        Then rubb d his brow  and took it up again   The player s countenance assumes a wild stare  he sighs twice most  piteously  as if he were on the point of suffocation  scrubs his  forehead  and  bending his body  apes the action of snatching an object  from the floor  Nor is this dexterity of dumb show omitted  when he  concludes his imitation in these three lines          At first he look d as if he meant to read it        But check d by rising fears  he crushed it thus        And thrust it  like an adder  in his bosom    Here the judicious performer imitates the confusion and concern of  Alonzo  seems to cast his eyes upon something  from which they are  immediately withdrawn with horror and precipitation then shutting  his fist with a violent squeeze  as if he intended to make immediate  application to Isabella s nose  he rams it in his own bosom  with all  the horror and agitation of a thief taken in the manner  Were the player  debarred the use of speech  and obliged to act to the eyes only of the  audience  this mimicry might be a necessary conveyance of his meaning     6 22 15  3 45 PM   but when he is at liberty to signify his ideas by language  nothing can  be more trivial  forced  unnatural  and antic  than this mummery  Not  that I would exclude from
