as bound by all manner of ties to do every   thing to please her  was enough to give the most galling reflections to   a woman of her delicacy and spirit       But there was still another  and  by many degrees  a more aggravating   motive for her indignation  if she had purchased this squirrel with her   own money  or if it had been presented to her by any other hands than   those of Mr  Trueworth  not only the loss would have been less shocking   to her  but also the person  by whom she sustained that loss  would    perhaps  have found less difficulty in obtaining her forgiveness       She kept her promise  however  and ordered a bed to be made ready for   her in another room  Mr  Munden came not home that night till very late    and being told what his wife had done  took not the least notice of it    but happening to meet her the next morning  as she was coming down   stairs   So  Madam   said he   I suppose you fancy this obstinate   disobedience to your husband is mighty becoming in you         When a husband   answered she   is ignorant of the regard he ought to   have for his wife  or forgets to put it in practice  he can expect   neither affection nor obedience  unless the woman he has married happens   to be an idiot        They passed each other with these words  and she went directly to Lady   Trusty  being impatient to acquaint her with the behaviour of her   husband towards her since she last had seen her       This worthy lady was astonished beyond measure at the recital  it seemed   so strange to her  that a gentleman of Mr  Munden s birth  fortune  and   education  should ever entertain the sordid design of obliging his wife   to convert to the family uses what had been settled on her for her own   private expences  that she could not have given credit to it from any   other mouth than that of the weeping sufferer  his killing of the   squirrel also  though a trifle in itself  she could not help thinking   denoted a most cruel  revengeful  and mean mind       But how much soever she condemned him in her heart  she forebore   expressing the whole of her sentiments on this occasion to his wife    being willing  as they were joined to each other by the most sacred and   indissoluble bonds  rather to heal  if possible  the breach between   them  than to add any thing which might serve to widen it       She told her that  though she could not but confess that Mr  Munden had   behaved towards her  through this whole affair  in a manner very   different from what he ought to have done  or what might have been   expected from him  yet she was sorry to find that she had carried things   to that extremity  particularly she blamed her for having quitted his   bed   Because   said she   it may furnish him with some matter of   complaint against you  and  likewise  make others suspect you have not   that affection for him which is the duty of a wife        Mrs  Munden making no answer to this  and looking a little perplexed   I   do not mean  by what I have said   resumed Lady Trusty   to persuade you   to take any steps towards a reconciliation  that is  I would not have   you confess you have been in the wrong  or tell him you are sorry for   what you have done  that would be taking a blame upon yourself you do   not deserve  and he would imagine he had a right to expect the same on   every trifling occasion  It may be  he might be imperious and   ill natured enough to create quarrels merely for the sake of humbling   your spirit and resentment into submission        But as to live in the manner you are likely to do together   continued   she   cannot but be very displeasing in the eye of Heaven  and must also   expose both of you to the censure and contempt of the world  when once   it comes to be known and talked of  some means must be speedily found to   bring about an accommodation between you         O  Madam   cried the other  hastily interrupting her   how impossible   is it for me ever to look with any thing but disdain and resentment on a   man who  after so many protestations of eternal love  eternal adoration    has dared to treat me in this
