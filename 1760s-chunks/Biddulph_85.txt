design upon her person  than on her diamond ear rings  Now  said I  taking one of her hands with rather more freedom than respect  since we are out of all danger of discovery  or any possibility of pursuit  I will tell you a secret  and I spoke with an easy assured tone  She drew her hand away  What do you mean  Sir  Nothing  madam  but to have the pleasure of your company in a little trip I am going to take  believe me  you are not in the least danger  you are under my protection  those are my servants that you see riding with us  and you may judge of the value I set upon you  by the pains I have taken to get you into my possession  Lord  Mr Faulkland  why sure you can’t be serious  Never more so in my life  madam  I have long had a design upon you  but your connection with Mr Arnold—My connection with Mr Arnold  Sir  interrupting me  I don’t understand you —Come  come  Mrs Gerrarde  you and I are old acquaintance  you know  ’tis no time for dissembling  He has been a happy man long enough  ’tis time for a woman of your spirit to be tired of him  especially as I think I may say  without vanity  you do not change for the worse in falling into my hands  The lady had now recovered her courage  she was no longer in fears of being robbed  and her spirits returned  You audacious creature  how dare you treat me thus  Have you the assurance to insinuate that there was any thing criminal in my attachment to Mr Arnold and his family  My dear madam  I accuse you of no attachment to any of his family  he himself was the only favoured person—Sure there never was such an impertinent wretch —But I know the author of this scandal  it was Mrs ——  and she dared to prophane your sister’s honoured name   but I despise her  and Mr Arnold shall soon know how I have been affronted  and she fell a crying —My dear Mrs Gerrarde  I beg your pardon  I did not mean to offend you  if Mr Arnold admired you  he did no more than what every man does who sees you  I beseech you to compose yourself  by all that is good  I mean you no harm  be calm  I conjure you  and don’t spoil the prettiest face in England with crying  A daring  provoking creature  she sobbed  what could put such an attempt as this in your head  and to what place are you carrying me  Only to France  my dear creature  have you have been there  To France  to France  she exclaimed  and do you dare to think you shall carry me    there  Oh  you’ll like it of all things  said I  when you get there—What do you think her reply was  Why  neither more nor less than a good box on the ear  I catched hold of her hand  and kissed it  you charming vixen  how I admire you for your spirit  She endeavoured to wrest her hand from me  but I held them both fast  for fear of another blow  Base  insolent  ravisher  villain  As she rose in her epithets  I replied with  lovely  charming  adorable  tender  gentle creature—She cried again  but they were spiteful tears  and did not create in me the least touch of that pity  which  on any other occasion  they might have moved me to   I was glad our altercations had a short truce  by the chariot’s stopping at the gardener’s cottage  where I had ordered my equipage to wait  All the family were in bed but the man’s wife  who came curt’sying to the door  I led  or rather lifted  Mrs Gerrarde out of the chariot  for she would not give me her hand  and begging she would repose herself for a few minutes  whilst I gave orders to my servants  put her into the good woman’s hands  She went sullenly in  without making me any answer  and seeing nobody but the old woman  she was convinced that complaints  or an attempt to escape  would be equally fruitless  and so prudently acquiesced  I soon dispatched my orders  I made the footman  who came behind the chariot  mount the box  and directed him to drive to an inn in the next village to Mrs Gerrarde’s house  and from thence to send it home by some one who did not know to whom he belonged  I then ordered my own equipage to the door  and entering the cottage  told the lady I was ready to attend her  The old woman presently vanished  so that seeing nobody to apply to  she suffered me very quietly to put her into my chariot  and I placed myself by her  It was made on purpose for travelling  and I took care to have nothing but wooden windows  to which I had the precaution to add a couple of spring locks  which shut on drawing up  and were not without difficulty to be opened  One of the windows was already up
