respects and cus    toms  this right of directing matrimonial choice has always belonged   to the parents   till maturity of age may be presumed to ripen   judgment  and to remove the necessity upon which it is founded    But  however evident this right is  the passions of youth so often   rebel against it  that it was found necessary to enforce it by express   laws  These laws  though  the professed end of which is to make   marriage happy  should never be perverted to the unnatural purpose   of preventing it entirely  by clogging it with such imnecessary and   unreasonable restrictions  as tend to subjugate not only natural       Lord Hardwicke s Marriage Act of 1753  which put a stop to Fleet   marriages  The Bill encountered extraordinary opposition on such   points as the predicted check to population  and the hardship to yoimger   sons  who would be prevented from making runaway matches with   heiresses          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 497     Jiberty  but also the highest interest of the state  which   depends upon population  to avarice  caprice  or pride of family   in parents   or to views of interest in those appointed to supply   their place  The particular case of my master which gave occasion   to these reflections was this  He was the youngest son of a noble   family  to the honours of which his rising virtues promised to add   new lustre  Youthful inclination had first attached him to this lady    whose merits upon acquaintance confirmed that attachment more   than her very large fortune  Such a marriage could not fail to meet   the approbation of reason and paternal prudence  Accordingly    every necessary preliminary was agreed upon  when the sudden   death of her father threw in legal obstacles  which threatened to   prevent it  at least for a longer time than youthful impatience   could bear  For  as he had not actually signed to his consent  those   to whom the care of his daughter devolved thought proper to exert   the right which the law gave them of objecting to the disparity   between her fortune and that of her lover  and so break off a match   evidently for their mutual advantage  When the lovers found   that all they could do to influence their compliance was ineffectual    they had recourse to this expedient  which the sage makers of the   law had  perhaps  inadvertently  left open   to evade it by flying   beyond its power   and there solemnised a marriage which should   be valid at their return home  though entered into without any of   the prudential cautions for securing happiness  which are customary   on such occasions  and he had in vain offered to come into   so that   the law which was professedly designed to prevent inconsiderate   and unhappy marriages  in its effect deprived this  and the many   marriages of the kind  of the means for procuring happiness  which   former laws  founded on reason  had provided for them      It is not to be denied but the evils wiiich were immediately   alleged as the occasion of this law called aloud for remedy   but   whether the remedy provided by it did not introduce an inconvenience   of worse consequence to the public than those evils  is not so clear   a case  Whatever restrictions might have been thought necessary    in worldly wisdom  to prevent secret marriages  by which either    the honours of families might be supposed to suffer diminution    or their fortunes fall a prey to mercenary design  where these con    siderations interfere not  such restrictions should never in good   policy extend  On the contrary  every impediment and delay  not   immediately proceeding from moral necessity  should be removed    and the state of matrimony encouraged by such honours and ad    vantages as should counterbalance the inconveniences of it to persons   labouring under circumstances of indigence   by which means   the inferior ranks of the people  whose numbers make the strength   of a state  would be delivered from the difficulties and fears which   at present deter them from entering into matrimony  to the heavy   loss of the community  and the immediate ruin of such numbers   of both sexes  whose natural passions  debarred from this  their   only proper resource  lead them into such vices as defeat the end   x f their creation  and make them a reproach to humanity  How   many infants would daily be saved from the most unnatural murder    io the ornament and advantage of their country  could the wretched     2i         498 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     parents have saved their own shame by marriage   How many   females  who offer
