waited above ten minutes  when Emilia entered in a most  enchanting undress  with all the graces of nature playing about her  person  and in a moment riveted the chains of his slavery beyond the  power of accident to unbind   Her mother being still abed  and her brother gone to give orders about  the chaise  in which they proposed to return that same day to their  own habitation  he enjoyed her company a whole hour  during which he  declared his love in the most passionate terms  and begged that he might  be admitted into the number of those admirers whom she permitted to  visit and adore her   She affected to look upon his vows and protestations as the ordinary  effect of gallantry  and very obligingly assured him that were she to  live in that place she should be glad to see him often  but as the  spot on which she resided was at a considerable distance  she could not  expect he would go so far  upon such a trifling occasion  as to take the  trouble of providing himself with her mamma s permission   To this favourable hint he with all the eagerness of the most fervent  passion  that he had uttered nothing but the genuine dictates of his  heart  that he desired nothing so much as an opportunity of evincing the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   sincerity of his professions  and that  though he lived at the extremity  of the kingdom  he would find means to lay himself at her feet  provided  he could visit her with her mother s consent  which he assured her he  would not fail to solicit   She then gave him to understand that her habitation was about sixteen  miles front Winchester  in a village which she named  and where  as he  could easily collect from her discourse  he would be no unwelcome guest   In the midst of this communication they were joined by Mrs  Gauntlet   who received him with great courtesy  thanking him again for his  politeness to Emy at the ball  and anticipated his intention by saying  that she should be very glad to see him at her house  if ever his  occasions should call him that way   CHAPTER XVIII   He inquires into the Situation of this young Lady  with whom he is  enamoured  Elopes from School  Is found by the Lieutenant  conveyed to  Winchester  and sends a Letter with a copy of verses to his Mistress   He was transported with pleasure at this invitation  which he assured  her he should not neglect  and after a little more conversation on  general topics  took his leave of the charming Emilia and her prudent  mamma  who had perceived the first emotions of Mr  Pickle s passion for  her daughter  and been at some pains to inquire about his family and  fortune   Neither was Peregrine less inquisitive about the situation and pedigree  of his new mistress  who  he learned  was the only daughter of a  field officer  who died before he had it in his power to make suitable  provision for his children  that the widow lived in a frugal though  decent manner on her pension  assisted by the bounty of her relations   that the son carried arms as a volunteer in the company which his father  had commanded  and that Emilia had been educated in London  at the  expense of a rich uncle  who was seized with the whim of marrying at the  age of fifty five  in consequence of which his niece had returned to her  mother  without any visible dependence  except on her own conduct and  qualifications   This account  though it could not diminish his affection  nevertheless  alarmed his pride  for his warm imagination had exaggerated all his own  prospects  and he began to fear that his passion for Emilia might be  thought to derogate from the dignity of his situation  The struggle  between his interest and love produced a perplexity which had an evident  effect upon his behaviour  he became pensive  solitary  and peevish   avoided public diversions  and grew so remarkably negligent in his  dress  that he was scarce distinguishable by his own acquaintance  This  contention of thoughts continued several weeks  at the end of which  the charms of Emilia triumphed over every other consideration  Having  received a supply of money from the commodore  who acted towards him  with great generosity  he ordered Pipes to put up some linen and other    6 22 15  3 45 PM   necessaries in a sort of knapsack  which he could conveniently carry   and  thus attended  set out early one morning on foot for the village  where his charmer lived  at which he arrived before two o clock in the  afternoon  having chosen this method of travelling that his route might  not be so easily discovered  as it must have been had he hired horses   or taken a place in the stage coach   The first thing he did was to secure a convenient lodging at the inn  where he dined  then he shifted himself  and  according
