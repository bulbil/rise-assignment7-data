teeth  but it was some time before I could convince him of Thomson s being alive  at whose good fortune nevertheless he was extremely glad     Having renewed our protestations of friendship  I bid the honest Welchman and his spouse farewell  and taking post horses  arrived at London that same night  where I found my father in good health  to whom I imparted what I had learned of Narcissa —This indulgent parent approved of my intention of marrying her  even without a   347 fortune  provided her brother s consent could not be obtained  promised to make over to me in a few days a sufficiency to maintain her in a fashionable manner  and expressed a desire of seeing this amiable creature  who had captivated me so much —As I had not slept the night before  and was besides fatigued with my journey  I found myself under a necessity of taking some repose  and went to bed accordingly  next morning about ten a clock  I took a chair  and  according to Mrs  Sagely s directions  went to my charmer s lodgings  and enquired for Miss Williams —I had not waited in a parlour longer than a minute  when this young woman entered  and no sooner perceived me  than she shrieked and run backward  I got between her and the door  and clasping her in my arms  brought her to herself by an embrace     Good heaven  cried she  Mr  Random is it you indeed  my mistress will run distracted with joy  —  I told her  it was from an apprehension that my sudden appearance would have some bad effect on my dear Narcissa  that I had desired to see her first  in order to concert some method of acquainting her mistress gradually with my arrival  She approved of my conduct  and after having yielded to the suggestions of her own friendship  in asking if my voyage had been successful  charged herself with that office  and left me glowing with desire of seeing and embracing the object of my love  In a very little time I heard some body coming down stairs in haste  and the voice of my angel pronounce  with an eager tone    O heaven  is it possible  where is he    How were my faculties arroused at this well known sound  and how was   348 my soul transported  when she broke in upon my view  in all the bloom of ripened beauty  Grace was in all her steps  heaven in her eye  in every gesture dignity and love —You whose souls are susceptible of the most delicate impressions  whose tender bosoms have felt the affecting vicissitudes of love  who have suffered an absence of eighteen long months from the dear object of your hope  and found at your return the melting fair  as kind and constant as your heart could wish  do me justice on this occasion  and conceive what unutterable rapture possessed us both  while we flew into one anothers arms  This was no time for speech —locked in a mutual embrace  we continued some minutes in a silent trance of joy —When I thus encircled all that my soul held dear —while I hung over her beauties —beheld her eyes sparkle  and every feature flush with virtuous fondness  when I saw her enchanting bosom heave with undissembled rapture  and knew myself the happy cause—Heavens  what was my situation —I am tempted to commit my paper to the flames  and to renounce my pen for ever  because its most ardent and lucky expression so poorly describes the emotions of my soul  O adorable Narcissa   cried I  O miracle of beauty  love and truth  I at last fold thee in my arms  I at last can call thee mine  no jealous brother shall thwart our happiness again  fortune hath at length recompenced me for all my sufferings  and enabled me to do justice to my love —The dear creature smiled ineffably charming  and with a look of bewitching tenderness  said    And shall we never part again     Never   I replied  thou wondrous pattern of all earthly   349 perfection  never  until death shall divide us  by this ambrosial kiss  a thousand times more fragrant than the breeze that sweeps the orange grove  I never more will leave thee      As my first transport abated  my passion grew turbulent and unruly  I was giddy with standing on the brink of bliss  and all my virtue and philosophy were scarce sufficient to restrain the inordinate sallies of desire —Narcissa perceived the conflict within me  and with her usual dignity of prudence  called off my imagination from the object in view  and with eager expressions of interested curiosity  desired to know the particulars of my voyage —In this I gratified her inclination  bringing my story down to the present hour  She was infinitely surprised at the circumstances of my finding my father  which brought tears into her lovely eyes  She was transported at hearing that he approved my flame  discovered a longing desire of being introduced to him  congratulated herself and me upon my good fortune  and observed that this great and unexpected stroke of fate seemed to have been brought about by the immediate direction of providence —Having entertained ourselves some hours with the genuine effusions
