used to say  that his little Byron was an enthusiast in her gratitude  But  however  when I say any thing of the exalted minds  of the expanded hearts  of the amiaable manners  of this happy brother and sister  which seems to exceed  in my praises  the bounds you will all be willing to set me  then let the over flowings be carried to account of the grateful enthusiasm  and only to that   Which shall I begin with  You will have a sharp look out upon me  you say  Ah  my Lucy  I know what you mean  But I am safe from every thing but my gratitude  I will assure you   And so  if I begin with the character of the Brother  then will you join with my uncle  shake your   251 head  and cry  Ah  my Harriet  If I begin with the sister  will you not say  that I save my choicest subject for the last  How difficult is it to avoid censure  when there is a resolution taken to be censorious   Well  but keep a look out  if you please  my Lucy  Not the least shadow of reserve shall it give to my heart  My pen shall be honest to that heart  and I shall be benefited  I am sure  by the faithful wounds of such affectionate  and equally beloved as revered friends—And so  Pen  take thy course   Miss Grandison—Yes  my volant  my self conducted quill  begin with the sister  say my Lucy what she pleases—  Miss Grandison is about twenty four  Of a fine stature  She has dignity in her aspect  and a very penetrating black eye  with which she does what she pleases  Her hair is black  very fine  and naturally curls  She is not fair  but her complexion is delicate and clear  and promises a long duration to her loveliness  Her features are generally regular  Her nose is a little aquiline  but that is so far from being a blemish  that it gives a kind of majesty to her other features  Her teeth are white and even  Her mouth is perfectly lovely  and a modest archness appears in her smiles  that makes one both love and fear her  when she begins to speak  She is finely shaped  and  in her air and whole appearance  perfectly genteel   She herself says  That before her brother came to England  she was thought to be proud  pert  and lofty  But I hardly believe her  for the man lives not  it is my belief  who in fourteen months time  and Sir Charles has not been longer arrived  could so totally eradicate those qualities in a mind of which they had taken▪possession  as that they should not occasionally shew themselves   She has charming spirits  I dare say  she sings well  from the air she now and then warbles in the gaiety of her heart  as she goes up and down stairs  She is   252 very polite  yet has a vein of raillery  that were she not polite  would give one too much apprehension for one s ease  But I am sure she is frank  easy  and good humoured  And  by turning over all the just and handsome things which are attributed to herself  to her brother s credit  she must be equally humble and generous   She says  she has but lately taken a very great likeing to reading  But I am ready to question what she says  when she speaks any thing that some would construe to her disadvantage  She pretends  that she was too volatile  too gay  too airy  to be confined to sedentary amusements  Her father  however  according to the genteelest and most laudable modern education for women  had given her a master  who taught her History and Geography  in both which she acknowledges she made some progress  In Music  she owns she has skill  But I am told by her maid who attended me by her young Lady s direction  and who delights to praise her mistress  that she reads and speaks French and Italian  that she writes finely  and is greatly admired for her wit  prudence  and obligingness  Nobody  said Jenny  who is a sensible young woman a clergyman s daughter  well educated  and very obligeing  can stand against her good natured raillery  Her brother  she says  is not spared  But he takes delight in her vivacity  and gives way to it  when it is easy to see  that he could take her down  if he pleased  And then  added this good young woman  she is an excellent manager in a family  finely as she is educated  I rejoiced to hear that  for the honour of our reading Ladies  as in Miss Clements s case   She knows every thing  and how to direct what should be done  from the private family dinner  to a sumptuous entertainment  And every day inspects  and approves  or alters  the bill of fare  By the way  my Lucy  she is an early riser—Do you mind that  And so can do every thing with ease
