whom they suppose more propitious to the Europeans than to themselves  and as an ambassador from the prince whose subject he is  they therefore think it a mark of honor  and a proof of esteem  to receive missionaries  and to our remissness  and the French wise attention on this head  is owing the extreme attachment the greater part of the savage nations have ever had to the latter       The French missionaries  by studying their language  their manners  their tempers  their dispositions  by conforming to their way of life  and using every art to gain their esteem  have acquired an influence over them which is scarce to be conceived  nor would it be difficult for ours to do the same  were they judiciously chose  and properly encouraged       I believe I have said  that there is a striking resemblance between the manners of the Canadians and the savages  I should have explained it  by adding  that this resemblance has been brought about  not by the French having won the savages to receive European manners  but by the very contrary  the peasants having acquired the savage indolence in peace  their activity and ferocity in war  their fondness for field sports  their hatred of labor  their love of a wandering life  and of liberty  in the latter of which they have been in some degree indulged  the laws here being much milder  and more favorable to the people  than in France       Many of the officers also  and those of rank in the colony troops  have been adopted into the savage tribes  and there is stronger evidence than  for the honor of humanity  I would wish there was  that some of them have led the death dance at the execution of English captives  have even partook the horrid repast  and imitated them in all their cruelties  cruelties  which to the eternal disgrace  not only of our holy religion  but even of our nature  these poor people  whose ignorance is their excuse  have been instigated to  both by the French and English colonies  who  with a fury truly diabolical  have offered rewards to those who brought in the scalps of their enemies  Rousseau has taken great pains to prove that the most uncultivated nations are the most virtuous  I have all due respect for this philosopher  of whose writings I am an enthusiastic admirer  but I have a still greater respect for truth  which I believe is not in this instance on his side       There is little reason to boast of the virtues of a people  who are such brutal slaves to their appetites as to be unable to avoid drinking brandy to an excess scarce to be conceived  whenever it falls in their way  though eternally lamenting the murders and other atrocious crimes of which they are so perpetually guilty when under its influence       It is unjust to say we have corrupted them  that we have taught them a vice to which we are ourselves not addicted  both French and English are in general sober  we have indeed given them the means of intoxication  which they had not before their intercourse with us  but he must be indeed fond of praising them  who makes a virtue of their having been sober  when water was the only liquor with which they were acquainted       From all that I have observed  and heard of these people  it appears to me an undoubted fact  that the most civilized Indian nations are the most virtuous  a fact which makes directly against Rousseau s ideal system       Indeed all systems make against  instead of leading to  the discovery of truth       Pere Lafitau has  for this reason  in his very learned comparison of the manners of the savages with those of the first ages  given a very imperfect account of Indian manners  he is even so candid as to own  he tells you nothing but what makes for the system he is endeavoring to establish       My wish  on the contrary  is not to make truth subservient to any favorite sentiment or idea  any child of my fancy  but to discover it  whether agreable or not to my own opinion       My accounts may therefore be false or imperfect from mistake or misinformation  but will never be designedly warped from truth       That the savages have virtues  candor must own  but only a love of paradox can make any man assert they have more than polished nations       Your Lordship asks me what is the general moral character of the Canadians  they are simple and hospitable  yet extremely attentive to interest  where it does not interfere with that laziness which is their governing passion       They are rather devout than virtuous  have religion without morality  and a sense of honor without very strict honesty       Indeed I believe wherever superstition reigns  the moral sense is greatly weakened  the strongest inducement to the practice of morality is removed  when people are brought to believe that a few outward ceremonies will compensate for the want of virtue       I myself heard a man  who had raised a large fortune by very indirect means  confess his life had been contrary to every precept of the Gospel  but that he hoped the
