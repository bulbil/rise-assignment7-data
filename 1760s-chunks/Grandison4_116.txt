 But  in a fit of pious bravery  as he used to call it  when every thing between themselves  and between the friends on both sides  was concluded on  she threw herself into a Convent  and  passing steadily through the probationary forms  took the veil  but afterwards repented  and took pains to let it be known that she was unhappy  This gave him a disgust against the sequestred life  tho  he was  in other respects  a zealous Catholic  And Clementina having always a serious turn  in order to deter her from embracing it  both grandfathers being desirous of strengthening their house  as well in the female as male line  they inserted a clause in each of their wills  by which they gave the estate designed for her  in case she took the veil  to Laurana  and her descendants  Laurana  to enter into possession of it on the day that Clementina should be professed  But if Clementina married  Laurana was then to be intitled only to a handsome legacy  that   289 she might not be entirely disppointed  For the reversion  in case Clementina had no children  was to go to our eldest son  who  however  has been always generously folicitous to have his sister marry   Both grandfathers were rich  Our son Giacomo  on my father s death  as he had willed  entered upon a considerable estate in the kingdom of Naples  which had for ages been in my family  He is therefore  and will be  greatly provided for  Our second son has great prospects before him  in the church  But you know he cannot marry  Poor Jeronymo  We had not  before his misfortune  any great hopes of strengthening the family by his means  He  alas   as you well know  who took such laudable pains to reclaim him  before we knew you  with great qualities  imbibed free notions from bad company  and declared himself a despiser of marriage  This the two grandfathers knew  and often deplored  for Jeronymo and Clementina were equally their favourites  To him and the Bishop they bequeathed great legacies   We suspected not  till very lately  that Laurana was deeply in Love with the Count of Belvedere  and that her mother and she had views to drive our sweet child into a convent  that Laurana might enjoy the estate  which they hoped would be an inducement to the Count to marry her  Cruel Laurana  Cruel Lady Sforza  So much love as they both pretended to our child  and  I believe  had  till the temptation  strengthened by power  became too strong for them  Unhappy the day that we put her into their hands   Besides the estate so bequeathed to Clementina  we can do great things for her  Few Italian families are so rich as ours  Her brothers forget their own interest  when it comes into competition with hers  She is as generous as they  Our four children never knew what a contention was  but who should give up   290 an advantage to the other  This child  this sweet child  was ever the delight of us all  and likewise of our brother the Conte della Porretta  What joy would her recovery and nuptials give us —dear creature  We have sometimes thought  that she is the fonder of the sequestred life  as it is that which we wish her not to embrace—But can Clementina be perverse  She cannot  Yet that was the life of her choice  when she had a choice  her grandfathers wishes notwithstanding   Will you now wonder  Chevalier  that neither our sons nor we can allow Clementina to take the veil  Can we so reward Laurana for her cruelty  Especially now  that we suspect the motives for her barbarity  Could I have thought that my sister Sforza—But what will not Love and Avarice do  their powers united to compass the same end  the one reigning in the bosom of the mother  the other in that of the daughter  Alas  alas  they have  between them  broken the spirit of my Clementina  The very name of Laurana gives her terror—So far is she sensible  But  O Sir  her sensibility appears only when she is harshly treated  To tenderness she had been too much accustomed  to make her think an indulgent treatment now ••r unusual   I dread  my dear Dr  Bartlet  yet am impatient  to see the unhappy Lady  I wish the general were not to accompany her  I am afraid I shall want temper  if he forget his  My own heart  when it tells me  that I have not deserved ill usage  from my equals and superiors in rank  especially  bids me not bear it  I am ashamed to own to you  my reverend friend  that pride of spirit  which  knowing it to be my fault  I ought long ago to have subdued   Make my compliments to every one I love  Mr  and Mrs  Reeves are of the number   Charlotte  I hope is happy  If she is not  it must be her own fault  Let her know  that I will not   291 allow  when my love to both sisters
