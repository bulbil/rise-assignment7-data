whenever you think of my over livelinesses  as you call  em  you don t drop a courtesy  and say  You are obliged to me   But still the attack made upon you in your dressingroom at Colnebrooke  by my sister and me  sticks in your stomach—And why so  We were willing to shew you  that we were not the silly people you must have thought us  had we not been able to distinguish light from darkness  You  who ever were  I believe▪ one of the frankest hearted girls in Britain  and admired for the ease and dignity given you by that frankness  were growing aukward  nay dishonest  Your gratitude  your gratitude  was the dust you wanted to throw into our eyes  that we might not see that you were governed by a stronger motive  You called us your friends  your sisters  but treated us not as either  and this man  and that  and t other  you could refuse  and why  No reason given for it  and we were to be popt off with your gratitude  truly —We were to believe just what you said  and no more  nay  not so much as you said  But we were not so implicit  Nor would you  in our case  have been so   But    you  perhaps  would not have violently broken in upon a poor thing  who thought we were blind  because she was not willing we should see    —May be not  But then  in that case  we were honester than you would have been  that s all  Here  said I  Lady L  is this poor girl aukwardly struggling to conceal what every body sees  and  seeing  applauds her for  the men considered  Yes  Harriet  the man considered  be pleased to take that in   Let us  in pity  relieve her  She is though to be frank  open hearted  communicative  nay  she passes herself upon ••in those characters  She sees we keep nothing from her    228 She has been acquainted with your Love before wedlock  with my folly  in relation to Anderson  She has carried her head above a score or two of men not contemptible  She sits enthroned among us  while we make but common figures at her footstool  She calls us sisters  friends  and twenty pretty names  Let us acquaint her  that we see into her heart  and why Lord D  and others are so indifferent with her  If she is ingenuous  let us spare her  if not  leave me to punish her—Yet we will keep up her punctilio as to our brother  we will leave him to make his own discoveries  She may confide in his politeness  and the result will be happier for her  because she will then be under no restraint to us  and her native freedom of heart may again take its course     Agreed  agreed  said Lady L —And arm in arm  we entered your dressing room  dismissed the maid  and began the attack—And  O Harriet  how you hesitated  paraded  fooled on with us  before you came to confession  Indeed you deserved not the mercy we shewed you—So  child  you had better to have let this part of your story sleep in peace   You bid me not tell Emily that your cousin is in Love with her  But I think I will  Girls begin very early to look out for admirers  It is better  in order to stay her stomach  to find out one for her  than that she should find out one for herself  especially when the man is among ourselves  as I may say  and both are in our own management  and at distance from eath other  Emily is a good girl  but she has susceptibilities already  And tho  I would not encourage her  as yet  to look out of herself for happiness  yet I would give her consequence with herself  and at the same time let her see  that there could be no mention made of any thing that related to her  but what she should be acquainted with  Dear girl  I love her as well as you  and I pity her too  I or she  as well as Somebody else  will have difficulties to contend   229 with  which she will not know easily how to get over  tho  she can  in a flame so young  generously prefer the interest of a more excellent woman to her own —There  Harriet  is a grave paragraph  You ll like me for it   You are a very reflecting girl  in mentioning to me so particularly  your behaviour to your Grevilles  Fenwicks  and Ormes  What is that but saying  See  Charlotte  I am a much more complaisant creature to the men  no one of which I intend to have  than you are to your husband   What a pious woman  indeed  must be your grandmamma  that she could suspend her joy  her longabsent darling at her feet  till she had first thank d God for restoring her to her arms  But  in this instance  we
