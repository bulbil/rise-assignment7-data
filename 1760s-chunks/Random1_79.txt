so that we could never after get sight of him  for which we were not sorry  because the captain was mainly wroth  and would certainly have done him a mischief —for he afterwards caused him to be run on the ships books  whereby he lost all his pay  and if he should be taken  would be tried as a deserter      This account of the captain s behaviour gave me no advantageous idea of his character  and I could not help lamenting my own fate  that had subjected me to such a commander  However  making a virtue of necessity  I put a good face on the matter  and next day was with the other pressed men put on board of the Thunder lying at the Nore —When we came along side  the mate who guarded us thither  ordered my hand cuffs to be taken off  that I might get on board the easier  which being perceived by some   224 of the company who stood upon the gangboards to see us enter  one of them called to Jack Rattlin  who was busied in doing this friendly office for me     Hey  Jack  what Newgate galley have you boarded in the river as you came along  Have we not thieves enow among us already    Another observing my wounds  which still remained exposed to the air  told me  my seams were uncaulked  and that I must be new payed —A third  seeing my hair clotted together with blood  as it were  into distinct cords  took notice  that my bows were manned with the red ropes  instead of my side —A fourth asked me  if I could not keep my yards square without iron braces  and in short  a thousand witticisms of the same nature  were passed upon me  before I could get up the ship s side —After we had been all entered upon the books  I enquired at one of my ship mates where the surgeon was  that I might have my wounds dressed  and had actually got as far as the middle deck  for our ship carried eighty guns  in my way to the cock pit  when I was met by the same midshipman who had used me so barbarously in the tender  He seeing me free from my chains  asked  with an insolent air  who had released me  To this I foolishly answered  with a countenance that too plainly declared the state of my thoughts    Whoever did it  I am persuaded did not consult you in the affair  —  I had no sooner uttered these words  than he cried    D—n you  you saucy son of a b—ch  I ll teach you to talk so to your officer  —  So saying  he bestowed on me several severe stripes  with a supple Jack he had in his hand  and going to the commanding officer  made such a report of me  that I was immediately put in irons by   225 the master at arms  and a centinel placed over me —Honest Rattlin  as soon as he heard of my condition  came to me  and administred all the consolation he could  and then went to the surgeon in my behalf  who sent one of his mates to dress my wounds  This mate was no other than my old friend Thomson  with whom I became acquainted at the Navy office  as before mentioned  If I knew him at first sight  it was not so easy for him to recognize me  disfigured with blood and dirt  and altered by the misery I had undergone —Unknown as I was to him  he surveyed me with looks of compassion  and handled my sores with great tenderness  When he had applied what he thought proper  and was about to leave me  I asked him if my misfortunes had disquised me so much  that he could not recollect my face  Upon this he observed me with great earnestness for some time  and at length  protested he could not recollect one feature of my countenance —To keep him no longer in suspence  I told him my name  which when he heard  he embraced me with affection  and professed his sorrow in seeing me in such a disagreeable situation  I made him acquainted with my story  and when he heard how inhumanly I had been used in the tender  he left me abruptly  assuring me  I should see him again soon  I had scarce time to wonder at his sudden departure  when the master at arms came to the place of my confinement  and bid me follow him to the quarter deck  where I was examined by the first lieutenant  who commanded the ship in the absence of the captain  touching the treatment I had received in the tender from my friend the midshipman  who was present to confront me —I recounted the particulars   226 of his behaviour to me  not only in the tender  but since my being on board the ship  part of which being proved by the evidence of Jack Rattlin and others  who had no great devotion for my oppressor  I was discharged from confinement to make way for him  who was delivered to the master at arms to take his turn in the Bilboes —And this was not the only satisfaction I enjoyed
