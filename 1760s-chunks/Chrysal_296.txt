 the elder bravely came to seek for glory in these   inhospitable wilds  with as much ardour as my master pursued it   on his proper element  in order to earn honours  which he might   transmit to his ovni posterity  equal to those which his brother   inherited from his illustrious ancestors  When the tender inquiries   of affection were reciprocally answered  my master gratified the   curiosity of his brother with a particular account of his late dearly    bought success  closing the black detail with some remarks on the   different conduct of the general of this army  which were much to   his advantage        Your reflections  my dearest brother    answered the oifioer      are most just  as things appear to you  But when you have had an   opportunity of seeing further  I fear you will find reason to change   your sentiments  and that the delay here proceeds at bottom from   the same principle with the precipitation which produced such   terrible effects with you  and Heaven grant it produces not as bad      Interest is the object everywhere  and whether that is pursued by   sacrificing the forces in rash and ill conducted attempts to gain   an immediate prize  or by letting them melt away in inaction  to   accumulate the profits of command  makes no difference in the end    I would not be miderstood from this to justify the officer for arraign    ing the general s conduct in so public and personal a manner    Such ungoverned warmth is inexcusable  Proper respect must be   paid to those who bear that authority  or the effect of that authority   ceases   indeed  it is not to them  but to him who delegates the   authority  the respect is paid  A general at the head of an army   represents his sovereign in the plenitude of his power  and to suffer   any slight to be shown to his delegated character were to betray   the trust of that delegation  For this reason  I think his punish    ment was necessary  and therefore just   I wish I could add that it   was equally so from the injustice as from the circumstances of the   accusation which occasioned it   but to anyone who will not shut   his eyes  it must appear beyond a doubt that his great crime was   speaking too much  and too plain truth  for  with all our boasted   care for the preservation of the men  their distresses are such as   have not left me a penny in my pocket  for I cannot shut my hand   where my heart is opened  In short  I am so sick of the whole   scene  that I have solicited the command of a detached party  with   which I hope to show that the native bravery of Britons  when led   with spirit  requires but little experience to enable them to conquer   more formidable foes than naked savages  led by a few wretched   Frenchmen  in a condition not much better  I set out to morrow         348 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     morning  and think it a particular happiness that you have arrived   time enough for me to have this interview with you        The rest of their conversation is not necessary to be repeated    as it turned upon their own domestic concerns  This much only   it is but just for me to observe  that it showed their conduct in the   intercourse and relations of private life to be as amiable as that in   their public capacities was exalted  and proved that moral virtue   is the best foundation for true heroism  My master s brother   having  in the course of their conversation  intimated his having   some present occasion for money  I here entered into his service    You may judge I remained not long in the possession of my new   master  His brother had no sooner left him  than he paid me   away  among a large number of my fellows  to a merchant  for   some additions which he thought it necessary to make  at his own   expense  to the provisions made by the public for the support and   comfort of his men  through the fatigues and inconveniences of a   campaign in an uninhabited coimtry  The sentiments expressed   by my master in the effusion of his soul to his brother  showed his   character in the justest light   I shall  therefore  only add  that as   he acted from principles firmly established on the invariable basis   of reason  there was no danger of his deviating from the path in   which he set out      So bright a prospect made it a pain for me to quit his service so   suddenly   but I have since met many mortifications of
