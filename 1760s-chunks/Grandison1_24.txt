with her fan  and look d as if she thought herself slighted  a little scorn intermingled with the airs she gave herself   Miss Clements smiled  and look d pleased  as if she enjoyed  good naturedly  a compliment made to one of the Sex which she adorns  by the goodness of her heart   Miss Barnevelt said  she had  from the moment I first entered  beheld me with the eye of a Lover  And freely taking my hand  squeezed it —Charming creature  said she  as if addressing to a country innocent  and perhaps expecting me to be cover d with blushes and confusion   The Baronet  excusing himself to Lady Betty  assured her  that she must place this his bold intrusion to the account of Miss Byron  he having been told that she was to be there   Whatever were his motive  Lady Betty said  he did her favour  and she was sure the whole company would think themselves doubly obliged to Miss Byron   The Student look d as if he thought himself eclipsed by Sir Hargrave  and as if  in revenge  he was putting his fine speeches into Latin  and trying them by the rules of grammar  a broken sentence from a classic author bursting from his lips  and at last  standing up  half on tip toe  as if he wanted to look down upon   55 the Baronet  he stuck one hand in his side  and passed by him  casting a contemptuous eye on his gaudy dress   Mr  Singleton smiled  and look d as if delighted with all he saw and heard  Once  indeed  he try d to speak  His mouth actually open d  to give passage to his words  as sometimes seems to be his way before the words are quite ready  But he sat down satisfied with the effort   It is true  people who do not make themselves contemptible by affectation should not be despised  Poor and rich  wise and unwise  we are all links of the same great chain  And you must tell me  my dear  if I  in endeavouring to give true descriptions of the persons I see  incur the censure I bestow on others who despise any one for defects they cannot help   Will you forgive me  my dear  if I make this Letter as long as my last   No  say   Well then  I thank you for a freedom so consistent with our friendship  And I will conclude with assureances  that I am  and ever will be   Most affectionately Yours  HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   IT was convenient to me  Lucy  to break off just where I did in my last  else I should not have been so very self denying as to suppose you had no curiosity to hear  what undoubtedly I wanted to tell  Two girls talking over a new set of company  would my uncle Selby say  are not apt to break off very abruptly  not she especially of the two  who has found out a fair excuse to repeat every compliment made to herself  and when perhaps there may be a new admirer in the case     56 May there so  my uncle  And which of the gentlemen do you think the man  The Baronet  I warrant  you guess —And so he is   Well then  let me give you  Lucy  a sketch of him  But consider  I form my accounts from what I have since been told  as well as from what I observed at the time   Sir Hargrave Pollexfen is handsome and genteel  pretty tall  about twenty eight or thirty  His complexion is a little of the fairest for a man  and a little of the palest  He has remarkably bold eyes  rather approaching to what we would call goggling  and he gives himself airs with them as if he wish d to have them thought rakish  Perhaps as a recommendation  in his opinion  to the Ladies  Miss Cantillon  on his back being turned  Lady Betty praising his person  said  Sir Hargrave had the finest eyes she ever saw in a man  They were manly  meaning ones   He is very voluble in speech  but seems to owe his volubility more to his want of doubt  than to the extraordinary merit of what he says  Yet he is thought to have sense  and if he could prevail upon himself to hear more  and speak less  he would better deserve the good opinion he thinks himself sure of  But as he can say any thing without hesitation  and excites a laugh by laughing himself at all he is going to say  as well as at what he has just said  he is thought infinitely agreeable by the gay  and by those who wish to drown thought in merriment   Sir Hargrave  it seems  has travelled  But he must have carried abroad with him a great number of follies  and a great deal of affectation  if he has left any of them behind him   But  with all his foibles  he is said to be a man of enterprize and courage  and young Ladies  it seems
