of them swore the fellow ought to be pilloried for his presumption   Our hero  seizing this favourable opportunity  acquiesced in their  remarks  and observed  with great vehemence  that it would be a  meritorious action to put the rascal to the proof  and then toss him in  a blanket for non performance  They were wonderfully pleased with this  suggestion  and forthwith determined to try the experiment  though  as  they understood the apparition would be produced to one only at a time   they could not immediately agree in the choice of the person who should  stand the first brunt of the magician s skill  While each of them  severally excused himself from this preference on various pretences   Peregrine readily undertook the post  expressing great confidence of the  conjurer s incapacity to give him the least cause of apprehension   This point being settled  they detached one of their number to Crabtree   in order to bespeak and adjust the hour and terms of the operation   which he insisted upon performing at his own apartment  where everything  was prepared for the occasion  At the appointed time  they went thither  in a body  to the number of seven  in full expectation of detecting the  impostor  and were received with such gloomy formality  as seemed to  have an effect upon the countenances of some among them  though they  were encouraged by the vivacity of Pickle  who affected a double share  of petulance  for the more effectual accomplishment of his purpose   Cadwallader made no reply to the interrogations they uttered  in the  levity of their insolence  at the first entrance  but ordered Hadgi to  conduct them through the next room  that they might see there was no  previous apparatus to affright their deputy with objects foreign to his  undertaking  They found nothing but a couple of wax tapers burning on a  table that stood with a chair by it in the middle of the apartment   and returned to the audience chamber  leaving Peregrine by himself   to encounter the phantom of that person whom they should  without his  knowledge  desire the magician to conjure up to his view   All the doors being shut and the company seated  a profound silence  ensued  together with a face of dreadful expectation  encouraged by  the blue flame of the candles  which were tipped with sulphur for that  purpose  and heightened by the dismal sound of a large bell  which Hadgi  tolled in the ante chamber  Cadwallader having thus practised upon their  ignorance and fear  desired them to name the person to be produced   After some whispers among themselves  one of them took the pen  and   writing the name of Commodore Trunnion upon a slip of paper  put it into  the hands of the magician  who rose from his seat  and  opening the  door of his closet  displayed to their view a skull  with thigh bones  crossed  upon a table covered with black cloth   This melancholy spectacle made a remarkable impression upon the  imaginations of the company  already prepossessed by the previous  ceremony  and they began to survey one another with looks of  consternation  while Cadwallader  shutting himself in the closet   that was contiguous to the chamber in which his friend Peregrine was  stationed  thrust the label with his uncle s name through a small chink  in the partition according to agreement  muttering at the time a sort  of gibberish  that increased the panic of his audience  then returning  to his chair  the knell was tolled again  and Pickle called aloud   D  n  your mummery  why don t you despatch      6 22 15  3 45 PM   This was a signal to Crabtree  who thus certified of his having received  the paper  stood up and waved his wand in the figure of an S  The motion  being thrice performed  their ears were all of a sudden invaded by  a terrible noise in the next room  accompanied with the voice of  Peregrine  who exclaimed  in a tone of horror and amazement   Guard me   Heaven  my Uncle Trunnion   This ejaculation had such an effect upon the  hearers  that two of them swooned with fear  a third fell upon his knees  and prayed aloud  while the other three  in a transport of dismay and  distraction  burst open the door  and rushed into the haunted chamber   where they found the table and chair overturned  and Peregrine extended   in all appearance without sense or motion  upon the floor   They immediately began to chafe his temples  and the first symptom of  his recovery which they perceived was a hollow groan  after which he  pronounced these words   Merciful powers  if I live I saw the commodore  with his black patch  in the very clothes he wore at my sister s  wedding   This declaration completed their astonishment and terror  they  observed a wildness in his looks  which he seemed to bend on something  concealed from their view  and were infected by his appearance to such  a
