  under the conduct of officers who prevented any ill accident  so that   our travellers met with no manner of interruption  but arrived safely at   the magnificent city of Vienna  where was at that time an extreme gay   court  affording every thing capable of diverting a much more settled   melancholy than either Melanthe or her fair companion were possessed of       The arch dutchesses  Mary Elizabeth  and Mary Anna Josepha  afterward   queen of Portugal  had frequent balls and entertainments in their   different drawing rooms  to all which Melanthe  being a stranger and a   woman of quality  was invited  she kept her promise with Louisa  and   treating her as a young lady  whose friendship for her  and a desire of   seeing the world had engaged to accompany her  she was received and   respected as such  and by this means had an opportunity of shewing the   skill she had in dancing  singing  music  and indeed all the   accomplishments that a woman born and educated to the best expectations    is usually instructed in  As neither her lady nor herself understood the   German language  and she spoke infinitely the best French  her   conversation was the most agreeable  which  joined with a most engaging   manner  and a peculiar sweetness in her voice  attracted all those   civilities which the rank of the other demanded       Possessed of so many charms  it would have been strange if  in a city   throng d like Vienna with young noblemen  who were continually coming   from all parts of the empire  she had lived without some who pretended   to somewhat more than mere admiration  but her heart had not refused the   worthy Dorilaus to become the conquest of a German  nor was it here she   was ordained to experience those anxieties in herself  she could but   imperfectly conceive by the description she had from others       Melanthe  however  whose sole aim was to drive all perplexing thoughts   from her mind  encouraged a great number of visitors  so that her   lodgings seemed a perfect theatre of gallantry  and Louisa having her   share in all the amusements this lady prepared for the reception of   those that came to see her  or were contrived for her entertainment by   others  past her time in the most gay and agreeable manner imaginable    and by this means acquired the knowledge of almost the only thing she   before was ignorant in  how to receive a multiplicity of company  yet to   behave so is each should imagine themselves most welcome   to seem   perfectly open  without discovering any thing improper to be   revealed   to use all decent freedoms with the men  yet not encourage   the least from them  and to seem to make a friend of every woman she   conversed with  without putting truth in any   and in fine  all the   little policies which make up the art of what is called a polite   address  and which is not to be attained without an acquaintance with   the court and great world       This  I say  our amiable foundling was now well vers d in  and practised   among those who she found made a practice of it  but yet retained the   same sincerity of mind  love of virtue  and detestation of vice  she   brought with her from the house of Dorilaus   neither was her youth too   much dazled with the exterior splendor she beheld  and tho  she was well   enough pleased with it  yet it did not in the least take her off from   the duties of religion  or inspire her with any ambitious or aspiring   wishes to become what the remembrance of what she was forbid any   probable expectation of  She knew the present fashion of her life was   not an assured settlement  and therefore set not her heart upon it  Few   at her years would have had the like prudence  or in time armed   themselves  as she did  against any change that might befal her       In this happy situation let us leave her for a while  the young Horatio   claims his share of attention  and it is time to see what encouragement   and success his martial ardor met with on the banks of the Danube             CHAP  V        Horatio s reception by the officers of the army  his behaviour in the   battle  his being taken prisoner by the French  his treatment among   them  and many other particulars        The extreme graceful person of Horatio  his youth  handsome equipage    and the letters sent by Dorilaus to several of the principal officers in   his favour  engaged him a reception answerable to his wishes
