over him  which was ready to pour down all its malignity on his own head     As he mused on what might be the occasion of Cozro s long stay  he heard a loud knocking at his door  It was immediately opened by one of his slaves  and a man  who by his habit he knew to be one of the cady s officers  rudely entered his chamber     How comes it  said the stranger  that thou hast had the temerity  in contempt of our sovereign lord s commands  to  Page  178  employ thy emissary about the city at a time when thou knowest that so strict an injunction has been laid on all people to keep within their houses  none being permitted to stir abroad but for the absolute necessities of life  or in cases of imminent danger     Far be it from me  replied ← Nourjahad →   to disobey our mighty sultan s orders  but I understood that slaves had permission to go unquestioned on their master s business  And what business  answered the man  can thy slave have from morning to night in so many different quarters of the city     Page  179  ← Nourjahad →   who did not care to be himself the trumpeter of his own good deeds  hesitated to give an answer     Ha  ha  cried the stranger  I see plainly there is something dangerous in thy mystery  and that the money which thy slave has been distributing amongst such a variety of people  is for a purpose very different from that which he pretends  A likely matter it is indeed that a private man should bestow in charity such sums as Cozro acknowledges he has within these few days distributed     Yet nothing is more certain  replied ← Nourjahad →   than that Cozro has spoke  Page  180  the truth  We shall see that  replied the officer  in a tone of insolence  Cozro is already in prison  and my orders are to conduct thee to him     ← Nourjahad →   exceedingly troubled at hearing this  replied  He was ready to go with him  and the officer led him out of his house     It was now late at night  they passed along the streets without meeting any one  and soon reached the place wherein Cozro was confined  It was the prison where such persons were shut up as were accused of treason against the state     Page  181  Here he found the unfortunate Cozro in a dungeon  Alas  cried he  as soon as his master entered  why do I see thee here  Say rather  my dear Cozro  replied ← Nourjahad →   what strange fatality has brought thee to this dismal place     I can give no other account  answered Cozro  but that in returning home this night  I was seized on in the street by some of those soldiers who were employed to patrol about the city  to see that the sultan s orders were punctually observed  and being questioned concerning my business  I told them that I had been relieving the wants of indigent people  and saving even from perishing   Page  182  some poor wretches who had not wherewithal to buy food     That is an idle errand  replied one of them  and might have been deferred till the term of mourning was expired  however  if you will give me a piece of gold  I will let you pass for this time  otherwise both you and your employer may happen to repent of having transgressed the sultan s commands  I made no scruple  pursued Cozro  to take out my purse  in which there were ten sequins left  I gave one of them to the soldier  but the rapacious wretches seeing I had more money  were not content with this  but insisted on my giving the whole amongst them  I refused   Page  183  some angry words ensued  one of the miscreants struck me  and I returned the blow  Enraged at this  they hurried me before the cady  to whom they accused me of having disobeyed the edict  and assaulted the sultan s officers in the discharge of their duty  I was not heard in my defence  having four witnesses against me  but was immediately dragged to this horrid prison  and the sultan himself  they say  is to take cognizance of my offence     Oh  Heaven  cried ← Nourjahad →   to what mischiefs does not the love of gold expose us  See  my friend  into what misfortunes thou art plunged by the sordid avarice of those vile soldiers  But why   Page  184  why didst thou hesitate to give up that paltry sum which thou hadst in thy purse  to obtain thy liberty  I do not repent what I have done  answered Cozro  and shall contentedly suffer the penalty I have incurred  since it was in so good a cause     If the sultan is just  replied Nourjahad  the punishment ought only to fall on me  who alone am guilty  since what thou didst was by my command
