whole Alphabet only to very weak or very irascible People  for I think  the five Vowels might serve to surmount any Resentment  we could have to each other  However  if you like the   Water Bottle best  I will always have one by my Side   Adieu   my Love   LETTER CXCIX   My FANNY   I RECEIVED your s  with Lady — s inclosed  and am pleased to find  she does not speak  like a Courtier  to your Pride  but addresses herself  like a Philosopher and a Friend  Page  59 to your Prudence  It is certain  that no Man partakes of the Lowness of his Situation  while he appears above it  And the Question in Life is  not what Part we acted  but how we performed it  What she says  is extremely just    that Misfortunes should be rather a Spur  than a Bridle  to us   as a Man exerts himself more in a Bog  than upon Terra firma  and the noble Mind  like a Tennis Ball  always rises in Proportion to it s Fall  Caesar said bravely  that he would rather be the first Man in a Village  than the second at Rome  and I would rather appear above a low Part  than beneath a great one     I am glad to find  that you have contracted the Maxim of Athenodorus to the Vowels  tho   by mentioning the Water Bottle  I suspect you mean to add the Liquids to them  Now I will cut the Work still shorter  for I will confine myself  not only to the Vowels  but to two of them  in Honour of ourselves  For I think  upon any such Occasion  we need have Regard but to U and I  and  to shorten it still further  let us consider those two Letters but as Diphthong   I have been employed these three Mornings in two of the most opposite Amusements  that one can well imagine  in sorting and reading all your charming Letters  filled with Kindness  Love  and Truth  and pulling the grey Hairs Page  60 out of my Head — Not  as one might conjecture  to leave myself yet the Appearance of Youth  sufficient to justify so much Fondness  but for a very extraordinary Reason  to present my lively  gay  young Love with a Locket of them  You have several Times wished  that I was many Years older than I am  in return for which  I shall dedicate every Symptom of Age to you still  as they appear   My Fiddle  as my Nerves unstrung   Venus  upon thy Shrine be hung   Cupid  found a Retreat   Now we are upon the Subject of Age  we may talk of the Epitaphs  which I promised to frame for you and me  The two  I have thought of  are   Evasi  I have escaped   looking upon Death in that philosophic Light  and  Permutatio felix  A happy Exchange   considering Death  as becomes a Christian  the Means of an Exchange for Immortality  I give you your Choice of them  tho   as I hope  and shall take Care  that we shall be both laid under one Stone  I will have them both inscribed  as of one Sentence  to shew that in Death  as well as Life  I consider you Part of myself—   And in Death they were not divided   The Epitaph then shall stand thus   Evasimus — Permutatio felix   In the Name of God  Amen     Believe me your s  Henry   Page  61  LETTER CC   I AM almost angry with my sweet Love for not attributing his Disappointment to any Cause  rather than my Neglect  I did indeed write  by Saturday s Post  to Lady —  to Kitty  and to you  How extremely rude must Lady — think me  as there is no Doubt but all my Letters miscarried  I am vastly uneasy about them  but particularly for her s  it being of most Consequence   I join with you in thinking that Friendship not only allows the Privilege of communicating our inmost Thoughts  and of acknowledging the honest Pride we feel from the Exercise of any moral Virtue  but that it is a Breach of that noble Intercourse to conceal even our Faults or Foibles  For my Part  I have shewn my Heart as naked to thy View  as to the Eye of Heaven  Real Friendship  like true Love  is understood by very few  yet common in the Mouths of every one  It can only be conceived by Minds capable of the most refined and disinterested Sentiments    Reserve will wound it  and Distrust destroy   and this makes  Friends such Rarities below   I think  that Persons of different Sexes  who  with a tolerable Understanding  have had a sincere Affection for each other  are most likely to be capable of real Page  62 Friendship  for even the Remains of Love will create a Gentleness in our Manners  and Complacency of Behaviour  the Want of which is too often the Effect and Bane of common Friendships
