he ventures to affirm  that a train may often bring a lady into the most critical circumstances  for should a rude fellow  says he  offer   70 to come up to ravish a kiss  and the lady attempt to avoid it  in retiring she must necessarily tread upon her train  and thus fall fairly upon her back  by which means every one knows — her cloaths may be spoiled   The ladies here make no scruple to laugh at the smallness of a Chinese slipper  but I fancy our wives at China would have a more real cause of laughter  could they but see the immoderate length of an European train  Head of Confucius  to view a human being crippling herself with a great unwieldy tail for our diversion  backward she cannot go  forward she must move but slowly  and if ever she attempts to turn round  it must be in a circle not smaller than that described by the wheeling crocodile  when it would face an assailant  And yet to think that all this confers importance and majesty  to think that a lady acquires additional respect from fifteen yards of trailing taffety  I can t contain  ha  ha  ha  this is certainly a remnant of European barbarity  the female Tartar dressed in sheep skins  is in far more convenient drapery  Their own writers have sometimes inveigh d against the absurdity of this fashion  but perhaps it has never been ridiculed so well as upon the Italian theatre  where Pasquarielo being engaged to attend on the countess of Fernambroco  having one of his hands employed in carrying her muff  and the other her lap dog  he bears her train majestically along by sticking it in the waistband of his breeches   Adieu     71  LETTER LXXIX  From the same   A Dispute has for some time divided the philosophers of Europe  it is debated  whether arts and sciences are more serviceable or prejudicial to mankind  They  who maintain the cause of literature  endeavour to prove their usefulness from the impossibility of a large number of men subsisting in a small tract of country without them  from the pleasure which attends the acquisition  and from the influence of knowledge in promoting practical morality   They who maintain the opposite opinion  display the happiness and innocence of those uncultivated nations who live without learning  urge the numerous vices which are to be found only in polished society  enlarge upon the oppression  the cruelty and the blood which must necessarily be shed  in order to cement civil society  and insist upon the happy equality of conditions in a barbarous state  preferable to the unnatural subordination of a more refined constitution   This dispute  which has already given so much employment to speculative indolence  has been managed with much ardour  and  not to suppress our sentiments  with but little sagacity  They who insist that the sciences are useful in refined society are certainly right  and they who maintain that barbarous nations are more happy without them  are right also  but when one side for this reason attempts to prove them as universally   72 useful to the solitary barbarian  as to the native of a crowded common wealth  or when the other endeavours to banish them as prejudicial to all society  even from populous states as well as from the inhabitants of the wilderness  they are both wrong  since that knowledge which makes the happiness of a refined European  would be a torment to the precarious tenant of an Asiatic wild   Let me  to prove this  transport the imagination for a moment to the midst of a forest in Siberia  There we behold the inhabitant  poor indeed  but equally fond of happiness with the most refined philosopher of China  The earth lies uncultivated and uninhabited for miles around him  his little family and he the sole and undisputed possessors  In such circumstances nature and reason will induce him to prefer a hunter s life to that of cultivating the earth  He will certainly adhere to that manner of living which is carried on at the smallest expence of labour  and that food which is most agreeable to the appetite  he will prefer indolent though precarious luxury  to a laborious though permanent competence  and a knowledge of his own happiness will determine him to persevere in native barbarity   In like manner his happiness will incline him to bind himself by no law  Laws are made in order to secure present property  but he is possessed of no property which he is afraid to lose  and desires no more than will be sufficient to sustain him  to enter into compacts with others  would be undergoing a voluntary obligation without the expectance of any reward  He and his countrymen are tenants  not rivals  in the same   73 inexhaustible forest  the encreased possessions of one by no means diminishes the expectations arising from equal assiduity in another  there are no need of laws therefore to repress ambition  where there can be no mischief attending its most boundless gratifications   Our solitary Siberian will  in like manner  find the sciences not only entirely useless in directing his practice  but disgusting even in speculation  In every contemplation our curiosity must be first excited by the appearances of things  before our reason undergoes the fatigue of investigating the causes  Some of those appearances are produced
