 and impatiences  which he had often heard others complain of  but not   till now experienced in himself  all that he before had felt of love was   languid  at best aimed only at enjoyment  and in the gratification of   that desire was extinguished  but the passion he was possessed of for   Louisa was of a different nature  and accompanied with a respect which   would not suffer him to entertain a thought in prejudice of her   innocence       Many reasons  besides his natural aversion to marriage  concurred to   hinder him from making her his wife  and as there were yet more to deter   him from being the instrument of her dishonour  the situation of his   mind was very perplexing   He blushed within himself at the inclinations   he had for a girl whom he had always behaved to as a child of his own    and who looked upon him as a father  not only the disparity of their   years made him consider the passion he was possessed of as ridiculous    there was one circumstance  which  if at any time a thought of marrying   her entered into his head  immediately extirpated it  which was  that   there was a possibility of her being born not only of the meanest  but   the vilest parents  who  on hearing her establishment  might appear and   claim the right they had in her  and lo  said he  I shall ally myself   to  perhaps  a numerous family of vagabonds  at least  whether it be so   or not  the manner in which these children were exposed  being publicly   known  may furnish a pretence for any wretch to boast a kindred       He was therefore determined to suppress a passion  which  as he had too   much honour to seek the gratification of by one way  his prudence and   character in the world would not allow him to think of by the other  and   as absence seemed to him the best remedy  he sent her down into the   country again with a precipitation  which made her  wholly ignorant of   the real motive  fear she had done something to offend him  At parting    she entreated him to let her know if he had been dissatisfied with any   thing in her behaviour   Wherefore do you ask  said he  with some   emotion  which the poor innocent still mistook for displeasure  because    answered she  dropping some tears at the same time  that you banish me   from your presence  Why would you be glad to continue with me always    again demanded he  Yes indeed  said she  and if you loved me as well as   you do my brother  you would never part with me  for I saw with what   regret you let him go       This tender simplicity added such fewel to the fire with which Dorilaus   was enflamed  that it almost consumed his resolution  he walked about   the room some time without being able to speak  much less to quiet the   agitation he was in  At last  Louisa  said he  I was only concerned your   brother made choice of an avocation so full of dangers   but I never   intended to keep him at home with me   he should have gone to Oxford to   finish his studies  and the reason I send you again to the   boarding school is that you may perfect yourself in such things as you   may not yet be mistress of   as for any apprehensions of my being   offended with you  I would have you banish them entirely  for I assure   you  I can find nothing in you but what both merits and receives my   approbation       She seemed extremely comforted with these words  and the coach being at   the door  went into it with her accustomed chearfulness  leaving him in   a state which none but those who have experienced the severe struggles   between a violent inclination and a firm resolution to oppose it  can   possibly conceive             CHAP  II        Relates the offers made by Dorilaus to Louisa  and the manner of her   receiving them        Louisa was no sooner gone  than he wished her with him again  and was a   thousand times about to send and have her brought back  but was as often   prevented by the apprehensions of her discovering the motive   He was   now convinced that love does not always stand in need of being indulged   to enforce its votaries to be guilty of extravagancies         He had banished the object of his affections from his presence  he had   painted all the inconveniences of pursuing his desires in the worst
