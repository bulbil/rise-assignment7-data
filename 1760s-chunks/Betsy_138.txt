to the Author of all mercies  we are assured        by the physician that attends him  and who is esteemed the most        skilful this county affords  that he is in a fair way of doing        well  His delirium has quite left him  and he has recovered the use        of his reason so far as to entreat I would send the warmest wishes        of his heart to you  and to desire you will make the same        acceptable to his dear brother  if you are yet so happy as to see        him  he also enjoins you to pay his compliments to Mr  Trueworth         in such words as are befitting the friendship you know he has for        him  I have much to say to you from myself  on the score of that        gentleman  and should be glad to add to the advice I have already        given you  but am deprived of that satisfaction by the arrival of        some company  who are come to pass a week or fortnight with us         therefore must defer what I have to say till another opportunity         Farewel  may Heaven keep you under it s protection  and your        guardian angel never fail his charge  Be assured  that though I do        not write so long  nor so often to you  as I could wish  I am        always  with the greatest sincerity  my dear Miss Betsy  your very        affectionate friend  and humble servant            M  TRUSTY            P S  I wrote the above this morning  because one of our men was to        have gone pretty early to town  but Sir Ralph having some letters        of his own  which were not then ready  detained him  and I have now        the pleasure to tell you  that the doctor  who is this moment come        from your brother s chamber  assures me that he has found him        wonderfully mended since his visit to him last night  Once more  my        dear  adieu        Mr  Thoughtless  perceiving some tears in the eyes of Miss Betsy while   she was reading  cried out   What is the matter  sister  I hope no ill   news from the country     Be pleased to read that  Sir   said she    giving him the letter   and see if I had not cause to be affected with   some part of it         Poor Frank   said he  as soon as he had done reading   I am sorry for   the accident that has happened to him  but more glad it is like to be   attended with no worse consequences  Do not be melancholy  my dear   sister  you find he is in a fair way of recovery  and I hope we shall   soon have him with us  I long very much to see him   continued he   and   the more so  as I have spoke in his behalf to a general officer whom I   contracted an intimacy with at Paris  and who has promised me all the   service he can in procuring him a commission        They had some farther talk on family affairs  after which he told her he   was troubled to leave her alone  but was obliged to return to some   company he had made an elopement from when he came there  At parting  he   saluted her with a great deal of affection  desired she would be   chearful  and said  he dare believe she had too much merit ever to have   any real cause to be otherwise       This tenderness very much exhilarated her drooping spirits  she   entertained fresh hopes of being in the house with a brother  who  she   found  designed to live in the most elegant and polite manner  which was   what she had at present the most at heart of any thing in the world  She   now began to fancy he did not propose it to her  either because he did   not think she would approve of it  or because he feared  that to testify   any desire of removing her might offend Mr  Goodman  as she had boarded
