  I desired   said he   the pomp and power of undivided   dominion  and HAMET was driven from the throne which he shared with me    by a voice from heaven  I desired to break off his marriage with   ALMEIDA  and it was broken off by a prodigy  when no human power could   have accomplished my desire  It was my wish also to have the person of   ALMEIDA in my power  and this wish also has been gratified  yet I am   still wretched  But I am wretched  only because the means have not been   adequate to the end  what I have hitherto obtained  I have not desired   for itself  and of that  for which I desired it  I am not possessed  I   am  therefore  still wretched  because I am weak  With the soul of   ALMORAN  I should have the form of HAMET  then my wishes would indeed be   filled  then would ALMEIDA bless me with consenting beauty  and the   splendor of my power should distinguish only the intervals of my love    my enjoyments would then be certain and permanent  neither blasted by   disappointment  nor withered by satiety   When he had uttered these   reflections with the utmost vehemence and agitation  his face was again   obscured by gloom and despair  his posture was again fixed  and he was   falling back into his former state of silent abstraction  when he was   suddenly roused by the appearance of the Genius  the sincerity of whose   friendship he began to distrust        ALMORAN   said the Genius   if thou art not yet happy  know that my   powers are not yet exhausted  fear me not  but let thine ear be   attentive to my voice   The Genius then stretched out his hand towards   him  in which there was an emerald of great lustre  cut into a figure   that had four and twenty sides  on each of which was engraven a   different letter   Thou seest   said he   this talisman  on each side of   it is engraven one of those mysterious characters  of which are formed   all the words of all the languages that are spoken by angels  genii  and   men  This shall enable thee to change thy figure  and what  under the   form of ALMORAN  thou canst not accomplish  thou shalt still be able to   effect  if it can be effected by thee  in the form of any other  Point   only to the letters that compose the name of him whose appearance thou   wouldst assume  and it is done  Remember only  that upon him  whose   appearance thou shalt assume  thine shall be imprest  till thou   restorest his own  Hide the charm in thy bosom  and avail thyself of   its power   ALMORAN received the talisman in a transport of gratitude   and joy  and the Genius immediately disappeared       The use of this talisman was so obvious  that it was impossible to   overlook it  ALMORAN instantly conceived the design with which it was   given  and determined instantly to put it in execution   I will now     said he   assume the figure of HAMET  and my love  in all its ardour    shall be returned by ALMEIDA   As his fancy kindled at the anticipation   of his happiness  he stood musing in a pleasing suspense  and indulged   himself in the contemplation of the several gradations  by which he   would ascend to the summit of his wishes       Just at this moment  Osmyn  whom he had commanded to attend him at this   hour  approached his apartment  ALMORAN was roused by the sound of his   foot  and supposed it to be OMAR  who had again intruded upon his   privacy  he was enraged at the interruption which had broken a series of   imaginations so flattering and luxurious  he snatched out his poignard    and lifting up his arm for the stroke  hastily turned round to have   stabbed him  but seeing Osmyn  he discovered his mistake just in time to   prevent the blow       Osmyn  who was not conscious of any crime  nor indeed of any act that   could have given occasion of offence  started back terrified and   amazed  and stood trembling in suspense whether to remain or to   withdraw  ALMORAN  in the mean time  sheathed the instrument of death    and bid him fear nothing  for he should not be hurt  He then turned   about  and putting  his hand to his forehead  stood again  silent in a   musing posture  he recollected  that if he assumed the figure of HAMET    it was necessary he should give orders for HAMET to be admitted to
