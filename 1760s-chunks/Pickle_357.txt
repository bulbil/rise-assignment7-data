little time lost his command upon  the duke s disgrace  and the regiment was ordered for Ireland  being  given to Colonel Nassau  whose favour the young volunteer acquired to  such a degree  that he was recommended to the king for his ensigncy   which in all probability he would have obtained  had not the regiment  been unluckily reduced    In consequence of this reduction  which happened in the most severe  season of the year  he was obliged to return to his own country  through  infinite hardships  to which he was exposed from the narrowness of his  circumstances  And continuing still enamoured of a military life  he  entered into the regiment of Scots Greys  at that time commanded by  the late Sir James Campbell  who  being acquainted with his family and  character  encouraged him with a promise of speedy preferment  In this  corps he remained three years  during which he had no opportunity of  seeing actual service  except at the affair of Glensheel  and this  life of insipid quiet must have hung heavy upon a youth of M   s active  disposition  had not he found exercise for the mind  in reading books  of amusement  history  voyages  and geography  together with those that  treated of the art of war  ancient and modern  for which he contracted  such an eager appetite  that he used to spend sixteen hours a day in    6 22 15  3 45 PM   this employment  About that time he became acquainted with a gentleman  of learning and taste  who observing his indefatigable application   and insatiable thirst after knowledge  took upon himself the charge of  superintending his studies  and  by the direction of such an able guide   the young soldier converted his attention to a more solid and profitable  course of reading  So inordinate was his desire of making speedy  advances in the paths of learning  that within the compass of three  months  he diligently perused the writings of Locke and Malebranche   and made himself master of the first six and of the eleventh and twelfth  books of Euclid s Elements  He considered Puffendorf and Grotius with  uncommon care  acquired a tolerable degree of knowledge in the French  language  and his imagination was so captivated with the desire of  learning  that  seeing no prospect of a war  or views of being provided  for in the service  he quitted the army  and went through a regular  course of university education  Having made such progress in his  studies  he resolved to qualify himself for the church  and acquired  such a stock of school divinity  under the instructions of a learned  professor at Edinburgh  that he more than once mounted the rostrum  in the public hall  and held forth with uncommon applause  But being  discouraged from a prosecution of his plan  by the unreasonable  austerity of some of the Scotch clergy  by whom the most indifferent  and innocent words and actions were often misconstrued into levity and  misconduct  he resolved to embrace the first favourable opportunity  of going abroad  being inflamed with the desire of seeing foreign  countries  and actually set out for Holland  where  for the space of  two years  he studied the Roman law  with the law of nature and nations   under the famous professors Tolieu and Barbeyrac    Having thus finished his school education  he set out for Paris  with  a view to make himself perfect in the French language  and learn such  useful exercises  as might be acquired with the wretched remnant of his  slender estate  which was by that time reduced very low  In his journey  through the Netherlands  he went to Namur  and paid his respects to  Bishop Strickland and General Collier  by whom he was received with  great civility  in consequence of letters of recommendation  with which  he was provided from the Hague  and the old general assured him of his  protection and interest for a pair of colours  if he was disposed to  enter into the Dutch service  Though he was by that time pretty well  cured of his military quixotism  he would not totally decline the  generous proffer  for which he thanked him in the most grateful terms   telling the general that he would pay his duty to him on his return from  France  and then  if he could determine upon re engaging in the army   should think himself highly honoured in being under his command    After a stay of two months in Flanders  he proceeded to Paris  and  far  from taking up his habitation in the suburbs of St  Germain  according  to the custom of English travellers  he hired a private lodging on the  other side of the river  and associated chiefly with French officers   who  their youthful sallies being over  are allowed to be the politest  gentlemen of that kingdom  In this scheme he found his account so much   that he could not but wonder at the folly of his countrymen  who lose  the main scope of their going abroad  by spending their time
