England    This was an unfortunate office for him  in the execution of which he    6 22 15  3 45 PM   chanced to open a letter from Sir T   A    with whom  as I have already  observed  I had some correspondence at Bath  I had according to my  promise  given this gentleman a decisive answer  importing that I  was determined to remain in my present situation  but as Lord B   was  ignorant of my sentiments in that particular  and perceived from the  letter that something extraordinary had passed between us  and that  I was earnestly solicited to leave him  he was seized with the utmost  consternation and concern  and  having previously obtained the king s  leave to go abroad  set out that very night for France  leaving his  affairs in the greatest confusion    Sir T   A   hearing I was gone  without understanding the cause of my  departure  took the same route  and both arrived at Dover next day  They  heard of each other s motions  Each bribed the master of a packet boat  to transport him with expedition  but that depending upon the wind  both  reached Calais at the same time  though in different vessels  Sir  T   sent his valet de chambre post  with a letter  entreating me to  accompany him into Italy  where he would make me mistress of his whole  fortune  and to set out directly for that country  that he might not  lose me by the arrival of Lord B    promising to join me on the road   if I would consent to make him happy  I sent his messenger back with  an answer  wherein I expressed surprise at his proposals  after having  signified my resolution to him before I left England  He was scarce  dismissed  when I received another letter from Lord B    beseeching me  to meet him at Clermont  upon the road from Calais  and conjuring me  to avoid the sight of his rival  should he get the start of him in  travelling  This  however  was not likely to be the case  as Lord B    rode post  and the other was  by his corpulence  obliged to travel in  a chaise  yet  that I might not increase his anxiety  I left Paris  immediately on the receipt of his message  and met him at the appointed  place  where he received me with all the agitation of joy and fear   and asked if I had ever encouraged Sir T   A   in his addresses  I very  candidly told him the whole transaction  at which he was incensed  but  his indignation was soon appeased  when I professed my penitence  and  assured him that I had totally rejected his rival  Not that I approved  of my behaviour to Sir T    who  I own  was ill used in this affair  but  surely it was more excusable to halt here  than proceed farther in my  indiscretion    My lover being satisfied with my declaration  we went together to  Paris  being attended by the Scotchman  whom I have already mentioned   though I believe he was not over and above well pleased to see matters  thus amicably compromised  The furious knight followed us to the  capital  insisted on seeing me in person  told this North Briton  that  I was actually engaged to him  wrote every hour  and railed at my  perfidious conduct  I took no notice of these delirious transports   which were also disregarded by Lord B    till  one night  he was  exasperated by the insinuations of Mr  C    who  I believe  inflamed  his jealousy  by hinting a suspicion that I was really in love with his  rival  What passed betwixt them I know not  but he sent for me from the  opera  by a physician of Paris  who was a sort of go between among us  all  and who told me  that  if I did not come home in the instant  a  duel would be fought on my account    I was very much shocked at this information  but  by being used to  alarms from the behaviour of Lord     I had acquired a pretty good share  of resolution  and with great composure entered the room where Lord B      6 22 15  3 45 PM   was  with his companion  whom I immediately ordered to withdraw  I then  gave his lordship to understand  that I was informed of what had passed   and thought myself so much injured by the person who had just quitted  the apartment  that I would no longer live under the same roof with  him  Lord B   raved like a bedlamite  taxing me with want of candour and  affection  but I easily justified my own integrity  and gave him such  assurances of my love  that his jealousy subsided  and his spirits were  recomposed
