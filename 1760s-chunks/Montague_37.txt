     There is something exceedingly agreable in the whirl of the carrioles  which fly along at the rate of twenty miles an hour  and really hurry one out of one s senses       Our little coterie is the object of great envy  we live just as we like  without thinking of other people  which I am not sure here is prudent  but it is pleasant  which is a better thing       Emily  who is the civilest creature breathing  is for giving up her own pleasure to avoid offending others  and wants me  every time we make a carrioling party  to invite all the misses of Quebec to go with us  because they seem angry at our being happy without them  but for that very reason I persist in my own way  and consider wisely  that  though civility is due to other people  yet there is also some civility due to one s self       I agree to visit every body  but think it mighty absurd I must not take a ride without asking a hundred people I scarce know to go with me  yet this is the style here  they will neither be happy themselves  nor let any body else  Adieu   Dec  29       I will never take a beaver s word again as long as I live  there is no supporting this cold  the Canadians say it is seventeen years since there has been so severe a season  I thought beavers had been people of more honor       Adieu  I can no more  the ink freezes as I take it from the standish to the paper  though close to a large stove  Don t expect me to write again till May  one s faculties are absolutely congealed this weather   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER XLIX   49   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Jan  1   IT is with difficulty I breathe  my dear  the cold is so amazingly intense as almost totally to stop respiration  I have business  the business of pleasure  at Quebec  but have not courage to stir from the stove       We have had five days  the severity of which none of the natives remember to have ever seen equaled   tis said  the cold is beyond all the thermometers here  tho  intended for the climate       The strongest wine freezes in a room which has a stove in it  even brandy is thickened to the consistence of oil  the largest wood fire  in a wide chimney  does not throw out it s heat a quarter of a yard       I must venture to Quebec to morrow  or have company at home  amusements are here necessary to life  we must be jovial  or the blood will freeze in our veins       I no longer wonder the elegant arts are unknown here  the rigour of the climate suspends the very powers of the understanding  what then must become of those of the imagination  Those who expect to see    A new Athens rising near the pole     will find themselves extremely disappointed  Genius will never mount high  where the faculties of the mind are benumbed half the year          Tis sufficient employment for the most lively spirit here to contrive how to preserve an existence  of which there are moments that one is hardly conscious  the cold really sometimes brings on a sort of stupefaction       We had a million of beaux here yesterday  notwithstanding the severe cold   tis the Canadian custom  calculated I suppose for the climate  to visit all the ladies on New year s day  who sit dressed in form to be kissed  I assure you  however  our kisses could not warm them  but we were obliged  to our eternal disgrace  to call in rasberry brandy as an auxiliary       You would have died to see the men  they look just like so many bears in their open carrioles  all wrapped in furs from head to foot  you see nothing of the human form appear  but the tip of a nose       They have intire coats of beaver skin  exactly like Friday s in Robinson Crusoe  and casques on their heads like the old knights errant in romance  you never saw such tremendous figures  but without this kind of cloathing it would be impossible to stir out at present       The ladies are equally covered up  tho  in a less unbecoming style  they have long cloth cloaks with loose hoods  like those worn by the market women in the north of England  I have one in scarlet  the hood lined with sable  the prettiest ever seen here  in which I assure you I look amazingly handsome  the men think so  and call me the Little red riding hood  a name which becomes me as well as the hood       The Canadian ladies wear these cloaks in India silk in summer  which  fluttering in the wind  look really graceful on a fine woman       Besides our riding hoods  when we go out  we have a large buffaloe s skin under our feet  which turns up  and wraps round
