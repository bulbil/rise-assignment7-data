a native of Ireland  a man of prudence and bravery  he marched against General Lally  took the city of Wandewash in his way  reduced Carangoly  a fortress commanded by Colonel O Kenedy  and  at length  came up with the French General  who was equally desirous of the engagement  It is remarkable enough  that the commanders  on either side  were countrymen  but this did not  in the least  abate their attachment to the different crowns they served  In the morning early the French advanced within three quarters of a mile of the English line  and the cannonading began with great fury on both sides  the engagement continued with much obstinacy till about two in the afternoon  when the French gave way  and fled towards their camp  which  however  they as quickly abandoned  and left their cannon  and the field of battle  to the conquerors  Their losing the city of   232 Arcot was the consequence of this victory  and nothing now remained to them of all their vast possessions in India but Pondicherry  their strongest  largest  and most beautiful settlement in that part of the world  This capital of the French Indian power  in the days of its prosperity  exceeded all other European settlements there  in trade  opulence  and splendor  and was still the repository for all the French wealth  which remained after repeated defeats  As soon as the fortresses adjacent to this important place were reduced  Colonel Coote sat down before it  resolved upon the blockade by land  while Admiral Stevens shut up their harbour by sea  A regular siege was  at that time  impracticable  from the periodical rains which in that climate were soon expected to obstruct such operations  These disadvantages were even sufficient to repress any attempts whatsoever  but  notwithstanding the inclemency of the climate  the English commander continued before the place for full seven months  Neither rains nor storms were  in the least  able to abate their assiduity  they continued the siege  and pressed the garrison in such a manner that they were reduced to the most extreme distress  Lally  however  was resolutely bent on suffering every calamity rather than yield this last stake of French power in India  though his soldiers were obliged to feed on dogs and cats  and even bought such wretched provisions extremely dear   eight crowns having been given for the flesh of a dog  yet still he determined to hold out  In the midst of this distress  fortune seemed to give an opportunity of relief  had it been properly seconded  In the beginning of January one of those terrible storms which are common in those climates  but of whose violence we can have but little idea in Europe  wrecked a large part of the English fleet that was blocking up the harbour of Pondicherry  This was a blow   233 which once more elevated the hopes of the despairing garrison  The General now flattered himself with the hope of being supplied with provisions  and  once more  animated his soldiers  long sunk with disease  famine  fatigue  and uninterrupted adversity  He immediately wrote to one of the French residents at a Dutch settlement sor instant assistance  his eager impatience appears in the letter he sent    The English squadron is no more  Sir  Of the twelve ships they had in our road  seven are lost  crews and all  the other four dismasted  and no more than one frigate hath escaped—lose not an instant in sending boats after boats loaded with rice —The saving of Pondicherry hath been in your power once already  this opportunity neglected  the fault will be all yours  Offer great rewards —In four days I expect seventeen thousand Morattoes —In short  risque all  attempt all  force all  and send us some rice  should it be but half a garse at a time   This singular letter  however  was intercepted  and  in less than four days  he had the mortification to behold Admiral Stevens again appearing in the harbour  who had repaired his losses with all possible celerity  and the blockade now became as complete as ever  Still  however  he made no proposal to surrender  the siege was carried on by his countryman with redoubled alacrity  and  at length  he found his troops half consumed with fatigue and famine  a breach made in the rampart  and not more than one day s provision of any kind remaining  He was now reduced to an extremity that would admit of no hesitation  a signal was therefore made to cease hostilities  the principal of the Jesuits  together with two civilians  came out  and offered terms of capitulation  Lally  however  could not be prevailed upon to offer any terms  he sent a paper  filled with reproaches  against the English  to Colonel Coote  and alledged  that he would not treat with an enemy upon the honourable terms of war  who had already forfeited his honour in several   234 instances  He therefore suffered the English troops to take possession of the place  but refused to surrender it in the usual forms  This conquest terminated the power of France in India  the whole trade of that vast peninsula  from the Indus to the Ganges  became our own  The Princes of
