of his disappointing her the evening before  and to make a new   assignation for that   but what was their mutual surprise when   they came to compare notes   As he insisted on his not having   attended the appointment  she flew into a rage  and accused him   of having betrayed her basely to some of his companions  and  as   she positively asserted her having met some person there  he accused   her with equal warmth of inconstancy  and sacrificing him to some   of his rivals  on whom he vowed the severest vengeance  if he could   ever find him out        As this altercation was not carried on with much delicacy on   either side  it soon produced an absolute rupture between the   lovers  who separated with sentiments for each other very different   from those with which they met  The dog boy  in an hour or two    when his resentment cooled a little  recollected that it might be   proper to let his lord know the success of his message  who sent   for him into his presence directly  and being freed from his appre    hensions by hearing that he was but that moment returned  ordered   him to set out again instantly  and deliver the letter to the gentle    man  wherever he was  and not return without an answer        His orders were so urgent that the fellow did not dare to make   the least delay   but fortune  that seemed resolved to cross his   lordship s designs  contrived it so  that he met the gentleman on   his road  without having called at home  or received the letter that         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 265     had been left for him  Upon the dog boy s informing him of it    he concluded  aa he was much nearer to his lordship s than to his   own house  that it was the readiest way for him to wait upon him   directly without minding to send the man for the letter  Accord    ingly  he bade him turn back and ride on before him  to acquaint his   lordship of hia coming        Though it was late when he had set out the second time  he made   such haste that he reached home just at the time of his lordship s   appointment  when it unluckily coming into his head that his per    fidious mistress might possibly have taken the advantage of his   absence to make another assignation in his dog kennel  the fkst   thing he did the moment he dismounted from his horse was to go   there to see if anyone had invaded his territories  Nor was his   suspicion disappointed   for the fair one was so uneasy to unravel   the mystery of the adventure of the evening before  that she punctu    ally attended her appointment  where she had not waited many   minutes before her unknown lover arrived  The scene of their   meeting was so dark  that it was impossible for either of them to   know the other  However  she soon thought of a method to remedy   this  which was to purloin something out of his pockets  by which   she might discover who he was  without betraying herself   for she   soon found that he knew no more of her than she did of him        She had just executed her design  and was taking her leave of   her lover  when his jealous rival came upon them unawares  and   overhearing their expressions of fondness  was so enraged that he   resolved to take immediate revenge  Accordingly  he approached   them without any noise  and turning the butt end of his whip  aimed   a stroke so unluckily  though at a venture  that it felled his lordship   to the ground  The female  who instantly guessed what was the   matter  took advantage of the darkness to make her escape  which   she happily effected without any disaster  the dog boy stumbling   over his fallen adversary the first step he advanced to pursue her    His lordship  half recovered from the blow  laid hold of his anta    gonist  who  grappling with him directly  a battle ensued  in which   nobility was so rudely handled that his lordship was obliged to   declare himself  and cry out for quarter  It is easy to conceive   the confusion of the conqueror upon this discovery  He instantly   strove to disengage himself and make his escape  but his lordship   held him fast  promising to forgive him  though  if he would have   the discretion never to mention a syllable of the affair  and inform   him who the female was with whom he had made the assignation   to meet in this place the evening before
