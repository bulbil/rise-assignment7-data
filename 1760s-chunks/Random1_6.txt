of childbed  and had not an old maid servant to whom she was very dear  afforded her pity and assistance  at the hazard of incurring my grandfather s displeasure  she and the innocent fruit of her womb must have fallen miserable victims to his rigour and inhumanity —By the friendship of this poor woman  she was carried up to a garret  and immediately delivered of a man child  the story of whose unfortunate birth  he himself now relates —My father being informed of what had happened  flew to the embraces of his darling spouse  and while he loaded his off spring with paternal caresses  could not forbear shedding a flood of tears  on beholding the dear partner of his heart  for whose ease he would have sacrificed the treasures of the east  stretched upon a flock bed  in a miserable apartment  unable to protect her from the inclemencies of the weather —It is not to be supposed that the old gentleman was ignorant of what passed  tho  he affected to know nothing of the matter  and pretended to be very much surprized  when the son of his deceased eldest son  a pert boy  who lived with him as his heir apparent  acquainted him with the affair  he determined therefore to preserve no medium  but immediately  on the third day after her delivery  sent her a peremptory order to begone  and turned off the servant who had preserved her life  This behaviour so exasperated my father  that he had recourse to the most dreadful imprecations  and on his bare knees implored that heaven would renounce him  if ever he should forget or forgive the barbarity of his fire —The injuries   6 which this unhappy mother received from her removal in such circumstances  and the want of necessaries where she lodged  together with her grief and anxiety of mind  soon threw her into a languishing disorder which put an end to her life  My father  who loved her tenderly  was so affected with her death  that he remained six weeks deprived of his senses  during which time  the people where he lodged  carried the infant to the old man  who relented so far  on hearing the melancholy story of his daughter in law s death  and the deplorable condition of his son  that he sent the child to nurse  and ordered my father to be carried home to his house  where he soon recovered the use of his reason —Whether this hard hearted judge felt any remorse for his cruel treatment of his son and daughter  or  which is more probable  was afraid his character would suffer in the neighbourhood  he professed great sorrow for his conduct to my father  whose delirium was succeeded by a profound melancholy and reserve  At length he disappeared  and notwithstanding all imaginable inquiry  could never be heard of  which confirmed most people in the opinion of his having made away with himself in a fit of despair —How I understood the particulars of my birth  will appear in the course of these memoirs     7  CHAP  II   I grew up—am hated by my relations—sent to school—neglected by my grandfather—maltreated by my master—seasoned to adversity—form cabals against the pedant—debarred access to my grandfather—hunted by his heir—demolish the teeth of his tutor   THERE were not wanting some  who suspected my uncles of being concerned in my father s fate  on the supposition that they would all share in the patrimony destined for him  and this conjecture seemed supported by reflecting  that in all his calamities they never discovered the least inclination to serve him  but  on the contrary  by all the artifices in their power  fed his father s resentment  and strengthened his resolution of leaving him to misery and want —But people of judgment treated this insinuation as an idle chimera  because had my relations been so wicked as to consult their interest by committing such an attrocious crime  the fate of my father would have extended to me too  whose life was another obstacle to their expectation —Mean while  I grew apace  and as I strongly resembled my father  who was the darling of the tenants  I wanted nothing which their indigent circumstances could afford  but their favour was a weak resource against the jealous enmity of my cousins  who  the more my infancy promised  conceived   8 the more implacable hatred against me  and before I was six years of age  had so effectually blockaded my grandfather  that I never saw him but by stealth  when I sometimes made up to his chair as he fat to view his labourers in the field  on which occasions  he would stroak my head  bid me be a good boy  and promise he would take care of me —I was soon after sent to school at a village hard by  of which he had been dictator time out of mind  but as he neither paid for my board  nor supplied me with clothes  books  and other necessaries I required  my condition was very ragged and contemptible  and the schoolmaster  who through fear of my grandfather taught me gratis  gave himself no concern about the progress I made under his instruction —In spite of all these difficulties and disgraces  I became a good proficient in the Latin tongue  and as soon as I could write tolerably  pestered my grandfather with letters to
