therefore just mention one   or two of his actions  from which you may  in some measure  form   a judgment of the whole      Having a pressing occasion  some time ago  for an hundred   guineas  he appUed to one of those necessary attendants of the   great  who  at the moderate interest of five hundred per cent   are   always ready to supply them with money to discharge their debts   of honour  This friendly gentleman  being well acquainted with   the character of the borrower  made many scruples to comply   with his request  tiU at length he suffered Inmself to be prevailed   upon conditionally  that  if the principal and premium were not   paid in a week  he should receive a guinea as a further gratuity   then  and every time after that he should demand his money  tiU   it was paid  Accordingly  at the end of the week  he made his   demand  and  as he expected  received his guinea   from which   time he took care to call upon him every second or third day  tiU         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 43     he had received his money more than twice told thus  in single   goiaeas  for forbearance   always timing his applications  when he   saw his debtor in company with persons before whom he would   not even enter into an expostulation  for fear of having the affair   known  so that as soon as he saw him approach  without waiting   to be asked  he used to puU out his purse  and calling him to him    gave him a guinea  to go and buy something for him  an errand   the other sufficiently understood      The constant repetition of this could not always escape observa    tion  nor was the cause of it unsuspected by most of his acquaint    ance   some of whom happening to hint it to him one evening    when wine had taken away all reserve  he  who was above being   ashamed of anything  honestly owned the whole transaction  and   joined in the general laugh at his own folly  however  as the   secret was now out  he resolved to submit to the imposition no   longer  and the next time his friend waited upon him  instead of   hurrying him away as before  he publicly entered into a discussion   of his demand  and as he could not deny his having received   more than double what he had lent  the debt was adjudged by   the company to be sufficiently discharged  and he was Uterally   sent off without his errand      This story shows only the levity and inconsiderateness of his   temper  and the distresses in which they entangled him   but the   following is of a blacker hue and will prove that he is capable of   doing anything to extricate himseff from those distresses  and   provide for the gratification of his passions      Not very long ago  a young gentleman  who had a miUtary turn    collected the whole of his small fortune  to purchase himself a   commission in the army  Having lodged his money in the hands   of his agent  who  for the convenience of making use of it  and to   enhance the price of his own trouble  was in no haste to dispatch   the affair  he made an excursion to the coimtry town  in which   this gentleman s seat was  and where he happened to be at that   time      As the hospitaUty of his temper made his house open to every   stranger  who had the appearance of a gentleman  the young   soldier soon became acquainted with him  and in return for the   friendship for which he mistook the general affability of his   conversation  and to display his own importance  told him his   present situation  and the method he had taken to procure success   to his hopes of a truncheon  His friend expressed the strongest   approbation of his spirit  and encouraged his hopes  but told him   that he had chosen the worst way of entering into the army  as the   sum of money  which he had given the agent to purchase him only   a pair of colours  applied properly to some of the persons in office    and backed by good interest  would not only procure him a   cometcy of horse  at present  which was of three times that value    but would also establish such an interest for him  as should greatly   accelerate his rise to still higher promotions      Struck with such a promising prospect as this speech opened to   him  the young gentleman answered  that he was sensible of the   truth of what the other said  but that it
