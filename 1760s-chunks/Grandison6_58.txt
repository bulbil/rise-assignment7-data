my uncle  She only said to me  when she saw me  I have had a little debate with your uncle  We must   144 do as well as we can with him  my dear  He means well   Thursday Morning  October 19   AFTER breakfast  first one  then another  dropt away  and left only Sir Charles and me together  Lucy was the last that went  and the moment she was withdrawn  while I was thinking to retire to dress  he placed himself by me  Think me not abrupt  my dear Miss Byron  said he  that I take almost the only opportunity which has offered of entering upon a subject that is next my heart   I found my face glow  I was silent   You have given me hope  madam  All your friends encourage that hope  I love  I revere  your friends  What I have now to petition for  is  A confirmation of the hope I have presumed upon  CAN you  madam  the Female delicacy is more delicate than that of man can be  unequally as you may think yourself circumstanced with a man who owns that once he could have devoted himself to another Lady  CAN you say  that the man before you is the man whom you CAN  whom you DO  prefer to any other   He stopt  expecting my answer   After some hesitations  I have been accustomed▪ Sir  said I  by those friends whom you so deservedly value  to speak nothing but the simplest truth  In an article of this moment  I should be inexcusable  if—  I stopt  His eyes were fixed upon my face  For my life I could not speak  yet wished to be able to speak—  If  If what  madam  and he snatched my hand  bowed his face upon it  held it there  not looking up to mine  I could then speak—If thus urged  and by SIR CHARLES GRANDISON—I did not speak my heart—I answer—Sir—I CAN—I DO  I wanted  I thought  just then  to shrink into myself   He kissed my hand with fervour  dropt down on   145 one knee  again kissed it—You have laid me  madam  under everlasting obligation  And will you permit me  before I rise—loveliest of women  will you permit me  to beg an early day —I have many affairs on my hands  many more in design  now I am come  as I hope  to settle in my native country for the rest of my life  My chief glory will be  to behave commendably in the private life  I wish not to be a public man  and it must be a very particular call  for the Service of my King and Country united  that shall draw me out into public notice  Make me  madam  soon  the happy husband I hope to be  I prescribe not to you the time  But you are above empty forms  May I presume to hope  it will be before the end of a month to come   He had forgot himself  He said  he would not prescribe to me   After some involuntary hesitations—I am afraid of nothing so much  just now  Sir  said I  as appearing  to a man of your honour and penetration  affected  Rise  Sir  I beseech you  I cannot bear—  I will  madam  and rise as well as kneel  to thank you  when you have answered a question so very important to my happiness   Before I could resume  Only believe me  madam  said he  that my urgency is not the insolent urgency of one who imagines a Lady will receive as a compliment his impatience  And if you have no scruple that you think of high importance  add  I beseech you  to the obligation you have laid him under to your condescending goodness  and add with that frankness of heart which has distinguished you in my eyes above all women  the very high one  of an early day   I looked down—I could not look up—I was afraid of being thought affected—Yet how could I so soon think of obliging him   He proceeded—You are silent  madam —Propitious be your silence  Allow me to enquire of your   146aunt  for your kind  your condescending acquiescence  I will not now urge you further  I will be all hope   Let me say  Sir  that I must not be precipitated  These are very early days   Much more was in my mind to say  but I hesitated—I could not speak  Surely  my dear Ladies  it was too too eary an urgency  And can a woman be wholly unobservant of custom  and the laws of her Sex —Something is due to fashion in dress  however absurd that dress might have appeared in the last age  as theirs do to us  or may in the next  And shall not those customs which have their foundation in modesty  and are characteristic of the gentler Sex  be intitled to excuse  and more than excuse   He saw my confusion  Let me not  my dearest life  distress you  said he  Beautiful as your emotion is  I cannot enjoy
