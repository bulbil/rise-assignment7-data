 all powerful monarch as he is  he might not find the accomplishment of his desires so easy  Lucretia  though brought up behind the scenes  is not without virtuous principles  whatever pleasure she may take in applause and professional reputation  she had much rather preserve the character of a good girl  than establish that of a great actress   Aunt  said little Marialva  joining in the conversation  why conjure up monsters only to lay them again  I shall never be at a loss to repel the king s advances  because his taste is too refined to stoop so low  But  charming Lucretia  said I  if such a thing should happen  would you be cruel enough to let him languish like a common lover  Why not  answered she  Setting virtue aside  my vanity would he more flattered by my own resistance than by the tribute of his affection  I was not a little surprised to hear a pupil of Laura s school talk so properly  and to find that with so free an education she imbibed such unusual principles of morality   The king  impatient to see Lucretia  went to the play next evening  The piece was got up with music and dancing  to shew our young actress off to the best advantage  My eyes were fixed on his majesty  but he completely eluded my penetration by an obstinate gravity  On the following day  the minister said  Santillane  I have just been with the king  who has been talking about Lucretia  with so much animation  that I doubt not but he is smitten  and  as I told him that you had sent for her from Toledo  he expressed a wish to confer with you in private on the subject  orders are given for your admittance  run  and bring me back an account of what passes   I flew to the palace  and found the king alone  He was walking up and down  in much apparent perplexity  He put several questions to me about Lucretia  made me relate her history  and then asked whether the little jade had not been tampering with chastity already  I boldly assured him to the contrary  though such pledges were somewhat hazardous in general  but mine was taken  and gave the prince much pleasure  If so  replied he  I select you for my agent with Lucretia  let her become acquainted with her triumph from your lips  He then put a box of jewels into my hand  worth fifty thousand crowns  with a message begging her acceptance of them  and promising more substantial proofs of his affection   Before I went on my errand  I reported progress to my lord duke  That minister  I thought  would be more vexed than rejoiced at it  supposing that he had his own views of gallantry towards Lucretia  and would learn with regret the rivalship of his master  but I was mistaken  Far from appearing chagrined  his joy was so excessive  that it would ooze out at his tongue  in words which were not quite lost on the hearer   Indeed  friend Philip  then I have you in my clutches  while your pleasures lead you  your business must be left to me   This side speech explained to me the plot  an amorous prince  and a long headed minister  My orders were to execute my commission as speedily as possible  with the assurance that the first lord in the land would be proud to stand in my shoes  Besides  there was no pimp of rank  as in the former case  to seize the profit and leave the infamy with me  the honour and emolument were now exclusively my own   Thus did his excellency relish the ingredients of pandarism to my palate  and I tasted them with the greediness  but not without the qualms of an epicure  for since my imprisonment I had become regenerate  and did not take pride in dirty work  because my employer washed his hands in perfumed water  But though conscience was awake  interest was not asleep  I was no longer a villain for the fun of it  but my compliance would confirm my footing with the minister  and him it was my duty  at all events  to please   My first appeal was to Laura in private  I opened the negotiation delicately  and presented my credentials in the form of the jewel box  The lady was thrown off her guard by the display  Signor Gil Blas  cried she  you are one of my oldest friends  and I must not play the hypocrite  strait laced morals are inconsistent with the discipline of my sect  Nothing can be more delightful to me than a conquest  which throws such a game into our hands  But  between ourselves  I am afraid Lucretia is not so enlightened as we are  though a daughter of Thalia  she has taken the better behaved goddesses for her school mistresses  and given a rebuff to two young noblemen of amiable manners and large fortunes  They were not kings  you will say  and truly we may hope that Lucretia s virtue will be too undisciplined to stand a royal siege  but you must remember the event is hazardous  and I shall not interpose my authority to compel her  If  far
