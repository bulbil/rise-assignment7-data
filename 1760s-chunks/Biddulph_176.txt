setting out was no other than that of a common writing clerk in a merchant’s counting house at Jamaica  from whence I wrote twice to your father  but never had any answer  I interrupted him to tell him  I had heard my father say he had got one letter from him  and had writ to him in return  and afterwards made many enquiries after him without success  Perhaps he might  said he  but I never received it  nor heard of any enquiries made  which piqued me so  that I resolved never to write again  In a little time I made myself so useful to my master that he grew exceedingly fond of me  and having no heir but an only daughter  who it seems had conceived an inclination for me  though without my suspecting it  but which her father had by some means discovered  he frankly made an offer of her to me in marriage  with an assurance of leaving me all that he was worth at his decease  and an immediate proffer of entering into partnership with him  The only return he required on my part  was to change my name  and assume his  which was Collett  I made no scruple of complying  for though my regard to the young lady had never risen to what is commonly called love  I yet thought her in all respects an unexceptionable match  I married her  my patron punctually fulfilled his promise  and at the end of three years I found myself by his death in possession of a considerable estate  The following year I lost my wife in childbed of her first child  who died with its mother  The changing my name was probably the occasion of my not being found out by those employed to enquire after me  and I perhaps ought now to acknowlege myself careless in not acquainting my friends with my good fortune   I had such uncommon success in trade that my wealth increased amazingly  In about five years after the decease of my first wife  I married the widow of a merchant  with whom I got an immense fortune  This lady I truly loved  She was an amiable creature  I had one son by her  a fine youth  and we lived happily together for twelve years  at the end of which it pleased God to take from me both wife    and child  Poor man  his tears began to flow here  He proceeded  After this loss my own life began to grow tiresome to me  I had more riches than I knew what to do with  and had nobody to leave them to  my health began to decline  I grew weary of the place  and resolved  partly to divert my melancholy  and partly through affection to my native country  to see England once more  I settled my affairs in the best manner  sent considerable sums of money over before me  and brought a large one with me  During my voyage the whim took me  that I would enquire privately after your family  and present myself to you as I have done  in order to make trial of your dispositions  resolving  according as I found you worthy of it  to share my fortune amongst you  as I knew I had no other relations in the world   I have been in England above a month  The first thing I did was to go down into Wiltshire  where I was soon informed that your father and mother were dead  and that your brother was married and resided for the most part in London  you  I was told  had been married and was a widow  but I could learn no more about you  On my return to town I soon found where your brother lived  and had the pleasure to hear a good character of him  but I had determined to make my own experiment on him  and I did intend  had he received me ever so kindly  to have made the same experiment on you  before I disclosed my plot to either of you   I dressed myself in these old clothes on purpose  and what the success of my scheme has been you know  Your brother  narrow hearted  inhuman wretch  I blot forever from my thoughts  it will be the better for you  though I have more than enough for you both   Your kindness  I tell you again  my valuable relation  I will repay an hundred fold  Accept of that bill in your hand for your present use  I am sure you want it  and accept of it only as an earnest of my future friendship towards you  That brother  in affluence himself  who could see his sister  such a sister want  must have lost all regard to ties of blood  and ’tis no wonder that I  so much further removed in kindred  met with such treatment at his hands   See  my Cecilia  what an amazing turn of fortune  What could I do but lift up my eyes  as I did my heart  in silent adoration of that God  who is a father to the fatherless  and defendeth the cause of the widow   It was some time before I could frame my mind to discourse on ordinary subjects  I gratefully accepted my cousin’s noble present
