maker  or to buy   something in town  and begged leave that Miss Forward should accompany   her  saying  she wanted her choice in what she was to purchase  Sparkish   was always made acquainted when they were to go out  and never failed to   give them a meeting       Miss Forward had a great deal of the coquette in her nature  she knew   how to play at fast and loose with her lover  and  young as she was    took a pride in mingling pain with the pleasure she bestowed  Miss Betsy   was a witness of all the airs the other gave herself on this occasion    and the artifices she made use of  in order to secure the continuance of   his addresses  so that  thus early initiated into the mystery of   courtship  it is not to be wondered at  that when she came to the   practice  she was so little at a loss       This intercourse  however  lasted but a small time  their meetings were   too frequent  and too little circumspection used in them not to be   liable to discovery  The governess was informed that  in spite of all   her care  the young folks had been too cunning for her  on which she   went to the father of Sparkish  acquainted him with what she knew of the   affair  and intreated he would lay his commands on his son to refrain   all conversation with any of the ladies under her tuition  The old   gentleman flew into a violent passion on hearing his son had already   begun to think of love  he called for him  and after having rated his   youthful folly in the severest manner  charged him to relate the whole   truth of what had passed between him and the young lady mentioned by the   governess  The poor lad was terrified beyond measure at his father s   anger  and confessed every particular of his meetings with Miss Forward   and her companion  and thus Miss Betsy s share of the contrivance was   brought to light  and drew on her a reprimand equally severe with that   Miss Forward had received  The careful governess would not entirely   depend on the assurance the father of Sparkish had given her  and   resolved to trust neither of the ladies out of her sight  while that   young gentleman remained so near them  which she knew would be but a   short time  he having finished his school learning  and was soon to go   to the university  To prevent also any future strategems being laid   between Miss Betsy and Miss Forward  she took care to keep them from   ever being alone together  which was a very great mortification to them    but a sudden turn soon after happened in the affairs of Miss Betsy    which put all I have been relating entirely out of her head                CHAPTER II       Shews Miss Betsy in a new scene of life  and the frequent opportunities   she had of putting in practice those lessons she was beginning to   receive from her young instructress at the boarding school          Though it is certainly necessary to inculcate into young girls all   imaginable precaution in regard to their behaviour towards those of   another sex  yet I know not if it is not an error to dwell too much upon   that topick  Miss Betsy might  possibly  have sooner forgot the little   artifices she had seen practised by Miss Forward  if her governess  by   too strenuously endeavouring to convince her how unbecoming they were    had not reminded her of them  besides  the good old gentlewoman was far   stricken in years  time had set his iron fingers on her cheeks  had left   his cruel marks on every feature of her face  and she had little remains   of having ever been capable of exciting those inclinations she so much   condemned  so that what she said seemed to Miss Betsy as spoke out of   envy  or to shew her authority  rather than the real dictates of truth       I have often remarked  that reproofs from the old and ugly have much   less efficacy than when given by persons less advanced in years  and who   may be supposed not altogether past sensibility themselves of the   gaieties they advise others to avoid       Though all the old gentlewoman said  could not persuade Miss Betsy there   was any harm in Miss Forward s behaviour towards young Sparkish  yet she   had the complaisance to listen to her with all the attention the other   could expect or desire from her       She was  indeed  as yet too young to consider of the justice of the   other s reasoning  and her future conduct shewed  also  she was
