 and therefore retired  She shut herself up  and about noon  sent  sealed up    278 a Letter  which I will English as well as I can  thus directed   To her ever honoured  ever indulgent Father and Mother  CLEMENTINA DELLA PORRETTA    HOW did my whole Soul aspire after the veil —Insuperable obstacles having arisen against the union of your child with one exalted man  how averse was I to enter into covenant with any other   It was your pleasure  my Lord  it was yours  madam  that I should not be indulged in the aspiration  You had the goodness to oblige me in my averseness   The Chevalier Grandison has since convinced me▪ by generous and condescending reasonings  that I could not  in duty to the will of my two grandfathers  and in justice to my elder brother and his descendants  renew my wishes after the cloister  I submit   But now  what is to be done  what can I do  to make you  my dearest parents  and my brothers  happy  Olivia triumphs over me  My situation is disagreeable  I  who ought to be a comfort to my friends  have been  I still am  a trouble to them all —The Chevalier Grandison and his excellent Lady  have signified to me  more than once  that they expect from me the completion of their earthly happiness  And what is this life  but a short  a transitory passage to a better   Have I not declined accepting the vows of the first of men  The only man I ever saw with a wish to be united to him  Decline them on motives  that all my friends think do me honour   Have I ever  dear as the struggle cost me  repented the glorious self denial  And what precedents of selfdenial  wholly yours by laws divine and human  as I am  have you  my ever indulgent parents  set me     279 Is there a man I would prefer to him whom my friends are solicitous to commend to my favour   Cannot I  in performing my duty to my parents  perform all those duties of life  which performed  may intitle me to a blessed hope   Shall I contend in and through life  to carry a point  that at the awful close of it will appear to me  as nothing —  Let me make a proposal—On a supposition that you  Sir  that you  Madam  whose patient goodness to me has been unexampled   and every one of my friends  favour the Count of Belvedere as much as ever—I have always acknowledged his merits—  Permit me a year s consideration from the present time  to examine the state of my head and heart  and at the end of that year  allow me to determine  and I will endeavour  my dear parents  to make your wishes  and my duty  honour  conscience   divested of caprice  fancy  petulance  my sole guides in the result  as well as in the discussion  The Chevalier Grandison  his Lady  Father Marescutti  and Mrs  Beaumont  shall be judges between my relations and me  if there be occasion   But  as it would be unreasonable to expect  that the Count of Belvedere should attend an issue so uncertain  for I would rather die  than give my vows to a man to whom I could not do justice both with regard to head and heart  so  I make it my earnest request to him  that he will look upon himself to be absolutely free to make his own choice  and to pursue his own measures  as opportunities offer  Rejoiced at my heart should I be  to have reason to congratulate him on his nuptials with a woman of the soundness of whose mind he could have no doubt  and whose heart never knew another attachment   I would humbly propose  as a measure highly expedient  that the ever obliging Chevalier Grandison   280 and his truly admirable Lady will permit us  as soon as possible  to depart from England   O my friends accuse me not of levity in your hearts  I obeyed in the rash voyage hither  an Impulse that appeared to me irresistable  And let us leave it to his never forfeited honour  to bring over to us  as soon as can be convenient  his Lady  his Sisters  and their Lords  as they have made us hope  And that a family friendship may be cultivated among us  as if a legal relation had taken place   But allow me to declare  that if my cousin Laurana shall be found to have entertained the least reason to hope that she might one day be Countess of Belvedere  that that expectation alone  whatever turn my health may take  shall be considered as finally determining the Count s expectations on me  for I never will be looked upon as the rival of my cousin   And now  blessed Virgin mother of the God of my hope  do thou enable me to be an humble instrument of restoring to the hearts of my honoured and indulgent parents  and to those of my affectionate brothers and other friends  the tranquility of which I have so unhappily
