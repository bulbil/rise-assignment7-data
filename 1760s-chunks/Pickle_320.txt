desponding manner in which they were delivered  begged to know if  any new obstacle was raised  by some late change in his sentiments or  situation  And he  in order to avoid a painful explanation  told  her  that he had long despaired of being able to vanquish Emilia s  resentment  and for that reason quitted the pursuit  which he would  never renew  howsoever his heart might suffer by that resolution  though  he took Heaven to witness  that his love  esteem  and admiration of her   were not in the least impaired  But the true motive of his laying aside  his design  was the consciousness of his decayed fortune  which  by  adding to the sensibility of his pride  increased the horror of another  repulse  She expressed her concern for this determination  both on his  own account  and in behalf of Emilia  whose happiness  in her opinion   depended upon his constancy and affection  and she would have questioned  him more minutely about the state of his affairs  had not he discouraged  the inquiry  by seeking to introduce another subject of conversation   After mutual protestations of friendship and regard  he promised to  visit her often  during her residence in town  and took his leave in a  strange perplexity of mind  occasioned by the images of love  intruding  upon the remonstrances of carking care  He had some time ago forsaken  those extravagant companions with whom he had rioted in the heyday of  his fortune  and begun to consort with a graver and more sober species  of acquaintance  But he now found himself disabled from cultivating  the society of these also  who were men of ample estates and liberal  dispositions  in consequence of which  their parties were too expensive  for the consumptive state of his finances  so that he was obliged to  descend to another degree  and mingle with a set of old bachelors and  younger brothers  who subsisted on slender annuities  or what is called  a bare competency in the public funds  This association was composed of  second hand politicians and minor critics  who in the forenoon saunter  in the Mall  or lounge at shows of pictures  appear in the drawing room  once or twice a week  dine at an ordinary  decide disputes in a  coffee house  with an air of superior intelligence  frequent the pit  of the playhouse  and once in a month spend an evening with some noted  actor  whose remarkable sayings they repeat for the entertainment of  their ordinary friends   After all  he found something comfortable enough in the company of  these gentlemen  who never interested his passions to any violence of  transport  nor teased him with impertinent curiosity about his private  affairs  For  though many of them had maintained a very long  close  and  friendly correspondence with each other  they never dreamt of inquiring  into particular concerns  and if one of the two who were most intimately  connected  had been asked how the other made a shift to live  he would  have answered with great truth   Really  that is more than I know    Notwithstanding this phlegmatic indifference  which is of the true  English production  they were all inoffensive  good natured people  who  loved a joke and a song  delighted in telling a merry story  and prided  themselves in the art of catering  especially in the articles of fish   venison  and wild fowl   Our young gentleman was not received among them on the footing of a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   common member  who makes interest for his admission  he was courted as a  person of superior genius and importance  and his compliance looked upon  as an honour to their society  This their idea of his pre eminence was  supported by his conversation  which  while it was more liberal and  learned than that to which they had been accustomed  was tinctured  with an assuming air  so agreeably diffused  that  instead of producing  aversion  it commanded respect  They not only appealed to him  in all  doubts relating to foreign parts  to which one and all of them were  strangers  but also consulted his knowledge in history and divinity   which were frequently the topics of their debates  and  in poetry of  all kinds  he decided with such magisterial authority  as even  weighed against the opinions of the players themselves  The variety of  characters he had seen and observed  and the high spheres of life in  which he had so lately moved  furnished him with a thousand entertaining  anecdotes  When he became a little familiarized to his disappointments   so that his natural vivacity began to revive  he flashed among them in  such a number of bright sallies  as struck them with admiration  and  constituted himself a classic in wit  insomuch that they began to retail  his remnants  and even invited some particular friends to come and hear  him hold forth  One of the players  who had for many years strutted  about the taverns in the neighbourhood of Covent
