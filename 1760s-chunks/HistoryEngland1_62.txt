most despicable opinion of it  yet  when I read the Latin productions of some of the priests of that period  I cannot avoid allowing the authors no small share of erudition  The truth is  learning was separated from the purposes of common life  at that time  but by no means unknown or neglected by the clergy  as we are taught to believe   I am   c   LETTER XXIV   WHATEVER side was victorious  in these times of civil slaughter  could confirm their injustice with the shew of authority  The parliament usually followed the conqueror  and fixed him upon the throne  when he had an army to back his pretensions  Edward was immediately  upon this victory  confirmed by their unanimous   182 approbation  while Henry and his Queen were to seek for new resources in France and Scotland  No calamity was able to abate Margaret s perseverance  though so often overcome  yet she was once more resolved to enter England with five thousand men  granted her by the French King  bringing the unfortunate Henry with her to enforce her claims  Her usual ill fortune attended her  her little fleet was dispersed by a tempest  and she herself entered the Tweed with no small difficulty  Again  however  she offered her enemy battle  and was again defeated  near Hexham  The loss of this battle seemed to deprive her of every resource  she and her husband were now obliged to find safety in a separate flight  without attendants  and without even the necessaries of life  The weak unfortunate Monarch  almost always imprudent  and consequently unsuccessful  thought he could lie concealed in England  his error was soon attended with the natural consequences  he was taken prisoner  carried to London with ignominy  and confined in the Tower   Margaret was rather more fortunate than he  for she escaped  with the Dukes of Somerset and Exeter  out of the kingdom  and retired to her father  who  though very poor  strove  as well as he could  to supply her with the mere necessaries of life  You are not to suppose the miseries of the great  at those times  were fictitious  as we find them at present  they  in reality  endured every calamity that poverty now inflicts on the obscurest of wretches  Philip de Comines  says  he saw the Duke of Exeter following the Duke of Burgundy s equi  barefoot  and serving for his livelihood as a footman  This was a strange situation for a Lord  who had conducted armies    183 and was allied to Kings and Princes  but the times were barbarous  the Princes on the coasts of Negroland experience such reverses of fortune at this very day   Edward  being now  by means of Warwick  fixed upon the throne  reigned in peace and security  A spirit of gallantry reigned in his court  mixed with the cruelty which seemed the distinguishing feature of those times of discord  In the very same palace which one day smoaked with blood  a ant or a mask appeared the day sollowing  and the King would at once gallant a mistress and inspect an execution   As his amours  however  were likely to dissatisfy his subjects  the Earl of Warwick advised him to marry  and  with his consent  went over to France to procure him Bona of Savoy  and the match was accordingly  by his means  concluded  But  whilst the Earl was hastening the negotiation in France  the King himself put an effectual stop to it at home  by marrying Elizabeth Woodville  with whom he had fallen in love  and whom he had vainly strove to debauch  Having thus given Warwick real cause of offence  he was resolved to widen the breach by driving him from the council  We are apt to hate the man we have offended  as much as the man who has offended us  Edward was no sooner established in security by Warwick  than he began to be ungrateful  Warwick  whose prudence was equal to his bravery  soon made use of both to assist his revenge  he seduced Clarence  the King s brother  and  to confirm him in his interests  makes him his son in law  and now  finding his plot ready for execution  flies into open rebellion  Vengeance seemed to be the only motive he had in view  plots  truces  stratagems    184 and negotiations  followed each other in a rapid succession  But Warwick  long acquainted with intrigue and dissimulation  was  at last  too subtle for the young King  inviting him  by a seeming promise of composition  to his house  he threw Edward off his guard  and Warwick  seizing the opportunity  made him a prisoner   Nothing now appeared that could oppose Warwick s designs  he therefore disbanded his troops as unnecessary  and Edward was consigned to the custody of the Archbishop of York  But soon an accident happened that overthrew all Warwick s expectations  Edward s behaviour  in confinement  was so very obliging  that he got leave  upon some occasions  to hunt in a park adjoining the place of his confinement  from thence he one day made his escape  by the assistance of a couple of his friends
