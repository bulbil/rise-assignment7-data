known his opinion of her  he wrote to her  and inclosed a double piece of paper in the letter  which being a pregnant proof of his generosity  procured him a visit  as did a repeated present the desired favour   Young Ed—ds was the richest of all her admirers under the rank of nobility    91 and Miss ELLIOT  availing herself of his extraordinary fondness  obtained from him very considerable  as well as very frequent draughts  and by that means lived as elegant as any woman in the whole city  Those who are acquainted with the pride of the human heart  will not be at all surprised  when they hear that our heroine was now as much the envy of the women  as she was the admiration of the men  The latter thought the charms of the whole sex centered in the amiable Miss ELLIOT  while the former invented numberless aspersions to villify her character  representing her vanity as unparalleled  her pride as insupportable  and her avarice as insatiable   Notwithstanding the calumny of her sex  which arose from the most inveterate envy to our heroine  who supplanted most of them in the admiration of the men  by the splendor of her appearance  she had many adorers  and met with divers adventures  no less extraordinary than entertaining   A certain noble lord  whose marriage being of some years standing  was grown    90 weary of the embraces of his lady  though a woman of very amiable accomplishments both of mind and person  imagining he saw in Miss ELLIOT qualities that would excite sensations superior to any he had hitherto experienced  found means to procure a visit  and would have abruptly opened his design  had he not discovered  from the reserved manner of her behaviour  that some degree of ceremony was requisite by way of prelude   He submitted to the custom she imposed  and after two hours distant conference took his leave  but  on the second visit  he presented her with a gold snuff box  containing a very valuable commodity  which prevented any farther remonstrances on her part  However  she informed him  she was engaged all the week with Mr  Ed—ds  and would be at his service at the expiration of that time  The appointed period being come  his lordship waited on her  and presented her with a diamond ring  with which she seemed extremely satisfied  He passed the evening with her  and was so enraptured with her company  that he not only protested   92 he had never been so happy in his life  but repeated his visits every other day for a month  when he made her very handsome presents  and she made him the satisfactory returns   During her interviews with this noble lord  she had received from him  when cash run short  jewels to a considerable amount  In these she appeared at the play  sitting very near to the lady of her noble keeper  whose most magnificent apparatus of dress being disposed of to support the extravagance of her lord  she had nothing but paste ornaments about her  and therefore  observing her own diamonds on a celebrated courtezan  was so excessively  and indeed justly chagrined  that she left the play house before the representation was concluded   This adventure was succeeded by another  that gratified the spleen and envy of the malicious part of the sex for some days  Miss ELLIOT was riding one morning in Hyde Park for the benefit of the air  in compliance with the custom of the   93bean mende  when her horse  taking fright  ran away with her  A group of beaux presently came to her assistance  and our heroine being risen from the ground  found she had a violent pain in her right hip  on which a chair being sent for  she was conveyed home  To this accident alone  as we shall see in the sequel  she owed all her future good fortune   When she came home she was put to bed  and a surgeon being sent for  he gave it as his opinion  that the hurt she had received was far from being dangerous  and that if proper care were taken of her  she might  after a dew days  appear again in public as before this accident happened to her   Amongst the gentlemen who were present when she received the accident  there was one who seemed more attentive than all the rest to lend her assistance  He was no other than the D— of C—  who having learned the place of her abode  resolved to visit her as soon as she was able to receive company    94 He therefore sent her several polite messages  signifying the great desire he had of being farther acquainted with her  and his intention of coming to see her as soon as ever her present indisposition would allow her to receive visits   She  who was overjoyed at the thoughts of being taken notice of by so respectable a personage  returned answers suitable to the letters she received  and  at his desire  appointed a day when it would be most convenient for him to come to see her  He obeyed the summons  and this first interview engaged her so deeply in his affections  that he took her immediately into keeping  on condition of her laying aside all
