Ostrog dominions  He even aspired at the empire of Tartary  and had formed the design of deposing the great Cham  who was intimately connected with the princess of Ostrog  Inspired by these projects  he  at the beginning of winter  suddenly poured like a deluge into one of the provinces that owned this Amazon s sway  but he had hardly gained the passes of the mountains  when he found himself opposed by a numerous body of forces  assembled under the command of a celebrated general  who gave him battle without hesitation  and handled him so roughly  that he was fain to retreat into the demesnes of Pol hassan  where he spent the greatest part of the winter in exacting contributions and extending the reign of desolation      136 All the petty princes and states who hold of the great Cham  began to tremble for their dominions  and the Cham himself was so much alarmed at the lawless proceedings of Brut an tiffi  that he convoked a general assembly of all the potentates who possessed fiefs in the empire  in order to deliberate upon measures for restraining the ambition of this ferocious freebooter  Among others  the Dairo of Japan  as lord of the farm of Yesso  sent a deputy to this convention  who  in his master s name  solemnly disclaimed and professed his detestation of Brut an tiffi s proceedings  which  indeed  were universally condemned  The truth is  he  at this period  dreaded the resentment of all the other coestates rather more than he feared the menaces of Brut an tiffi  and  in particular  apprehended a sentence of outlawry from the Cham  by which at once he would have forfeited    137 all legal title to his beloved farm  Brut an tiffi  on the other hand  began to raise a piteous clamour  as if he meant to excite compassion  He declared himself a poor injured prince  who had been a dupe to the honesty and humanity of his own heart  He affirmed that the Amazon of Ostrog had entered into a conspiracy against him  with the Mantchoux Tartars  and prince Akousti  he published particulars of this dreadful conjuration  which appeared to be no other than a defensive alliance formed in the apprehension that he would fall upon some of them  without any regard to treaty  as he had done on a former occasion  when he seized one of the Amazon s best provinces  He publickly taxed the Dairo of Japan with having prompted him to commence hostilities  and hinted that the said Dairo was to have shared his conquests  He openly intreated his co estates to    138 interpose their influence towards the re establishment of peace in the empire  and gave them privately to understand  that he would ravage their territories without mercy  should they concur with the Cham in any sentence to his prejudice   As he had miscarried in his first attempt  and perceived a terrible cloud gathering around him  in all probability he would have been glad to compound matters at this juncture  on condition of being left in statu quo  but this was a condition not to be obtained  The princess of Ostrog had by this time formed such a confederacy  as threatened him with utter destruction  She had contracted an offensive and defensive alliance with the Chinese  the Mantchoux  and the Serednee Tartars  and each of these powers engaged to furnish a separate army to humble the insolence of Brut an tiffi  The majority of the Tartar fiefs agreed to raise a    139 body of forces to act against him as a disturber of the publick peace  the great Cham threatened him with a decree of outlawry and rebellion  and the Amazon herself opposed him at the head of a very numerous and warlike tribe  which had always been considered as the most formidable in that part of Tartary  Thus powerfully sustained  she resolved to enjoy her revenge  and at any rate retrieve the province which had been ravished from her by Brut an tiffi  at a time when she was embarrassed with other difficulties  Brut an tiffi did not think himself so reduced as to purchase peace with such a sacrifice  The Mantchoux were at a great distance  naturally slow in their motions  and had a very long march through a desert country  which they would not attempt without having first provided prodigious magazines  The Serednee were a divided people  among whom he had made shift to foment    140 intestine divisions  that would impede the national operations of the war  The Japonese Fatzman formed a strong barrier between him and the Chinese  the army furnished by the fiefs  he despised as raw  undisciplined militia  besides  their declaring against him afforded a specious pretence for laying their respective dominions under contribution  But he chiefly depended upon the coffers of Japan  which he firmly believed would hold out until all his enemies should be utterly exhausted   As this freebooter was a principal character in the drama which I intend to rehearse  I shall sketch his portrait according to the information I received from a fellow atom who once resided at his court  constituting part in one of the organs belonging to his first chamberlain  His stature was under the middle size  his aspect mean and forbidting     141 with a certain expression which did not at all prepossess the
