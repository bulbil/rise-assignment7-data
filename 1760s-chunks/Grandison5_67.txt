shew her gratitude to you   It is impossible  madam  but I must have joy in your joy  Lady Clementina  I apprehend  perseveres in her resolution —  I have talked to her  Chevalier  in your favour  If you love her  she says  as we all think you do  she will yet be yours   Dear madam  overjoyed  tell me—  Let me interrupt you  Chevalier  I must not mislead you  nor keep you in suspense—She will  she says  beg your acceptance of her vows—if—  If what  madam—  Hear me with patience  Chevalier—If you will comply with the conditions  on which we would have permited her to be yours  when you were last in Italy—This is her own proposal—Made at her own motion—She is afraid it will be to no purpose  she says afraid  Sir   But as you have not denied her to herself  she begs I will put the question to you in her name  for the sake  if you should refuse her  of her own future tranquillity of mind  The Chevalier Grandison is generous  he is just  he is polite  He cannot but receive this motion of my child by her mother  as the greatest condescension from both   I bowed  I was going to speak  but they all severally broke in upon me   On my knees  Chevalier  said Father Marescotti  I will entreat you   O Chevalier  said the Bishop  how happy is it in your power to make us all   Surely you can  you will  you must  Chevalier  said the Count  if you love the dear creature  as we all suppose you do   You will not  I hope  dear Grandison  said the Marquis  refuse my daughter  Ask any conditions of us—She shall be with you in England in a month s Page  168 time  We will accompany her thither  and stay till you shall choose to return with us   Jeronymo  with sobs  caught my hand as I sat next him—For God s sake  for my sake  for all our sakes  for your soul s sake  my Grandison  be ours  Let your Jeronymo call you Brother   If my tears  if my prayers  have weight  said the Marchioness  let me call down my child  and she shall give you her hand in our presence  She thinks  besides the regard she has for your soul  that she ought to insist upon the terms on which we would have consented to make her yours  in gratitude for our compliance with her wishes   Dearest Grandison  rejoined the Bishop  Refuse not my sister  Refuse not the daughter of the Marchese and Marchesa della Porretta  Refuse not the assenting Clementina   They were all silent  their eyes were upon me  It is  answered I  too  too condescendingly generous to put this task upon me  But  Refuse Lady Clementina  said you  How you wound my soul by the supposition  I see your compassion for me  in the light you cannot but mean I should  Lady Clementina s generously and condescendingly meant proposal  when I am willing to allow terms to her  that she will not to me  shews me how important she thinks the difference between the two religions  Need I repeat my  Lord  to the Bishop  what my own thoughts are upon this subject  Would to heaven the terms were no other than those before agreed to  or were such as I could comply with  I have only to console myself  that the power of Refusal lies where it ought to lie  Clementina is an angel  I am not worthy of her  Yet  let me add  this company  bowing round me  cannot think me too solemn—Were I to live always here  were I convinced that there is no life after this  your commands and Clementina s would be Laws to me  But has she not the goodness to say  in her paper     That Page  169 I have the same notion she has of the brevity and vanity of this world s glory  and of the duration of that to come      They looked upon one another  It is hard  very hard  said the Bishop  for a man  convinced of the truth of his religion  to allow to another of a different persuasion  what he expects should be allowed for himself  You  Chevalier  however  can allow it  and have greatness of mind enough to judge favourably of those who cannot  I do love you  but fain would I love you more   The Marchioness wept  My dear Love  said the Marquis  taking her hand with the tenderness of a Lover  but speaking a little too severely of me for his usual generosity—How many tears has this affair cost you  My heart bleeds to see you weep  Comfort yourself  Let us comfort each other  The Chevalier Grandison is indeed unworthy of our child  unworthy of the terms we offered to him  unworthy of our joint entreaties—He is an invincible man   I was greatly affected  After a little hesitation  I ask leave  my Lords  said I
