heard the sound of bells approaching our chamber  and felt my bedfellow cling close to me  uttering these words    95 Christ have mercy upon us  there he comes —At that instant  a monstrous overgrown raven entered our chamber  with bells at its feet  and made directly towards our bed —As this creature is reckoned in our country  a common vehicle for the devil and witches to play their pranks in  I verily believed we were haunted  and in a violent fright  shrunk my head under the bed cloaths —This terrible apparition leapt upon the bed  and after giving us several severe dabbs with its beak through the blankets  hopped away  and vanished  Strap and I recommended ourselves to the protection of heaven with great devotion  and when we no longer heard the noise  ventured to peep up and take breath —But we had not been long freed from this phantom  when another appeared  that had well nigh deprived us both of our senses  We perceived an old man enter the room  with a long white beard that reached to his middle  there was a certain wild peculiarity in his eyes and countenance  that did not savour of this world  and his dress consisted of a brown stuff coat  buttoned behind  and at the wrists  and an odd fashioned cap of the same stuff upon his head —I was so amazed that I had not power to move my eyes from such a ghastly object  but lay motionless  and saw him come streight up to me  when he got to the bed  he wrung his hands  and cried with a voice that did not seem to belong to a human creature    Where is Ralph    I made no reply  upon which  he repeated in an accent still more preternatural    Where is Ralpho  —  He had no sooner pronounced these words  than I heard the sound of the bells at a distance  which the apparition having listened to  tript away  and left me almost petrified with   96 fear  It was a good while before I could recover myself so far as to speak  and when at length I turned about to Strap  I found him in a fit  which  however  did not last long —When he came to himself  I asked his opinion of what had happened  and he assured me  that the first must certainly be the soul of some person damned  which appeared by the chains about its legs  for his fears had magnified the creature to the bigness of a horse  and the sound of small morris bells to the clanking of massy chains —As for the old man  he took it to be the spirit of somebody murdered long ago in this place  which had power granted it to torment the assassin in the shape of a raven  and that Rapho was the name of the said murderer —Although I had not much faith in his interpretation  I was too much troubled to enjoy any sleep  and in all my future adventures  never passed a night so ill —In the morning  Strap imparted the whole affair to Joey  who after an immoderate fit of laughter  explained the matter  by telling him that the old man was the landlord s father  who had turned idiot some years ago  and diverted himself with a tame raven  which  it seems  had hopped away from his apartment in the night  and induced him to follow it to our chamber  where he had inquired after it  under the name of Ralpho     Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey  which continued six or seven days longer  At length we entered the great city  and lodged all night at the inn  where the waggon halted —Next morning  all the passengers parted different ways  while my companion and I sallied out to enquire for the member of parliament to whom I had a letter of recommendation   97 from Mr  Crab  As we had discharged our lodging at the inn  Strap took up our baggage  and marched behind me in the street with the knapsack on his back  as usual  so that we made a very whimsical appearance —I had dressed myself to the greatest advantage  that is  put on a clean ruffled shirt  my best thread stockings  my hair  which was of the deepest red  hung down upon my shoulders  as lank and streight as a pound of candles  and the skirts of my coat reached to the middle of my leg  my waistcoat and breeches were of the same piece  and cut in the same taste  my hat very much resembled a Barber s bason in the shallowness of the crown and narrowness of the brims  Strap was habited in a much less aukward manner than me  but a short crop eared wig that very much resembled Scrub s in the play  and the knapsack on his back  added to what is called a queer phiz  occasioned by a long chin  an hook nose  and high cheek bones  rendered him on the whole a very fit subject of mirth and pleasantry  As we walked along  Strap  at my desire  enquired of a carman whom we met  whereabouts Mr  Cringer lived —and was answered by a stare accompanied with the word
