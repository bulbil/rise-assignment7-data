Heart had formed for future Days —  May every Happiness in Life attend you  and  if you wish to give me Ease  tell me  as soon as it is in your Power  that you are well— I neither wish nor desire  that you should take more Notice of this than my former Letter  excuse its Folly and Inconsistence  and believe me your faithful and affectionate  Friend and Servant   LETTER CXXII   My dear FANNY   YOU first banish me your Love  and then seem concerned at the Apprehensions of my Death  Leonora  in the Revenge  just after she has stabbed herself  takes Notice of such an Inconsistency as this in Alonzo  I shall say no more on this Head  for the same Reason that  as you say  I took no Notice of your former Letter  which is  that I am resolved never to make Replication to any Paragraph of your s    229 which makes me uneasy  lest the Altercation should grow to such a Warmth  as is inconsistent with that  which I sincerely hope may always subsist between us  However  I took Notice of the whole Subject of your Letter  I think  in the latter Part of mine  and I am rejoiced to find you think in the same Way  by saying  in your last  that  Death is Parting    I thank you extremely for your Concern about my Health  and be assured  my dearest Fanny  that this is equal to any one Reason I have to be concerned about it myself  Upon my Honour  if I had apprehended that Letter would have given you any Uneasiness  I would not have wrote it  for  tho  the Unkindness of your s might have justified such a Reply  yet it rendered me too low spirited to be malicious  and  in general  that Subject has  and will  whenever urged  give me a great deal of unfeigned Uneasiness and Concern  but must not  ought not  ever to raise my Resentment  I spoke of Death  as  I hope  you did of Parting  without a certain or a serious Thought about it  for  since Nero s Days  a Man may make his Will without the Danger of dying  I am  however  a great deal better than I was at that Time  tho  without using any Sort of Means  not even as much as I did in Town  and I believe  if I could stay within for two Days  I should be perfectly well  but  tho  I have no Person at Work these Holydays  I can t help frequently to haunt and revisit   230 these dear Scenes  late rendered more dear  where we have sat  walked  and conversed together   I find my Love of Solitude increasing every Day  which Inclination  beside the Enjoyment of Solitude itself  gives me a very flattering Pleasure  for  according to a rational and refined Opinion or Sentiment of your s  mentioned in a late Conversation  we are not only to perfect ourselves in Virtue here  but also in a true Taste and Relish for the Pleasures of the Blessed  if we would reach the Sublimity of those Joys which we are taught to hope for  Now  methinks my Aversion from Society  and frequent Retiring  as it were  within myself  in a great Measure  prepares me for the Enjoyment of that intuitive Converse  which Spirits or Angels hold with each other  by intellectual Vision  without the paltry  slow  and imperfect Aid of Sounds  of which spiritual Act  I think  the Communing with our own Hearts  Reflection  or mental Soliloquy  have a very great Resemblance   Other Lovers say  they would retire from all Society for you  but I would quit even Solitude for your Converse  as it is a nearer Approach to those Pleasures I hinted at above  and in some Sort the Enjoyment of that Heaven upon Earth  But   They say  bad Men would be unbless d in Heaven     231What is my Crime  which makes me so with you   Oh  Why am I sent a banish d Man to roam     Adieu  my Heart s dear Fanny  I am your s in this World  and the next   Henry   LETTER CXXIII   My dear FANNY   WHEN we read a Spectator of Addison s together lately in London  you may remember  I caviled at his saying  the Will was one of the Faculties of the Soul  When I came home  I looked into Locke s Essay upon the human Understanding  and finding him in the same Story  I began to reflect a little upon this Head  and found  I had apprehended that the Will was said to be one of the special Qualities of the Soul  but the Word  Faculty  being a comprehensive Term  and signifying a Power  then whatever a Soul has the Power of doing is called one of its Faculties  tho  not one of its essential Qualities  so that  in the general Sense of the Phrase  neither Addison or Locke may be reprehended  but as they both join Willing  which is but a Power  to
