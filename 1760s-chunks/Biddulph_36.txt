married  so that the family is intirely dispersed  but notwithstanding this  and the number of years that have passed over since my marriage  my mother cannot yet endure the name of the family  and always  as you may have observed  calls me by my maiden name   I was much affected at the story of the amiable Mrs Vere  The sweet melancholy  which predominates in her countenance  shews that the spirits  when broken in the bud of youth  are hardly to be recovered  What a tyrant this lady Grimston is  I did not admire her before  but I now absolutely dislike her  What a wife and a mother has she been to a husband and a daughter  who might have constituted the happiness of a woman of a different temper  And yet she passes for a wonderful good woman  and a pattern of all those virtues of a religion  which meekness and forgiveness characterise  She is mistaken  if she thinks that austerity is necessary to christianity  The most that my charity allows me to believe of such people is  that they impose on themselves  at a time when the most discerning perhaps think that they are endeavouring to impose on others   What an angel is my good mother  when compared to this her friend  whom her humility makes her look upon as her superior in virtue  I am very angry with Sir George  who in his resentment  said to me once  that she was like lady Grimston  I then knew but little of that lady’s character  or I should have reproved him for it   I conjured Mrs Vere to make her visit longer than she had at first intended  She told me  she would most gladly do it  but that it was a liberty she did not dare to take  unless her mother asked her to prolong it  which  she said  she possibly might do  in complaisance to me   September 4  My mother I find has made lady Grimston her confidant in relation to my affairs  the dear woman never keeps her mind to herself on any subject  Lady Grimston highly applauds her conduct in that business  and bestowed a few civil words on me for my filial duty  intermixed with an ungrateful comparison of her own daughter’s behaviour  And she condoled with herself  by saying  that good parents had not always good children  She told my mother  that she wished to see the child  meaning me  happily disposed of  for that  notwithstanding the    prudence of my behaviour  the world would be apt to cast reflections on me  on account of the abruptness with which the match was broken off  without the true reasons being known  and my illness  she said  might be imputed to the disappointment  which might incline people to suspect the rejection had been on Mr Faulkland’s side  What a provoking hint was this my dear  it has really alarmed my mother  who depends much on the judgment of her friend  and has at the same time so nice a regard to the honour of her family  I wish that formal old woman would mind her own business   September 6  My mother and lady Grimston have had abundance of private confabulation these two days  from which Mrs Vere and I are excluded  I wish there may not be some mischief a brewing  One thing  however  has given me pleasure  lady Grimston has invited her daughter to stay at Grimston hall as long as my mother and I continue here   Mrs Vere tells me  she suspects the subject of their conferences  but she is perverse  and will not tell me what she thinks  for fear  as she says  she should have guessed wrong  and her surmises would only teaze me   September 10  A packet sent me from London—A letter from Sir George—one from my Cecilia—and so soon too  Welcome  welcome  thou faithful messenger  from the faithfullest of hearts   Thou dear anticipating little prophetess  What put it into thy head to call Mr Arnold a new conquest  upon my but barely mentioning him to you  I was just going to tell you all  and behold your own whimsical imagination has suggested the most material part to you already  You desire me to be sincere  was that necessary  my sister  from you to me  You say  you are sure Mr Arnold is  or will be my lover  and insist on my being more particular in my description of him  What a strange girl you are  again I ask you  What put this into your head  What busy little spirit of intelligence flew to you with the news before I knew it myself  For as to the fact  it is but too certain   This has been the subject of my mother’s and lady Grimston’s private conferences  and Mrs Vere  sly thing as she is  guessed it  It seems Mr Arnold disclosed his passion to lady Grimston  in order to ask her advice about it  She loves mightily to be consulted  and ill     starred as I am  did me the honour to recommend me strongly to him  and she has prepossessed my mother too in favour of this new man  I wish the meddling
