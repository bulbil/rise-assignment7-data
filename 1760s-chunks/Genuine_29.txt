had sufficient friends at the admiralty to obtain this favour  he had none who would crown his hopes by procuring a commission in the army  However  an uncle dying about that time  and leaving him a legacy  he purchased with it an ensigncy in a marching regiment     138He was soon ordered to quarters  when he gave ample testimony of his gentility  and genius for military affairs  He made an attack on every pretty girl in the town  taking some by surprise  and others by capitulation  He stormed every drinking house at four in the morning  and where the garrison was obstinate made the escalade  and carried the liquor sword in hand  So great was his martial skill and valour this way  that if he had not soon changed quarters  the complaints of the inhabitants would have gone a great way towards breaking him   He was now eighteen  tall  well made  and handsome  fluent in speech  and impudent in deportment  at a country town  a young lady with five thousand pounds in her own possession saw his charming person  and could not resist him  She ogled him—she wrote to him—he answered hear—and at last married her   After enjoyment  he could see no other endearment than her fortune  He possessed himself of it  and quitted his quarters    139 He came to London  hired an elegant house  purchased rich furniture  and set up a genteel equi  he dressed as well as any man in town  and kept as good company  To keep good company  and be ruined  with a young man are almost synonymous terms  Two months frequenting Arthur s carried off his wife s fortune and the sale of his commission  A few levants at the chocolate house proscribed him  Here terminated his present glory   Our hero made the most of his effects  left his creditors an empty house to contemplate  and set out for Bristol  where he insinuated himself into the good graces of one Mr  JACKSON  a merchant with whom he still passed for an officer  and giving a very exact detail of the gentlemen of the corps he lately belonged to  the deception failed not to succeed  and he had the address to gain credit for any reasonable sum  He failed not to make use of the advantage  and for the first time drew only for two hundred pounds  which bill being paid on sight  he next drew for five hundred  and the gentleman still did honour   140 to his draught  insomuch that had not his moderation been surpassed by Mr  JACKSON s generosity  he might have continued drawing for any considerable sum  Soon after  he paid his addresses to a rich merchant s daughter at Liverpool  whose father was dead  and had left her fortune in the hands of trustees till she was of age  one of whom she then lived with   This gentleman approved his suit  but before he would sign any writings  desired he would realize his protestations  This induced him to draw upon his Bristol friend for five thousand pounds  So great a bill proved its own abortion  for even if the gentleman had had cash enough to answer it  which he had not  such a capital sum could not fail of giving him some alarm  and the bill returned  with the post unaccepted   Having in the interim made great advances towards gaining his mistress s heart  he went himself  as soon as the post came  to receive his letters  and thereby gained intelligence of the return of his bill several hours before the trustee  who had not his   141 letters before the next morning  He now saw there was but one resource to succeed   He went immediately to the young lady  who had appointed that evening for an interview  and with the utmost concern told her he had received a letter from London  which acquainted him with his uncle s being at the point of death  and his desire of seeing his nephew before he departed this life  adding  that his uncle and he had been at some little variance for a good while  and that he flattered himself  that if he could arrive in town time enough to be reconciled to him  he should have sufficient influence over him  to get reinstated in his will in lieu of his brother  who  since the breach  had supplied the place  that therefore he proposed seting out that evening  and yet the thought of leaving his charmer struck far deeper into his heart than the loss of the fortune he might obtain  that he was sensible  to propose a journey before they were married  might create in her some suspicion of his intentions  that it would be impossible to get the ceremony performed that evening    142 and that he doubted not her guardian would oppose her intentions  if they were inclined to take such a journey  that therefore if she had a mind to prevent his being the most miserable man in the world  she must set out with him in a post chaise incog  that evening  without the knowledge of her trustee  and that to prevent all tear on her side  they should be married the next morning at the first town they came to   However plausible this story  and
