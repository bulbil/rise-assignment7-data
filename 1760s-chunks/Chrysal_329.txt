ever after presume   to attempt exercising his wit upon the society  in any manner    or by any means whatsoever   on taking which oath  and asking   pardon upon his knees  at the door of the chapel  the offender should   be forgiven      To this proposal they all assented  except my master  who  for   private reasons  thought the latter part of it much too mild for so   flagrant a crime  He had long cherished a secret grudge against the   other  who not only often pointed his wit against him in a manner   that he could not digest  nor knew how to resent  it being as polite   as it was keen  but also put him constantly to the expense of double   wickedness  the only qualification in which he could possibly shine    to avoid being totally eclipsed by him  His desire of revenge also   was strongest on this occasion  as he had suffered the deepest   disgrace        By this practical joke upon his aristocratic associates  Wilkes seems   to have provoked the lasting enmity of Sandwich and Dash wood  who   took an active part  in 1763  in the proceedings against him for printing   the Essay on Woman          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 391     Accordingly  he exerted all his eloquence to show the enormity   of the crime of attempting to turn any of the rites and ceremonies   established by the laws of the society into ridicule   the letting of   which escape without adequate punishment  he said  would argue   weakness  and want of spirit in them  and must end in the ruin of   their authority   for which weighty reasons he proposed that the   offender should be directly expelled the society in form  as the only   effectual way to vindicate their dignity  and prevent others from   offering it the like insult for the future  This gave the affair a new   turn  They all took fire at the thought of their dignities being   insulted  and expelled him that moment  without ever waiting to   hear him in his own defence  But he soon had the satisfaction of   seeing himself amply avenged  The care they took to keep every    thing they did secret had long awoke the curiosity of the neighour    hood  who were the more severe in their guesses the less able they   were to guess aright  But the affair of the baboon  whom the   servants got sight of  before he could be caught  and whether misled   by his dress  or misrepresenting by design  gave out to be the devil    was no sooner known  than a formal story was propagated over   the whole country that the end of their meeting was to worship   the devil  to whom this chapel was dedicated  and who had often   been seen among them in a variety of shapes      Scandal always meets easy credit  The story was believed by   many  and repeated by more  as if they believed it  never losing   anything in the repetition   till such a universal alarm was raised   among the people â€” who are content to infringe the precepts of   religion  without denying its authority â€” that the superior  whose   seat was in the neighbourhood  found it necessary to dissolve the   society   and effacing every trace of it  convert the building to the   better use of a pleasure house  in which he entertained all his neigh    bours in general  whenever he was in the country   beside which    he also built a church   on an eminence near his house  that answered   the double purpose of convincing the populace of his regard to   religion  and of making a beautiful termination to a vista which he   had just cut through a wood in his park      I have anticipated these circumstances to satisfy your curiosity     as I have also omitted many  and softened more particulars in this   acooxmt  which were too horrid to have been represented in their   proper colours        High Wycombe Church  built by Dashwood some time after the   dissolution of the Medmenham confraternity  Wilkes  said    I believe   this is the fir st church which has been built for a prospect    The   village  for the convenience of which it was erected  lay at the foot of   the hill          392 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XXII     A rrrRTHBB ACCOTTNT op the ETTLBS or the convent   WITH SOME   STBIKING INSTANCES OF ECONOMY â€” A SEEMING INCONSISTENCY   ACCOUNTED FOB EBOM A PBINCIPLB NOT STJEFICIENTLY tTNDBB    STOOD â€” SOME BBMAKKABLB EFFECTS OF VANITY â€” REASON OF
