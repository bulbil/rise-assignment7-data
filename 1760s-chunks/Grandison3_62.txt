tête conversation  that may let us into a little of his own   But shall I trust myself with him alone  Lucy    152 Indeed I am afraid of him  of my self  rather  My own concerns so much in my head  I wish I don t confound them with Miss Grandison s  A fine piece of work shall I make of it  if I do  If I get it so happily over  as not to be dissatisfied with my self  for my part in it  I shall think I have had a deliverance   But  Lucy  if all these distinctions paid me in this conversation  and all this confidence placed in me  produce nothing—If—Why  what if  In one word  Should this if be more than if —Why then it will go the harder  that s all  with your Harriet  than if she had not been so much distinguished   At afternoon tea  the Danby s being mentioned  Lord L  asked Sir Charles  What was the danger from which he relieved their uncle  And we all joining in requesting particulars he gave the following  which I will endeavour to repeat  as near as possible  in his own words  My heart interested itself in the relation      Mr  Danby  said he  was a merchant of equal eminence and integrity  He was settled at Cambray  He had great dealings in the manufactures of cambricks and lace  His brother John  a very profligate man  had demanded of him  and took it ill that he denied him  a thousand guineas  for no better reason  but because he had generously given that sum to each of the wicked man s children  Surely  he pleaded  he was as nearly related to his brother as were those his children  No plea is too weak for folly and self interest to insist upon  Yet my Mr  Danby had often given this brother large sums  which he squandered away almost as soon as he received them        My father used to make remittances to Mr  Danby  for my use  for his dealings in other branches of commerce extended to the south of France and Italy  This brought me acquainted with him        He took a great liking to me  I saw him first at   153 Lyons  and he engaged me to visit him at Cambray  whenever I should go to Paris or Flanders        Accompanying a friend  soon after  to Paris  I performed my promise        He had a villa in the Cambresis  at a small distance from the city  which he sometimes called his cottage  at others his dormitory  It was a little lone house  He valued it for its elegance  Thither  after I had passed two days with him at his house in the city  he carried me        His brother  enraged at being refused the sum he had so unreasonably demanded  formed a plot to get possession of his whole fortune  My Mr  Danby was a bachelor  and  it was known  had  to that time  an aversion to the thought of making his will        The wretch  in short  hired three ruffians to murder him  The attempt was to be made in this little house  that the fact might have the appearance of being perpetrated by robbers  and the cabinets in the bed chamber  if there were time for it  after the horrid fact was perpetrated  were to be broken open  and rifled  in order to give credit to that appearance  The villains were each to be rewarded with a thousand crowns  payable on the wicked man s getting possession of his brother s fortune  and they had fifty crowns apiece paid them in hand  Their unnatural employer waited the event at Calais  tho  he told them he should be at Dunkirk        I had one servant with me  who lay with a manservant of Mr  Danby in a little room over the stable  about an hundred yards from the house  There were only conveniences in the house for Mr  Danby and a friend  besides two women servants in the upper part of it        About midnight I was alarmed by a noise  as of violence used at the window of Mr  Danby s room  Mine communicated with his  The fastening of the   154 door was a spring lock  the key of which was on my side        I slipt on my cloaths in an instant  and  drawing my sword  rushed into the next room  just as one villain  with a large knife in his hand  had seized the throat of Mr  Danby  who  till then  was in a sound sleep  The skin of his neck  and one hand listed up to defend himself  were slightly wounded before I ran the ruffian into the shoulder  as I did with my sword  and in the same moment disarmed him  and threw him  with violence from the bed  against the door
