a clatter about his ears with a cudgel  that his eyes had almost started from their sockets  His voice was lost within the vizor  and his friend affected not to understand his meaning when he made signs with his gauntlets  and endeavoured to close with him  that he might wrest the cudgel from his hand  At length he desisted  saying   I ll warrant the helmet sound by its ringing   and taking it off  found the squire in a cold sweat  He would have achieved his first exploit on the spot  had his strength permitted him to assault Dawdle  but what with want of air  and the discipline he had undergone  he had well nigh swooned away  and before he retrieved the use of his members  he was appeased by the apologies of his companion  who protested he meant nothing more than to try if the helmet was free of cracks  and whether or not it would prove a good protection for the head it covered   His excuses were accepted  the armour was packed up  and next morning Mr  Sycamore set out from his own house  accompanied by Dawdle  who undertook to perform the part of his squire at the approaching combat  He was also attended by a servant on horseback  who had charge of the armour  and another who blowed the trumpet  They no sooner understood that our hero was housed at the George  than the trumpeter sounded a charge  which alarmed Sir Launcelot and his company  and disturbed honest Captain Crowe in the middle of his first sleep  Their next step was to pen a challenge  which  when the stranger departed  was by the trumpeter delivered with great ceremony into the hands of Sir Launcelot  who read it in these words — To the knight of the Crescent  greeting  Whereas I am informed you have the presumption to lay claim to the heart of the peerless Aurelia Darnel  I give you notice that I can admit no rivalship in the affection of that paragon of beauty  and I expect that you will either resign your pretensions  or make it appear in single combat  according to the law of arms and the institutions of chivalry  that you are worthy to dispute her favour with him of the Griffin —POLYDORE    Our adventurer was not a little surprised at this address  which however he pocketed in silence  and began to reflect  not without mortification  that he was treated as a lunatic by some person  who wanted to amuse himself with the infirmities of his fellow creatures  Mr  Thomas Clarke  who saw the ceremony with which the letter was delivered  and the emotions with which it was read  hied him to the kitchen for intelligence  and there learned that the stranger was Squire Sycamore  He forthwith comprehended the nature of the billet  and  in the apprehension that bloodshed would ensue  resolved to alarm his uncle  that he might assist in keeping the peace  He accordingly entered the apartment of the captain  who had been waked by the trumpet  and now peevishly asked the meaning of that d—ned piping  as if all hands were called upon deck  Clarke having imparted what he knew of the transaction  together with his own conjectures  the captain said  he did not suppose as how they would engage by candlelight  and that  for his own part  he should turn out in the larboard watch  long enough before any signals could be hove out for forming the line   With this assurance the lawyer retired to his nest  where he did not fail to dream of Mrs  Dolly Cowslip  while Sir Launcelot passed the night awake  in ruminating on the strange challenge he had received  He had got notice that the sender was Mr  Sycamore  and hesitated with himself whether he should not punish him for his impertinence  but when he reflected on the nature of the dispute  and the serious consequences it might produce  he resolved to decline the combat  as a trial of right and merit founded upon absurdity  Even in his maddest hours  he never adopted those maxims of knight errantry which related to challenges  He always perceived the folly and wickedness of defying a man to mortal fight  because he did not like the colour of his beard  or the complexion of his mistress  or of deciding by homicide whether he or his rival deserved the preference  when it was the lady s prerogative to determine which should be the happy lover  It was his opinion that chivalry was an useful institution while confined to its original purposes of protecting the innocent  assisting the friendless  and bringing the guilty to condign punishment  But he could not conceive how these laws should be answered by violating every suggestion of reason  and every precept of humanity   Captain Crowe did not examine the matter so philosophically  He took it for granted that in the morning the two knights would come to action  and slept sound on that supposition  But he rose before it was day  resolved to be somehow concerned in the fray  and understanding that the stranger had a companion  set him down immediately for his own antagonist  So impatient was he to establish this secondary contest  that by daybreak he entered the chamber of Dawdle  to which he was directed by the waiter
