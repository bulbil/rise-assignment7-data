bearing the host  which he publicly adored  and this served to alienate the few Protestants of that kingdom  who still adhered to his cause  A small party of that religion were resolved to defend their lives and religion in the little city of London derry  They were besieged by the forces of King   82 James  and suffered all the complicated miseries of war  famine  and bigotted cruelty  but  determined never to yield  they rejected capitulation  and always repulsed the besiegers with considerable loss  At length  supplies and succours arriving from England  King James s army thought proper to raise the siege   The cruelties exercised upon the Protestants were as shocking as unnecessary  soldiers were permitted to pillage them without redress  and they were compelled to accept base money in exchange for those commodities they were forced to sell  But their sufferings were soon to have a period  The Duke of Schomberg was sent over  with assistance  and William himself soon after followed  and landed at Carrickfergus  He was met by numbers of the Protestants  who had fled from persecution  and now  at the head of six and thirty thousand men  he was resolved to go in quest of the enemy  Having marched to Dundalk  and then to Ardee  he  at length  came in sight of the Irish army  The river Boyne lay between the two armies  the front of the Irish being secured by a morass and a rising ground  These obstacles were insufficient to prevent the ardour of William  who  when his friend the Duke of Schomberg expostulated upon the danger boldly  replied  That a tardy victory would be worse than a defeat  The Duke  finding his advice not relished  retired to his tent in a melancholy manner  as if he had a prescience of his own misfortune  Early in the morning  at six o clock  King William gave orders to pass the river  the army passed in three different places  and the battle began with unusual vigour  The Irish troops  which have been reckoned the best in Europe abroad  have always fought indifferently at home  they fled  after a long resistance  with precipitation  and left the French and Swiss regiments  who came to their assistance  to make the   83 best retreat they could  William led on his horse in person  and contributed  by his activity and vigilance  to secure the victory  James was not in the battle  but stood aloof  during the action  on the hill of Dunmore  surrounded with some squadrons of horse  and  at intervals  was heard to exclaim  when he saw his own troops repulsing the enemy    O spare my English subjects   The Irish lost about fifteen hundred men  and the English about one third of that number  but the death of the Duke of Schomberg  who was shot as he was crossing the water  seemed to outweigh all the numbers of the enemy  He had been long a soldier of fortune  and fought under almost every power in Europe  His skill in war was unparalleled  and his fidelity equal to his courage  The number of battles in which he had been personally engaged  was said to equal the number of his years  and he died aged eighty two  James fled  regardless of the safety of his soldiers  William rode round the scene of slaughter  relieving the wounded  as well of the enemy s troops as his own  O Regan  an old Irish captain  was heard to say upon this occasion  That  if the English would exchange generals  the conquered army would fight the battle over again     This blow totally depressed the hopes of James  he fled to Dublin  advised the magistrates to get the best terms they could from the victor  then set out for Waterford  where he embarked for France  in a vessel prepared for his reception  Had he possessed either conduct or courage  he might still have headed his troops  and fought with advantage  but prudence forsook him with good fortune   His friends were still resolved to second his interests  though he had abandoned them himself  After his retreat  another desperate battle was fought at Aughrim  in which his adversaries were again victorious  Limeric  a strong city in the southern part of   84 the kingdom  still held out in his favour  This city was besieged  and made a brave defence  but  despairing of the King s fortunes  the garrison  at length  capitulated  the Roman Catholics  by this capitulation  were restored to the enjoyment of such liberty in the exercise of their religion  as they had possessed in the reign of Charles II  and about fourteen thousand of those who had fought in favour of King James  had permission to go over to France  and transports were provided for their reception   The conqueft os Ireland being thus completed  the only hopes of the fugitive King now depended on the assistance of Lewis XIV  who promised to make a descent upon England in his favour  The French King was punctual  he supplied the fugitive Monarch with an army consisting of a body of French troops  some English and Scotch refugees  and the Irish regiments which had been transported
