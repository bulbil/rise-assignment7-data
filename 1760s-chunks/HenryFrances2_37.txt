 these Groves and Springs  The Hamadryads are your s  the Fawns—not Page  138 Satyrs — your s  the Naiads your s  Accept them all  and  with them  my Heart in Dower  which is your s  your s     LETTER CCXXVII   SINCE you desire me to continue my Notes upon Pliny  I shall go on with that Subject again   The first Epistle of the third Book puts me in mind of Lord Orrery s Wish about the latter Scenes of his Life  hinted at in one of my former Letters to you  and in the Passage I here allude to  for Want of better Light from History  he supposes after what Manner Pliny passed the Decline of Life  but I think the latter Part of the Letter  I am now upon  affords a strong Presumption of this Supposition  and  as Pliny desires Calvisius to keep that Letter by him  in order to judge of his Philosophy  so shall we remember Lord Orrery s Declaration with the same View  I think the Character of Spurinna not unlike his own  and there is one Circumstance hinted at  when he takes the Air in his Chariot  in which they happily agree  In this Letter there is a pretty Distinction between being pleased  and being proud of a Thing    The only Mark of Age he discovers  is Prudence   This is a fine Trait     Page  139In the sixth Epistle of the same Book  in the Comment on it  Lord Orrery gives us a gay Ode  to divert our Thoughts from the melancholy Prospect of an old Man  which is like the merry Epilogues  they give us often  after our Tragedies  This Argument has been treated pro and con in the Spectators  But for my Part  I always chuse to retire with the Bier  for sober Thoughts do me no Harm  as I can be grave  without being melancholy  I am surprized his Lordship should say an old Man was a dismal Sight  for a Person  who views all Things   In the calm Light of mild Philosophy   regards with equal Eyes both Youth and Age  nay  I cannot think it requires any great Straining of Philosophy to bear even our own Decay  as there are Pleasures and Solations indulged by Providence to every Stage of Life  and  to a Mind rightly turned  perhaps  not the least to the last  and  if any Uneasiness arises in our Senescence  from a nearer Prospect of the Grave  it is unbecoming a Christian  who rests in Hope     There is something extremely elegant  and a fine Address of Compliment  in several of Pliny s Epistles  with a certain Tour d Expression et de Sentiment  which is observable in the Writings of the best and politest French Authors  I shall give you but one Example  among many  because I would not prevent you  as you have Page  140 not gone through his Works  It is in the eighth Epistle of this Book    And  since it is equally excellent to merit and confer Benefits  I see you are resolved to lay Claim to the Praise of both  by giving to another what you have deserved yourself     In the Observations upon the second Epistle of the fourth Book  my Lord  after his humane Way  reprimands Pliny for his frequent Abuse of Regulus  which  as I hinted  is an Instance of his Humanity  but not of his Judgment  There are many Men of vile Deserts  so far beyond the Reach of Laws  that there is no Way to punish them  but by Satire or Invective  and I believe that several People  naturally vicious in themselves  have been restrained within the Bounds of social Morality  not from Respect to the Tables  but out of Fear of being   damn d to everlasting Fame   From the whole Tenor of Pliny s Character  and it is this Way we should judge of Men  he inveighs against Regulus from a virtuous Rage  rather than from Hatred  Malice  or any Uncharitableness  This puts me in Mind of a Sentiment of your s  upon some such Occasion as this  which may not be improperly repeated here  It is upon the Subject of Revenge   As a Passion  it is a Vice  but  as a Principle  a Virtue   Pursued with Malice and Ill nature  Page  141 upon slight or common Provocations  it is a Passion instigated by the Devil  but great and real Injuries  proceeding from extreme Vice and Immorality  call aloud for Justice  and then Vengeance becomes a godlike Principle  Perhaps it would be a proper Criticism here  to distinguish between the Words revenge and avenge     In the latter Part of the Comment upon the fourth Epistle  there is a very just Observation  That it is absolutely necessary for us to be as wary in the Choice of our Amusements  as of our Studies  For which Reason  I have often thought  that there wanted extremely such an Office to be established in all States  as a general Reveller  who should prescribe and preside over the Amusements  Pleasures  and Diversions of all Ranks  all Professions
