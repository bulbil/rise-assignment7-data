 and I had myself made this assignation with him in the garden  to concert measures for the elopement  and with his fortune he assured me that my own was closely linked  but it was in vain that I screamed after my husband  he darted from me as if my very touch were contamination   In such a state of mind  resumed Scipio  I was capable of anything  Those who know by experience what jealousy is  into what extravagance it drives the best regulated spirits  will be at no loss to conceive the disorder it must have produced in my weak brain  I passed in a moment from one extreme to an other  emotions of hatred succeeded instantaneously to all my former sentiments of affection for my wife  I took an oath never to see her more  and to banish her for ever from my memory  Besides  the supposed death of a man lay upon my conscience  and under that idea  I was afraid of falling into the hands of justice  so that every torment which could be accumulated on the head of guilt and misery by the fury of despair and the demon of remorse  was the remediless companion of my wretched flight In this dreadful situation  thinking only of my escape  I returned home no more  but immediately quitted Toledo  with no other provision for my journey but the clothes on my back  It is true  I had about sixty pistoles in my pocket  a tolerable supply for a young man  whose views in life pointed no higher than a good service   I walked forward all night  or rather ran  for the phantom of an alguazil always dogging me at the heels made me perform wonders of pedestrian activity  The dawn overtook me between Rodillas and Maqueda  When I was at the latter town  finding myself a little weary  I went into the church which was just opened  and having put up a short prayer  sat down on a bench to rest  I began musing on the state of my affairs  which were sufficiently out at elbows to require all my skill in patch work  but the time for reflection as well as for repentance were cut short  The church echoed on a sudden with three or four smacks of a whip  which made me conclude that some carrier was on the road  I immediately got up to go and see whether I was right or wrong  At the door I found a man  mounted on a mule  leading two others by the halter  Stop  my friend  said I  whither are those two mules going  To Madrid  answered he  I came hither with two good Dominicans  and am now setting out on my return   Such an opportunity of going to Madrid gave me an itching desire for the expedition  I made my bargain with the muleteer  jumped upon one of his mules  and away we scampered towards Ilescas  where we were to put up for the night  Scarcely were we out of Maqueda before the muleteer  a man from five and thirty to forty  began chanting the church service with a most collegiate twang  This trial of his lungs began with matins  in the drowsy tone of a canon between asleep and awake  then he roared out the Belief  alternately in contralto  tenor  and bass  in all the harmonious confusion of high mass  and not content with that  he rang the bell for vespers  without sparing me a single petition or so much as a bar of the magnificat  Though the scoundrel almost cracked the drum of my ear  I could not help laughing heartily  and even egged him on to make the welkin reverberate with his hallelujahs  when the anthem was suspended a few rests  for the necessary purpose of supplying wind to the organ  Courage  my friend  said I  go on and prosper  If heaven has given you a good capacious throat  you are neither a niggard nor a perverter of its precious boon  Oh  certainly not for the matter of that  cried he  happily for my immortal soul  I am not like carriers in general  who sing nothing but profane songs about love or drinking  I do not even defile my lips with ballads on our wars against the Moors  such subjects are at least light and unedifying  if not licentious and impure  You have  replied I  an evangelical purity of heart which belongs only to the elect among muleteers  With this excessive squeamishness of yours about the choice of your music  have you also taken a vow of continence  wherever there is a young bar  maid to be picked up at an inn  Assuredly  rejoined he  chastity is also a virtue by which it is my pride to ward off the temptations of the road  where my only business is to look after my mules  I was in no small degree astonished at such pious sentiments from this prodigy of psalm singing mule drivers  so that looking upon him as a man above the vanities and corruptions of this nether world  I fell into chat with him after he had gone the length of his tether in singing   We got to Ilescas late in the day  On entering the inn yard  I left the care of the mules to my companion
