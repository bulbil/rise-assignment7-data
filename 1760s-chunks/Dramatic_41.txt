afflicted her  to take notice of Davids obstinacy—he indeed once or twice attempted to speak—but it was a vain attempt  as he could not  we beg leave to speak for him     Page   unnumbered      illustration    p  121   SLAUGHTER Surgeon   Man Midwife  Page  125  Mr  Llwhyddwhuydd was too fond a husband to deny his wife what she desired  but being a great reader  the news papers and magazines informed him of the indecency  indelicacy  and evil tendency of having men midwives     The putters together of those daily and monthly paragraph compendiums had proved  that no husband of nice honour  would suffer a man midwife  and as David was a man of the nicest honour  how could he endure them     In some papers it was hinted  that men midwives could be of no use  because the Indian women delivered themselves     In other papers it was inserted  that in a state of nature  there were neither men midwives  nor parsons  and that people could do well without both  and as how in the first ages  and the first ages were the best ages  and that this age was the worst age  but in the first ages there were no arts  or sciences  nor occasion for any  that people would live better without them  than with them  that neither mankind or womankind had need for more help than the animals in the fields  or the fowls of the air  that it was only villainous custom  evil habits  wrong tendencies  and the prejudice of education  that made us employ surgeons  taylors  chymists  shoe makers  men midwives  dancing masters  snuff makers  French cooks  saddles  shirts  shifts  or pocket handkerchiefs     From the information of those weekly paid journalists  we may easily account why GREAT SCHOLARS  who study nature so nicely  are such GREAT SLOVENS  as they know by their extreme skill  that we are not superior to the  Page  126  beasts  they chuse to retain as much brutality as possible in their behaviour     David  like the traveller in the contention with the wind  wrapped himself up in his surtout  determined to stand out the tempest  when word was brought him  that madam Llwhyddwhuydd was brought to bed of a fine boy  and as like the father—    He would not stay to hear the rest of the messenger s observation  bursting through the crowd  run home  and received the congratulations of his company  Mr  Llwhyddwhuydd indeed rejoiced having a son and heir  and that was the utmost of his hopes  wishes  and prayers  before he had read the observations abovementioned  Yet now his principal satisfaction arose  from the reflection his lady was brought to bed without the help of a man midwife     The METAPHYSICAL SCENE   The authors of Joseph Andrews and Tristram Shandy wrote themselves into reputation  and I believe got money by what they did  and really deserved it —Ever since I have engaged in this work  I have endeavoured to copy one or both of their stiles  manners  or maxims  but I cannot fancy myself quite so clever  Yet have I all that customary fondness  that becoming partiality  for my own works  which every author ought to have  and hold all the rest of my cotemporaries in a trifling light  to myself  This I do as well as any or all the dramatic writers of England  Ireland or Scotland  but yet I don t find myself  honestly speaking  a jot better genius for all the abuse I make use of     Page  127  If the connections I have with publishers could be on my side discharged  or a protection granted me  I might wear a laced coat  and live without working  as well as many other gentlemen     Then  I would no more meddle with a pen and ink  than a lady in high keeping would mend her own linnen  for my mind scorns the drudgery of writing  reading  and reflecting  as much as any rich man in the kingdom can do     My wife has an acquaintance  who promises to provide for me  either in the church  the navy  the law  the army  the customs  at court  or in the excise  it does not signify what branch it is  for if a man has but interest  he is fit for any place     Must it not irritate a genius  like me  or like my spouse  to see so many dunces  driving their one horse chaise  or else crammed into hackney coaches  taking the air to White Conduit house  on a Sunday  raising a dust on the New Road  and choaking such foot passengers as me  and my wife  but we enjoy the satisfaction to reflect  though those wretches ride about flourishing  in the folly of finery—yet they perhaps  not one of them  ever made a rebus  or can repeat the Greek alphabet     At this instant  the dear creature my spouse is sitting
