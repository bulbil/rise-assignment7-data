without distinguishing whether it was a smile of approbation or not  he look d as if he pity d us all  and as if he thought himself cast into unequal company  Nay  twice or thrice he addressed himself  in preference to every one else  to honest simpering Mr  Singleton  Who  for his part  as was evident  much better relished the Baronet s flippances  than the dry significance of the Student  For  whenever Sir Hargrave spoke  Mr  Singleton s mouth was open  But it was quite otherwise with him  when Mr  Walden spoke  even at the time that he paid him the distinction of addressing himself to him  as if he were the principal person in the company   But one word  by the bye  Lucy—Don t you think it is very happy for us foolish women  that the generality of the Lords of the creation are not much wiser than ourselves  Or  to express myself in other words  That over wisdom is as foolish a thing to the full  as moderate solly —But  hush  I have done—I know that at this place my Uncle will be ready to rise against me   After dinner  Mr  Walden  not chusing to be any longer so egregiously eclipsed by the man of the Town  put forth the Scholar     60 By the way  let me ask my uncle  if the word scholar means not the learner  rather than the learned  If it originally means no more  I would suppose that formerly the most learned men were the most modest  contenting themselves with being thought but learners  a modesty well becoming a learned man  since  vast is the field of science  as my revered first instructor used to say  and the more a man knows  the more he will find he has to know   Pray  Sir Hargrave  said Mr  Walden  may I ask you—You had a thought just now  speaking of Love and Beauty  which I know you must have from Tibullus  And then he repeated the line in an heroic accent  and  pausing  look d round upon us women  Which University had the honour of finishing your studies  Sir Hargrave  I presume you were brought up at one of them   Not I  said the Baronet  A man  surely  may read Tibullus  and Virgil too  without being indebted to either University for his learning   No man  Sir Hargrave  in my humble opinion  With a decisive air he spoke the word humble  can be well grounded in any branch of learning  who has not been at one of our famous Universities   I never yet proposed  Mr  Walden  to qualify myself for a degree  My Chaplain is a very pretty fellow  He understands Tibullus  I believe  Immoderately laughing  and by his eyes cast in turn upon each person at table  bespeaking a general smile —And of Oxford  as you are  And again he laughed  But his laugh was then such a one  as rather shewed ridicule than mirth  a provoking laugh  such a one as Mr  Greville often affects when he is in a disputatious humour  in order to dash an opponent out of countenance  by getting the laugh  instead of the argument  on his side   My uncle  you know  will have it sometimes  that his girl has a satirical vein  I am afraid she has—   61 A bold hussy —But this I will say  I mean no ill nature  I love every body  but not their faults  as my uncle in his Letter tells me  And wish not to be spared for my own  Nor  very probably  am I  if those who see me  write of me to their chosen friends as I do to mine  of them  Shall I tell you what I imagine each person of the company I am writing about  writing in character  would say of me to their correspondents —It would be digressing too much  or I would   Mr  Walden in his heart  I dare say  was revenged on the Baronet  He gave him such a look  as would have grieved me the whole day  had it been given me by one whom I valued   Sir Hargrave had too much business for his eyes with the Ladies  in order to obtain their countenance  to trouble himself about the looks of the men  And indeed he seemed to have as great a contempt for Mr  Walden  as Mr  Walden had for him   But here I shall be too late for the post  Will this stuff go down with you at Selby house  in want of better subjects   Every thing from you  my Harriet—  Thank you  Thank you  all  my indulgent friends  So it ever was  Trifles from those we love  are acceptable  May I deserve your Love   Adieu  my Lucy —But tell my Nancy  that she has delighted me by her Letter   H  B   LETTER XII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   WHAT is your opinion  my charming Miss Byron  said the Baronet  May not a man of fortune  who has
