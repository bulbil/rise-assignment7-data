pre eminence  and a very earnest  dispute ensued  during which  the ass  in the course of his circuit   showed himself and rider  and in a trice decided the contest  for   struck with this second glimpse  both at one instant sprang backward  with such force  as overturned their next men  who communicated the  impulse to those that stood behind them  and these again to others  so  that the whole passage was strewed with a long file of people  that lay  in a line  like the sequel and dependence of a pack of cards   In the midst of this havoc  our hero returned from his own room with  an air of astonishment  asking the cause of this uproar  Receiving such  hints of intelligence as Jolter s consternation would permit him to  give  he snatched the candle out of his hand  and advanced into the  haunted chamber without hesitation  being followed by all present  who  broke forth into a long and loud peal of laughter  when they perceived  the ludicrous source of their disquiet  The painter himself made an  effort to join their mirth  but he had been so harrowed by fear  and  smarted so much with the pain of the discipline he had received from  Pickle  that he could not  with all his endeavours  vanquish the  ruefulness of his countenance  His attempt served only to increase  the awkwardness of his situation  which was not at all mended by the  behaviour of the coquette  who  furious with her disappointment  slipped  on a petticoat and bedgown  and springing upon him  like mother Hecuba   with her nails deprived all one side of his nose of the skin  and would  not have left him an eye to see through  if some of the company had not  rescued him from her unmerciful talons  Provoked at this outrage  as  well as by her behaviour to him in the diligence  he publicly explained    6 22 15  3 45 PM   his intention in entering her chamber in this equipage  and missing the  Hebrew among the spectators  assured them that he must have absconded  somewhere in the apartment  In pursuance of this intimation  the room  was immediately searched  and the mortified Levite pulled up by the  heels from his lurking place  so that Pallet had the good fortune  at  last  to transfer the laugh from himself to his rival and the French  inamorata  who accordingly underwent the ridicule of the whole audience   CHAPTER LVII   Pallet endeavouring to unravel the Mystery of the Treatment he had  received  falls out of the Frying pan into the Fire   Nevertheless  Pallet was still confounded and chagrined by one  consideration  which was no other than that of his having been so  roughly handled in the chamber  belonging  as he found upon inquiry   to the handsome young lady who was under the Capuchin s direction  He  recollected that the door was fast locked when his beast burst it open   and he had no reason to believe that any person followed him in his  inruption  on the other hand  he could not imagine that such a gentle  creature would either attempt to commit  or be able to execute  such  a desperate assault as that which his body had sustained  and her  demeanour was so modest and circumspect  that he durst not harbour the  least suspicion of her virtue  These reflections bewildered him in the  labyrinth of thought  he rummaged his whole imagination  endeavouring  to account for what had happened  At length  he concluded  that either  Peregrine  or the devil  or both must have been at the bottom of the  whole affair  and determined  for the satisfaction of his curiosity   to watch our hero s motions  during the remaining part of the night  so  narrowly  that his conduct  mysterious as it was  should not be able to  elude his penetration   With these sentiments he retired to his own room  after the ass had been  restored to the right owners  and the priest had visited and comforted  his fair ward  who had been almost distracted with fear  Silence no  sooner prevailed again  than he crawled darkling towards her door  and  huddled himself up in an obscure corner  from whence he might observe  the ingress or egress of any human creature  He had not long remained  in this posture  when  fatigued with this adventure and that of the  preceding night  his faculties were gradually overpowered with slumber   and  falling fast asleep  he began to snore like a whole congregation of  Presbyterians  The Flemish beauty  hearing this discordant noise in the  passage  began to be afraid of some new alarm  and very prudently bolted  her door  so that when her lover wanted to repeat his visit he was not  only surprised and incensed at this disagreeable serenade  the author of  which he did not know  but when compelled by his passion  which was  by this time wound to the highest pitch  he ventured to approach the  entrance  he
