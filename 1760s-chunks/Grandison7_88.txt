they are both so much improved as husband and Wife —Upon my Word  I am charmed with her in every one of the above characters  My Lord appears  even in her company  now that his wife has given him his due consequence  a manly  sensible Man  If he ever had any levities of behaviour they are all vanished and gone  She is all vivacity  as heretofore  but no flippancy  Her liveliness  in the main  is that of a sensible  not a very saucy wife  entirely satisfied with herself  her situation and prospects  Upon my Word  I am brought over to her opinion  that if the second man be worthy  a woman may be happy  who has not been indulged in her first Fancy  And I am the rather induced to hope so for my Emily s sake   Tuesday Evening   MRS  Beaumont has received a Letter from the Ladies her friends at Florence  expressing their fear that the love of her Country now she is in it  has taken place in her heart  and weakened her Affection for them  They beg of her to convince them of the contrary by hastening to them   This Letter  it seems  mentions some severe reflexions cast upon Lady Clementina by the unhappy Olivia  Camilla  who is very fond of me  has hinted this to me  and at the same time acquainted me with her young Lady s earnestness to see it  Mrs  Beaumont having expressed to her her indignation against Olivia on the occasion  Unworthy Olivia  What reflexions can you cast on the admirable Clementina    226 —Yet I wish Mrs  Beaumont would let me see them —But dear Mrs  Beaumont  impart not to Clementina any thing that may affect her delicate and too scrupulous mind   This over lively Lady G  has been acquainting Lady Clementina with Emily s story  yet intending to set forth nothing by it  she says  but the fortitude of so young a creature   She owns  that Lady Clementina often reddened as she proceeded in it  yet that she went on—How could she —I chid her for poor Emily s sake  for her own sake  for Lady Clementina s  for Sir Edward Beauchamp s sake—How could she be so indelicate  Is there a necessity  dear Lady G   thought I  as she repeated what passed on the occasion  now you are so right in the great articles of your duty  that you must be wrong in something   Lady Clementina highly applauded Emily  however  A charming young creature she called her  Absence  added she  is certainly a right measure  Were the man a common man  it would not signify  Presence  in that case  might help her  as he probably would every Day expose his Faults to her observation  But absence from such a man as Sir Charles Grandison  is certainly right  Lady G  says  it was easy to see that Lady Clementina made some self applications upon it   Wednesday Morning  May 2   LADY G  has been communicating to me a conference which she says  she could not but overhear  between Lady Clementina and Mrs  Beaumont  held in the closet of the latter  which joins to a closet in Lady G s dressing room  separated only by a thin partition  The rooms were once one—A little of your usual curiosity  I doubt  my dear Lady G  thought I  You were not confined to that closet  You might have retired when their conversation begun  But  no  Curiosity is a nail  that will fasten to the ground  the   227 foot of an inquisitive Person  however painful  what she hears may sometimes make her situation   Mrs  Beamont had acquainted Lady Clementina with the contents of the Letter she had received from her Friends at Florence  The poor Lady was in tears upon it  She called Olivia cruel  unjust  wicked  The very surmize  said she  is of such a nature  that I cannot bear to look either Lady Grandison  or any of her friends in the face  For Heaven s sake  let it not be hinted to any one in the family  nor even to my own relations  that Olivia herself could be capable of making such a reflexion upon me   My dearest Lady Clementina  said Mrs  Beaumont  I wish—  What wisheth my dear Mrs  Beaumont—  That you would change your system   ARTICLES  Mrs  Beaumont  ARTICLES —If they are broken with me  I resume my solicitude to be allowed to take the veil  That allowance  and that only  can set all right  My heart is distressed by what you have let me see Olivia has dared to throw out against me   Allow me one observation only  my dear Clementina  What Olivia has hinted  the world will hint  It behoves you to consider  that the Husband of Lady Grandison ought not to be so much the object of any woman s attention  as to be an obstacle to the address of another man really worthy   Cruel  cruel Olivia  There is no bearing the thought of her vile suggestion  None but Olivia—Say not the world  Olivia only  Mrs  Beaumont
