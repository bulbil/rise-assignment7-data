 in concluding for me  What  did the man think I was to be won at once    Did he imagine his merits were so extraordinary  that there required no   more to obtain  than barely to ask  But I give myself no concern on that   score  I assure you  Sir  it is the insolence of his accusing me of   being in love that vexes me  Who told him  I wonder  or how came such a   thing into his head  that Mr  Trueworth had the preference in my esteem    By the manner in which he speaks of him in this letter  he has found   more perfections in him than ever I did  and would make one think he   were himself enamoured of his rival s merits        In answer to all this  he told her  with a serious air  that Mr  Staple   was bound  by all those ties which engage a noble mind  to act in the   manner he had done  that he had been twice indebted to Mr  Trueworth for   his life  and that the whole behaviour of that gentleman towards him    both during the combat  and after it was over  demanded all the returns   that gratitude could pay       He afterwards ran into a detail of all the particulars of what had   passed between the two rivals  many of which the ladies were ignorant of   before  Lady Mellasin joined with her husband in extolling the   greatness of soul which Mr  Trueworth had shewn on this occasion  but   Miss Flora said little  and what she did  was rather in praise of Mr    Staple   Mr  Trueworth   cried she   is a fine gentleman enough  but has   done no more than what any man of honour would do  and  for my part  I   think that Mr  Staple  in putting the self denial he has now shewn in   practice  discovers more of the hero and philosopher than the other has   done        The conversation on this topick lasted some time  and probably would not   have broke off so soon  if it had not been interrupted by two young   ladies coming in to ask Miss Betsy and Miss Flora if they were not for   the Park that morning  To which they having agreed  and promised to call   on them in their way  went up into their chamber  in order to prepare   themselves for the walk proposed                CHAPTER III       Discovers to Miss Betsy a piece of treachery she little expected to   hear of          Miss Flora  who had been deterred from saying all she had a mind to do    on the affair between Miss Betsy s two lovers  now took this opportunity   of giving her tongue all the latitude it wanted  They were no sooner   come into the chamber  than   Lord  my dear   cried she  with a tone   vastly different from that in which she had spoke to her of late   how   vexed am I for you  It will certainly go all about the town  that you   are in love with Trueworth  and there will be such cabals  and such   whispering about it  that you will be plagued to death  I could tear him   to pieces  methinks  for I am sure he is a vain fellow  and the hint   must come first from himself         I never saw any thing like vanity in him   replied Miss Betsy   and I   am rather inclined to believe Mr  Staple got the notion from the idle   rattle of Mr  Chatfree     Mr  Chatfree   said Miss Flora   thought of   no such thing himself  till he had been at the tavern with Mr    Trueworth  but  if I was in your place  I would convince Mr  Staple  and   the world  that I was not capable of the weakness imputed to me         Why  what would you have me do   cried Miss Betsy   I would have you   write to Mr  Staple   answered the other   and let him know the   deception his rival has put upon him   Miss Betsy  who had always an   aversion to any thing of this kind  and thought it too great a   condescension to write on any score to a man who had pretended love to   her  shook her head at this proposal  and exclaimed against it with the   utmost vehemence       Miss Flora made use of all the arguments she could think on  to bring   her off from what she called
