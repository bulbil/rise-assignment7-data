353     Now  in Great Britain and Ireland  and in all continents or inland   countries  the several deserts  mountains  marshes  and other   obstacles  with the difficulty  danger  and toil of travel  and the   great expense of land carriage  have utterly precluded all com    merce and communication to any considerable extent  Insomuch   that it would be easier and cheaper to convey a commodity of any   burden to either of the Indies  than from many parts of Great   Britain and Ireland to others  by land      While God appears to separate the several nations of the earth   from each other  by the intervention of seas  lakes  and rivers  he   hath actually and intimately united them thereby      Water serves to the art and navigation of man  as air serves to   the wings of the feathered species  It is the easy and speedy   medium  the ready conduit and conveyance  whereby all redun    dancies are carried  and all wants supplied  It makes man  as it   were  a denizen of every country on the globe  It shortens every   distance  and ties the remotest regions together  It carries and   communicates the knowledge  the virtues  manufactures  and arts   of each climate to all  It gives new springs and motives to   industry  action  and invention  It gives a general importance   to the meanest manufacturer  It gives to each man an interest in   whatever is done upon earth  the productions of every region  and   the tribute of every nation      Now  China and Holland are the only countries upon earth who   have considerably availed themselves of this capital benefit of water   carriage  or water commerce   and therefore they are  incomparably    the most populous and most prosperous of all countries in the   world      China  as your lordship knows  extends from under the Tropic of   Cancer to about thirteen hundred miles north  and thereby contains   within itself all the variety of climate  and degrees of heat and   cold  that are requisite for the sundry productions upon earth    Inspired by some forecast or sagacity  not imparted to the rest   of mankind  they cut and quartered this vast continent by as many   navigable canals as answer to the ducts and veins in the human   body for the dispensation of life and nourishment  These canals   serve as links or chords to the grand community of the Chinese     they bind region to region  house to house  and man to man  and   hold the whole as one system or family together  This great king    dom is thereby become as one city  and the canals as so many   streets  through which plenty is diffused by commerce to every   part  If any art or useful invention commences or receives im    provement in any place  it is immediately conveyed to every place   for imitation and promotion  No portion of this wide continent   lies waste or uncultivated  because the canals are as so many   markets brought to every man s door  and  by the perpetual   demand of whatever is saleable  incite the natives to exert them    selves in providing all the redundancies they possibly can  that   they may derive wealth to themselves by supplying the respective   wants of others  Thus  throughout the expanded dominion of   China  nothing is wasted  nothing lost  nothing superfluous  nothing   wanting  All are employed  active  industrious  ingenious  and     A a         354 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      thriving  Their canals are intimately to them what seas are   diffusively to the rest of the globe  They are thereby become as   a world within themselves  sufficient to their own happiness and   occasions  They never change their manners or policy  They   never enterprise war against others  And China is affirmed at this   day to contain one hundred and twenty millions of prospering   inhabitants      The Dutch also  about a hundred and forty years ago  followed   the example of the Chinese  Their country is now become as one   great and extended metropolis to the universe   and through their   canals  as though paved and spacious high ways  the world resorts   with all its wealth  So encouraged and so incited  neither the   lame  nor the blind  nor the maimed  sit unemployed  Every child   is taught its trade from the moment it can apply its little hands to   a regular motion  and they bring to the parents vast sums  in lieu   of an infinite variety of toys and trifles that are dispersed among   the idle of the other children of men  For
