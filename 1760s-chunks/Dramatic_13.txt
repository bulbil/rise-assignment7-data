have limped along—that defect in their gait proceeding  either from the wounds received in battle  or from the neglect of not being dressed after the fight  or from incurable contractions  or relaxations  the fatal effects of being exposed to the scorching heats  and sudden damps of Africa  and America  and to the severity of wintering in ill provided quarters  on the banks of the Rhine  the Weeser  the Lippe   c   c  for which  perhaps  Flemish and Dutch commissaries                                          I was present at the disputation  which old Winterness had with Corporal Knott on this subject  which  with the reader s leave  we ll insert — because  if it is not a story  it is a dialogue  and as it is a dialogue  it will be a means of displaying a copper plate exhibition of an old warrior  and a junior fine gentleman  or  more properly  to explain the print  it is a contrast between the Charms of Peace in Mr  Knott s figure  and the Fortune of War in the old soldier s portrait     At the valiant tooper the altercation happened  old Winterness was relating in the Corporal s  Page  36  company all the engagements he had been in  fighting all his battles o er and o er again  and marking with a stick  upon the sand of the ale house kitchen  the marches and countermarches of our armies  dwelling with emphasis on the spot where he had received a shot  or lost a limb —There  my boys  just there  where I put my foot now  there I stood on the left of the Scotch greys  and had these two cuts on my skull  and  as it mought be here  I had these three wounds  and supposing now these pieces of pipe to be our front line  as I was to the right of the royal  a musquet ball took me in flank  and went through both my thighs  and there Sir  as I was running after the French Pollavousees  I lost the use of my right eye  and  Sir  supposing this full pot now to be Bocachica castle  there I stood while we were attacking it  and here it was  that I left my arm and leg at Cartagenah  — But what then — I don t think much at it  not I —I have gained honour and glory enough for an honest man—I know what it is to serve my country — and so here s his Majesty King George s health  and all his family  and Old England for ever—and as to my limbs  why they re welcome to um  as welcome as I am to this tobacco of my own buying     This limb losing conversation was foreign to the Corporal s thoughts  he had been bred up in polite and delicate principles  which was diametrically opposite to such gothic customs  although several people of birth lately  have been mad enough to relapse into their forefathers rusticity  and not mind the sun s spoiling their complexions  nor different climates having any  Page   unnumbered      illustration    Page 36th  Page  37  effect upon their constitutions  and have been as cool amidst batteries  broadsides  pitched battles  and forts storming  as if they were only dancing minuets at an assembly in England — Yet the Corporal did not exceedingly relish such maiming honours  for  in his days  fighting for one s country was not made such a fashion among fine gentlemen  as it is at present  therefore he rejoiced  that a peace had been so expeditiously manufactured   Yet he was ready  with a small sword  to give any private gentleman satisfaction—because that was fighting upon honour  which no person of honour could refuse—but fighting for one s country may be refused  because you may have—or—or—or—or—or— c   c  Knott  unwilling that Old Chelsea should win all the applause of the company  interrupted the scar furrowed grenadier  observing  that a man might run as many risques  be in as many dangers at home  as abroad  and to prove it  related his intrigues with several fine women     First  he recounted the hair breadth scapes to get Miss Neatsfoot  the tripe man s daughter off —how he scaled the back garret  how he knocked down the watchman  and how the town was obliged to him for bringing so accomplished a girl upon it—thus the Corporal went on  — It was I that gave that girl the first idea of acting  I ust to tell her  how the first time she got into grand keeping  she must persuade her friend to speak to some of the managers  about letting her come upon the Stage  because I know that s common — ay  and it s grown a scheme too among several gentlemen about town  to get  Page  38  rid of their women that way  for when a girl grows stale upon their hands  and they want to part with her
