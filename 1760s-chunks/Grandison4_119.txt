for you  my dear Dr  Bartlett  are so  And then I will subscribe myself a partaker of the happiness of all my friends  and particularly  Your ever affectionate GRANDISON   LETTER XLII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Bologna  Monday  May 15 26   LAST night arrived Lady Clementina  the General  his Lady  the Count  and Signor Sebastiano     297 I had left Jeronymo about an hour  He had had in the morning the intended opening made by Mr  Lowther  He would have me present   The operation was happily performed  But  thro  weakness of body  he was several times in the day troubled with faintings   I left him tolerably chearful in the evening  and rejoicing in expectation of his sister s arrival  and▪ as the Bishop had assured him of the General s grateful disposition  he longed  he said  to see that affectionate brother and his Lady once more  He had never but once seen her before  and then was so ill  that he could hardly compliment her on the honour she had done their family   The bishop sent to tell me that his sister was arrived  but that being fatigued and unhappy  Camilla should acquaint me in the morning with the way in which she should then be   I slept not half an hour the whole night  You  my dear friend  will easily account for my restlesness   I sent  as usual  early in the morning  to know how Jeronymo rested  The answer was favourable  returned by Mr  Lowther  who sat up with him that night  at his own motion  He knew not but something critical might happen   Camilla came  The good woman was so full of her own joy to see me once more in Italy  that I could not presently get a word from her  of what my heart throbbed with impatience to know   At last  You will  said she  have the General and the Bishop with you  Ah  Sir  my poor young Lady  What has she suffered since you left us  You will not know her  We are not sure she will know you  Who shall be able to bear the first interview  She has now but few intervals  It is all one gloomy confusion with her  She cares not to speak to anybody  Every stranger she sees  terrifies her  O the vile  thrice vile Lady Laurana —    298 In this manner ran on Camilla  Nor would she enter into any other particulars than the unhappy ones she left me to collect from the broken hints and exclamations thus thrown out  Alas  thought I  the calamities of Clementina have affected the head of the poor Camilla  She hurried away  lest she should be wanted  and lest the General should find her with me   The two brothers came soon after  The General took my hand  with a kind of forced politeness  We are all obliged to you  Sir  said he  for your Mr  Lowther  Are the surgeons of England so famous  But the people of your nation have been accustomed to give wounds  They should therefore furnish operators to heal them  We are obliged to you also  for the trouble you have given yourself in coming over to us in person  Jeronymo has found a revival of spirits upon it  God grant they may not subside  But  alas  our sister —Poor Clementina —She is lost   Would to God  said the Bishop  we had left her to the care of Mrs  Beaumont   The General himself  having taken her from Florence  would not join in this wish  There was a middle course  he said  that ought to have been taken  But Laurana is a daughter of the devil  said he  and Lady Sforza ought to be detested for upholding her   The General expressed himself with coldness on my coming over  but said  that now I was on the spot  and as his sister had been formerly desirous of seeing me  an interview might be permitted  in order to satisfy those of the family who had given me the invitation  which it was very good of me to accept  especially as I had the Lady Olivia in England attending my motions  But otherwise he had no opinion—There he stopt   I looked upon him with indignation  mingled with contempt  And directing myself to the Bishop  You   299 remember  my Lord  said I  the story of Naaman the Syrian  a   What is that  my Lord  said he to the Bishop   Far be it from me  continued I  still directing myself to the Bishop  to presume upon my own consequence in the application of the story  But your Lordship will judge how far the comparison will hold  Would to God it might throughout   A happy allusion  said the Bishop  I say Amen   I know not who this Naaman is  said the General  nor what is meant by your allusion  Chevalier  But by your looks I should imagine  that you mean me contempt   My looks  my Lord  generally indicate my heart
