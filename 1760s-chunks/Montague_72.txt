loving with ardor  and from the same cause as capable of being estranged by neglect  give your whole attention to preserving this invaluable treasure  observe every rule I have given to her  if you would be happy  and believe me  the heart of woman is not less delicate than tender  their sensibility is more keen  they feel more strongly than we do  their tenderness is more easily wounded  and their hearts are more difficult to recover if once lost       At the same time  they are both by nature and education more constant  and scarce ever change the object of their affections but from ill treatment  for which reason there is some excuse for a custom which appears cruel  that of throwing contempt on the husband for the ill conduct of the wife       Above all things  retain the politeness and attention of a lover  and avoid that careless manner which wounds the vanity of human nature  a passion given us  as were all passions  for the wisest ends  and which never quits us but with life       There is a certain attentive tenderness  difficult to be described  which the manly of our sex feel  and which is peculiarly pleasing to woman   tis also a very delightful sensation to ourselves  as well as productive of the happiest consequences  regarding them as creatures placed by Providence under our protection  and depending on us for their happiness  is the strongest possible tie of affection to a well turned mind       If I did not know Lucy perfectly  I should perhaps hesitate in the next advice I am going to give you  which is  to make her the confidante  and the only confidante  of your gallantries  if you are so unhappy as to be inadvertently betrayed into any  her heart will possibly be at first a little wounded by the confession  but this proof of perfect esteem will increase her friendship for you  she will regard your error with compassion and indulgence  and lead you gently back by her endearing tenderness to honor and herself       Of all tasks I detest that of giving advice  you are therefore under infinite obligation to me for this letter       Be assured of my tenderest affection  and believe me   Yours   c   ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXVII   117   To the Earl of —   Silleri  April 8   NOTHING can be more true  my Lord  than that poverty is ever the inseparable companion of indolence       I see proofs of it every moment before me  with a soil fruitful beyond all belief  the Canadians are poor on lands which are their own property  and for which they pay only a trifling quit rent to their seigneurs       This indolence appears in every thing  you scarce see the meanest peasant walking  even riding on horseback appears to them a fatigue insupportable  you see them lolling at ease  like their lazy lords  in carrioles and calashes  according to the season  a boy to guide the horse on a seat in the front of the carriage  too lazy even to take the trouble of driving themselves  their hands in winter folded in an immense muff  though perhaps their families are in want of bread to eat at home       The winter is passed in a mixture of festivity and inaction  dancing and feasting in their gayer hours  in their graver smoking  and drinking brandy  by the side of a warm stove  and when obliged to cultivate the ground in spring to procure the means of subsistence  you see them just turn the turf once lightly over  and  without manuring the ground  or even breaking the clods of earth  throw in the seed in the same careless manner  and leave the event to chance  without troubling themselves further till it is fit to reap       I must  however  observe  as some alleviation  that there is something in the climate which strongly inclines both the body and mind  but rather the latter  to indolence  the heat of the summer  though pleasing  enervates the very soul  and gives a certain lassitude unfavorable to industry  and the winter  at its extreme  binds up and chills all the active faculties of the soul       Add to this  that the general spirit of amusement  so universal here in winter  and so necessary to prevent the ill effects of the season  gives a habit of dissipation and pleasure  which makes labor doubly irksome at its return       Their religion  to which they are extremely bigoted  is another great bar  as well to industry as population  their numerous festivals inure them to idleness  their religious houses rob the state of many subjects who might be highly useful at present  and at the same time retard the increase of the colony       Sloth and superstition equally counterwork providence  and render the bounty of heaven of no effect       I am surprized the French  who generally make their religion subservient to the purposes of policy  do not discourage convents  and lessen the number of festivals  in the colonies  where both are so peculiarly pernicious       It is to this circumstance one may in great measure
