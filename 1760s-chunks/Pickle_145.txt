present  The doctor was  confounded  the governor dismayed  the Levite s teeth chattered  the  painter astonished at the general confusion  the cause of which he could  not comprehend  and Pickle himself  not a little alarmed  was obliged to  use all his interest and assiduity in appeasing this son of the church   who  at length  in consideration of the friendship he professed for the  young gentleman  consented to forgive what had passed  but absolutely  refused to sit in contact with such a profane wretch  whom he looked  upon as a fiend of darkness  sent by the enemy of mankind to poison the  minds of weak people  so that  after having crossed himself and uttered  certain exorcisms  he insisted upon the doctor s changing places with  the Jew  who approached the offended ecclesiastic in an agony of fear   Matters being thus compromised  the conversation flowed in a more  general channel  and without the intervention of any other accident  or bone of contention  the carriage arrived at the city of Ghent about  seven in the evening  Supper being bespoken for the whole company  our  adventurer and his friends went out to take a superficial view of  the place  leaving his new mistress to the pious exhortations of her  confessor  whom  as we have already observed  he had secured in his  interest  This zealous mediator spoke so warmly in his commendation   and interested her conscience so much in the affair  that she could  not refuse her helping hand to the great work of his conversion  and  promised to grant the interview he desired   This agreeable piece of intelligence  which the Capuchin communicated to  Peregrine at his return  elevated his spirits to such a degree  that he  shone at supper with uncommon brilliance  in a thousand sallies of wit  and pleasantry  to the delight of all present  especially of his fair  Fleming  who seemed quite captivated by his person and behaviour  The  evening being thus spent to the satisfaction of all parties  the company  broke up  and retired to their several apartments  where our lover  to  his unspeakable mortification  learned that the two ladies were  obliged to be in the same room  all the other chambers of the inn being  pre occupied  When he imparted this difficulty to the priest  that  charitable father  who was very fruitful in expedients  assured him  that his spiritual concerns should not be obstructed by such a slender  impediment  and accordingly availed himself of his prerogative  by going  into his daughter s chamber when she was almost undressed  and leading  her into his own  on pretence of administering salutary food for her  soul  Having brought the two votaries together  he prayed for success  to the operations of grace  and left them to their mutual meditations   after having conjured them in the most solemn manner to let no impure  sentiments or temptations of the flesh interfere with the hallowed  design of their meeting   The reverend intercessor being gone  and the door fastened on the  inside  the pseudo convert  transported with his passion  threw himself  at his Amanda s feet  and begging she would spare him the tedious form    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of addresses  which the nature of their interview would not permit him  to observe  began  with all the impetuosity of love  to make the most  of the occasion  But whether she was displeased by the intrepidity and  assurance of his behaviour  thinking herself entitled to more courtship  and respect  or was really better fortified with chastity than he or his  procurer had supposed her to be  certain it is  she expressed resentment  and surprise at his boldness and presumption  and upbraided him with  having imposed upon the charity of the friar  The young gentleman was  really as much astonished at this rebuff  as she pretended to be at his  declaration  and earnestly entreated her to consider how precious  the moments were  and for once sacrifice superfluous ceremony to the  happiness of one who adored her with such a flame as could not fail to  consume his vitals  if she would not deign to bless him with her favour   Notwithstanding all his tears  vows  and supplications  his personal  accomplishments  and the tempting opportunity  all that he could obtain  was an acknowledgment of his having made an impression upon her heart   which she hoped the dictates of her duty would enable her to erase  This  confession he considered as a delicate consent  and  obeying the impulse  of his love  snatched her up in his arms  with an intention of seizing  that which she declined to give  when this French Lucretia  unable  to defend her virtue any other way  screamed aloud  and the Capuchin   setting his shoulder to the door  forced it open  and entered in an  affected ecstasy of amazement  He lifted up his hands and eyes  and  pretended to be thunderstruck at the discovery he had made  then in  broken exclamations  professed his horror at the wicked intention of
