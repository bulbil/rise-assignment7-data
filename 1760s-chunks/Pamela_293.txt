you will take   no notice of our conversation  but I see you are much touched with it    Did you ever hear any thing prettier  more unaffected  sincere  free    easy   No  never  madam  answered she  in my life  and it is a great   pleasure to see so happy a reconciliation taking place  where there is   so much merit       I said  I have discovered so much prudence in Mrs  Worden  that  as well   for that  as for the confidence your ladyship places in her  I have made   no scruple of speaking my mind freely before her  and of blaming my   dear master while he was blameworthy  as well as acknowledging his   transcendent goodness to me since  which  I am sure  exceeds all I can   ever deserve  May be not  said my lady  I hope you ll be very happy in   one another  and I ll now rise  and tell him my thoughts  and ask him   to let me have the reading of your papers  for I promise myself much   pleasure in them  and shall not grudge a journey and a visit to you  to   the other house  to fetch them       Your ladyship s favour  said I  was all I had to wish for  and if I have   that  and the continuance of your dear brother s goodness to me  I shall   be easy under whatever else may happen       And so I took my leave  and withdrew  and she let me hear her say to   Mrs  Worden   Tis a charming creature  Worden   I know not which excels    her person  or her mind   And so young a creature too   Well may my   brother love her       I am afraid  my dear father and mother  I shall now be too proud indeed       I had once a good mind to have asked her ladyship about Miss Sally   Godfrey  but I thought it was better let alone  since she did not   mention It herself  May be I shall hear it too soon  But I hope not  I   wonder  though  whether she be living or dead       We breakfasted together with great good temper  and my lady was very   kind  and  asking my good master  he gave leave very readily  she should   see all my papers  when you returned them to me  and he said  He   was sure  when she came to read them  she would say  that I had well   deserved the fortune I had met with  and would be of opinion  that all   the kindness of his future life would hardly be a sufficient reward for   my virtue  and make me amends for my sufferings       My lady resolving to set out the next morning to return to her lord  my   master ordered every thing to be made ready for his doing the like to   Bedfordshire  and this evening our good neighbours will sup with us  to   take leave of my lady and us          Wednesday night       Nothing particular having passed at dinner or supper  but the most   condescending goodness  on my lady s side  to me  and the highest   civilities from Mr  Peters s family  from Lady Jones  from Sir Simon s   family  etc  and reciprocal good wishes all around  and a promise   obtained from my benefactor  that he would endeavour to pass a fortnight   or three weeks in these parts  before the winter set in  I shall   conclude this day with observing  that I disposed of the money my   master was so good to put into my hands  in the manner he was pleased to   direct  and I gave Mrs  Jewkes hers in such a manner as highly pleased   her  and she wished me  with tears  all kinds of happiness  and prayed   me to forgive her all her wickedness to me  as she herself called it  I   begged leave of my master to present Mrs  Worden with five guineas for a   pair of gloves  which he said was well thought of       I should have mentioned  that Miss Darnford and I agreed upon a   correspondence  which will be no small pleasure to me  for she is an   admirable young lady  whom I prefer to every one I have seen  and I   shall  I make no doubt  improve by her letters  for she is said to have   a happy talent in writing  and is well read  for so young a lady          Saturday       On
