placed implicitly under my superintendence    nothing was done without my special direction  the tenants paid their rents into my hands  the disbursements of the family were all under my revision  and the subordinate situations in the household were at my disposal without appeal  and yet the power of tyrannizing did not give me the inclination  as it has always hitherto done to my equals and superiors  I neither turned away the male servants  because I did not like the cut of their beards  nor the female ones because they happened not to like the cut of mine  If they made up to Don Caesar or his son at once  without currying my favour as the channel of all good graces  far from taking umbrage at them on that account  I spoke out officiously in their behalf  In other respects  too  the marks of confidence my two masters were incessantly lavishing on me inspired me with a substantial zeal for their service  Their interest was my real object  there was no slight of hand in my ministry  I was such a caterer for the general good  as you rarely meet with in private families or in political societies   While I was hugging myself on the well earned prosperity of my condition  love  jealous of my dealings with fortune  was bent on sharing my gratitude by the addition of a higher zest  he planted  watered  and ripened in the heart of Dame Lorenza Sephora  Seraphina s confidential woman  an abundant crop of liking for the happy steward  My Helen  not to sink the fidelity of the historian in the vanity of the man  could not be many months short of her fiftieth year  But for all that  a look of wholesomeness  a face none of the ugliest  and two good looking eyes of which she knew the efficient use  might make her still pass for a decent bit of amusement in a summer evening  I could only just have been thankful for a little more relief to her complexion  since it was precisely the colour of chalk  but that I attributed to maiden concealments  which had eat away all the damask of her cheek   The lady ogled me for a long time  with ogles that savoured more of passion than of chastity  but instead of communing in the language of the eyes  I made pretence at first not to be sensible of my own happiness  Thus did my gallantry appear as if arrayed in its first blushes  a circumstance which was rather tempting than repulsive to her feelings  Taking it into her head  therefore  that there was no standing upon dumb eloquence with a young man who looked more like a novice than he was  at our very first interview she declared her sentiments in broad  unequivocal terms  that I might have no plea for misinterpretation  She played her part like an old stager  affected to be overwhelmed with confusion while she was speaking to me  and after having said all she wanted to say in a good audible voice  put her hand before her face  to hide the shame which was not there  and make me believe that she was incommoded by the delicacy of her own feelings  There was no standing such an attack  and though vanity had a larger share in my surrender than the tender passion  I did not receive her overtures ungraciously  Nay  more  I presumed to overlook decorum in my vivacity  and acted the impatient lover so naturally as to call down a modest rebuke upon my freedoms  Lorenza chid my fondness  but with so much fondness in her chidings  that while she prescribed to me the coldness of an anchorite  it was very evident she would have been miserably disappointed if I had taken her prescription  I should have pressed the affair at once to the natural termination of all such affairs  if the lovely object of my ardent wishes had not been afraid of giving me a left handed opinion of her virtue  by abandoning the works before the siege was regularly formed  This being so  we parted  but with a promise to meet again  Sephora in the full persuasion that her reluctant resistance would stamp her for a vestal in my esteem  and myself full of the sweet hope that the torments of Tantalus would soon be succeeded by an elysium of enjoyment   My affairs were in this happy train  when one of Don Caesar s under servants brought me such a piece of news  as gave an ague to my raptures  This lad was one of those inquisitive inmates who apply either an ear or an eye to every keyhole in a house  As he paid his court constantly to me  and served up some fresh piece of scandal every day  he came to tell me one morning that he had made a pleasant discovery  and that he had no objection to letting me into the fun  on condition that I would not blab  because Dame Lorenza Sephora was the theme of the joke  and he was afraid of becoming obnoxious to her resentment and revenge  I was too much interested in coming at the story he had to tell  not to swear myself into discretion through thick and thin  but it was necessary that my motive should seem curiosity and not personal concern  so that I asked him  with an air of
