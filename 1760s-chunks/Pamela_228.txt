have been the   unhappy occasion of their disobliging you  He raised me up  and said    My beloved Pamela has too often been in this suppliant posture to me    to permit it any more  Rise  my fairest  and let me know whom  in   particular  you would reinstate  and he kindly held me in his arms  and   pressed me to his beloved bosom  Mrs  Jervis  sir  said I  in the first   place  for she is a good woman  and the misfortunes she has had in the   world  must make your displeasure most heavy to her       Well  said he  who next  Mr  Longman  sir  said I  and I am sure  kind   as they have been to me  yet would I not ask it  if I could not vouch   for their integrity  and if I did not think it was my dear master s   interest to have such good servants       Have you any thing further  said he   Sir  said I  your good old butler    who has so long been in your family before the day of your happy birth    I would  if I might  become an advocate for       Well  said he  I have only to say  That had not Mr  Longman and Mrs    Jervis  and Jonathan too  joined in a body  in a bold appeal to Lady   Davers  which has given her the insolent handle she has taken to   intermeddle in my affairs  I could easily have forgiven all the rest of   their conduct  though they have given their tongues no little license   about me  But I could have forgiven them  because I desire every body   should admire you  and it is with pride that I observe not only their   opinion and love  but that of every body else that knows you  justify my   own   But yet  I will forgive even this  because my Pamela desires it    and I will send a letter myself  to tell Longman what he owes to your   interposition  if the estate he has made in my family does not set him   above the acceptance of it  And  as to Mrs  Jervis  do you  my dear    write a letter to her  and give her your commands  instantly  on  the   receipt of it  to go and take possession of her former charge  for now    my dearest girl  she will be more immediately your servant  and I know   you love her so well  that you ll go thither with the more pleasure to   find her there   But don t think  added he  that all this compliance is   to be for nothing  Ah  sir  said I  tell me but what I can do  poor as   I am in power  but rich in will  and I will not hesitate one moment  Why   then  said he  of your own accord  reward me for my cheerful compliance    with one sweet kiss  I instantly said  Thus  then  dear sir  will I   obey  and  oh  you have the sweetest and most generous way in the world    to make that a condition  which gives me double honour  and adds to   my obligations  And so I clasped my arms about his neck  and was not   ashamed to kiss him once and twice  and three times  once for every   forgiven person       Now  my dearest Pamela  said he  what other things have you to ask  Mr    Williams is already taken care of  and  I hope  will be happy   Have you   nothing to say for John Arnold       Why  dear sir  said I  you have seen the poor fellow s penitence in my   letters   Yes  my dear  so I have  but that is his penitence for his   having served me against you  and  I think  when he would have betrayed   me afterwards  he deserves nothing to be said or done for him by either       But  dear sir  said I  this is a day of jubilee  and the less he   deserves  poor fellow  the more will be your goodness  And let me add   one word  That as he was divided in his inclinations between his duty to   you and good wishes to me  and knew not how to distinguish between the   one and the other  when he finds us so happily united by your great   goodness to me  he will have no more puzzles in his duty  for he has not   failed in any other part of it  but  I hope  will serve you faithfully
