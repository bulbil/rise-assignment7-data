 and took Miss Darnford s hand  and said  Save me    dear miss  by your sweet example  from my rising pride  But could I   deserve half these kind things  what a happy creature should I be  said   Miss Darnford  You deserve them all  indeed you do       The greatest part of the company having sat down to loo  my master being   pressed  said he would take one game at whist  but had rather be excused   too  having been up all night  and I asked how his friend did  We ll   talk of that  said he  another time  which  and his seriousness  made me   fear the poor gentleman was dead  as it proved       We cast in  and Miss Boroughs and my master were together  and Mr  Perry   and I  and I had all four honours the first time  and we were up at   one deal  Said my master  An honourable hand  Pamela  should go with an   honourable heart  but you d not have been up  if a knave had not been   one  Whist  sir  said Mr  Perry  you know  was a court game originally    and the knave  I suppose  signified always the prime minister        Tis well  said my master  if now there is but one knave in a court  out   of four persons  take the court through       The king and queen  sir  said Mr  Perry  can do no wrong  you know  So   there are two that must be good out of four  and the ace seems too plain   a card to mean much hurt       We compliment the king  said my master  in that manner  and  tis well to   do so  because there is something sacred in the character  But yet  if   force of example be considered  it is going a great way  for certainly a   good master makes a good servant  generally speaking       One thing  added he  I will say  in regard to the ace  I have always   looked upon that plain and honest looking card in the light you do  and   have considered whist as an English game in its original  which has made   me fonder of it than of any other  For by the ace I have always thought   the laws of the land denoted  and as the ace is above the king or queen    and wins them  I think the law should be thought so too  though  may be    I shall be deemed a Whig for my opinion       I shall never play whist  said Mr  Perry  without thinking of this    and shall love the game the better for the thought  though I am no   party man  Nor I  said my master  for I think the distinctions of whig   and tory odious  and love the one or the other only as they are honest   and worthy men  and have never  nor never shall  hope  given a vote  but   according to what I thought was for the public good  let either whig or   tory propose it       I wish  sir  replied Mr  Perry  all gentlemen in your station would act   so  If there was no undue influence  said my master  I am willing to   think so well of all mankind  that I believe they generally would       But you see  said he  by my Pamela s hand  when all the court cards   get together  and are acted by one mind  the game is usually turned   accordingly  Though now and then  too  it may be so circumstanced  that   honours will do them no good  and they are forced to depend altogether   upon tricks       I thought this way of talking prettier than the game itself  But I   said  Though I have won the game  I hope I am no trickster  No  said my   master  God forbid but court cards should sometimes win with honour  But   you see  for all that  your game is as much owing to the knave as the   king  and you  my fair one  lost no advantage  when it was put into your   power       Else  sir  said I  I should not have done justice to my partner  You   are certainly right  Pamela  replied he  though you thereby beat your   husband  Sir  said I  you may be my partner next  and I must do justice    you know  Well  said he  always choose so worthy a friend  as chance has
