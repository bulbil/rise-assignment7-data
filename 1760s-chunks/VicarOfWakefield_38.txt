my masquerade character in the play  Upon informing him  Page  195  of the truth  and that I did not belong to the company  he was condescending enough to desire me and the player to partake in a bowl of punch  over which he discussed modern politics with great earnestness and seeming interest  I set him down in my own mind for nothing less than a parliament man at least  but was almost confirmed in my conjectures  when upon my asking what there was in the house for supper  he insisted that the player and I should sup with him at his house  with which request  after some entreaties  I was prevailed on to comply   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XIX   The description of a person discontented with the present government  and apprehensive of the loss of our liberties   THE house where we were to be entertained  lying at a small distance from the village  our inviter observed  that as the coach was not ready  he would conduct us on foot  and we soon arrived at one of the most magnificent mansions I had seen in the country  The apartment into which we were shewn was perfectly elegant and modern  he went to give orders for supper  while the player  with a wink  observed that we were perfectly in luck  Our entertainer soon returned  an elegant supper was brought in  two or three ladies  in an  Page  198  easy deshabille  were introduced  and the conversation began with some sprightliness  Politics  however  was the subject on which our entertainer chiefly expatiated  for he asserted that liberty was at once his boast and his terror  After the cloth was removed  he asked me if I had seen the last Monitor  to which replying in the negative    What  nor the Auditor  I suppose    cried he    Neither  Sir    returned I    That s strange  very strange    replied my entertainer    Now  I read all the politics that come out  The Daily  the Public  the Ledger  the Chronicle  the London Evening  the Whitehall Evening  the seventeen magazines  and the two reviews  and though they hate each other  I love them all  Liberty  Sir  liberty is the Briton s boast  and by all my coal mines in Cornwall  I reverence its guardians     Then it is to be hoped    cried I    you reverence the king     Yes    returned my entertainer    when he does what we would have him  but if he goes on as he has done of late   Page  199  I ll never trouble myself more with his matters  I say nothing  I think only  I could have directed some things better  I don t think there has been a sufficient number of advisers  he should advise with every person willing to give him advice  and then we should have things done in another manner         I wish    cried I    that such intruding advisers were fixed in the pillory  It should be the duty of honest men to assist the weaker side of our constitution  that sacred power that has for some years been every day declining  and losing its due share of influence in the state  But these ignorants still continue the cry of liberty  and if they have any weight basely throw it into the subsiding scale         How    cried one of the ladies    do I live to see one so base  so sordid  as to be an enemy to liberty  and a defender of tyrants  Liberty  that sacred gift of  Page  200  heaven  that glorious privilege of Britons         Can it be possible    cried our entertainer    that there should be any found at present advocates for slavery  Any who are for meanly giving up the privileges of Britons  Can any  Sir  be so abject         No  Sir    replied I    I am for liberty  that attribute of Gods  Glorious liberty  that theme of modern declamation  I would have all men kings  I would be a king myself  We have all naturally an equal right to the throne  we are all originally equal  This is my opinion  and was once the opinion of a set of honest men who were called Levellers  They tried to erect themselves into a community  where all should be equally free  But  alas  it would never answer  for there were some among them stronger  and some more cunning than others  and these became masters of the rest  for as  Page  201  sure as your groom rides your horses  because he is a cunninger animal than they  so surely will the animal that is cunninger or stronger than he  sit upon his shoulders in turn  Since then it is entailed upon humanity to submit  and some are born to command  and others to obey  the question is  as there
