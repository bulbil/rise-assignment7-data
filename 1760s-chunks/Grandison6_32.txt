with regard to the proposals I had formerly made to the family at Bologna  relating to Religion and Residence  as I had also declared to the brothers of the Lady  that no worldly grandeur should ever have induced me to allow  in a beginning address  the terms  I was willing  as a compromise  to allow to that Lady  for thoroughly had I weighed the inconveniencies which must attend such an alliance  The Lady zealous in her Religion  the Confelsor who was to be allowed her  equally zealous  the spirit of making proselytes so strong  and held by Roman Catholics to be so meritorious  and myself no less in earnest in my Religion  I had no doubt to pronounce  I told the good Doctor  in confidence     that I should be much more happy in marriage with the Lady of Selby house  were she to be induced to   80 honour me with her hand  than it was possible I could be with Lady Clementina  even were they to comply with the conditions I had proposed  as I doubted not but that Lady would also be  were her health restored  with a man of her own nation and Religion    And I owned to him  besides    that I could have no hope of conquering the opposition given me by the friends of Clementina  and that I could not at times but think hardly of the indignities cast upon me by some of them      The doctor  I knew  at the same time that he lamented the evil treatment Clementina met with from her mistaken friends  and her unhappy malady  and admired her for her manifold excellencies  next to adored Miss Byron  And he gave his voice accordingly     But here  doctor  is the case  said I—Clementina is a woman with whom I had the honour of being acquainted before I knew Miss Byron  Clementina has infinite merits  She herself refused me not  She consented to accept of the terms I offered  She even besought her friends to comply with them  She has an opinion of my honour  and of my tenderness for her  Till I had the happiness of knowing Miss Byron  I was determined to await either her recovery or release  and will Miss Byron herself  if she knows that  forgive me  the circumstances not changed  for the change of a resolution of which Clementina was so worthy  The treatment the poor Lady has met with  for my sake  as once she wrote  tho  virgin modesty induced her to cross out those words  has heightened her disorder  She still to this moment  wishes to see me  While there is a possibility  tho  not a probability  of my being made the humble instrument of restoring an excellent woman  who in herself deserves from me every consideration of tenderness  ought I to wish to engage the heart  were I able to succeed in my wishes  of the equally  excellent Miss Byron —Could   81 I be happy in my own mind  were I to try  and to succeed  And if not  must I not be as ungrateful to her  as ungenerous to the other —Miss Byron s happiness cannot depend on me  She must be happy in the happiness she will give to the man of her choice  whoever shall be the man      We were all silent  My grandmamma and aunt seemed determined to be so  and I could not speak  He proceeded   You know not  dear Miss Byron  I wished you not to know  the conflicts my mind laboured with  when I parted with you on my going abroad  My destiny was wrapt up in doubt  and uncertainty  I was invited over  Signor Jeronymo was deemed irrecoverable  He wished to see me  and desired but to live to see me  My presence was requested as a last effort to recover his noble sister  You yourself  madam  applauded my resolution to go  But  that I might not be thought to wish to engage you in my favour  so circumstanced as I was  that to have done so  would have been to have acted unworthily to both Ladies   I insinuated my hopelessness of ever being nearer to you than I was   I was not able to take a formal leave of you  I went over  Success attended the kind  the soothing treatment which Clementina met with from her friends  Success also attended the means used for the recovery of the noble Jeronymo  Conditions were again proposed  Clementina  on her restoration  shone upon us all even with a brighter lustre than she did before her disorder  All her friends consented to reward with the hand of their beloved daughter  the man to whom they attributed secondarily the good they rejoiced in  I own to you  Ladies  that what was before honour and compassion  now became admiration  and I should have been unjust to the merits of so excellent a woman  if I could not say  Love  I concluded myself already the husband of Clementina  yet it would have   82 been strange  if the welfare and happiness of Miss Byron were not the next wish of my heart  I rejoiced that  despairing
