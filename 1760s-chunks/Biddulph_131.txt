a day  my white Guiney hen brought out a fine brood of chickens  you might be as well pleased with it  as I should be to hear from you of the birth of an arch duchess  Indeed  my Cecilia  there is such a sameness in my now tranquil days  that I believe I must have recourse to telling you my dreams  to furnish out matter of variety   March 19  We have had a wedding to day in our neighbourhood  Young Main  Patty’s brother  has got a very pretty young gentlewoman  with a fortune of five thousand pounds  It seems  this pair had been fond of each other from their childhood  but the girl’s fortune put her above her lover’s hopes  however  as he has  for a good while  been in very great business  and has the reputation of being better skilled in his profession than any one in the country  he was in hopes  that his    character  his mistress’s affection for him  and his own constancy  would have some little weight with her family  Accordingly he ventured to make his application to the young woman’s brother  at whose disposal she was  her father having been dead for some years  but he was rejected with scorn  and forbid the house   The girl’s father  it seems  had been an humourist  and left her the fortune under a severe restriction  for  if ever she married without her brother’s consent  she was to lose it  so that  in that particular instance of disposing of her person  she was never to be her own mistress  In the disposal of her fortune  however  he did not so tie her up  for after the age of one and twenty  she had the power of bequeathing her fortune by will to whom she pleased   The brother  who is a very honest man  had no motive  but a regard to his sister’s interest  in refusing poor Mr Main  a man of good fortune had proposed for her  whom the brother importuned her to accept of  but she was firm to her first attachment   The young lover found means to convey a letter to his mistress  in which he told her  that as he was in circumstances to support her genteelly  if she would venture to accept of his hand  he would never more bestow a thought on her fortune  This proposal the prudent young woman declined on her own part  but advised him to make it to her brother  as she was not then without suspicions that he wished to retain her fortune in the family  and that it was only to save appearances he had proposed a match to her  of which he was sure she would not accept  But in this opinion she injured him  She thought  however  the experiment might be of use  in giving the better colour to her marrying afterwards the man whom she loved   But it was an ill judged attempt  and succeeded accordingly  for  if the brother should have given his consent  he could have no pretence for withholding her portion  or  if he did so by mutual agreement  his motive for denying his consent before  must appear too obviously to be a bad one   The young people  not considering this sufficiently  resolved to make the trial  accordingly Mr Main wrote to the brother a very submissive letter  telling him he would  in the most solemn manner  relinquish all claim to his sister’s fortune  if he would make him happy by consenting to their marriage  without which  he said  the young lady’s regard for her brother would not suffer her to take such a step     This letter had no other effect than that of making the brother extremely angry  He sent a severe message to the young man  to acquaint him  that he looked upon his proposal as a most injurious affront to his character  but that he was ready to convince him  and every body else  that he had no designs upon his sister’s fortune  as he would not refuse his consent to her marriage with any other man in the country but himself  This was a thunder clap to the poor lover  he comforted himself  however  with the hopes that his mistress’s heart would determine her in his favour  notwithstanding the severity of the brother   There had been  it seems  besides this gentleman’s not thinking Mr Main a suitable match for his sister  some old family pique between him and Mr Main’s father   These transactions happened some time before I came to the country  Just about that juncture  the poor girl had the misfortune to receive a hurt in her breast  by falling against the sharp corner of a desk from a stool  on which she had stood in order to reach down a book that was in a little case over it  This accident threw her into a fit of illness  which put a stop to all correspondence between her and her lover   In this illness  a fever  which was her apparent complaint  was the only thing to which the physician paid attention  and the hurt in her breast was not enquired after  so that by the time she was tolerably recovered from the
