value your crackers of a rope s end   This oration  the longest  that ever Pipes was known to make  he concluded with a flourish of his  cudgel  and enforced with such determined refusals to leave them  that  they found it impossible to bring the cause to mortal arbitrement at  that time  and strolled about the park in profound silence  during  which  Hatchway s indignation subsiding  he  all of a sudden  thrust out  his hand as an advance to reconciliation  which being cordially shaken  by Peregrine  a general pacification ensued  and was followed by a  consultation about the means of extricating the youth from his present  perplexity  Had his disposition been like that of most other young men   it would have been no difficult task to overcome his difficulties  but  such was the obstinacy of his pride  that he deemed himself bound in  honour to resent the letters he had received  and instead of submitting  to the pleasure of the commodore  expected an acknowledgment from him   without which he would listen to no terms of accommodation   Had I been  his own son   said he   I should have borne his reproof  and sued for  forgiveness  but knowing myself to be on the footing of an orphan  who  depends entirely upon his benevolence  I am jealous of everything that  can be construed into disrespect  and insist upon being treated with the  most punctual regard  I shall now make application to my father  who is  obliged to provide for me by the ties of nature  as well as the laws  of the land  and if he shall refuse to do me justice  I can never want  employment while men are required for his Majesty s service      6 22 15  3 45 PM   The lieutenant  alarmed at this intimation  begged he would take no new  step until he should hear from him  and that very evening set out for  the garrison  where he gave Trunnion an account of the miscarriage  of his negotiation  told him how highly Peregrine was offended at the  letter  communicated the young gentleman s sentiments and resolution   and finally assured him that unless he should think proper to ask pardon  for the offence he had committed  he would  in all appearance  never  more behold the face of his godson   The old commodore was utterly confounded at this piece of intelligence   he had expected all the humility of obedience and contrition from the  young man  and  instead of that  received nothing but the most indignant  opposition  and even found himself in the circumstances of an offender   obliged to make atonement  or forfeit all correspondence with his  favourite  These insolent conditions at first threw him into an agony of  wrath  and he vented execrations with such rapidity that he left himself  no time to breathe  and had almost been suffocated with his choler   He inveighed bitterly against the ingratitude of Peregrine  whom he  mentioned with many opprobrious epithets  and swore that he ought to be  keelhauled for his presumption  but when he began to reflect more coolly  upon the spirit of the young gentleman  which had already manifested  itself on many occasions  and listened to the suggestions of Hatchway   whom he had always considered as an oracle in his way  his resentment  abated  and he determined to take Perry into favour again  this  placability being not a little facilitated by Jack s narrative of our  hero s intrepid behaviour at the assembly  as well as the contest with  him in the park  But still this plaguy amour occurred like a bugbear to  his imagination  for he held it as an infallible maxim  that woman was  an eternal source of misery to man  Indeed  this apophthegm he seldom  repeated since his marriage  except in the company of a very few  intimates  to whose secrecy and discretion he could trust  Finding  Jack himself at a nonplus in the affair of Emilia  he consulted Mrs   Trunnion  who was equally surprised and offended when she understood  that her letter did not produce the desired effect  and after having  imputed the youth s obstinacy to his uncle s unseasonable indulgence   had recourse to the advice of the parson  who  still with an eye to his  friend s advantage  counselled them to send the young gentleman on his  travels  in the course of which he would  in all probability  forget  the amusements of his greener years  The proposal was judicious  and  immediately approved  when Trunnion  going into his closet  after divers  efforts  produced the following billet  with which Jack departed for  Windsor that same afternoon          My good lad   If I gave offence in my last letter I m sorry      for t  d ye see  I thought it was the likeliest way to bring      you up  but  in time to come  you shall have a larger swing      of cable  When you can
