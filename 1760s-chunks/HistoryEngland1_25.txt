his just claims with vicious generosity  Thus  after a life spent in toil  fatigue  and ambition  he found himself  at last  utterly deprived  not only of his patrimonial dukedom  but of his fortune  his freedom  and friends  Normandy he saw fall to the conqueror  to add to his misfortunes  he at last languished  for twenty six years of his life  a prisoner in Cardiff castle in Wales  where he died in captivity  To want prudence is  in some measure  to want virtue   Henry  having acquired possession of Normandy  might now be said to be master of a theatre where many a succeeding tragedy was to be performed  and soon his neighbour of France began to shew his jealousy of so powerful a rival  These wars now began which were to be so fatal to distant posterity  The ravages of the French were at first neglected  and Henry remained a quiet spectator in England  as if unprovoked at their insolence  but foon he shewed  that his unwillingness to engage was by no means the effect of fear  He passed into Normandy with a powerful army  and offered the enemy battle  the challenge was soon accepted  and a furious combat ensued  During the fight  a French cavalier  named Crispin  personally attacked the King of England  and struck him twice on the head  with such force  that all   73 his armour streamed with an effusion from the wound  The King  however  no way intimidated  continued the single combat with resolution  and  summoning all his strength  discharged such a blow at his adversary  as threw him from his horse  and he became the prisoner of his Majesty s own hand  This decided the victory in favour of the English  who pursued the French with great slaughter  which hastened the peace  that was concluded soon after   Fortune now seemed to smile upon Henry  and promise a long succession of felicity  he was in peaceable possession of two powerful states  and had a Prince for undisputed heir  now arrived at his sixteenth year of age  a youth of great hopes  All his enemies were humbled  and many actually in his own power  Matilda  his daughter  was married to the Emperor Henry IV  and he had the hearts of the greatest number of his subjects  particularly the English  All his prospects  however  were at once clouded by an unforeseen misfortune  an accident which tinctured his remaining life with misery  Henry  returning victorious from abroad  brought with him a numerous retinue of the chief nobility  In one of the vessels of the fleet  his son  and several young noblemen  his companions  went together to render the passage more agreeable  The young Prince  desirous to be first ashore  promised the seamen a reward  if they came in foremost  This emulation was fatal to them all  the pilot ran the ship upon a rock  and immediately she was dashed to pieces  The Prince  however  was put into the boat and would have escaped  were he not called back by the cries of Matilda  his sister  He was now out of danger himself  but could not leave her to perish  he   74 prevailed upon the sailors to row back to take her in  the approach of the boat giving others an opportunity to attempt saving their lives  several leaped in also  so that the boat was overloaded  and all  except one  went to the bottom  When Henry was informed of the catastrophe of his only son  he covered his face  and never laughed after   The rest of his life seems a mere blank  his restless spirit of ambition had nothing now to toil for  His daughter  Matilda  however  becoming a widow  he married her a second time to Geoffry of Plantagenet  and  when brought to bed of a son  named Henry  he caused the nobility to give an oath of succession  in her favour  The great men of those times were ready to swear whatever the Monarch commanded  but observed it no longer than while they were obliged to obey  He did not long survive this attempt to confirm the succession  he died  as it is said  of a surfeit  caused by eating lampreys  in the sixty eighth year of his age  having reigned thirty six   It is strange  that historians impute it as a fault to several English Monarchs of those times  that they came to the crown without hereditary claims to support their title  this is one of the faults alledged against Henry  but it is none  if we consider the usual spirit of other successions   During the reign of Henry  the barons and the clergy were growing into power  each was a petty tyrant over those who held under him  In order  therefore  to confirm privileges so lately acquired  they joined in electing a King  who might owe to them  and not to any previous claim  his prerogative and sceptre  With such intentions they pitched upon Stephen  nephew to the deceased King  and  as for their oaths to Matilda    75 the Bishops gave them an absolution  They could not  indeed  have made
