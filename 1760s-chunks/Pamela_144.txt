cause to think that you will be the more insolent  as   you find me kinder  Ah  sir  said I  you know best your own heart and   designs  But I fear I was too open hearted then  and that you still   keep your resolution to undo me  and have only changed the form of your   proceedings       When I tell you once again  said he  a little sternly  that you cannot   oblige me more  than by placing some confidence in me  I will let you   know  that these foolish and perverse doubts are the worst things you   can be guilty of  But  said he  I shall possibly account for the cause   of them  in these papers of yours  for I doubt not you have been sincere   to your father and mother  though you begin to make me suspect you  For   I tell you  perverse girl  that it is impossible you should be thus cold   and insensible  after what has passed in the garden  if you were not   prepossessed in some other person s favour  And let me add  that if I   find it so  it shall be attended with such effects  as will make every   vein in your heart bleed       He was going away in wrath  and I said  One word  good sir  one   word before you read them  since you will read them  Pray make   allowances  for all the harsh reflections that you will find in them    on your own conduct to me  And remember only  that they were not written   for your sight  and were penned by a poor creature hardly used  and who   was in constant apprehension of receiving from you the worst treatment   that you could inflict upon her       If that be all  said he  and there be nothing of another nature  that   I cannot forgive  you have no cause for uneasiness  for I had as many   instances of your saucy reflections upon me in your former letters  as   there were lines  and yet  you see  I have never upbraided you on that   score  though  perhaps  I wished you had been more sparing of your   epithets  and your freedoms of that sort       Well  sir  said I  since you will  you must read them  and I think I   have no reason to be afraid of being found insincere  or having  in any   respect  told you a falsehood  because  though I don t remember all   I wrote  yet I know I wrote my heart  and that is not deceitful  And   remember  sir  another thing  that I always declared I thought myself   right to endeavour to make my escape from this forced and illegal   restraint  and so you must not be angry that I would have done so  if I   could       I ll judge you  never fear  said he  as favourably as you deserve  for   you have too powerful a pleader within me  And so went down stairs       About nine o clock he sent for me down into the parlour  I went a little   fearfully  and he held the paper in his hand  and said  Now  Pamela    you come upon your trial  Said I  I hope I have a just judge to hear my   cause  Ay  said he  and you may hope for a merciful one too  or else I   know not what will become of you       I expect  continued he  that you will answer me directly  and plainly    to every question I shall ask you   In the first place  here are several   love letters between you and Williams  Love letters  sir  said I   Well    call them what you will  said he  I don t entirely like them  I ll   assure you  with all the allowances you desired me to make for you  Do   you find  sir  said I  that I encouraged his proposal  or do you not    Why  said he  you discourage his address in appearance  but no otherwise   than all your cunning sex do to ours  to make us more eager in pursuing   you       Well  sir  said I  that is your comment  but it does not appear so in   the text  Smartly said  says he  Where a d   l gottest thou  at these   years  all this knowledge  And then thou hast a memory  as I see by your   papers  that nothing escapes  Alas  sir  said I  what poor abilities I   have  serve only to make me more miserable
