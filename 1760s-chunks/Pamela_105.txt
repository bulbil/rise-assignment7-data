still  Good Heaven    succeed to me my dangerous  but innocent devices   I have read of a   great captain  who  being in danger  leaped overboard into the sea    and his enemies  as he swam  shooting at him with bows and arrows  he   unloosed his upper garment  and took another course  while they stuck   that full of their darts and arrows  and so he escaped  and lived   to triumph over them all  So what will I do  but strip off my upper   petticoat  and throw it into the pond  with my neckhandkerchief  For to   be sure  when they miss me  they will go to the pond first  thinking I   have drowned myself  and so  when they see some of my clothes floating   there  they will be all employed in dragging the pond  which is a very   large one  and as I shall not  perhaps  be missed till the morning  this   will give me opportunity to get a great way off  and I am sure I will   run for it when I am out  And so I trust  that Providence will direct my   steps to some good place of safety  and make some worthy body my friend    for sure  if I suffer ever so  I cannot be in more danger  nor in worse   hands  than where I am  and with such avowed bad designs       O my dear parents  don t be frightened when you come to read this   But   all will be over before you can see it  and so God direct me for the   best  My writings  for fear I should not escape  I will bury in the   garden  for  to be sure  I shall be searched and used dreadfully if I   can t get off  And so I will close here  for the present  to prepare for   my plot  Prosper thou  O gracious Protector of oppressed innocence  this   last effort of thy poor handmaid  that I may escape the crafty devices   and snares that have begun to entangle my virtue  and from which  but   by this one trial  I see no way of escaping  And oh  whatever becomes of   me  bless my dear parents  and protect poor Mr  Williams from ruin  for   he was happy before he knew me          Just now  just now  I heard Mrs  Jewkes  who is in her cups  own to the   horrid Colbrand  that the robbing of poor Mr  Williams was a contrivance   of hers  and executed by the groom and a helper  in order to seize my   letters upon him  which they missed  They are now both laughing at the   dismal story  which they little think I overheard  O how my heart   aches  for what are not such wretches capable of  Can you blame me for   endeavouring  through any danger  to get out of such clutches          Past eleven o clock       Mrs  Jewkes is come up  and gone to bed  and bids me not stay long in my   closet  but come to bed  O for a dead sleep for the treacherous brute  I   never saw her so tipsy  and that gives me hopes  I have tried again  and   find I can get my head through the iron bars  I am now all prepared    as soon as I hear her fast  and now I ll seal up these  and my other   papers  my last work  and to thy providence  O my gracious God  commit   the rest   Once more  God bless you both  and send us a happy meeting    if not here  in his heavenly kingdom  Amen          Thursday  Friday  Saturday  Sunday  the 28th  29th  30th  and 31st days   of my distress       And distress indeed  For here I am still  and every thing has been worse   and worse  Oh  the poor unhappy Pamela   Without any hope left  and   ruined in all my contrivances  But  oh  my dear parents  rejoice with   me  even in this low plunge of my distress  for your poor Pamela has   escaped from an enemy worse than any she ever met with  an enemy she   never thought of before  and was hardly able to stand against  I mean    the weakness and presumption  both in one  of her own mind  which   had well nigh  had not the divine grace interposed  sunk her into the   lowest  last abyss of misery and perdition       I will proceed  as I have opportunity  with my
