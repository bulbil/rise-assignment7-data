and over again  for he had been in the army  Of course I was idolized by these three persons  never out of their arms  My early years were passed in the most childish amusements  for fear of hurting my health by application  It will not do  said my father  to hammer much learning into children till time has ripened their understanding  While he waited for this ripening  the season went by  I could neither read nor write  but I made up for that in other ways  My father taught me a thousand different games  I became perfectly acquainted with cards  was no stranger to dice  and my grandfather set me the example of drawing the long bow  while he entertained me with his military exploits  He sung the same songs repeatedly one after another every day  so that when  after saying ten or twelve lines after him for three months together  I got to boggle through them without missing  the whole family were in raptures at my memory  Neither was my wit thought to be at all less extraordinary  for I was suffered to talk at random  and took care to put in my oar in the most impertinent manner possible  O the pretty little dear  exclaimed my father  as if he had been fascinated  My mother made it up with kisses  and my grandfather s old eyes overflowed  I played all sorts of dirty and indecent tricks before them with impunity  everything was excusable in so fine a boy  an angel could not do wrong  Going on in this manner  I was already in my twelfth year without ever having a master  It was high time  but then he was to teach me by fair means  he might threaten  but must not flog me  This arrangement did me but little good  for sometimes I laughed when my tutor scolded  at others  I ran with tears in my eyes to my mother or my grandfather  and complained that he had used me ill  The poor devil got nothing by denying it  My word was always taken before his  and he came off with the character of a cruel rascal  One day I scratched myself with my own nails  and set up a howl as if I had been flogged  My mother ran  and turned the master out of doors  though he vowed and protested he had never lifted a finger against me   Thus did I get rid of all my tutors  till at last I met with one to my mind  He was a bachelor of Alcala  This was the master for a young man of fashion  Women  wine  and gaming  were his principal amusements  It was impossible to be in better hands  He hit the right nail on the head  for he let me do what I pleased  and thus got into the good graces of the family  who abandoned me to his conduct  They had no reason to repent  He perfected me betimes in the knowledge of the world  By dint of taking me about to all his haunts  he gave such a finish to my education  that barring literature and science  I be came an universal scholar  As soon as he saw that I could go alone in the high road to ruin he went to qualify others for the same journey  During my childhood I had lived at home just as I liked  and did not sufficiently consider  that now I was beginning to be responsible for my own actions  My father and mother were a standing jest  Yet they were themselves thrown into convulsions at my sallies  and the more ridiculous they were made by them  the more waggish they thought me  In the mean time I got into all manner of scrapes with some young fellows of my own kidney  and  as our relations kept us rather too short of cash for the exigencies of so loose a life  we each of us made free with whatever we could lay our hands on in our own families  Finding this would not raise the supplies  we began to pick pockets in the streets at night  As ill luck would have it  our exploits came to the knowledge of the police  A warrant was out against us  but some good natured friend  thinking it a pity we should be nipped in the bud  gave us a caution  We took to our heels  and rose in our vocation to the rank of highwaymen  From that time forth  gentlemen  with a blessing on my endeavours  I have gone on till I am almost the father of the profession  in spite of the dangers to which it is exposed   Here the captain ended  and it came to the turn of the lieutenant  Gentle men  extremes are said to meet     and so it will appear from a comparison of our commander s education and mine  My father was a butcher at Toledo  He passed  with reason  for the greatest brute in the town  and my mother s sweet disposition was not mended by the example  In my childhood  they whipped me in emulation of one another  I came in for a thousand lashes of a day  The slightest fault was followed up by the severest punishment  In vain did I beg for
