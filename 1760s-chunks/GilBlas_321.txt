on board  On this the gamester  finding that I had cut my teeth of wisdom sooner than suited his purpose  turned me off very coolly  saying  Go about your business  master Scipio  and speed as you may deserve  I do not like to play with folks who are in the habit of revoking  Get out of my sight  or I shall set your solfeggio in a crying key   I spared him the trouble of telling me to go twice  Off I shot like an arrow  for fear he should unfledge me  by taking away my livery  When distant enough to slacken my pace  I walked along in the streets  musing whither I might betake myself for a night s lodging  with only two reals in my pocket  The gate of the archbishop s palace at length stared me in the face  and  as his grace s supper was then dressing  a savoury odour exhaled from the kitchens  impregnating the gale with soup and sauce for a mile round  Ods haricots and cutlets  thought I  it would be no hard matter for me to dispense with one of those little side dishes  which will be of no use to the archbishop but to make out the figure of his table  nay  I would be contented only just to dip in my four fingers and thumb  and then to sup like a bear upon suckings  But how to accomplish it  Is there no way of bringing these choice morsels to a better test than that of smell  And why not  Hunger  they say  will break through stone walls  On this idea did I set my wits to work  and  by dint of conning over the subject  a stratagem struck me  which set my lungs as well as appetite in motion  just as the old carpenter kept bawling   I have found it   like a madman  when he had hit the right nail of his proposition on the head  I ran into the court of the palace  and made the best of my way to the kitchens  calling out with all my might   Help  help   as if some assassin had been at my heels   At my reiterated cries master Diego  the archbishop s cook  ran with three or four kitchen drudges to learn what was the matter  and seeing only me  asked why I roared so loud  Ah  good sir  answered I  with every token of exquisite distress  for mercy s sake and for St Polycarp s  save me  I beseech you  from the fury of a blusterer  who swears he will kill me  But where is this disturber of the public peace  cried Diego  You have no one to quarrel with but yourself  for I do not see so much as a cat to spit at you  Go your ways  my little man  and do not be afraid  it is evidently some wag who has been playing upon your cowardice for his diversion  but he knew better than to follow you within these walls  for we would have cut his ears off at the least  No  no  said I  it was for no laughing matter that he ran after me  He is a noted footpad  and meant to rob me  I am certain that he is now waiting for me at the corner of the street  Then he may wait long enough  replied the knight of the iron spit  for you shall stay here till to morrow  You shall sup with us  and we will give you a bed   I was out of my little wits with joy at the mention of these last tidings  and it was like the turnpike road to paradise after crossing an Arabian desert  when being led by master Diego through the kitchens  I there saw my lord archbishop s supper  and the stew pans in the last throes of parturition  There were fifteen accountable souls  for I reckoned them up  in attendance on the labour  but the litter of dishes far out numbered the fecundity of nature in her most prolific mood  so much more gracious and bountiful is providence to the heads of the church in the indulgence of their appetites  than mindful of the worthless brute creation in the propagation of its kind  Here it was  at the fountain head of prelacy  inhaling an atmosphere of gravy  instead of just snuffing the scent as it lay upon the breeze  that I first shook hands with sensuality  I had the honour of supping with the scullions  and of sleeping in their room  an initiation of friendship so sincere and strong  that on the following day  when I went to thank master Diego for his goodness in vouchsafing me a refuge  he said  Our kitchen lads have been with me in a body  to declare how excessively delighted they are with your manners  and to propose having you among them as a fellow servant  How should you  on your part  like to make one of the society  I answered that  with such a feather in my cap  I should be the vainest and the happiest of mortals  Then so be it  my friend  replied he  consider yourself henceforth as a buttress of the hierarchy  With this invitation
