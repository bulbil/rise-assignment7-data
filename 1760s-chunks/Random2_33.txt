above —This request was a real favour to one of his disposition  which was no less communicative than curious  he therefore complied with great satisfaction  and let me know  to my extreme astonishment  that the supposed young prince was a dancer at one of the theatres  and the ambassador no other than a fidler belonging to the opera    The doctor  said he  is a Roman Catholick priest  who sometimes appears in the character of an officer  and assumes the name of captain  but more generally takes the garb  title and behaviour of a physician  in which capacity he wheedles himself into the confidence of weak minded people  and by arguments no less specious than false  converts them from their religion and allegiance —He has been in the hands of justice more than once for such practices  but he is a sly dog  and manages matters with so much craft  that hitherto he has escaped for a short imprisonment —As for the general  you may see he has owed his promotion more to his interest than his capacity  and now that the eyes of   92 the ministry are opened  his friends dead  or become inconsiderable  he is struck off the list  and obliged to put up with a yearly pension  in consequence of this reduction  he is become malecontent  and enveighs against the government in all companies  with so little discretion  that I am surprised at the lenity of the administration in overlooking his insolence  but the truth of the matter is  he owes his safety to his weakness and want of importance —He has seen a little  and but a little service  and yet if you will take his word for it  there has not been a great action performed in the field since the revolution  in which he was not principally concerned  When a story is told of any great general  he immediately matches it with one of himself  though he is often unhappy in his invention  and commits such gross blunders in the detail  that every body is in pain for him —Caesar  Pompey  and Alexander the Great are continually in his mouth  and as he reads a good deal without any judgment to digest it  his ideas are confused  and his harrangues as unintelligible as infinite  for  once he begins  there is no chance of his leaving off speaking  while one person remains to yield attention  therefore the only expedient I know  of putting a stop to his loquacity  is to lay hold of some incongruity he has uttered  and demand an explanation  or ask the meaning of some difficult term that he knows by name only  this will effectually put him to silence  if not to flight  as it happened when I enquired about an epaulement —Had he been acquainted with the signification of that word  his triumph would have been intolerable  and we must have quitted the field first  or   93 been worried with impertinence  —  Having thus gratified my curiosity  the old gentleman began to discover his own  in questions relating to myself  to which I thought proper to return ambiguous answers —   I presume  Sir   said he  you have travelled  —  I answered    Yes     —I dare say  you would find it very expensive  said he   —  I replied    To be sure  one cannot travel without money  —   That I know by experience  said he  for I myself take a trip to Bath or Tunbridge every season  and one must pay sauce for what he has on the road as well in other countries as in this —That s a very pretty stone in your ring —give me leave  Sir —the French have attained to a wonderful skill in making compositions of this kind —Why now  this looks almost as well as a diamond  —   Almost as well  Sir   said I  why not altogether —I m sure if you understand any thing of jewels  you must perceive at first sight  that this stone is a real diamond  and that of a very fine water —Take it in your hand  and examine it  —  He did so  with some confusion  and returned it  saying    I ask your pardon  I see it is a true brilliant of immense value  —  I imagined his respect for me increased after this inquiry  therefore to captivate his esteem the more  I told him  I would shew him a seal of composition  engraved after a very valuable antique  upon which I pulled out my watch with a rich gold chain  adorned with three seals set in gold  and an opal ring —He viewed each of them with great eagerness  handled the chain  admired the chased case  and observed  that the whole must have cost me a vast sum of money  I affected indifference  and replied in a careless manner    Some trifle of sixty or   94 seventy guineas    Upon which he stared in my face for some time  and then asked if I was an Englishman —I answered in the negative —   You are from Ireland then  Sir  I presume   said he     I made the same
