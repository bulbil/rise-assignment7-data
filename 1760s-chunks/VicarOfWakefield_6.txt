Burchell and I bringing up the rear  We lightened the fatigues of the road with philosophical disputes  which he seemed perfectly to understand  But what surprised me most was  that though he was a money borrower  he defended his opinions with as much obstinacy as if he had been my patron  He now and then also informed me to whom the different seats belonged that lay in our view as we travelled the road    That    cried he  pointing to a very magnificent house which stood at some distance    belongs to Mr  Thornhill  a young gentleman who enjoys a large fortune  though entirely dependant on the will of his uncle  Sir Willam Thornhill  a gentleman  who content with a little himself  permits his nephew to enjoy the rest  and chiefly resides in town     What    cried I    is my young landlord then the nephew of a man whose virtues  generosity  and singularities are so universally known  I have heard  Page  26  Sir William Thornhill represented as one of the most generous  yet whimsical  men in the kingdom  a man of consummate benevolence   —   Something  perhaps  too much so    replied Mr  Burchell    at least he carried benevolence to an excess when young  for his passions were then strong  and as they all were upon the side of virtue  they led it up to a romantic extreme  He early began to aim at the qualifications of the soldier and scholar  was soon distinguished in the army  and had some reputation among men of learning  Adulation ever follows the ambitious  for such alone receive most pleasure from flattery  He was surrounded with crowds  who shewed him only one side of their character  so that he began to lose a regard for private interest in universal sympathy  He loved all mankind  for fortune prevented him from knowing that there were rascals  Physicians tell us of a disorder in which  Page  27  the whole body is so exquisitely sensible  that the slightest touch gives pain  what some have thus suffered in their persons  this gentleman felt in his mind  The slightest distress  whether real or fictitious  touched him to the quick  and his soul laboured under a sickly sensibility of the miseries of others  Thus disposed to relieve  it will be easily conjectured  he found numbers disposed to solicit  his profusions began to impair his fortune  but not his good nature  that  indeed  was seen to encrease as the other seemed to decay  he grew improvident as he grew poor  and though he talked like a man of sense  his actions were those of a fool  Still  however  being surrounded with importunity  and no longer able to satisfy every request that was made him  instead of money he gave promises  They were all he had to bestow  and he had not resolution enough to give any man pain by a denial  By this means he drew round him crowds of dependants   Page  28  whom he was sure to disappoint  yet wished to relieve  These hung upon him for a time  and left him with merited reproaches and contempt  But in proportion as he became contemptible to others  he became despicable to himself  His mind had leaned upon their adulation  and that support taken away  he could find no pleasure in the applause of his heart  which he had never learnt to reverence itself  The world now began to wear a different aspect  the flattery of his friends began to dwindle into simple approbation  that soon took the more friendly form of advice  and advice when rejected ever begets reproaches  He now found that such friends as benefits had gathered round him  were by no means the most estimable  it was now found that a man s own heart must be ever given to gain that of another  I now found  that—but I forget what I was going to observe  in short  sir  he resolved to respect himself   Page  29  and laid down a plan of restoring his shattered fortune  For this purpose  in his own whimsical manner he travelled through Europe on foot  and before he attained the age of thirty  his circumstances were more affluent than ever  At present  therefore  his bounties are more rational and moderate than before  but still he preserves the character of an humourist  and finds most pleasure in eccentric virtues      My attention was so much taken up by Mr  Burchell s account  that I scarce looked forward as we went along  till we were alarmed by the cries of my family  when turning  I perceived my youngest daughter in the midst of a rapid stream  thrown from her horse  and struggling with the torrent  She had sunk twice  nor was it in my power to disengage myself in time to bring her relief  My sensations were even too violent to  Page  30  permit my attempting her rescue  she would have certainly perished had not my companion  percieving her danger  instantly plunged in to her relief  and  with some difficulty  brought her in safety to the opposite shore  By taking the current a little farther
