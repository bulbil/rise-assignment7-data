 as if distressed —To be sure they were distressed   Caroline found out her brother  But when she approached him  could not utter one word of what she had meditated to say  But  dropping down on one knee  blessed him  as she owned  in her heart  both for Lord L  and herself  but could only express her gratitude by her lifted up hands and eyes   Just as he had raised and seated her  enter d to them the equally grateful Charlotte  He placed her next her sister  and drawing a chair for himself  taking an hand of each  he thus addressed himself to them     237 My dear sisters  you are too sensible of these but due instances of my brotherly love  It has pleased God to take from us our father and mother  We are more than brothers and sisters  and must supply to each other the wanting relations  Look upon me only as an executor of a will  that ought to have been made  and perhaps would  had time been given  My circumstances are greater than I expected  greater  I dare say  than my father thought they would be  Less than I have done  could not be done  by a brother who had power to do this  You don t know how much you will oblige me  if you never say one word more on this subject  You will act with less dignity  than becomes my sisters  if you look upon what I have done in any other light than as your due   O my aunt  Be so good  as to let the servants prepare my apartment at Selby house  There is no living within the blazing glory of this man  But  for one s comfort  he seems to have one fault  and he owns it—And yet does not acknowledgment annihilate that fault —O no  for he thinks not of correcting it  This fault is pride  Do you mind what a stress he lays now and then on the Family name  and  as above  Dignity  says he  that becomes my sisters —Proud mortal —O my Lucy  he is proud  too proud  I doubt  as well as too considerable in his fortunes—What would I say —Yet  I know who would study to make him the happiest of men—Spare me  spare me here  my uncle  or rather skip over this passage  Lucy   Sir Charles  at the end of eight months from his father s death  gave Caroline  with his own hand  to Lord L   Charlotte had two humble servants  Lord G  and Sir Walter Watkyns  as you have seen in my former Letters  but likes not either of them   Lord L  carried his Lady down to Scotland  where   238 she was greatly admired and caressed by all his relations  How happy for your Harriet was their critically proposed return  which carried down Sir Charles and Miss Charlotte to prepare every thing at Colnebrooke for their reception   Sir Charles accompanied my Lord and Lady L  as far on their way to Scotland as York  where he made a visit to Mrs Eleanor Grandison  his father s maidensister  who resides there  She  having heard of his goodness to his sisters  and to every body else with whom he had concerns  longed to see him  and on this occasion rejoiced in the opportunity he gave her to congratulate  to bless  and applaud  her nephew   What multitudes of things have I farther to tell you  relating to this strange man  Let me call him names   I enquired after the history of the good Dr  Bartlett  But the Ladies said  As they knew not the whole of it  they would refer me to the Doctor himself  They knew however enough  they said  to reverence him as one of the most worthy and most pious of men  They believed  that he knew all the secrets of their brother s heart   Strange  methinks  that these secrets lie so deep   Yet there does not seem any thing so very forbidding  either in Sir Charles or the Doctor  but that one might ask them a few innocent questions  And yet I did not use to be so very curious neither  Why should I be more so than his sisters —Yet persons coming strangers into a family of extraordinary merit  are apt  I believe  to be more inquisitive about the affairs and particularities of that family  than those who make a part of it  And when they have no other motive for their curiosity  than a desire to applaud and imitate  I see not any great harm in it   I was also very anxious to know  what  at so early an age  for Sir Charles was not then eighteen  were the faults he found with the governor appointed for   239 him  It seems  the man was not only profligate himself  but  in order to keep himself in countenance  laid snares for the young gentleman s virtue  which  however  he had the happiness to escape  tho  at an age in which youth is generally unguarded  This man was also contentious  quarrelsome  and a drinker  and yet  as
