subject of that part of the kingdom was granted a participation of British freedom   But whatever tranquility might have been restored by these means at home  the flames of war still continued to rage upon the continent with its accustomed violence  The French went forward with rapid success  having reduced almost the whole Netherlands to their obedience  In vain the Dutch negotiated  supplicated  and evaded war  they saw themselves stripped of all those strong towns which defended their dominions from invasion  and they now lay almost defenceless  ready to receive terms from their conquerors  The Dutch  at this time  were very different from their forefathers  the brave assertors of liberty  in the beginning of their republic  the individuals of their state were rich  while the government was poor  they had lost  in a spirit of traffic and luxury  all generosity of sentiment  and desire of independence  they only sought riches  regardless of public virtue  They were divided in their councils between two factions which now subsisted  namely  that which declared for a Stadtholder  and that which  with attachments to France  opposed his election  The prevalence of either side was almost equally fatal to liberty  if a Stadtholder was elected  they then saw their constitution altered from a republic to a kind of limited monarchy  if the opposite party prevailed  they were to feel the weight of a   186 confirmed aristocracy  confirmed by French power  and crouching under its authority  Of the two e…s they chose the former  the people  in several tons  inflamed almost to tumult and sedition  compelled their magistrates to declare for the Prince of Orange as Stadtholder  Captain general and Admiral of the United Provinces  The vigorous consequences of this resolution immediately appeared  all commerce with the French was prohibited  the Dutch army was augmented  and orders were issued to commence hostilities against the French by sea and land   Thus we see this war diffused throughout the whole system of Europe  in some measure resembling a disorder  the symptoms of which  at different times  appear in different parts of the body  remitting and raging by turns  At the commencement of the war we have seen the Queen of Hungary upon the point of losing all her possessions  Soon after we saw the unfortunate Duke of Bavaria  who had been chosen Emperor by the name of Charles VII  banished from his throne  stripped of his hereditary dukedom  and ever shrinking from surrounding dangers  We have seen the Duke of Savoy  now King of Sardinia  changing that side which some years before he espoused  and  joining with Austria and England  against the ambitious designs of France  while Italy still felt all the terrors of war  or rather saw foreigners contending with each other for her dominions  the French and Spaniards on one side  the Imperialists and the King of Sardinia on the other  Thus Rome  that once gave laws to the world  now saw the troops of Germany and Spain  by turns  enter into her territories  and  after various combats  she  at last  saw the Imperialists become masters  The Spaniards and French lost the most flourishing armies  notwithstanding the excellent conduct of the Prince of Conti their General  and  at last  after a bloody victory obtained over the Spaniards   187〈◊〉 St  Lazaro  the beautiful city of Genoa  which …d sided with Spain  was obliged to submit to the conquerors  to suffer some indignities imposed upon them  and to pay a most severe contribution   The city of Genoa had  for ages before  maintained its own laws  and boasted of liberty  Besides its inner wall  it had another formed by a chain of rocks of more than two leagues extent  but both being built in those times when modern fortification was yet unknown  it was not thought  by its Senate  capable of making a proper resistance  Upon submitting  the unhappy Italians too soon found that no mercy was to be expected from the court of Vienna  which had ever patronized oppression  More than a million sterling was demanded for a contribution  a tax  the payment of which must have utterly ruined the city  The magistrates did all in their power to pay the exorbitant sum demanded  and the German troops exercised every inhumanity in exacting it  The conquerors lived upon the people  and treated them with an insolence which was natural to them as conquerors  and as Germans  The Genoese were  at length  reduced to despair  and were resolved to make a last effort for the recovery of their liberty and independence  The Austrians took the cannon of the city  in order to transport them to Provence  where their arms had already penetrated  The Genoese themselves were obliged to draw those cannon which they had once considered as the defence and ornament of their citadel  It was on this occasion that an Austrian officer struck one of the citizens  who had been employed in this laborious task  This blow served to animate the people with their former spirit of freedom  They took up arms in every quarter of the town  and surprized some battalions of the Austrians  surrounded others  and cut them in pieces  The Senate  uncertain how to proceed  neither encouraged nor stopped the citizens  who
