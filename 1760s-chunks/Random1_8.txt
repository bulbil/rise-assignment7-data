that when different interests divided it  one of the parties commonly courted the assistance of Roderick Random  by which name I was known  to cast the balance  and keep the opposite section in awe —Meanwhile  I took the advantage of every play day  to present myself before my grandfather  to whom I seldom found access  by reason of his being so closely besieged by a numerous family of his female grandchildren  who  though they perpetually quarrelled among themselves  never failed to join against me  as the common enemy of all  His heir  who was about the age of eighteen  minded nothing but fox hunting  and indeed was qualified for nothing else  notwithstanding his grandfather s indulgence  in entertaining a tutor for him at home  who at the same time performed the office of parish clerk  This young Acteon  who inherited his grandfather s antipathy to every   12 thing in distress  never set eyes on me  without uncoupling his beagles  and hunting me into some cottage or other  whither I generally fled for shelter  In this christian amusement  he was encouraged by his preceptor  who  no doubt  took such opportunities to ingratiate himself with the rising sun  observing that the old gentleman  according to course of nature  had not long to live  being already on the verge of fourscore —The behaviour of this rascally sycophant incensed me so much  that one day  when I was beleagured by him and his hounds into a farmer s house  where I had found protection  I took aim at him  being an excellent marksman  with a large pebble  which struck out four of his foreteeth  and effectually incapacitated him for doing the office of a clerk ever after   CHAP  III   My mother s brother arrives—relieves me—a description of him—goes along with me to the house of my grandfather—is encountered by his dogs—defeats them after a bloody engagement—is admitted to the old gentleman—a dialogue between them   ABOUT this time  my mother s only brother  who had been long abroad  lieutenant of a man of war  arrived in his own country  where being informed of my condition  he came to see me  and out of his slender finances  not only supplied me with what necessaries I wanted for the present  but resolved not to leave the   13 country  until he had prevailed on my grandfather to settle something handsome for the future  This was a task to which he was by no means equal  being entirely ignorant not only of the judge s disposition  but also unacquainted with the ways of men in general  to which his education on board had kept him an utter stranger —He was a strong built man  somewhat bandylegged  with a neck like that of a bull  and a face which  you might easily perceive  had withstood the most obstinate assaults of the weather —His dress consisted of a soldier s coat altered for him by the ship s taylor  a stripped flannel jacket  a pair of red breeches japanned with pitch  clean grey worsted stockings  large silver buckles that covered three fourths of his shoes  a silverlaced hat whose crown over looked the brims about an inch and a half  a black bob wig in the buckle  a check shirt  a silk handkerchief  an hanger with a brass handle girded to his thigh by a tarnished laced belt  and a good oak plant under his arm —Thus equipt  he set out with me  who by his bounty made a very decent appearance  for my grandfather s house  where we were saluted by Jowler and Caesar  whom my cousin  young master  had let loose at our approach  Being well acquainted with the inveteracy of these curs  I was about to betake myself to my heels  when my uncle seizing me with one hand  brandished his cudgel with the other  and at one blow laid Caesar sprawling on the ground  but finding himself attacked at the same time in the rear by Jowler  and fearing Caesar might recover  he drew his hanger  wheel d about  and by a lucky stroke  severed Jowler s head from his body —By this time  the young fox hunter and   14 three servants armed with pitch forks and flails were come to the assistance of the dogs  whom they found breathless upon the field  My cousin was so provoked at the death of his favourites  that he ordered his attendants to advance  and take vengeance on their executioner  whom he loaded with all the curses and reproaches his anger could suggest —Upon which my uncle stepped forwards with an undaunted air  at the sight of whose bloody weapon  his antagonists fell back with precipitation  when he accosted their leader thus —   Lookée  brother  your dogs having boarded me without provocation  what I did was in my own desence —So you had best be civil  and let us shoot a head  clear of you    Whether the young  squire misinterpreted my uncle s desire of peace  or was enraged at the fate of his hounds beyond his usual pitch of resolution  I know not  but he snatched a flall from one of his followers  and came up with a shew of assaulting the lieutenant  who putting himself into a posture of defence  proceeded thus —
