country   their neglect of which has ro jsed an   indignation that will make them tremble          Or  in other words  they have disappointed your expeotationa    and  therefore  you take this method of being revenged on them    and extorting for fear what they would not do for favour  the   general motive of modem patriots  I acknowledge   but with what   face can you pretend to the title  prostituted as it is  I cannot think    as your very name is a burlesque upon everything that is serious          Pray  how so  reverend and grave sir   If the most profligate   sinner makes the best saint  as you say  why should not a moderate   rake make a tolerable politician   I believe you will hardly at    tribute it to the superior excellence of the latter character  But   the truth is  though it is impossible for me to profess political prin    ciples more contrary to my practice than your moral practice is   to your preaching  yet you would deny me the toleration which   you avail yourself of  and have my words judged from my actions     not my actions from my words  as you expect your own shall be    But my private character or practice signifies nothing to this under    taking  which is to rip up the practices and characters  public and   private  of a set of people who have obtruded themselves into a   station that exposes them to envy  and every accusation against   whom will  therefore  be received implicitly  without regarding   who or what the author of it is  Not but there is sufficient room   to attack these  whose whole private lives have been such a continual   series of vice and folly  and their public conduct of blunders and   villany  that it is impossible to say or think anything bad enough   of them  as I have already proved by incontestible instances in my   pamphlet  and shall by many more in the course of the undertaking    If the tables  indeed  should turn  and I get into their place  then   they may make the same use of my character  and perhaps not   without effect   but at present it is quite out of the question  And   now that I have opened myself to you  I expect your assistance    in return for my confidence          Assistance in politics   It is not in my power to give you any    I hate  from my soul  every political system under the sun  as a   jumble of folly and villany  I mean as they are carried into practice    not ID  their speculative plans   and therefore never could throw away   a thought upon them          That signifies nothing  The assistance which I want  you are   qualified to give  While I detect their political blunders and villany    you shall lash their private vices and follies  till we make them   equally ridiculous and odious to every man of sense and virtue in   the nation  a task that will give you the pleasing opportunity of   indulging that misanthropy which inspires the muse of a satirist  and   is mistaken for virtue  because it rails against vice   for  blazen it   out aa pompously as you will  nothing but ill nature can make a   man take delight in exposing the defects of others  and the more   forcibly he does it  the more powerful must that principle be with   him  And by the same rule  it is good nature that makes a man   fawn upon folly and flatter vice   and consequently  whoever does   it  is virtuous          A most judicious way of reasoning  truly  Now  on the contrary          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 473     I think it a much more just conclusion  that they who treat vice   with tenderness approve in their hearts  and would practice it if   they could  and that they who expose its deformities and dangers   really detest it  though they may sometimes  through human weak    ness  fall into the practice  But I do not wonder at your remark     it is an old and common one  All who are conscious that they   deserve the lash desire to lessen its force  and therefore derive satire   from ill nature  in order to obviate the application of it to the proper   object  and fasten upon the satirist the fault which is in them    selves  And this abuse of the terms good and ill  nature is the reason   why some have been provoked to call the former folly  But
