   nor did the blunt festivity of my master add a little to the pleasure   of the voyage  which met but one cloud  that seemed first to threaten   a good deal  but soon blew over      When we were about half our voyage  my master entered the   cabin hastily one morning  and  with a kind of fierce delight flashing   in his eyes  says to the Inquisitor  whom he always called owner       Well  owner  you shall now see what English boys can do  There   is a large EVenchman bearing down upon us  but if you do not see   him sheer off as short as if he had got foul of a lee shore  I will   never take the helm again  if he is not even obliged to drop anchor   to bring him up alongside of us   and  as I expected some such thing    I took a letter of marque  so that you need not fear of being hanged   for a pirate if the worst should happen        But  delighted as my master was  his passengers did not seem   so well pleased with the news  especially his owner  who was not   used to fighting  and beside was too anxious for his escape with his   fair prize to think of anything with pleasure which could possibly   deprive him of her      They all went directly  therefore  upon the deck  and seeing the   ship really coming towards them  the Inquisitor went into the cabin    that he should not be observed by the men  and  sending for my   master  accosted him thus   â€”       Surely  my friend  you cannot mean to wait for that ship   1    for we were lying to     She certainly means to ruttiick you          And so let her  owner    replied my master     I ll warrant she   gets as good as she brings          But consider  my friend    returned the Inquisitor    consider we   are on board you         Well  owner  and what then   You are not afraid   The lady   may be stowed safe below  and you will stand as good a chance as   another  You are not afraid           My good friend  I have not time now to explain my reasons to   you   but if you have any regard for me  you will instantly crowd   all the sail you can  and get clear of this affair  I desire it â€” I beg   it         Why  look you  owner  what needs all these words   If so be   you order us  we must put about  to be sure  for the ship is yours    But then the honour of Old England   consider that  the honour of   Old England          Oh  my friend  I can consider nothing but my desire to avoid   this danger   so once more I beg          Enough said  enough said     Then going upon the deck â€”     Well  my lads  our owner does not choose this brush while the   lady is on board   so we must about ship  but  as we come back    soup maigre shall pay for it    And  saying this  he obeyed the   desire of his owner as faithfully as if it had been his own  only not   with the same appearance of pleasure  not being able to avoid   ejaculating   Damn fear     at every turn of the tune he whistled  as he   walked  the deck the rest of the day      He had so punctually observed his owner s instructions in getting         292 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     a good ship  that we were soon out of sight of the Frenchman     nor did we meet with anything disagreeable during the remainder   of the voyage      The day after this affair  when they had all recovered their good    humour  my master addressed his owner thus     Now  owner    while the sky is clear  and we have nothing else to do  I had better   give you an account of your money  Here is the log book  which   you may overhaul at your leisure  though the sooner the better    This is the time  There is no taking a good observation in a storm    as may happen by and by
