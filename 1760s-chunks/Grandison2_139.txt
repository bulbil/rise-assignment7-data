time  was engaged in shews  fpectacles  and in the diversions of the places in which he lived  as it might be said  rather  than thro  which he passed    The Doctor  at one time  was the more patient with these delays  as he was willing that the carnival at Venice should be over  before he suffered his pupil to go to that city  But Lorimer  suspecting his intention  slipt thither unknown to his governor  at the very beginning of it  and the Doctor was forced to follow him  And when there  had the mortification of hearing of him  for the young man avoided his governor as much as possible  as one of the most riotous persons there    In vain did the Doctor  when he saw his pupil  set before him the example of Mr  Grandison  a   348 younger man  All the effect the Letters he used to read to him had upon him  was  to make him hate the more both his Governor and Mr  Grandison  By one Letter only did he do himself temporary credit  It was written some months before it was shewn him  in which Mr  Grandison described some places of note  thro  which he had passed  and thro  which the Doctor and his charge had also more lately passed  The mean creature contrived to steal it  and his father having often urged for a specimen of his son s observations on his travels  he copied it almost verbatim  and transmitted it as his own to his father  only letting the Doctor know  after he had sent it away  that he had written      The Doctor doubted not  but Lorimer had exposed himself  but was very much surprised  when he received a congratulatory Letter from the father on his son s improvements  mingled with some little asperity on the Doctor  for having set out his son to his disadvantage   I could not doubt   said the fond father   that a son of mine had genius  He wanted nothing but to apply  —And then he gave orders for doubling the value of his next remittance        The Doctor took the young gentleman to task about it  He owned what he had done  and gloried in his contrivance  But his governor thought it incumbent upon him to undeceive the father  and to save him the extraordinary part of his remittance        The young man was enraged at the Doctor  for exposing him  as he called it  to his father  and for the check he was continually giving to his lawless appetites  and falling into acquaintance with a courtezan  who was infamous for ruining many young travellers by her subtle and dangerous contrivances  they joined in a resolution to revenge themselves on the Doctor  whom they considered as their greatest enemy        Several projects they fell upon  One  in particular    349 was  to accuse him  by a third hand  as concerning himself with affairs of state in Venice  A crime  which in that jealous republic  is never overlooked  and generally ends fatally for the accused  who  if seized  is hardly ever heard of afterwards  From this danger he narrowly escaped  by means of his general good character  and remarkable inoffensiveness  and the profligateness of his accusers  Nor knew he his danger till many months afterwards  The Doctor believes  that he fared the better for being an Englishman  and a governor to the son of a British nobleman  who made so considerable a figure in England  because the Italians in general reap so much advantage from the travellers of this nation  that they are ready to favour and encourage them above those of any other        The Doctor had been very solicitous to be acquitted of his ungracious charge  In every Letter he wrote to England  this was one of his prayers  But still the father  who knew not what to do with his son at home  had besought his patience  and wrote to his son in the strongest terms  after reproaching him for his ungraciousness  to pay an implicit obedience to the Doctor        The father was a learned man  Great pains had been taken with Lorimer  to make him know something of the antient Greek and Roman histories  The father was very desirous  that his son should see the famous places of old Greece  of which he himself had read so much  And with great difficulty  the Doctor got the young man to leave Venice  where the vile woman  and the diversions of the place  had taken scandalous hold of him        Athens was the city  at which the father had desired they would make some stay  and from thence visit other parts of the Morea  And there the young man found his woman got before him  according to private agreement between them       350   It was some time before the Doctor found out that the very woman who had acted so abandoned a part with Lorimer at Venice  was his mistress at Athens  And when he did  he applied
