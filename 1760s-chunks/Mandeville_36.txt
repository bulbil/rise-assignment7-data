my soul  Yes  Mordaunt  let me be wretched  but let every blessing Heaven can bestow  be the portion of the loveliest of her sex      How little did I know of love  when I gave that name to the shameful passion I felt for the wife of my friend  The extreme beauty of the Countess Melespini  that unreserved manner which seldom fails to give hope  the flattering preference she seemed to give me above all others  lighted up in my soul a more violent degree of youthful inclination  which the esteem i had for her virtues refined to an appearance of the noblest of affections  to which it had not the remotest real resemblance            1 185          Without any view in my pursuit of her but my own selfish gratification  I would have sacrifised her honor and happiness to a transient fondness  which dishonored my character  and  if successful  might have corrupted a heart naturally full of probity  her amiable reproofs  free from that severity which robs virtue of half her charms  with the generous behaviour of the most injured of mankind  recalled my soul to honor  and stopped me early in the career of folly  time wore out the impression of her charms  and left only a cold esteem remaining  a certain proof that she was never the object of more than a light desire  since the wounds which real love inflicts are never to be intirely healed        Such was the infamous passion which I yet remember with horror  but my tenderness for Lady Julia  more warm  more animated  more violent  has a delicacy of which those only who love like me can          1 186       form any idea  independent of the charms of her person  it can never cease but with life  nor even then  if in another state we have any sense of what has passed in this  it is eternal  and incorporated with the soul  Above every selfish desire  the first object of my thoughts and wishes is her happiness  which I would die  or live wretched  to secure  every action of my life is directed to the sole purpose of pleasing her  my noblest ambition is to be worthy her esteem  My dreams are full of her  and  when I wake  the first idea which rises in my mind is the hope of seeing her  and of seeing her well and happy  my most ardent prayer to the supreme Giver of all good is for her welfare      In true love  my dear Mordaunt  there is a pleasure abstracted from all hope of return  and were I certain she would never be mine  nay  certain I should never behold her more  I would not  for all the          1 187       kingdoms of the world  give up the dear delight of loving her      Those who never felt this enlivening power  this divinity of the soul  may find a poor insipid pleasure in tranquillity  or plunge into vicious excesses to animate their tedious hours  but those who have  can never give up so sweet  so divine a transport  but with their existence  or taste any other joy but in subordination        Oh  Mordaunt  when I behold her  read the soft language of those speaking eyes  hear those harmonious sounds    who that has a soul can be insensible     yet there are men dead to all sense of perfection  who can regard that angel form without rapture  can hear the music of that voice without emotion  I have myself with astonishment seen them  inanimate as the trees around them  listen coldly to shoe melting accents          1 188          There is a sweetness in her voice  Mordaunt  a melodious softness  which fancy cannot paint  the enchantment of her conversation is inexpressible   Four o Clock      I am the most wretched of mankind  and wretched without the right of complaining  the baseness of my attempt deserves even the pangs I suffer  Could I  who made a parade of refusing to meet the advances of the daughter of almost a stranger  descend to seduce the heiress of him on earth to whom I am most obliged  Oh  Mordaunt  have we indeed two souls  Can I see so strongly what is right  yet want power to act up to my own sentiments  The torrent of passion bears down all before it  I abhor myself for this weakness  I would give worlds to recall that fatal letter  her coldness  her reserve  are more than I can support  My madness has undone me     My assiduity is importunate           1 189       I might have preserved her friendship  I have thrown away the first happiness of my life  Her eyes averted shun me as an object of
