 said Sir Charles  I know she is a mistress of that language  and elegant in her own  Pray  my dear   to her  let us be obliged  if it will not pain you   She blushed  and bowed   I must first tell you  said the Doctor  that I was the occasion of her choosing so grave a subject  as you will find that of the sonnet from which hers is taken   A sonnet  said Miss Grandison  My dear little POETESS  you must set it  and sing it to us   No indeed  madam  said Miss Jervois  blushing still more  Dr  Bartlett would by no means have me a Poetess  I am sure  And did you not  dear madam  speak that word  as if you meant to call me a name   I think she did  my dear  said Sir Charles  Nor would I have had my Emily distinguished by any name  but that of a discreet  an ingenious  and an amiable young woman  The title of Wit and Poetess  has been disgraced too often by Sappho s and Corrinna s ancient and modern  Was not this in your head  sister  But do not be disturbed  my Emily  the poor girl s eyes glistened   I mean no check to liveliness and modest ingenuity  The easy productions of a fine fancy  not made the business of life  or its boast  confer no denomination that is disgraceful  but very much the contrary   I am very glad  for all that  said Miss Jervois  that my little translation is in plain prose  Had it not  I should have been very much afraid to have it seen   Even in that case  you need not to have been afraid  my dear Miss Jervois  said the good Dr  Bartlett  Sir Charles is an admirer of good poetry  And Miss Grandison would have recollected the Philomelas  the Orinadas  and other excellent names among her own sex  whose fine genius does it honour   Your diffidence and sweet humility  my dear Emily  said Lady L  would  in you  make the most envied accomplishments amiable     308 I am sure  said the lovely girl  hanging down her head  tears ready to start  I have reason to be affected with the subject—The indulgent mother is described with so much sweet tenderness—O what pleasures do mothers lose  who want tenderness   We all  either by eyes or voices  called for the Sonnet  and her translation  Dr  Bartlett shewed them to us  and I sent copies of both   SONNET of Nicanvo da Filicaja   Qua madreì figlli con pietoso affetto  Mira  e d amor si strugge a lor davante   E un bacia in fronte  ed un si stringe al petto   Uno tien su i ginnocchi  un sulle piante   E mentre agli atti  a i gemiti  all  aspetto  Lor voglie intende si diverse  e tante   A questi un guardo  a quei dispensa un detto   E se ride  o s adira è sempre amante   Tal per noi Provvidenza alta infinita  Veglia  e questi conforta  e quei provvede   E tutti ascolta  e porge a tutti aita   E se niega talor grazia  a mercede   O niega fol  perchè a pregar ne invita   O negar singe  e nel negar concede      See a fond mother incircled by her children  With pious tenderness she looks around  and her soul even melts with maternal Love  One she kisses on the forehead  and clasps another to her bosom  One she sets upon her knees  and finds a seat upon her foot for another  And while  by their actions  their lisping words  and asking eyes  she understands their various numberless little wishes  to these she dispenses a look  a word to those  and whether she smiles or frowns   tis all in tender Love        Such to us  tho  infinitely high and awful  is PROVIDENCE  So it watches over us  comforting these  providing for those  listening to all  assisting   309 every one  And if sometimes it denies the favour we implore  it denies but to invite our more earnest prayers  or  seeming to deny a blessing  grants one in that refusal      When the translation was read aloud  the tears that before were starting  trickled down the sweet girl s cheeks  But the commendations every one joined in  and especially the praises given her by her guardian  drove away every cloud from her face   LETTER XXXII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss GRANDISON    Friday March 17   My dear Charlotte   I HAVE already seen Captain Anderson  Richard Saunder  whom I sent with your Letter▪ as soon as I came to town  found him at his lodgings near Whitehall  He expressed himself  on re•ding it before the servant  with indiferent warmth  I would not make minute enquiries after his words  because I intended an amicable meeting with him   We met at four yesterday afternoon
