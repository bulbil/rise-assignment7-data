Accordingly  that very evening we removed to lodgings   and  in   a few days  my father took and furnished a new house      I shall not dwell  my dear sir  on a trivial detail of the many         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  177     circumstances and little incidents that happened during the space   of four succeeding years  An infinity of suitors paid their addresses   to me or my fortune  I neither knew nor cared to which  for I con    tinued alike insensible to all  It is true  that during such a number   of years  having neither seen nor heard from you  I dropped all   thoughts of you  and scarce retained the traces or lineaments of   your person or aspect  From the impression  however  which you   left in my mind  I had formed to myself a dear  though confused   image of the lovely  of the desirable  and this I looked for every    where  but could nowhere find any resemblance thereof      In the mean time my parents urged me strongly to matrimony    They affectingly represented that they should not die in peace  if I   did not afford them the prospect of perpetuating themselves in my   offspring   such is the fond succedaneum which short lived creatures   propose for eking out their existence  and supplying the lot of an   inevitable mortality  by the flattering though poor substitute of a   name or bare remembrance       At length I told my parents that  as I could not form any choice   of my own  I would trust wholly to their judgment  and take up   with whomsoever they should be pleased to appoint  Hereupon   they recommended the Earl of Maitland to me  I kept to my   promise  and we were consequently married      My husband was comely in his person  easy and affable in his   temper  and a man of singular sense and letters for a lord  He loved   me with passion  and  as I could not pay him in specie  I en    deavoured to supply my want of affection to him by my attention   and assiduities      On the fifth year of my marriage my father died of a good old   age   and in four years more my dearest mother left me desolate    In her I lost the only object of fond affections that I had upon   earth  and my looks tacitly reproached my husband for his want of   power to console me      I believe it was equally unhappy for my lord as myself that we   were not blessed with children  The dear and tender attachments   that bind parents to their offspring  serve also as a subsequent and   more affecting nuptial band for uniting those parents more in    timately to each other  It draws about them a new circle of in    terests and amities   and  by creating a mutual confidence  forbids   the intrusion of those jealousies that must at all times pre suppose   an ah enation of regard  This  however  was not the case between   Lord Maitland and me  We never had a child  Perhaps  in some   constitutions  an union of souls as well as persons may be requisite   for such an effect      During the two years succeeding the death of my dear mother    I conceived a disgust against company and entertainments  I took   a religious turn  I looked upon this world  and all that it contained    as quite unworthy the regard of an immortal being  The principal   part of my time was taken up in books and offices of devotion   in   which employment I alternately sunk under the most gloomy de    pression of spirits  and again was elevated above myself into a new   world of joys and inexpressible openings      At length I was taken exceedingly ill of what the physicians     N         178 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      called a fever upon the nerves  which confined me to my bed above   six weeks  During my illness  my husband was the most constant   and assiduous of all my attendants  The affectionate sadness  the   painful distress  the tender solicitude that was visible in all his looks   and actions  made way into my soul with an obliging impression     and  while I reproached myself for my ungrateful defect of sensibility   toward him  love  or something tender and very like to love  took   place in my bosom      As soon as I was on the recovery  my husband disappeared  with    out taking leave or giving me any notice   and for three weeks I   knew not
