given that production its fame  and that  if Lesage s masterpiece has lived so long  and if it lives to day with such a fresh and abundant life  this constant appeal has been made in spite of its resemblance to the Spanish picaresque prototype   The application of the scientific method to literary criticism during the last generation has steadily tended to define works of art as  documents  of their epoch  and at the same time to classify them according to their structural variations rather than to accept them wholly as sources of human pleasure  The novel of Lesage for the purposes of classification  may be viewed as a picaresque novel  and it is interesting and legitimate to note that it is no doubt the best of its kind  yet there is equally little doubt that thousands of readers who do not know what the word  picaresque  means have for several generations regarded Gil Blas as simply the best of all novels  and that their reasons have been based on qualities quite independent of the mould into which it happened to be run  This is  in fact  the truth which these brief remarks are meant to set forth  In order to become a classic  and in order to hold its own among the books of the world  Gil Blas has had to live down its picaresqueness  The book has survived  and become one of the great books  notwithstanding the characteristics which seemed destined to confine it to the museum of antique literary forms     I  Walter Scott s recognition of the supreme delightfulness of Gil Blas has not been general among the critics  indeed  the sense of its intrinsic value as a definition of life must rather be placed to the credit of the uncritical public  Voltaire  referring to Lesage in his  Siècle de Louis XIV   limits his praise to the remark    His novel Gil Blas has survived because of the naturalness of the style   The curtness and inadequacy of this remark are probably due rather to the fact that Voltaire did not see beyond the superficial traits of this novel  its general picaresque atmosphere  than  as has so often been asserted  to any malicious intent to decry a book in which he supposed himself to have been held up to ridicule   The traditional view is  however  plausible enough  as Mr  James Fitzmaurice Kelly has shown in his introduction to the edition of Gil Blas published in the  World s Classics   There can be no doubt as to Lesage having ridiculed Voltaire in two of his plays   Joubert  whose delicacy was a hothouse fruit grown in the thin subsoil and the devitalised air in which he was compelled to live  corroborates Voltaire  while revealing his own prejudices   after all  is not the main interest of criticism the light it throws upon the critic     in a characteristic utterance    Lesage s novels would appear to have been written in a café by a domino player  after spending the evening at the play   Evidently this is a long way from the  beatitude  of Walter Scott  but it is nearer the point of view of Mr  Warner Allen  who  while he notes in his remarkable General Introduction to his edition of Celestine in the Picaresque Section of the  Library of Early Novelists   to which this volume belongs  that Gil Blas  has a conscience   is ingeniously effective in arguing that the spirit of Gil Blas is essentially picaresque    by which he means that realism and materialism are so predominantly its note that it must be classed well below  Don Quixote   where the heterogeneous picaresque material is beautifully fused by the 1magination of an idealist   It is just because Lesage ignores the idealistic side of man   Mr  Allen says   that Gil Blas misses being a great creation   On the other hand  La Harpe  who had read many books  but was no doubt the very opposite of a scientific critic of literature  praises Gil Blas not merely  as did Scott  for its entertainment  its agrément  but also for its moral inspiration  utile dulci  he insists  ought to be the device of this excellent book  forgetting that Lesage has himself written the precept of Horace on its title page   C est l école du monde que Gil Blas   La Harpe continues  and he remarks with singular felicity that Lesage in Gil Blas  has not fallen into that gratuitous profusion of minute detail which is nowadays taken to be truth   This comment suggests the probability that the reproach addressed to Lesage as to his lack of idealism is one that La Harpe would be disinclined to accept  and that they who make it have other standards for judging a work of art than those of the public to whom it is addressed  or indeed than those of the artist himself  especially such an artist as Lesage  who in his  Declaration  to the reader says expressly   My sole aim has been to represent life as it is     Je ne me suis proposé que de représenter la vie des hommes telle qu elle est    Certain of Lesage s predecessors had already declared it to be their aim to write books which should be a wholesome reaction against
