 said he   why your ladyship may swear it    for my part  I will not give above a fortnight for the conclusion  and I   will venture to wish the fair bride joy on the occasion  for he is a   fine gentleman  a very fine gentleman  indeed  and I think she could not   have made a better choice   With these words he wiped his mouth  and   advanced to Miss Betsy  in order to salute her  but  pushing him   scornfully back   None of your slights  good Mr  Chatfree   said she     if I thought you were in earnest  I would never see the face of Mr    Trueworth more        This did not hinder the pleasant old gentleman from continuing his   raillery  he plainly told Miss Betsy that she was in love  that he saw   the marks of it upon her  and that it was vain for her to deny it  Lady   Mellasin laughed very heartily to see the fret Miss Betsy was in  at   hearing Mr  Chatfree talk in this manner  but Miss Flora  to whom one   would imagine this scene would have been diverting enough  never opened   her lips to utter one syllable  but made such grimaces  as had they been   taken notice of  would have shewn how little she was pleased with it       Mr  Goodman had been so much struck with the first account given by Mr    Chatfree  that he was not to be rouzed by any thing that gentleman said   afterwards  he reflected  that though the consequences of the encounter   between the two rivals had been less fatal than he had been made to   imagine  yet it might have happened  and indeed been naturally expected    he could not forbear  therefore  interrupting his friend s mirth  by   remonstrating to Miss Betsy  in the most serious terms  the great error   she was guilty of  by encouraging a plurality of lovers at the same   time  he told her  that gentlemen of Mr  Trueworth s and Mr  Staple s   character and fortune  ought not to be trifled with   Suppose   said he     that one or both of them had indeed been killed  how could you have   answered to yourself  or to the world  the having been the sad   occasion         Lord  Sir   replied Miss Betsy  walking up and down the room in a good   deal of agitation   what would you have me do  I do not want the men to   love me  and if they will play the fool  and fight  and kill one   another  it is none of my fault        In fine  between Mr  Chatfree s raillery  and Mr  Goodman s admonitions    this poor young lady was teazed beyond all patience  and  finding it   impossible to put a stop to either  she flew out of the room  ready to   cry with vexation       She was no sooner gone  than Mr  Goodman took Mr  Chatfree into his   closet  and  having learned from him all the particulars of the late   duel  and consulted with him what was proper to be done to prevent any   farther mischief of the like sort  they went together to Mr  Staple s   lodging  in order to use their utmost endeavours to prevail on that   gentleman to desist the prosecution of his addresses to Miss Betsy                VOLUME THE SECOND               CHAPTER I       Will satisfy the reader s curiosity in some points  and increase it in   others          Though Mr  Goodman  under whose care and in whose house Miss Betsy had   been for upwards of a year  knew much more of that young lady s humour   and disposition than Mr  Chatfree  who saw her but seldom  could   possibly do  and could not be brought to think  as he did  that the   merits of Mr  Trueworth had made any effectual impression on her heart    yet he imagined  that to propogate such an opinion to Mr  Staple  would   conduce very much to persuade him to break off his courtship  which was   a thing very much desired by Mr  Goodman  as he was certain the   continuance of it would be attended with almost insurmountable   difficulties  and create many vexations and disputes  when Mr  Francis   Thoughtless came to town       The two old gentlemen went on together  discoursing on this affair  till   they came to the lodgings of Mr  Staple
