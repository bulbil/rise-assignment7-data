occasioned is only the more severe  I feel with unutterable anguish that my ancient friend  the friend of my earliest youth  is childless by the crime of him who owes his being to me  the blow his hand unwillingly struck  has reached the heart of the incomparable Lady Julia  I think of her angelic perfections  of the untimely fate which has robbed the world of its loveliest ornament  and almost wish never to have been a father      Lady Rochdale and Louisa are in tears by me  for ever excluded from Belmont  they look on themselves as exiles  though at home  The horrors of mind under which my son labors are unutterable  he entreats to see Colonel Mandeville  to obtain his pardon for that involuntary crime  which has destroyed all the happiness of his life            2 196          Will you  my friend  once more admit us  Allow us one interview with yourself and Colonel Mandeville  I ask no more  nor will ever repeat the visit  I could not support the sight of Lady Belmont     I am  my Lord    Your Lordship s most faithful    though wretched friend    Rochdale          2 197         To the Earl of Rochdale   Belmont  Wednesday      My Lord        CONVINCED Lord Melvin is more unfortunate than culpable  it would be cruel to treat him as a criminal  I feel a horror I cannot conquer at the idea of ever receiving the visit your Lordship has proposed  but  conscious of the injustice of indulging it  I sacrifise it to our antient friendship  and only postpone  not refuse  the visit  I will struggle with the reluctance of my heart  to see the guiltless author of my misery  as soon as he is publicly exculpated from the crime he at present stands charged with  Colonel Mandeville must appear as his accuser  wretched as his hand has made me  justice obliges me to bear witness to his innocence  Lady Anne Wilmot  who          2 198       was present at Mr  Mandeville s dying declaration  is ready to confirm my evidence  Lord Melvin therefore has nothing to fear  The trial once past  I will endeavour to prevail on Colonel Mandeville and Lady Belmont  to make the same painful sacrifice to friendship  to which time and reason will  I hope  perfectly reconcile us  but your Lordship will  on a moment s reflexion  be convinced that  till this is past  it would be indecent in me to see Lord Melvin      We are greatly obliged to Lady Rochdale and Lady Louisa  the time of whose visit their own politeness and sensibility will regulate  it is a severe addition to my wretchedness  that the family of my friend is so fatally involved in it        Oh  Lord Rochdale  you are a father  and can pity us  you can judge the anguish to which we must ever be a prey  never more shall we know a chearful hour           2 199       our lost child will be ever at our hearts  when I remember her filial sweetness  her angel virtues  her matchless perfections    the only view we had in life was to see her happy  that is past  and all is now a dreary wild before us  Time may blunt the keen edge of sorrow  and enable us to bear the load of life with patience  but never must we hope the return of peace      The shortness of life  and the consideration of how much of our own is past  are the only consolations we can receive  it cannot be long before we rejoin our beloved child  we have only to pray for that ardently expected hour  which will re unite us to all we love        Why will man lay schemes of lasting felicity  By an over solicitude to continue my family and name  and secure the happiness of my child  I have defeated my own purpose  and fatally destroyed both            2 200          Humbled in the dust  I confess the hand of heaven  the pride of birth  the grandeur of my house  had too great a share in my resolves        Oh  my friend     but I consider the hand which directed the blow  and submit to the will of my God     I am   c    Belmont          2 201         To Col  Bellville   Belmont  Sunday Morning       I AM desired by my Lord to ask you hither  and to beg you will bring my niece with you  Lady Belmont joins in the request
