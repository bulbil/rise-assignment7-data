the unexpected deliverance and happy arrival of our noble consin  give us greater joy  But let us forget all jealousies  and depise all  false rumours —Embrace  and forgive Lord Hubert  command our power  and  enjoy the reward of thy gallant toils         —The courtiers echoed the sentiments of their prince  and William with  a constrained submission gave his hand to Hubert  his noble friends  were collected round him  and renewed their congratulations  the King by  his caresses seemed willing to efface the remembrance of that easiness  with which he had yielded to the desires of his savourite  and this  favourite  by an assumed affection and humbleness of deportment  sought  to quench all remains of animosity in the mind of the injured Earl  but  conscious  of his own artifice and hypocrisy  he naturally suspected  that readiness of belief  with which Salisbury seemed to yield his  declarations  as well as that sudden calm of peace and reconciliation   in which his fury seemed to subside  He had injured  and therefore  hated him  he had affirmed boldly to divert the present storm  but   whether the Countess had already yielded to Raymond  or whether he had  forcibly possessed himself of her bed  as yet he knew not  and possibly  Lord William might detect his falshood  and return with double fury  to  urge his wrongs  and seek his just vengeance  Such thoughts he revolved  for a while in his busy mind  and then confirmed himself in the dreadful  purpose of concealing his baseness  and providing effectually  for his safety and power by the immediate destruction of this Lord   Far other thoughts now employed the Earl  He had by slow degrees  and by  the repeated arts of refined and steady hypocrisy  been wrought into a  firm persuasion  that Hubert had declared the truth  that his messengers  had been deceived  and that his wife still preserved her loyalty  and he  freely indulged these delightful thoughts  which naturally inspirited  an enlivened joy and complacency  The gracious condescensions of the  King he received with just returns of duty  he shared in the delight  which his noble friends expressed at their return  and  altho  he  wondered  yet was he affected with due pleasure  at the zeal and love  which the young Lord of France discovered  at that earnestness of  friendship which seemed so kindly interested in his sortunes  But not  the splendour and pleasures of a court  not the affection of friends   nor the smiles of royal favour  could detain him in the city of  Marlborough  He was impatient to seek his own noble mansion  and his  attendants held themselves in readiness to accompany him  Without any  delay  but what refreshment necessarily demanded  he took a dutiful  leave of the King  he received the repeated assurances of Hubert  that  his nephew had already retired from the castle  and that the Countess  waited to embrace him with unabated love  and he departed at the head of  his little troop  now reinforced by the followers of Lord Chauvigny  who  declared his resolution to attend the Earl of Salisbury     They took their way  and William  who had hitherto been totally engaged  by his own great affairs  was now more at ease  and more at leisure to  recall the tender sentiments of friendship  and to think on the good Les  Roches   Gentle Lord   said he  addressing himself to young Chauvigny         how have I deserved this zealous attachment  these extraordinary  instances of your affection  Say  what surprising events have brought  thee hither  Say  how hath Les Roches merited those tender names  I  think thou  gavedst him  of friend and father  What of his fortunes canst thou  inform me  If he indeed survives  where shall I seek him  How shall I  restore his daughter         —The mention of Jacqueline brightened the countenance of her lover with  a momentary joy  which was instantly clouded  and with a sigh which  awakened all the sears of William  he exclaimed at the severity with  which fortune had pursued his generous friend   I still hope   said he       and on that hope rests all my comfort  that he is now in England  but  whither driven  or where he may now lay his melancholy head  alas  I  know not  It is my purpose to seek him  and in this good purpose Earl  William surely must assist me —Let me unfold the story of our fortunes   and no longer wonder to see Chauvigny in this land         —They rode slowly on apart from their associates  all but the good old  knight  and the Frenchman thus began                  SECT  II     HOW can I reflect on that credulity  with which my father yielded to the  false and malicious Renresentations of Mal leon  and
