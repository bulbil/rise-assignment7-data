among the women  but where a man possesses so many attractions  he must frequently meet with extraordinary encouragement—and if women will be fools  it is but   37 reasonable they should be sufferers —There is a part of his character which I know my dear Harriot will be highly taken with  and that is  though he is a great admirer of magnificence  he always makes it a rule to live considerably within his fortune  and to distribute many sums towards the advancement of his poor tenants  which the most of our modern fine gentlemen injudiciously expend in horse racing  or in some other fashionable amusement equally inhuman and ridiculous  His benevolence  in this respect  joined to the most condescending affability  has rendered him the idol of all his inferiors in the country  and  for a circuit of twenty miles round his seat in Devonshire  there is scarcely a peasant who would not venture his life for Sir Robert Harold with the utmost chearfulness —Before ever I saw him  Harriot  I was delighted with his character—so that it was no wonder  when I did see him  if   38 my heart paid an honest tribute to his merit  and passionately longed for a share of his regard —Well  but to the point—  This morning he came  about twelve  to enquire after my health and to pay the customary compliments  my papa and mamma were fortunately at a concert in the rooms  and the dear man had a whole hour at least to entertain me on a subject  which few women  you know  whether they like the lover or not  ever think disagreeable —He was in a most charming undress  and looked so sweetly —You may be sure  my dear  the nature of his conversation did not take  in any great degree  from the force of his personal accomplishments   After politely repeating his acknowledgements for the honour I had done him the preceding evening  he drew   39 his chair close to mine  and  with an address inconceivably tender  took up one of my motionless hands  pressed it with an uncommon degree of fervor to his lips  and thus went on  delicately looking down the whole time  to prevent  as much as possible  the confusion into which I must be naturally thrown by the tendency of his declaration   I would not  my charming Miss Mildmay  have presumed thus early to make you acquainted with my sentiments  had not the shortness of your stay at Bath obliged me in some measure to break in upon the niceties of decorum  and rendered it in a manner necessary for me to seize the present opportunity of coming to an explanation  since it is more than probable I may never meet with another so favourable to my hopes —A lady like you  madam  who have been   40 so long and so properly the object of universal admiration  cannot be any way surprized at finding a new adorer in every new acquaintance—but I will not address you in the hackneyed forms of common place courtship  nor offer a violence to that delicacy which is always the companion of superior merit  by entering into an unnecessary descant upon those accomplishments  to which nothing but the grossest stupidity can possibly be a moment insensible or unjust —From the first hour  madam  I saw you  I passionately loved—and  though the disregard which you constantly manifested to the solicitation of numbers superior to myself both in merit and in fortune  made it doubly presumptuous in me to aspire at such a blessing as your hand—still  so long as you appeared wholly disengaged  I thought it would be a mark of veneration   41 to you  as well as an act of justice to myself  to make a profession of my everlasting attachment  and to enquire whether it would be possible  for a length of time  and an undeviating assiduity  to procure me adistant glimmering of success   My sister  whom I made the confidante of my passion  indeed advised me to an application to Mr  Mildmay—but  as a step of that nature might perhaps interfere with some wish of the beautiful Louisa s  I would on no account hazard it without her permission  young ladies very frequently see matters in a juster light than their fathers—and there are a thousand little reasons for consulting them on the business of their own hearts before a treaty is opened with their relations —On this account  my ever adorable Miss Mildway  I throw myself entirely   42 upon your generosity —If you have any latent motive for wishing me to decline a farther solicitation on this subject  be candid and tell me so  The man before you  madam  would scorn to purchase the happiness even of his whole life  by the prosecution of any suit in the least incompatible with your tranquility  he may be miserable  but he never will be mean  and has too high an idea of Miss Mildmay s benignity to think she would willingly add to his anxiety by an unnecessary suspence  if it is absolutely out of her power to think of ever removing it  You are silent  too lovely Miss Mildmay—fortunate be your silence  madam  for the present I shall take my leave  and  if I have not your positive commands to the contrary  will do myself the honour of waiting upon Mr  Mildmay to morrow morning
