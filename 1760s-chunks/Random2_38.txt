heartily  returned to the bottle  Bragwell became noisy and troublesome  Banter grew   106 more and more severe  Ranter rehearsed  Slyboot made faces at the whole company  I sung French catches  and Chatter kissed me with great affection  while the doctor with a woful countenance  sat silent like a disciple of Pythagoras —At length  it was proposed by Bragwell  that we should scour the hundreds  sweat the constable  maul the watch  and then reel soberly to bed     While we deliberated upon this expedition  the waiter came into the room  and asked for doctor Wagtail  when he understood he was present  he told him  there was a lady below to enquire for him  at which the physician started from his melancholy contemplation  and with a look of extreme confusion  assured the company  he could not possibly be the person wanted  for he had no connexion with any lady whatever  and bid the drawer tell her so —   For shame   cried Banter  would you be so impolite as to refuse a lady the hearing  perhaps she comes for a consultation —It must be some extraordinary affair that brings a lady to a tavern at this time o night —Mr  Ranter  pray do the doctor s baise mains to the lady  and squire her hither  —  The player immediately staggered out  and returned  leading in with much ceremony  a tall strapping wench  whose appearance proclaimed her condition  We received her with the utmost solemnity  and with a good deal of intreaty she was persuaded to sit  when a profound silence ensued  during which she fixed her eyes  with a disconsolate look  upon the doctor  who was utterly confounded at her behaviour  and returned her melancholy sour fold  at length  after a good many piteous sighs  she wiped her   107 eyes  and accosted him thus    What  not one word of comfort  Will nothing soften that stony heart of thine  Not all my tears  not all my affliction  Not the inevitable ruin thou hast brought upon me  Where are thy vows  thou faithless perjured man —Hast thou no honour —no conscience—no remorse for thy perfidious conduct towards me —answer me  wilt thou at last do me justice  or must I have recourse to heaven and hell for my revenge  —  If poor Wagtail was amazed before she spoke  what must his confusion be on hearing this address  His natural paleness changed into a ghastly clay colour  his eyes rolled  his lip trembled  and he answered in an accent not to be described —   Upon my word  honour  and salvation  madam  you are actually mistaken in my person —I have a most particular veneration for your sex  madam  and am actually incapable of injuring any lady in the smallest degree  madam —besides  madam  to the best of my recollection  I never had the honour of seeing you before  as I hope to be saved  madam     —How  traitor   cried she  dost thou disown me then —Mistaken  no —too well I know that fair bewitching face  too well I know that false enchanting tongue  alas  gentlemen  since the villain compels me  by his unkindness  to expose myself and him  know  that this betrayer  under the specious pretence of honourable addresses  won my heart  and taking advantage of his conquest  robbed me of my virgin treasure  and afterwards abandoned me to my fate —I am now four months gone with child by him  turned out   108 of doors by my relations  and left a prey to misery and want  Yes  thou Barbarian  said she  turning to Wagtail  thou tiger  thou Succubus  too well thou knowest my situation—but I will tear out thy faithless heart  and deliver the world from such a monster  —  So saying  she sprung forward at the doctor  who  with incredible agility  jumped over the table and got behind Bragwell  while the rest of us endeavoured to appease the furious heroine—Although every body in the company affected the utmost surprize  I could easily perceive it was a scheme concerted among them  to produce diversion at the doctor s expence  and being under no concern about the consequence  I entered into the confederacy  and enjoy d the distress of Wagtail  who with tears in his eyes  begged the protection of the company  declaring himself as innocent of the crime laid to his charge  as the foetus in utero  and hinting at the same time  that nature had not put it in his power to be guilty of such a trespass—   Nature   cried the lady   there was no nature in the case—he abused me by the help of charms and spells  else how is it possible  that any woman could have listened to the addresses of such a scarecrow —Were these owlish eyes made for ogling  that carrion complexion to be admired  or that mouth like a horse shoe to be kissed  No  no  you owe your success to your philtres  to your drugs and incantations  and not to your natural talents  which are in every respect mean and contemptible —  The doctor now thought he had got an opportunity
