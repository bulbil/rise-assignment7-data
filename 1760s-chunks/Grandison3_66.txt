like a man that was determined to be silent  I had apprehension  and hope  I suppose  struggling in mine  as I knew not whether to wish for the expected conference  or not  my cheeks  as I felt  in a glow     162 Let us think of nothing  my Lord  in this company  said he  but what is agreeable   He enquired kindly of my health and last night s rest  because of a slight cold that had affected my voice  Of Emily  Why she was so sad  Of Lady L  and my Lord  When they went to town  Of Miss Grandison  Why she looked so meditatingly  that was his word—Don t you see  Miss Byron  said he  that Charlotte looks as if she had not quite settled the humour she intends to be in for the next half hour   Charlotte looks  I believe  Sir  replied she  as if she were determined to take her humour for the next half hour from yours  whether grave  or airy   Then  returned he  I will not be grave  because I will not have you so —May I hope  madam  by and by  addressing himself to me  for the honour of your hand  to my Lord s library   Sir  I will—I will—attend you—hesitated the simpleton  but she can t tell how she looked   Thus  Lucy  was the matter brought on   He conducted me to my Lord s library —How did I struggle with myself for presence of mind  What a mixture was there of tenderness and respect  in his countenance and air   He seated me  then took his place over against me▪ I believe I looked down  and conscious  and silly  but there was such a respectful modesty in his looks  that one could not be uneasy at being now and then with an air of languor  as I thought  contemplated by him  Especially as  whenever I reared my eye lids to cast a momentary look at him as he spoke  I was always sure to see his eye withdrawn  This gave more freedom to mine  than it possibly otherwise could have had  What a bold creature  Lucy  ought she to be  who prefers a bold man  If she be not bold  how silly must she look under his staring confident eye  How must her want of courage add to his  and  of course  to his self consequence     163 Thus he began the subject we were to talk of   I will make no apology for requesting the favour of this conference with one of the most frank and open hearted young Ladies in the world  I shall have the honour  perhaps  of detaining your ear on more than one subject  How my heart throbbed   But that which I shall begin with  relates to my Lord G  and our sister Charlotte  I observe  from hints thrown out by herself  as well as from what Lady L  said  that she intends to encourage his addresses  but it is easy to see  that she thinks but slightly of him  I am indeed apprehensive  that she is rather induced to favour my Lord  from an opinion that he has my interest and good wishes  than from her own inclination  I have told her  more than once  that her s are  and shall be  mine  But such is her vivacity  that it is very difficult for me to know her real mind  I take it for granted  that she prefers my Lord to Sir Walter   I believe  Sir—But why should I say believe  when Miss Grandison has commissioned me to own  that Lord G  is a man whom she greatly prefers to Sir Walter Watkyns   Does she  can she  do you think  madam  prefer Lord G  not only to Sir Walter  but to all the men whom she at present knows  In other words  Is there any man that you think she would prefer to Lord G   I am extremely sollicitous for my sister s happiness  and the more  because of her vivacity  which  I am afraid  will be thought less to become the wife  than the single woman   I dare say  Sir  that if Miss Grandison thought of any other man in preference to Lord G  she would not encourage his addresses  upon any account   I don t expect  madam  that a woman of Charlotte s spirit and vivacity  who has been disappointed by a sailure of supposed merit in her first Love  if we may so call it   should be deeply in love with a man that has not very striking qualities  She can play   164 with a flame now  and not burn her fingers  Lord G  is a worthy  tho  not a very brilliant man  Ladies have eyes  and the eye expects to be gratified  Hence men of appearance succeed often  where men of intrinsic merit fail  Were Charlotte to consult her happiness  possibly she would have no objection to Lord G  She cannot  in the same man  have every thing  But if Lord G  consulted
