not an unlucky Accident happened  which deprived me from considering her in so amiable a Light as I ought to have done  but Reflections are ridiculous  few People know the Value of an Estate  till they have made away with it   Thus it happen d with me  Sir  I had not been married to her much above a Twelvemonth  before I lost her  that was another Joke carried a little too far too  But a Man at all Times don t know where to stop  when he is in high Spirits   You must know  Sir  on Afternoon  my Wife then had just been brought to   187Bed a Week  I had dined that Day at Tomkyns s  I was in high Spirits  and took three or four Friends Home with me  to hum an old Parson  a Relation of my Wife s  whom I had promised to spend the Evening with  I knew I shou d undergo a Jobation from him  but to stop his Mouth  Sir Grecian Grigg and I began a sham Fight  in the old one s Company   One of my Wife s foolish Maids run screaming to her Mistress  that I shou d be murdered among the drawn Swords  and in spite of her Servants  my Wife was so Headstrong  that she wou d come down Stairs only in her Wrapper and Slippers  altho  she had not lain in above seven or eight Days   We soon convinc d her it was only a Piece of Wit and Humour  but to see how uneven the Tempers of some Ladies are  tho  she tripp d down Stairs as nimble as a Wench at a Wake  her Spirits took such a Turn  that it was as much as all her Maids cou d do to lift her up Stairs again —She died in three Day s Time  I fancy she was piqued to be taken in so—  However  no Man cou d be more afflicted at parting from his Wife than I was  I had lost one of the finest Figures   188in England  Indeed I erected a fine Monument for her  and kept my Room a whole Week  to compose her Epitaph  and without Vanity  I may say  that no Husband cou d give more unfeign d Testimonies of his Affection than I did  in the Care I took of having her Memory celebrated   After her Decease  I found my richest and greatest Friends discontinued their Visits  I was in Repartee too severe  for I never wou d sink my Joke to save my Friend  no wonder then they absented themselves  as they had the Laugh so often against them  especially now they knew the only Person was gone who took their Parts   I had then no other Visitors but those whose Circumstances made it worth their while to fill their Bellies at my Table  tho  they were sure to be roasted for it  I soon grew tired with those to whom I gave a Dinner  only because they wanted one  their Applauses were as insipid to me as the Caresses of a Wife  three Months after Marriage  I left off House keeping  took Lodgings near Arthur s  and was balloted into the Jockey Club   Here was a new Field for Game  I cleared away a few Acres of Wood land    189just to make an exercising Place  run up a rubbing House  bought a Brace of brood Mares  got my Compliment of Colts  and just till my own Stud was risen four Years old  I purchased three or four capital Plate Horses  for as I was determined to be distinguished  I knew there was no doing those Things by Halves  and to compleat me for the Turf  I had several Hints from Pond  how to lay my Money   I began rather too late  I believe  for tho  no Man ever had better Horses than myself  nor won more Plates  nor was oftener let into the Secret  yet  damn it  let them say what they will  there is such a Thing as uck  ay  and bad Luck too  for in about five Years  my Estate  my Horses and Grooms all gallopped away to the Devil  leaving me at a dead Stand still  in a Spunging house  tho  there I had the Satisfaction to hear the Baileys allow  that they believed me to be one of the cleverest Gentlemen in England   After I had recovered my Liberty  I entered into Life as droll as ever I was  not quite so rich tho   But what is Money to a Man of Spirit  I used to treat  now I was treated  tossed into the Reckoning  but I was welcome every   190where  and every Body admired my vast Sprits   Tom Fool   Pray  Sir  did not you begin to think   Borlace   No  Sir  when a Man of Wit and Humour begins to think  he loses all Pretensions to those Titles  as a Beauty ceases to be a Toast  when she becomes a married Woman  Besides  I really lived so joyous  I had no Time for Reflection  I used to be engaged from Party to Party  that I had no Hours to myself  nor
