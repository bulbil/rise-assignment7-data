 side  presented one of my pistols out of my window  and preserved that  posture of defence  until he thought proper to retreat  and rid me of  the fears that attended his company  I arrived in town  and  changing  my equipage  hired an open chaise  in which  though I was almost starved  with cold  I travelled to Reading  which I reached by ten next morning   and from thence proceeded farther in the country  with a view of taking  refuge with Mrs  C    who was my particular friend  Here I should  have found shelter  though my lord had been beforehand with me  and  endeavoured to prepossess her against my conduct  had not the house  been crowded with company  among whom I could not possibly have been  concealed  especially from her brother  who was an intimate friend of my  persecutor    Things being thus situated  I enjoyed but a very short interview with  her  in which her sorrow and perplexity on my account appeared with  great expression in her countenance  and  though it was not in her power  to afford me the relief I expected  she  in the most genteel manner   sent after me a small sum of money  thinking that  considering the hurry  in which I left my house  I might have occasion for it on the road  I  was  by this time  benumbed with cold  fatigued with travelling  and  almost fretted to death by my disappointment  However  this was no time  to indulge despondence  since nobody could or would assist me  I stood  the more in need of my own resolution and presence of mind  After some  deliberation  I steered my course back to London  and  being unwilling  to return by the same road in which I came  as well as impatient to be  at the end of my journey  I chose the Bagshot way  and ventured to cross  the heath by moonlight    Here I was attacked by a footpad armed with a broad sword  who came    6 22 15  3 45 PM   up and demanded my money  My stock amounted to twelve guineas  and I  foresaw that should I be stripped of the whole sum  I could not travel  without discovering who I was  and consequently running the risk of  being detected by my pursuer  On these considerations  I gave the fellow  three guineas and some silver  with which he was so far from being  satisfied  that he threatened to search me for more  but I ordered the  coachman to proceed  and by good fortune escaped that ceremony  though  I was under some apprehension of being overtaken with a pistol bullet in  my flight  and therefore held down my head in the chaise  in imitation  of some great men  who are said to have ducked in the same manner in  the day of battle  My fears happened to be disappointed  I lay at an inn  upon the road  and next day arrived in town  in the utmost difficulty  and distress  for I knew not where to fix my habitation  and was  destitute of all means of support  In this dilemma  I applied to my  lawyer  who recommended me to the house of a tradesman in Westminster   where I lodged and boarded upon credit  with my faithful Abigail  whom I  shall distinguish by the name of Mrs  S     for the space of ten weeks   during which I saw nobody  and never once stirred abroad    While I was thus harassed out of all enjoyment of life  and reduced  to the utmost indigence  by the cruelty of my persecutor  who had even  stripped me of my wearing apparel  I made a conquest of Lord D     a nobleman who is now dead  and therefore I shall say little of his  character  which is perfectly well known  this only will I observe   that  next to my own tyrant  he was the person of whom I had the  greatest abhorrence  Nevertheless  when these two came in competition   I preferred the offers of this new lover  which were very considerable   and as an asylum was the chief thing I wanted  agreed to follow him  to his country seat  whither I actually sent my clothes  which I had  purchased upon credit    However  upon mature deliberation  I changed my mind  and signified my  resolution in a letter  desiring at the same time that my baggage might  be sent back  In consequence of this message  I expected a visit from  him  in all the rage of indignation and disappointment  and gave orders  that he should not be admitted into my house yet  notwithstanding this  precaution  he found means to procure entrance  and one of the first  objects that I saw  next morning  in my bedchamber  was my lover  armed  with a horsewhip  against which  from the knowledge of the man  I did  not think myself altogether secure  though
