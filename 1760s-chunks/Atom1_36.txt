the Pagans rose against George  and murdered    201 him with the utmost barbarity  and from this circumstance he became a saint and martyr  and the amulet or abraxas became his badge of distinction  The cross was considered as such a sure protection in battle  that every sword hilt was made in this form  and every warrior  before he engaged  kissed it in token of devotion  hence the phrase    I kiss your hilt    which is sometimes used even at this day  With respect to the mystical words ΑΒRΑCΑΣ  ΙΑΩ  ΔΟΩΝΑΙ  which are found upon those amulets  and supposed to be of Hebrew extract  tho  in the Greek character of termination  if thou wouldst know their real signification  thou mayest consult the learned De Croy  in his Treatise concerning the genealogies of the Gnostics  Thou wilt find it at the end of St  Irenaeus s works  published by Grabius at Oxford —       202 But  to return to magic  thou must have heard of the famous Albertus Magnus de Bolstadt  who indifferently exercised the professions of conjurer  bawd  and man midwife  who forged the celebrated Androides  or brazen head  which pronounced oracles  and solved questions of the utmost difficulty  nor can the fame of Henry Cornelius Agrippa have escaped thee  he  who wrote the Treatises De occulta Philosophia    de caecis Ceremoniis  who kept his demon secured with an inchanted iron collar  in the shape of a black dog  which black dog being dismissed in his last moments with these words  Abi perdita bestia quae me totum perdidisti  plunged itself in the river Soame  and immediately disappeared  But what need of those profane instances to prove the existence of magicians who held communication    203 with the devil  Don t we read in the scripture of the magicians of Pharaoh and Manasses  of the witch of Endor  of Simon and Barjesus  magicians  and of that sorceress of whose body the apostle Paul dispossessed the devil  Have not the fathers mentioned magicians and sorcerers  Have not different councils denounced anathemas against them  Hath not the civil law decreed punishments to be inflicted upon those convicted of the black art  Have not all the tribunals in France  England  and particularly in Scotland  condemned many persons to the stake for sorceries  on the fullest evidence  nay  even on their own confession  Thou thyself mayest almost remember the havock that was made among the sorcerers in one of the English colonies in North America  by Dr  Encrease Mather  and Dr  Cotton Mather  those luminaries    204 of the New England church  under the authority and auspices of Sir William Phipps  that flower of knighthood and mirror of governors  who  not contented with living witnesses  called in the assistance of spectral evidence  to the conviction of those diabolical delinquents —This was a hint  indeed  which he borrowed from the famous trial of Urban Grandier  canon of Loudun in France  who was duly convicted of magic  upon the depositions of the devils Astaroth  Eusas  Celsus  Acaos  Cedon  Asinodeus  Alix  Zabulon  Nephthalim  Cham  Uriel  and Acbas  I might likewise refer thee to king James s History of Witchcraft  wherein it appears  upon uncontrovertible evidence  that the devil not only presided in person at the assemblies of those wise women  but even condescended to be facetious  and often diverted them by dancing and    205 playing gambols with a lighted candle in his breech  I might bid thee recollect the authenticated account of the earl of Gowry s conspiracy against the said king  in which appears the deposition of a certain person  certifying that the earl of Gowry had studied the black art  that he wore an amulet about his person  of such efficacy  that although he was run several times through the body  not one drop of blood flowed from the wounds until those mystical characters were removed —Finally  I could fill whole volumes with undeniable facts to prove the existence of magic  but what I have said shall suffice  I must only repeat it again  that there was not one magician  conjurer  wizard  or witch  among all the Bonzes of Japan  whom the Cuboy consulted  a circumstance that astonished him the more  as divers of them  notwithstanding    206 their beards  were shrewdly suspected to be old women  and  till that time  an old woman with a beard upon her chin had been always considered as an agent of the devil —It was the nature of Fika kaka to be impatient and impetuous  Perceiving that none of his Bonzes had any communication with the devil  and that many of them doubted whether there was any such personage as the devil  he began to have some doubts about his own soul     For if there is no devil  said he   there is no soul to be damned  and it would be a reproach to the justice of heaven to suppose that all souls are to be saved  considering what rascally stuff mankind are made of    This was an inference which gave him great disturbance  for he was one of those who would rather encounter eternal damnation  than run any risque of
