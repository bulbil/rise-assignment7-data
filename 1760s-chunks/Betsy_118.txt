 his lady by the hand  and immediately tripped up stairs       Miss Betsy did not presently make any offer to go home  because she   thought it would appear very odd in her to leave her companion with two   strange gentlemen  She little guessed the designs they had in their   heads  and doubted not but they would soon take leave  she did not    however  continue in this mistake for many minutes  for one of them   drawing Miss Forward to a window  in order to speak to her with more   privacy  the other  that he might have the better opportunity to do so    addressed himself to Miss Betsy   How killingly handsome you are   said   he  taking her by both her hands  and looking full in her face   what a   pity you did not shine in the front to night  By my soul you would have   out dazzled all the titled prudes about you         Pish   replied she   I went to see the play  not to be seen   myself     Not to be seen   cried he   why then have you taken all this   pains to empty the whole quiver of Cupid s arrows to new point those   charms you have received from nature  Why does the jessamine and the   blooming violet play wanton in your hair  Why is the patch with so much   art placed on the corner of this ruby lip  and here another to mark out   the arched symmetry of the jetty brow  Why does the glittering solitaire   hang pendant on the snowy breast  but to attract and allure us poor men   into a pleasing ruin        Miss Betsy answered this raillery in it s kind  and  as she had a great   deal of ready wit  would soon perhaps  had the same strain continued    have left the beau nothing to say for himself  but Miss Forward and the   other gentleman having finished what they had to say  coming towards   them  put an end to it   What do you think   cried Miss Forward   this   gentleman swears he won t go out of the house till I give him leave to   send for a supper     You may do as you please   said Miss Betsy   but I   must be excused from staying to partake of it   Whether she was really   in earnest or not  is not very material  but her refusal was looked   upon only as a feint  and they pressed her to tarry in such a manner    that she could not well avoid complying  even though she had been more   averse  in effect  than for some time she pretended to be       The conversation was extremely lively  and  though sprinkled with some   double entendres  could not be said to have any thing indecent  or that   could raise a blush in the faces of women who were accustomed to much   company  Miss Betsy had her share in all the innocent part of what was   said  and laughed at that which was less so  But  not to dwell on   trifles  she forgot all the cautions given her by Mr  Trueworth    considering not that she was in company with two strange gentlemen  and   of a woman whose character was suspected  and  though she had a watch by   her side  regarded not how the hours passed on  till she heard the   nighly monitor of time  cry   Past twelve o clock  and a cloudy   morning        After this she would not be prevailed upon to stay  and desired Miss   Forward to send somebody for a chair   A chair  Madam   cried that   gentleman who  of the two  had been most particular in his addresses to   her   you cannot  sure  imagine we should suffer you to go home alone at   this late hour     I apprehend no great danger   said she   though I   confess it is a thing I have not been accustomed to   He replied  that   in his company she should not begin the experiment  On this a coach was   ordered  Miss Betsy made some few scruples at committing herself to the   conduct of a person so little known to her   All acquaintance must have   a beginning   said he   the most intimate friends were perfect strangers   at first  You may depend on it I am a man of honour  and cannot be   capable of an ungenerous action        Little more was said on the occasion  and being told a coach was at the   door  they took leave of Miss Forward and the other gentleman  and went
