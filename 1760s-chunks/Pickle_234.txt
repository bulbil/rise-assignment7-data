of Conde  and there met by accident with  some English noblemen  to whom I was known  The prince and his  sisters invited me very politely into the gallery where they sat  They  complimented me on my person  and seemed to admire my dress  which was  altogether new to them  being a blue English riding habit  trimmed with  gold  and a hat with a feather  They were particularly well pleased with  my hair which hung down to my waist  and pressed me to stay a fortnight  at their house  an invitation which I was very much mortified at  being obliged to refuse  because my lord did not understand the French  language  I was enchanted with the place and the company  the women  being amiable  and the men polite  nor were they strangers to my name  and story  for Mr  S   calling at the same place a few days after  they  rallied him on my account    When we arrived at Paris  the first thing I did was to metamorphose    6 22 15  3 45 PM   myself into a Frenchwoman  I cut off my hair  hid a very good complexion  of my own with rouge  reconciled myself to powder  which I had never  used before  put on a robe with a large hoop  and went to the Tuileries   full of spirits and joy  for  at that time  everything conspired to make  me happy  I had health  youth  and beauty  love  vanity  and affluence   and found myself surrounded with diversions which were gay  new  and  agreeable  My appearance drew upon me the eyes of the whole company   who considered me a stranger  but not a foreigner  so completely was I  equipped in the fashion of the French  and when they understood who I  was  they applauded my person with the most lavish encomiums  according  to their known politeness    After having made a circuit round all the public places of  entertainment in Paris  I was introduced into the company by an English  family  residing in that city  and  among others  became acquainted with  a French lady  whose charms were remarkably attractive  The duke of K    was her admirer  but she lived in reputation with her mother  and an  agreeable sister  whose lover was the prince of C    for almost every  lady in France has her aimant    With this charming woman  whose name was Madame de la T    I often made  parties of pleasure  The duke  Mr  S    she  and I  used to meet in the  Bois de Boulogne  which is a pleasant wood  at a small distance from  Paris  whither the company repairs in the summer season for the benefit  of the air  and  after having amused ourselves among the groves   embarked in his grace s equipage  which was extremely elegant  being a  calash drawn by six fine long tailed greys  adorned with ribbons  in the  French taste  and thus we were conducted to a little enchanted  or at  least enchanting  palace  possessed by the duke  at one end of the town   The lower apartment  appropriated to me  was furnished with yellow and  silver  the bed surrounded with looking glasses  and the door opened  into the garden  laid out in a cradle walk  and intervening parterres of  roses and other flowers  Above stairs  my female companion lodged in  a chamber furnished with chintz  We supped all together in the saloon   which  though small  was perfectly elegant  The company was always  good humoured  the conversation sprightly and joyous  and the scene   though often repeated  still delightful and entertaining    At other times  Mr  S   and I used to pass our evenings at the palace  of the prince of C    which his highness lent us for our accommodation   The apartments opened into the gardens of the Luxembourg  and were  in  point of magnificence  suitable to the owner  Thither I used to repair  in a flaming equipage  on pretence of visiting  and spent the best part  of the night with him who was dearer to me than all the princes in the  world    While I was happily engaged in these ravishing parties  my little lord  was employed in his efforts to recover his health by restoratives  and  I know not what  for he still lamented the enfeebling effects of his  passion  and complained that he loved me more like an angel than a  woman  though he strove to govern his affections according to the  doctrines of the Christian religion  as he regulated his life by the  maxims of Charles the Twelfth of Sweden  The meaning of this declaration  I could never learn  and  indeed  I have been often tempted to believe  he had no meaning at all    Be that as it will  I found my size visibly increasing  and my
