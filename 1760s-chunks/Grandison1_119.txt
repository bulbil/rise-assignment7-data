MR  Bagenhall gave me yours on Saturday last  just as I was stepping into my chariot to go out of town  Neither the general contents  nor the time mentioned in it  made it necessary for me to alter my measures  My sister was already in the chariot  I had not done well to make a woman uneasy  I have many friends  and I have great pleasure in promoting theirs  I promised an answer on Monday   My answer is this—I have ever refused  and the occasion has happened too often  to draw my sword upon a set and formal challenge  Yet I have reason to think  from the skill I pretend to have in the weapons  that in declining to do so  I consult my conscience rather than my safety   Have you any friends  Sir Hargrave  Do they love you  Do you love them  Are you desirous of life for their sakes  for your own —Have you enemies to whom your untimely end would give pleasure —Let these considerations weigh with you  They do  and always did  with me  I am cool  You cannot be so  The cool person  on such an occasion as this  should   293 put the warm one on thinking  This however as you please   But one more question let me ask you—If you think I have injured you  is it prudent to give me a chance  were it but a chance  to do you a still greater injury   You were engaged in an unlawful enterprize  If you would not have done by me in the same situation▪ what I did by you  you are not  let me tell you  Sir Hargrave  the man of honour  that a man of honour should be sollicituous to put upon a foot with himself   I took not an unmanly advantage of you  Sir Hargrave  You drew upon me  I drew not in return  You had a disadvantage in not quitting your chariot  after the lunge you made at me  you may be thankful that I made no use of it   I should not have been sorry  had I been able to give the Lady the protection she claimed  with less hurt to yourself  For I could have no malice in what I did  Altho  I had  and have still  a just abhorrence of the voilence you were guilty of to an helpless woman  and who I have found since merited better treatment from you  and indeed merits the best from all the world  and whose life was endangered by the violence   I write a long Letter  because I propose only to write  Pardon me for repeating  that the men who have acted as you and I have acted  as well with regard to the Lady  as to each other  cannot  were their principles such as would permit them to meet  meet upon a foot   Let any man insult me upon my refusal  and put me upon my defence  and he shall find that numbers to my single arm shall not intimidate me  Yet  even in that case  I would much rather choose to clear myself of them as a man of honour should wish to do  than either to kill or maim any man  My life is not my own  Much less is another man s mine  Him who thinks differently from me  I can despise as heartily as he can despise me  And if such a one imagines    294 that he has a title to my life  let him take it  But it must be in my own way  not in his   In a word  If any man has aught against me  and will not be concluded by the Laws of his country  my goings out  and comings in  are always known  and I am any hour of the day to be found  or met with  where ever I have a natural call  My sword is a sword of defence  not of offence  A pistol I only carry on the road  to terrify robbers  And I have found a less dangerous weapon sometimes sufficient to repel a sudden insult  And now  if Sir Hargrave Pollexfen be wise  he will think himself obliged for this not unfriendly expostulation  or whatever he pleases to call it  to  His most humble Servant  CHARLES GRANDISON   Monday   Mr  Reeves besought Sir Charles to let him shew me these Letters   You may  Mr  Reeves  said he  since I intend not to meet Sir Charles in the way he prescribes   As I asked not leave  Lucy  to take copies of them  I beg they may not be seen out of the venerable circle   I know I need not say how much I am pleased with the contents of the latter  I doubt not but you all will be equally so  Yet  as Sir Charles himself expects not that Sir Hargrave will rest the matter here  and indeed says he cannot  consistently with the vulgar notions of honour  do you think I can be easy  as all this is to be placed to my account   But it is evident  that Sir Charles is  He is governed by another set of principles
