of my situation —The surgeon is a good natured indolent man  the first mate  who is now on shore on duty  is indeed a little proud and cholerick  as all Welchmen are  but in the main  a friendly honest fellow —The lieutenants I have no concern with  and as for the captain  he is too much of a gentleman to know a surgeon s mate  even by sight      CHAP  XXV   The behaviour of Mr  Morgan—his pride  displeasure and generosity—the oeconomy of our mess described—Thomson s further friendship—the nature of my duty explained—the situation of the sick   WHILE he was thus discoursing to me  we heard a voice on the cockpit ladder  pronounce with great vehemence  in a strange dialect     The devil and his dam blow me from the top of Mounchdenny  if I go to him before there is something in my belly —let his nose be as yellow as a saffron  or as plue as a pell  look you  or as green as a leek   tis all one  —  To this somebody answered    So it seems my poor mess mate must part his cable for want of a little assistance —His fore top sail is loose already  and besides  the doctor ordered you to overhaul him —but I see  you don t mind what your master says  —  Here he   230 was interrupted with    Splutter and vons  you lousy tog  who do you call my master  get you gone to the doctor  and tell him my birth  and my education  and my abilities  and moreover  my behaviour is as good as his  or any gentleman s  no disparagement to him  in the whole world—Got pless my soul  does he think  or conceive  or imagine  that I am a horse  or an ass  or a goat  to trudge backwards and forwards  and upwards and downwards  and by sea and by land  at his will and pleasures —Go your ways  you rapscallion  and tell doctor Atkins  that I desire and request  that he will give a look upon the tying man  and order something for him  if he be dead or alive  and I will see him take it by and by  when my craving stomach is satisfied  look you  —  At this the other went away  saying  that if they would serve him so  when he was a dying  by G—d  he d be foul of them in the other world —Here Mr  Thomson let me know that the person we heard  was Mr  Morgan the first mate  who was just come on board from the hospital  where he had been with sick people —At the same time  I saw him come into the birth —He was a short thick man  with a face garnished with pimples  a snub nose turned up at the end  an excessive wide mouth  and little fiery eyes  surrounded with skin puckered up in innumerable wrinkles —My friend immediately made him acquainted with my case  when he regarded me with a very lofty look  but without speaking  set down a bundle he had in his hand  and approached the cupboard  which when he had opened  he exclaimed in a great passion    Cot is my life  all the pork is gone  as I am   231 a christian    Thomson then gave him to understand  that as I had been brought on board half famished  he could do no less than entertain me with what was in the locker  and the rather  as he had bid the steward enter me in the mess —Whether this disappointment made Mr  Morgan more peevish than usual  or he really thought himself too little regarded by his fellowmate  I know not  but after some pause  he went on in this manner—   Mr  Thomson  perhaps you do not use me with all the good manners  and complaisance  and respect  look you  that becomes you  because you have not vouchsafed to advise with me in this affair —I have  in my time  look you  been a man of some weight  and substance  and consideration  and have kept house and home  and paid scot and lot  and the king s taxes  ay  and maintained a family to boot —And moreover  also  I am your senior  and your elder  and your petter  Mr  Thomson  —   My elder I ll allow you to be  but not my better  cried Thomson  with some heat   —   Cot is my saviour  and witness too  said Morgan  with great vehemence  that I am more elder  and therefore more petter by many years than you  —  Fearing this dispute might be attended with some bad consequence  I interposed  and told Mr  Morgan  I was very sorry for having been the occasion of any difference between him and the second mate  and that rather than cause the least breach in their good understanding  I would eat my allowance by myself  or seek admission into some other company —But Thomson  with more spirit than discretion  as I thought  insisted upon my remaining
