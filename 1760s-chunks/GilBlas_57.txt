 more  to chime in with the doctor s theory  I found fault with the use of wine  and pitied mankind for having contracted an untoward relish to so pernicious a beverage  Then  finding my thirst not sufficiently allayed  I filled a large goblet with water  and after having swilled it like a horse  Come  sir  said I to my master  let us drink plentifully of this beneficial liquor  Let us make those early establishments of dilution you so much regret  to live again in your house  He clapped his hands in ecstacy at these words  and preached to me for a whole hour about suffering no liquid but water to pass my lips  To confirm the habit  I promised to drink a large quantity every evening  and  to keep my word with less violence to my private inclinations  I went to bed with a determined purpose of going to the tavern every day   The trouble I had got into at the grocer s did not discourage me from phlebotomizing and prescribing warm water in the usual course  Coming out of a house where I had been visiting a poet in a phrenzy  I was accosted in the street by an old woman who came up and asked me if I was a physician  I said yes  As that is the case  replied she  I entreat you with all humility to go along with me  My niece has been ill since yesterday  and I cannot conceive what is the matter with her  I followed the old lady to her house  where I was shown into a very decent room  occupied by a female who kept her bed  I went near  to consider her case  Her features struck me from the first  and I discovered beyond the possibility of a mistake  after having looked at her some little time  the she adventurer who had played the part of Camilla so adroitly  For her part  she did not seem to recollect me at all  whether from the oppression of her disorder  or from my dress as a physician rendering me not easy to be known again  I took her by the hand  to feel her pulse  and saw my ring upon her finger  I was all in a twitter at the discovery of a valuable  on which I had a claim both in law and equity  Great was my longing to make a snatch at it  but considering that these fair ones would set up a great scream  and that Don Raphael or some other defender of injured innocence might rush in to their rescue  I laid an embargo on my privateering  I thought it best to come by my own in an honest way  and to consult Fabricio about the means  To this last course I stuck  In the mean time the old woman urged me to inform her with what disease her niece was troubled  I was not fool enough to own my ignorance  on the contrary  I took upon myself as a man of science  and after my master s example  pronounced solemnly that the disorder accrued to the patient from the defect of natural perspiration  that consequently she must lose blood as soon as possible  because if we could not open one pore  we always open another  and I finished my prescription with warm water  to do the thing methodically   I shortened my visit as much as possible  and ran to the son of Nunez  whom I met just as he was going out on an errand for his master  I told him my new adventure  and asked his advice about laying an information against Camilla  Pooh  Nonsense  replied he  that would not be the way to get your ring again  Those gentry think restitution double trouble  Call to mind your imprisonment at Astorga  your horse  your money  your very clothes  did not they all centre in the hands of justice  We must rather set our wits to work for the recovery of your diamond  I take on myself the charge of inventing some stratagem for that purpose  I will deliberate it in my way to the hospital  where I have to say but two words from my master to the purveyor  Do you wait for me at our house of call  and do not be on the fret  I will be with you shortly   I had waited  however  more than three hours at the appointed place  when he arrived  I did not know him again at first  Besides that he had changed his dress and platted his hair  a pair of false whiskers covered half his face  He wore an immense sword with a hilt of at least three feet in circumference  and marched at the head of five men of as swaggering an air as himself  with bushy whiskers and long rapiers  Good day to you  Signor Gil Blas  said he by way of salutation  behold an alguazil upon a new construction  and marshalmen of like materials in these brave fellows my companions  We have only to be shown where the woman lodges who purloined the diamond  and we will obtain restitution  take my word for it  I hugged Fabricio at this discourse  which let me into the plot  and testified loudly my approval of the expedient  I paid my respects also to the
