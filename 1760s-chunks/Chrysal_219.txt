   â€¢CONCLUSION OP THE JBSTTIT S DISCOUBSE â€” HIS SYSTEM Off MORALITY   AND KELIGION â€” HIS BEOTHER YIELDS TO HIS ABGTTMENTS WITH   SOME PAETICTTLAR EXCEPTIONS â€” CHRYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE       This short but distinct view of the present situation of the affairs   of Europe must convince you that a general peace must soon be   concluded  the parties that would not being able to continue the   war much longer   and therefore we must be speedy in the execution   â€¢of our designs  or the opportunity will be lost  for it would be im    possible to make even the pride of Spain  or the avarice of Portugal   take the measures we want at a time when England is disengaged   irom other enemies  I have drawn this sketch to show you that         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 249     our designs are not rashly undertaken  but the result of the deepest   knowledge and insight into things  This must remove every scruple   that may arise from doubts of success  But there is one thing   more which must be explained to remove prejudices of another   nature  which may perhaps represent our undertaking in a wrong light   to you  and this is to evince the justice of it  and the means designed   to accomplish its success  Of this matter you must not pretend to   judge by the vulgar rules obtruded by design upon the ignorance of   the world  and which no wise man observes  who has it in his power   to break them with impunity  Man is thrown into this world by   nature to obtain his own happiness by every means within his   power  This is too sublime a truth for vulgar knowledge  as it   would put an end to the delusion by which the wise few keep the   herd of mankind in ignorahce and subjection        But that it is really the truth  and as such made the rule of   action by all the states and princes in the world  will not be denied    nor even doubted by anyone who has considered the systems of   policy and government which are  and ever have been  established   by them        For if it was not an undoubted maxim that power constitutes   the rule of justice  how inconsistent would be the actions of all man    kind   How could a state devise laws to punish the man with death    who goes into his neighbour s field and steals his ox  and  at the same   time  sends armies to invade  spoil  and depopulate the territories   of their neighbours   How could a poor pirate be hanged for rob    bing a single ship  and fleets immediately after sent avowedly to   destroy the whole trade of the same nation   If a state of war is   alleged  that is the very imposition of which I spoke  Every man   has as good a natural right to declare war with his neighbour as   the state he lives in has with another state  and every right that is   not natural is a usurpation  and void  This is the true philoso    phy of life  stripped of the idle dreams of enthusiasm  and selfish   misrepresentations of design        Aa for religion  look over the whole race of mankind  and try   if you can find one who practises what he professes  This is an   incontestible proof  that none believe it  as it is also  that there is   no necessity they should  else would the want of faith and obedience   be punished by that power which is thought to enjoin them   whereas   on the contrary  it is always most successful  as it affords means   which those restraints forbid  I observed that in the beginning of   our conversation on this subject you seemed shocked at my men    tioning the necessity of removing the persons who oppose our   designs  and particularly when I said the Spaniard had swallowed   his death  But this is all prejudice  and want of extending your   view beyond the surface of things  For how much better is the   method we take of striking the single person against whom our de    sign is levelled  than that pursued  not only without reproach    but even encouraged by applause  of involving the innocent with   the guilty  innocent  I mean  with respect to us   and laying waste    whole nations to bring a prince to death   How much better would   it have been for this court to have removed the King of Bulgaria   by poison or a dagger  than to have destroyed millions  as they have         250 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     done  in the pursuit of hia death  by this destructive
