  They did not say  when they related this to me  that they threw themselves at his feet  as to their better father  as well as brother  But I fancy they did   He afterwards  at parting with Mrs  Oldham  said    224 I would be glad to know  madam  how you dispose of yourself  Every unhappy person has a right to the good offices of those who are less embarrass d  When you are settled  pray let me know the manner  And if you acquaint me with the state of your affairs  and what you propose to do for and with those who are intitled to your first care  your confidence in me will not be misplaced   And pray  and pray  ask d I of the Ladies  what said Mrs  Oldham  How did she behave upon this —  Our Harriet is strangely taken with Mrs  Oldham s story  said Miss Grandison—Why  she wept plentifully  you may be sure  She clasped her hands  and kneeled to pray to God to bless him  and all that—She could not do otherwise   See  Lucy —But am I  my grandmamma  am I  my aunt  to blame  Is it inconsistent with the strictest virtue to be charmed with such a story —May not virtue itself pity the lapsed —O yes  it may  I am sure  you  and Sir Charles Grandison  will say it may  A while ago  I thought my self a poor creature  compared to these two Ladies  But now I believe I am as good as they in some things —But they had not such a grandmamma and aunt as I am bless d with  They lost their excellent mother  while they were young  and their brother is but lately come over  And his superior excellence  like sunshine  breaking out on a sudden  finds out  and brings to sight  those spots and freckles  that were hardly before discoverable   Sir Charles desired Mrs  Oldham would give in writing what she proposed to do for herself  and for those who were under her care  She did  at her first opportunity  It was  That she purposed going to London  for the sake of the young people s education  Of turning into money what jewels  cloaths  and plate  she should think above her then situation in life    225 Of living retired in a little genteel house  And she gave in an estimate of her worth  To what amount the Ladies know not  but this they know  that their brother allows her an annuity  for the sake of her sons by his father  And they doubt not but he will be still kinder to them  when they are old enough to be put into the world   This the Ladies think an encouragement to a guilty life  I will not dare to pronounce upon it  because I may be thought partial to the generous man  But should be glad of my uncle s opinion  This  however  may be said  That Sir Charles Grandison has no vices of his own to cover by the extensiveness of his charity and beneficence  and if it be not goodness in him to do thus  it is greatness  and this  if it be not praise worthy  is the first instance that I have known goodness and greatness of soul separable   The brother and sisters went down  after this  to Grandison hall  and Sir Charles had reason to be pleased with the good order in which he found every thing there   LETTER XXIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   THE next thing the Ladies mentioned  was  Sir Charles s management with the two stewards   I will not aim at being very particular in this part of the family history   When Sir Charles found that his father had left the inspection of each steward s account to the other  he enter d into the examination of the whole himself  and tho  he allowed them several disputable and unproved charges  he brought them to acknowledge a much greater ballance in his favour  than they had made themselves debtors for  This was the use he made of detecting them  to his sisters—You see    226 sisters  that my father was not so profuse as some people thought him  He had partners in his estate  and I have reason to think that he often paid interest for his own money   On his settling with Filmer  the treaty with Miss Obrien came out  Mr  Filmer had  by surprize  brought that beautiful girl into Sir Charles s presence  and he owned to his sisters  that she was a very lovely creature   But when the mother and aunt found  that he only admired her as a man would a fine picture  they insisted that Sir Thomas had promised to marry Miss Obrien privately  and produced two of his Letters to her  that seemed to give ground for such an expectation  Sir Charles was grieved for the sake of his father s memory  at this transaction  and much more on finding that the unhappy man went down to his seat in Essex  his head and heart full of this scheme  when he was struck with his last fatal illness
