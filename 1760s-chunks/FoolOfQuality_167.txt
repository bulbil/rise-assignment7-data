 Fenton tenderly embracing him    and taking him on his knee  and clasping him to his bosom  gave   way to the kindred emotion that swelled in his own breast  and   mingled his joyful tears with those of his Harry      As soon as the passion of these two friends had subsided  Harry   began to take new courage from the caresses of his dear father  who    as he sensibly felt  would never hate or forsake him  however he   might condemn and detest himself      Well then  sir  says he  since you are so very good  I will trust   you with my story  so far as it has to say to the little that I can   remember of my faults in it      You must know that I had no sooner got into your field that you   gave me for our plays than a young master came up to us  so grandly   dressed and attended  and with such a saucy air  that he seemed   to say in his own mind All these are but dirt in comparison of   myself      As I looked at him  he brought to my mind the story you once   told me of Hercules  who was poisoned by his fine coat  So I began   to pity him  and  I believe  to despise him too   and that  you know    was not right   for you told me that whoever despises another grows     M2         164 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      worse than the one he despises  and falls below him  while he thinks   to set himself above him   but that did not come into my head at   the time      And so  sir  to show us all that he did not matter money  or that   he loved mischief the better of the two  he took out a handful of   silver and threw it among my companions  to set them by the ears     and this provoked and began to make me very angry with him    and thus one fault brought me into another after it  like Water   my chickens come clock      But this did not satisfy my young lord for they called him lord   but he must take out a crown  and offer it to any two of my   companions that would box for it  So a stranger that was just   come offered to box any one in the company for it   but I do not   repent of my beating him  because he was the challenger      But the worst is yet to come  sir  There were some of my com    panions who refused to join in the scramble for the money  and   that pleased me very much   and so  to reward them  I took out   a handful of money and gave them a crown apiece  But  you know    I need not have taken out more money than I meant to give them    if it was not partly to show my lord that I had as much money as   himself  and so I got myself up to the head and ears in the very   same fault that I found with him      Now comes the worst of all  For  growing proud and conceited    as if I had no one fault in the world  and as if the like of me was   only fit to reprove others and teach them their duty  I desired the   fine master to take himself home  and  since he was a lord  to learn   also to be a gentleman  Upon that he gave me a blow  which I   deserved very well   but I did not matter his blow a fillip if I had   not thought it an affront before my companions  So my passion   began to rise  and I gave him half a stroke  but unluckily it hit him   full in the nose  and I am afraid he is hurted very sadly      Besides all  father  I know well enough there will come sad com    plaints against me  and so I shall bring trouble and disturbance   upon you   and that is grief upon grief      Do not fear for me  Harry  I shall do well enough  says Mr    Fenton  But  Harry  you have not told me near as great news as   you thought to do  I knew all along that you had a very naughty   boy within you   but I forbore to tell you so  because I rather   wished you should make the discovery yourself  and now  God be   praised   you have found out the secret      And what good will it do me
