immediately began   to prepare for putting into execution one of those strategems he had   contrived for separating her from Mr  Staple  After some few tender   speeches  he fell into a discourse concerning the weather  said  he was   sorry to perceive the days so much shortened  that summer would soon be   gone  and added  that as that beautiful season could last but a small   time  the most should be made of it   I came   said he   to intreat the   favour of you and Miss Flora  to permit me to accompany you in an airing   through Brompton  Kensington  Chelsea  and the other little villages on   this side of London        Miss Betsy replied  that she would go with all her heart  and believed   she could answer the same for Miss Flora  there being only two grave   dons and their wives within  whom she would be glad to be disengaged   from   But if not   said she   I can send for a young lady in the   neighbourhood  who will be glad to give us her company        She sent first  however  to Miss Flora  who immediately came in  and    the proposal being made  accepted it with pleasure  and added  that she   would ask her mamma for orders for the coach to be got ready   It need   not  Madam   said Mr  Trueworth   my servant is here  and he shall get   one from Blunt s   But Miss Flora insisted on their going in Mr    Goodman s  saying  she was certain neither he nor her mamma would go out   that day  as the company they had were come to stay  on which Mr    Trueworth complied       When she had left the room   Ah  Madam   said he to Miss Betsy   could I   flatter myself with believing I owed this condescension to any other   motive than your complaisance  to a person who has some share in your   brother s friendship  I should be blessed indeed  but  ah  I see I have   a rival  a rival dangerous to my hopes  not only on the account of his   merits  but also as he had the honour of declaring his passion before   me  the fortunate Mr  Staple   added he  kissing her hand   may  perhaps   have already made some impression on that heart I would sacrifice my all   to gain  and I am come too late         Rather too soon   replied she  smiling   both of you equally too soon    admitting his sentiments for me to be as you imagine  for I assure you    Sir  my heart has hitherto been entirely my own  and is not very likely   to incline to the reception of any guest of the nature you mean  for yet   a long  long time  Whoever thinks to gain me  must not be in a hurry    like Captain Hysom        Mr  Trueworth was about to make some passionate reply  when Miss Flora   returned  and told them the coach would be ready immediately  for she   herself had spoke to the coachman  and bid him put the horses to with   all the haste he could  on which the lover expressed his sense of the   obligation he had to her for taking this trouble in the politest terms       A person of much less discernment than this gentleman  might easily   perceive  that the way to be agreeable to Miss Betsy  was not to be too   serious  he therefore assumed all the vivacity he was master of  both   before they went  and during the whole course of the little tour they   made  in which it is not to be doubted but he regaled them with every   thing the places they passed through could furnish       The ladies were so well pleased  both with their entertainment and the   company of the person who entertained them  that they seemed not in   haste to go home  and he had the double satisfaction of enjoying the   presence of his mistress  and of giving at least one day s   disappointment to his rival  he was confirmed in the truth of this   conjecture  when  on returning to Mr  Goodman s  which was not till some   hours after close of day  the footman who opened the door told Miss   Betsy that Mr  Staple had been to wait upon her       After this it may be supposed he had a night of much more tranquillity   than the preceding one had afforded him  The next morning  as early as   he thought decency permitted  he made a visit
