he   called it       And so we entered the house together          Eight o clock at night       Now these sweet assurances  my dear father and mother  you will say    must be very consolatory to me  and being voluntary on his side  were   all that could be wished for on mine  and I was resolved  if possible    to subdue my idle fears and apprehensions          Ten o clock at night       As we sat at supper  he was generously kind to me  as well in his   actions  as expressions  He took notice  in the most delicate manner  of   my endeavour to conquer my foibles  and said  I see  with pleasure  my   dear girl strives to comport herself in a manner suitable to my wishes    I see  even through the sweet tender struggles of your over nice   modesty  how much I owe to your intentions of obliging me  As I have   once told you  that I am the conquest more of your virtue than your   beauty  so not one alarming word or look shall my beloved Pamela hear or   see  to give her reason to suspect the truth of what I aver  You may   the rather believe me  continued he  as you may see the pain I have   to behold any thing that concerns you  even though your concern be   causeless  And yet I will indulge my dear girl s bashful weakness so   far  as to own  that so pure a mind may suffer from apprehension  on so   important a change as this  and I can therefore be only displeased with   such part of your conduct  as may make your sufferings greater than my   own  when I am resolved  through every stage of my future life  in all   events  to study to make them less       After supper  of which  with all his sweet persuasions  I could hardly   taste  he made me drink two glasses of champaign  and  afterwards  a   glass of sack  which he kindly forced upon me  by naming your healths    and as the time of retiring drew on  he took notice  but in a very   delicate manner  how my colour went and came  and how foolishly I   trembled  Nobody  surely  in such delightful circumstances  ever behaved   so silly   And he said  My dearest girl  I fear you have had too much   of my company for so many hours together  and would better recollect   yourself  if you retired for half an hour to your closet       I wished for this  but durst not say so much  lest he should be angry    for  as the hours grew on  I found my apprehensions increase  and my   silly heart was the unquieter  every time I could lift up my eyes to   his dear face  so sweetly terrible did he appear to my apprehensions  I   said  You are all goodness  dear sir  and I boldly kissed his dear   hand  and pressed it to my lips with both mine  And saluting me very   fervently  he gave me his hand  seeing me hardly able to stand  and led   me to my chamber door  and then most generously withdrew       I went to my closet  and the first thing I did  on my knees  again   thanked God for the blessing of the day  and besought his divine   goodness to conduct my future life in such a manner  as should make me   a happy instrument of his glory  After this  being now left to my own   recollection  I grew a little more assured and lightsome  and the pen   and paper being before me  I amused myself with writing thus far          Eleven o clock Thursday night       Mrs  Jewkes being come up with a message  desiring to know  whether   her master may attend upon me in my closet  and hinting to me  that    however  she believed he did not expect to find me there  I have sent   word  that I beg he would indulge me one quarter of an hour   So    committing myself to the mercies of the Almighty  who has led me through   so many strange scenes of terror and affrightment  to this happy  yet   awful moment  I will wish you  my dear parents  a good night  and though   you will not see this in time  yet I know I have your hourly prayers    and therefore cannot fail of them now  So  good night  good night  God   bless you  and God bless
