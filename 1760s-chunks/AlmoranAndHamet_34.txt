  excess of tenderness and joy  which flattered all his hopes  and for a   moment suspended his misery  She enquired  with a fond and gentle   solicitude  by what means he had gained admittance  and how he had   provided for his retreat  He received and returned her caresses with a   vehemence  in which  to less partial eyes  desire would have been more   apparent than love  and in the tumult of his passion  he almost   neglected her enquiries  finding  however  that she would be answered    he told her  that being by the permission of ALMORAN admitted to every   part of the palace  except that of the women  he had found means to   bribe the eunuch who kept the door  who was not in danger of detection    because ALMORAN  wearied with the tumult and fatigue of the day  had   retired to sleep  and given order to be called at a certain hour  She   then complained of the felicitations to which she was exposed  expressed   her dread of the consequences she had reason to expect from some sudden   sally of the tyrant s rage  and related with tears the brutal outrage   she had suffered when he last left her   Though I abhorred him   said   she   I yet kneeled before him for thee  Let me bend in reverence to   that Power  at whose look the whirlwinds are silent  and the seas are   calm  that his fury has hitherto been restrained from hurting thee        At these words  the face of ALMORAN was again covered with the blushes   of confusion  to be still beloved only as HAMET  and as ALMORAN to be   still hated  to be thus reproached without anger  and wounded by those   who knew not that they struck him  was a species of misery peculiar to   himself  and had been incurred only by the acquisition of new powers    which he had requested and received as necessary to obtain that   felicity  which the parsimony of nature had placed beyond his reach  His   emotions  however  as by ALMEIDA they were supposed to be the emotions   of HAMET  she imputed to a different cause   As Heaven   says she   has   preserved thee from death  so has it  for thy sake  preserved me from   violation   ALMORAN  whose passion had in this interval again surmounted   his remorse  gazed eagerly upon her  and catching her to his bosom   Let   us at least   says he   secure the happiness that is now offered  let   not these inestimable moments pass by us unimproved  but to shew that we   deserve them  let them be devoted to love    Let us then   said ALMEIDA     escape together    To escape with thee   said  ALMORAN   is impossible    I shall retire  and  like the shaft of Arabia  leave no mark behind  me    but the flight of ALMEIDA will at once be traced to him by whom I was   admitted  and I shall thus retaliate his friendship with destruction      Let him then   said ALMEIDA   be the partner of our flight    Urge it   not now   said ALMORAN   but trust to my prudence and my love  to select   some hour that will be more favourable to our purpose  And yet   said   he   even then  we shall  as now  sigh in vain for the completion of our   wishes  by whom shall our hands be joined  when in the opinion of the   priests it has been forbidden from above    Save thyself then   said   ALMEIDA  and leave me to my fate    Not so   said ALMORAN   What else     replied ALMEIDA   is in our power    It is in our power   said ALMORAN     to seize that joy  to which a public form can give us no new claim  for   the public form can only declare that right by which I claim it now        As they were now reclining upon a sofa  he threw his arm round her  but   she suddenly sprung up  and burst from him  the tear started to her eye    and she gazed upon him with an earnest but yet tender look   Is it     says she   No sure  it is not the voice of HAMET    O  yes   said   ALMORAN   what other voice should call thee to cancel at once the wrongs   of HAMET and ALMEIDA  to secure the treasures of thy love from the hand   of the robber  to hide  the joys  which if now we lose we may lose
