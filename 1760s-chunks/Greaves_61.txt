that he might set out in quest of her without a moment s delay  It was not without some difficulty that this information was obtained from the postboy  who had been enjoined to secrecy by the lady  and even gratified with a handsome reward for his promised discretion  The same method was used to make him disgorge his trust  he undertook to conduct Sir Launcelot  who hired a post chaise for despatch  and immediately departed  after having directed his squire to follow his track with the horses   Yet  whatever haste he made  it is absolutely necessary  for the reader s satisfaction  that we should outstrip the chaise  and visit the ladies before his arrival  We shall therefore  without circumlocution  premise  that Miss Meadows was no other than that paragon of beauty and goodness  the all accomplished Miss Aurelia Darnel  She had  with that meekness of resignation peculiar to herself  for some years  submitted to every species of oppression which her uncle s tyranny of disposition could plan  and his unlimited power of guardianship execute  till at length it rose to such a pitch of despotism as she could not endure  He had projected a match between his niece and one Philip Sycamore  Esq   a young man who possessed a pretty considerable estate in the north country  who liked Aurelia s person  but was enamoured of her fortune  and had offered to purchase Anthony s interest and alliance with certain concessions  which could not but be agreeable to a man of loose principles  who would have found it a difficult task to settle the accounts of his wardship   According to the present estimate of matrimonial felicity  Sycamore might have found admittance as a future son in law to any private family of the kingdom  He was by birth a gentleman  tall  straight  and muscular  with a fair  sleek  unmeaning face  that promised more simplicity than ill nature  His education had not been neglected  and he inherited an estate of five thousand a year  Miss Darnel  however  had penetration enough to discover and despise him  as a strange composition of rapacity and profusion  absurdity and good sense  bashfulness and impudence  self conceit and diffidence  awkwardness and ostentation  insolence and good nature  rashness and timidity  He was continually surrounded and preyed upon by certain vermin called Led Captains and Buffoons  who showed him in leading strings like a sucking giant  rifled his pockets without ceremony  ridiculed him to his face  traduced his character  and exposed him in a thousand ludicrous attitudes for the diversion of the public  while at the same time he knew their knavery  saw their drift  detested their morals  and despised their understanding  He was so infatuated by indolence of thought  and communication with folly  that he would have rather suffered himself to be led into a ditch with company  than be at the pains of going over a bridge alone  and involved himself in a thousand difficulties  the natural consequences of an error in the first concoction  which  though he plainly saw it  he had not resolution enough to avoid   Such was the character of Squire Sycamore  who professed himself the rival of Sir Launcelot Greaves in the good graces of Miss Aurelia Darnel  He had in this pursuit persevered with more constancy and fortitude than he ever exerted in any other instance  Being generally needy from extravagance  he was stimulated by his wants  and animated by his vanity  which was artfully instigated by his followers  who hoped to share the spoils of his success  These motives were reinforced by the incessant and eager exhortations of Anthony Darnel  who seeing his ward in the last year of her minority  thought there was no time to be lost in securing his own indemnification  and snatching his niece for ever from the hopes of Sir Launcelot  whom he now hated with redoubled animosity  Finding Aurelia deaf to all his remonstrances  proof against ill usage  and resolutely averse to the proposed union with Sycamore  he endeavoured to detach her thoughts from Sir Launcelot  by forging tales to the prejudice of his constancy and moral character  and  finally  by recapitulating the proofs and instances of his distraction  which he particularised with the most malicious exaggerations   In spite of all his arts  he found it impracticable to surmount her objections to the proposed alliance  and therefore changed his battery  Instead of transferring her to the arms of his friend  he resolved to detain her in his own power by a legal claim  which would invest him with the uncontrolled management of her affairs  This was a charge of lunacy  in consequence of which he hoped to obtain a commission  to secure a jury to his wish  and be appointed sole committee of her person  as well as steward on her estate  of which he would then be heir apparent   As the first steps towards the execution of this honest scheme  he had subjected Aurelia to the superintendency and direction of an old duenna  who had been formerly the procuress of his pleasures  and hired a new set of servants  who were given to understand  at their first admission  that the young lady was disordered in her brain   An impression of this nature is easily preserved among servants  when the master
