to threaten  in plain terms  to make it  a national concern  and not only wrote to his court for instructions   but even advised the council to make reprisals  and send some French  gentleman in London to the Tower   This intimation had an effect upon the ministry at Versailles  who   rather than run the risk of incensing a people whom it was neither  their interest nor inclination to disoblige  consented to discharge the  offenders  on condition that they should leave Paris in three days after  their enlargement  This proposal was readily agreed to by Peregrine  who  was now a little more tractable  and heartily tired of being cooped  up in such an uncomfortable abode  for the space of three long days   without any sort of communication or entertainment but that which his  own imagination suggested   CHAPTER XLVII   Peregrine makes himself Merry at the Expense of the Painter  who curses  his Landlady  and breaks with the Doctor   As he could easily conceive the situation of his companion in adversity   he was unwilling to leave the place until he had reaped some diversion  from his distress  and with that view repaired to the dungeon of the  afflicted painter  to which he had by this time free access  When  he entered  the first object that presented itself to his eye was so  uncommonly ridiculous  that he could scarce preserve that gravity of  countenance which he had affected in order to execute the joke he had  planned  The forlorn Pallet sat upright in his bed in a deshabille that  was altogether extraordinary  He had laid aside his monstrous hoop     6 22 15  3 45 PM   together with his stays  gown  and petticoat  wrapped his lappets  about his head by way of nightcap  and wore his domino as a loose  morning dress  his grizzled locks hung down about his lack lustre  eyes and tawny neck  in all the disorder of negligence  his gray beard  bristled about half an inch through the remains of the paint with  which his visage had been bedaubed  and every feature of his face was  lengthened to the most ridiculous expression of grief and dismay   Seeing Peregrine come in  he started up in a sort of frantic ecstasy   and  running towards him with open arms  no sooner perceived the woeful  appearance into which our hero had modelled his physiognomy  than he  stopped short all of a sudden  and the joy which had begun to take  possession of his heart was in a moment dispelled by the most rueful  presages  so that he stood in a most ludicrous posture of dejection   like a malefactor at the Old Bailey  when sentence is about to be  pronounced  Pickle  taking him by the hand  heaved a profound sigh  and  after having protested that he was extremely mortified at being pitched  upon as the messenger of bad news  told him  with an air of sympathy and  infinite concern  that the French court  having discovered his sex  had  resolved  in consideration of the outrageous indignity he offered  in public to a prince of the blood  to detain him in the Bastille a  prisoner for life  and that this sentence was a mitigation obtained by  the importunities of the British ambassador  the punishment ordained by  law being no other than breaking alive upon the wheel   These tidings aggravated the horrors of the painter to such a degree  that he roared aloud  and skipped about the room in all the extravagance  of distraction  taking God and man to witness  that he would rather  suffer immediate death than endure one year s imprisonment in such a  hideous place  and cursing the hour of his birth  and the moment on  which he departed from his own country   For my own part   said his  tormentor  in a hypocritical tone   I was obliged to swallow the bitter  pill of making submission to the prince  who  as I had not presumed to  strike him  received acknowledgments  in consequence of which I shall  be this day set at liberty  and there is even one expedient left for the  recovery of your freedom  it is  I own  a disagreeable remedy  but one  had better undergo a little mortification than be for ever wretched   Besides  upon second thoughts  I begin to imagine that you will not for  such a trifle sacrifice yourself to the unceasing horrors of a dungeon   especially as your condescension will in all probability be attended  with advantages which you could not otherwise enjoy   Pallet   interrupting him with great eagerness  begged for the love of God that  he would no longer keep him in the torture of suspense  but mention  that same remedy  which he was resolved to follow  let it be ever so  unpalatable   Peregrine  having thus played upon his passions of fear and hope   answered   that as the offence was committed in the habit of a woman   which was a disguise unworthy of the other sex  the French court was of  opinion that the delinquent should be
