  pain I got from this pond  which now I think of with terror  and bending   my limping steps towards the house  took refuge in the corner of an   outhouse  where wood and coals are laid up for family use  till I   should be found by my cruel keepers  and consigned to a more wretched   confinement  and worse usage than I had hitherto experienced  and there   behind a pile of firewood I crept  and lay down  as you may imagine    with a mind just broken  and a heart sensible to nothing but the   extremest woe and dejection       This  my dear father and mother  is the issue of your poor Pamela s   fruitless enterprise  and who knows  if I had got out at the back door    whether I had been at all in a better case  moneyless  friendless  as I   am  and in a strange place   But blame not your poor daughter too much    Nay  if ever you see this miserable scribble  all bathed and blotted   with my tears  let your pity get the better of your reprehension  But   I know it will  And I must leave off for the present   For  oh    my strength and my will are at this time very far unequal to one   another   But yet I will add  that though I should have praised God   for my deliverance  had I been freed from my wicked keepers  and my   designing master  yet I have more abundant reason to praise him  that I   have been delivered from a worse enemy   myself          I will conclude my sad relation          It seems Mrs  Jewkes awaked not till day break  and not finding me in   bed  she called me  and  no answer being returned  she relates  that she   got out of bed  and ran to my closet  and  missing me  searched under   the bed  and in another closet  finding the chamber door as she had left   it  quite fast  and the key  as usual  about her wrist  For if I could   have got out of the chamber door  there were two or three passages    and doors to them all  double locked and barred  to go through into   the great garden  so that  to escape  there was no way  but out of the   window  and of that window  because of the summer parlour under it  for   the other windows are a great way from the ground       She says she was excessively frightened  and instantly raised the Swiss    and the two maids  who lay not far off  and finding every door fast  she   said  I must be carried away  as St  Peter was out of prison  by some   angel  It is a wonder she had not a worse thought       She says  she wept  and wrung her hands  and took on sadly  running   about like a mad woman  little thinking I could have got out of the   closet window  between the iron bars  and  indeed  I don t know whether   I could do so again  But at last finding that casement open  they   concluded it must be so  and ran out into the garden  and found my   footsteps in the mould of the bed which I dropt down upon from the   leads  And so speeded away all of them  that is to say  Mrs  Jewkes    Colbrand  and Nan  towards the back door  to see if that was fast  while   the cook was sent to the out offices to raise the men  and make them get   horses ready  to take each a several way to pursue me       But  it seems  finding that door double locked and padlocked  and the   heel of my shoe  and the broken bricks  they verily concluded I was got   away by some means over the wall  and then  they say  Mrs  Jewkes   seemed like a distracted woman  Till  at last  Nan had the thought to go   towards the pond  and there seeing my coat  and cap  and handkerchief    in the water  cast almost to the banks by the agitation of the waves    she thought it was me  and  screaming out  ran to Mrs  Jewkes  and said    O  madam  madam  here s a piteous thing   Mrs  Pamela lies drowned in   the pond  Thither they all ran  and finding my clothes  doubted not   I was at the bottom  and they all  Swiss among the rest  beat their   breasts  and made most
