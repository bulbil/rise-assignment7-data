Goodman   I think I am now at an age capable of chusing   for myself  in the article of dress  and as it has been settled between   you and Sir Ralph Trusty  that  out of the income of my fortune  thirty   pounds a year should be allowed for my board  twenty pounds for my   pocket expences  and fifty for my cloaths  I think I ought to have the   two latter entirely at my own disposal  and to lay it out as I think   fit  and not be obliged  like a charity child  to wear whatever livery   my benefactor shall be pleased to order   She spoke this with so much   spleen  that Mr  Goodman was a little nettled at it  and told her  that   what his wife had done was out of kindness and good will  which since   she did not take as it was meant  she should have her money to do with   as she would        That is all I desire   answered she   therefore be pleased to let me   have twenty guineas now  or  if there does not remain so much in your   hands  I will ask Sir Ralph to advance it  and you may return it to him   when you settle accounts     No  no   cried the merchant hastily   I see   no reason to trouble my good friend  Sir Ralph  on such a frivolous   matter  You shall have the sum you mention  Miss Betsy  whether so much   remains out of the hundred pounds a year set apart for your subsistence    or not  as I can but deduct it out of the next payment  but I would have   you manage with discretion  for you may depend  that the surplus of what   was at first agreed upon  shall not be broke into  but laid up to   increase your fortune  which  by the time you come of age  I hope will   be pretty handsomely improved        Miss Betsy then assured him  that she doubted not of his zeal for her   interest  and hoped she had not offended him in any thing she had said     No  no   replied he   I always make allowances for the little   impatiences of persons of your sex and age  especially where dress is   concerned   In speaking these words  he opened his bureau  and took out   twenty guineas  which he immediately gave her  making her first sign a   memorandum of it  Miss Flora was all on fire to have offered something   in opposition to this  but durst not do it  and the mantua maker that   instant coming in  she went up stairs with her into her chamber  leaving   Miss Betsy and Mr  Goodman together  the former of whom  being eager to   go about what she intended  ordered a hackney coach to be called  and   taking the silk with her  went directly to the shop where it was bought       The mercer at first seemed unwilling to take it again  but on her   telling him she would always make use of him for every thing she wanted   in his way  and would then buy two suits of him  he at last consented    As she was extremely curious in everything relating to her shape  she   made choice of a pink coloured French lustring  to the end  that the   plaits lying flat  she would shew the beauty of her waist to more   advantage  and to atone for the slightness of the silk  purchased as   much of it as would flounce the sleeves and the petticoat from top to   bottom  she made the mercer also cut off a sufficient quantity of a rich   green Venetian sattin  to make her a riding habit  and as she came home   bought a silver trimming for it of Point D Espagne  all which  with the   silk she disliked in exchange  did not amount to the money she had   received from Mr  Goodman       On her return  she asked the footman  who opened the door  if the   mantua maker was gone  but he not being able to inform her  she ran   hastily up stairs  to Miss Flora s chamber  which  indeed  was also her   own  for they lay together  she was about to bounce in  but found that   the door was locked  and the key taken out on the inside  This very much   surprized her  especially as she thought she had heard Miss Flora s   voice  as she was at the top of the stair case  wanting  therefore  to   be satisfied who was with her  she went as softly as she could into Lady   Mellasin s dressing room  which was parted from
