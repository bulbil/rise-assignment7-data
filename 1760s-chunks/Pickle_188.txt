by his experience of this ticklish  punctilio  and  in the meantime  gave a handsome benefaction to the  hospital  out of these first fruits of the success in play  and reserved  two hundred pounds for a set of diamond ear rings and solitaire  which  he intended for a present to Miss Emily   CHAPTER LXX    The two Friends eclipse all their Competitors in Gallantry  and practise  a pleasant Project of Revenge upon the Physicians of the Place   The fame of their exploit against the sharpers was immediately diffused  through all the companies at Bath  so that  when our adventurers  appeared in public  they were pointed out by an hundred extended  fingers  and considered as consummate artists in all the different  species of finesse  which they would not fail to practise with the first  opportunity  Nor was this opinion of their characters any obstacle to  their reception into the fashionable parties in the place  but  on the  contrary  such a recommendation  which  as I have already hinted  never  fails to operate for the advantage of the possessor   This first adventure  therefore  served them as an introduction to  the company at Bath  who were not a little surprised to find their  expectations baffled by the conduct of the two companions  because   far from engaging deeply at play  they rather shunned all occasions of  gaming  and directed their attention to gallantry  in which our hero  shone unrivalled  His external qualifications  exclusive of any other    6 22 15  3 45 PM   merit  were strong enough to captivate the common run of the female sex   and these  reinforced with a sprightliness of conversation  and a  most insinuating address  became irresistible  even by those who were  fortified with pride  caution  or indifference  But  among all the  nymphs of this gay place  he did not meet with one object that disputed  the empire of his heart with Emilia  and therefore he divided his  attachment according to the suggestions of vanity and whim  so that   before he had resided a fortnight at Bath  he had set all the ladies  by the ears  and furnished all the hundred tongues of scandal with full  employment  The splendour of his appearance excited the inquiries of  envy  which  instead of discovering any circumstances to his prejudice   was cursed with the information of his being a young gentleman of a good  family  and heir to an immense fortune   The countenance of some of his quality friends  who arrived at Bath   confirmed this piece of intelligence  Upon which his acquaintance  was courted and cultivated with great assiduity  and he met with such  advances from some of the fair sex  as rendered him extremely fortunate  in his amours  Nor was his friend Godfrey a stranger to favours of the  same kind  his accomplishments were exactly calculated for the meridian  of female taste  and  with certain individuals of that sex  his muscular  frame  and the robust connection of his limbs  were more attractive  than the delicate proportions of his companion  He accordingly reigned  paramount among those inamoratas who were turned of thirty  without  being under the necessity of proceeding by tedious addresses  and was  thought to have co operated with the waters in removing the sterility of  certain ladies  who had long undergone the reproach and disgust of their  husbands  while Peregrine set up his throne among those who laboured  under the disease of celibacy  from the pert miss of fifteen  who   with a fluttering heart  tosses her head  bridles up  and giggles  involuntarily at sight of a handsome young man  to the staid maid of  twenty eight  who  with a demure aspect  moralizes on the vanity of  beauty  the folly of youth  and simplicity of woman  and expatiates  on friendship  benevolence  and good sense  in the style of a Platonic  philosopher   In such a diversity of dispositions  his conquests were attended with  all the heart burnings  animosities  and turmoils of jealousy and spite   The younger class took all opportunities of mortifying their seniors  in public  by treating them with that indignity which  contrary to the  general privilege of age  is  by the consent and connivance of mankind   leveled against those who have the misfortune to come under the  denomination of old maids  and these last retorted their hostilities  in the private machinations of slander  supported by experience and  subtilty of invention  Not one day passed in which some new story did  not circulate  to the prejudice of one or other of those rivals   If our hero  in the long room  chanced to quit one of the moralists   with whom he had been engaged in conversation  he was immediately  accosted by a number of the opposite faction  who  with ironical smiles   upbraided him with cruelty to the poor lady he had left  exhorted him to  have compassion on her sufferings  and  turning their eyes towards  the object of their intercession  broke forth into a universal peal
