of me   and  at that instant recollecting that no help was near    that she was in the power of a man whose aim was her eternal ruin  and   that it was by her own indiscretion alone this mischief had fallen on   her  with so overcome with the dread  the shame  the horror  as she then   supposed  of her inevitable fate  that she was very near falling into a   swoon       The gentleman discovering  by the light of the lamps at the bagnio door    the condition she was in  was truly touched with it   Retire   said he   hastily to the fellows   we do not want you   Then throwing himself on   his knees before her   Let this posture  Madam   continued he   obtain   your pardon  and  at the same time  ease you of all apprehensions on my   score     May I believe you   said she  still weeping   You may     replied he  Then rising  and placing himself on the seat opposite to   her   I love my pleasures  and think it no crime to indulge the   appetites of nature  I am charmed with the kind free woman  but I honour   and revere the truly virtuous  and it is a maxim with me never to   attempt the violation of innocence  These  Madam  are my principles in   regard to your sex  but  to convince you farther  Here  fellow     continued he to the coachman  who was walking backwards and forwards at   some distance   get up upon your box  and drive where you were first   directed        Miss Betsy acknowledged the generosity of this behaviour  and  on his   asking by what accident it had happened  that he found her in company   with a woman of Miss Forward s character  she told him ingenuously the   truth  that they knew each other when children in the country  but that   she had not seen her more than three times since their coming to London    and was entirely ignorant of her conduct from that time       He then took the liberty of reminding her  that a young lady more   endangered her reputation by an acquaintance of one woman of ill fame    than by receiving the visits of twenty men  though professed libertines    To which she replied  that for the future she would be very careful   what company she kept of both sexes       This was the sum of the conversation that passed between them during   their little stage to Mr  Goodman s  where being safely arrived  after   having seen her within the doors  he saluted her with a great deal of   respect  and took his leave                CHAPTER XI       Shews what effects the transactions of the preceding night had on the   minds of Miss Betsy and Mr  Trueworth          Mr  Goodman and Lady Mellasin were gone to bed when Miss Betsy came   home  but Miss Flora sat up for her  in complaisance  as she pretended    but in reality to see who it was came home with her  This malicious   creature had been extremely fawning  for some days past  to Miss Betsy    but this night was more so than usual  doubtless  in the hope of being   able to draw something out of her  which her cruel wit might turn to her   disadvantage  but the other knew too well the disposition she had   towards her  to communicate anything to her  which she would not wish   should be made publick       Never did any one pass a night with greater inquietudes than this young   lady sustained  and she felt them the more terribly  as she had no   friend to whom pride and shame would suffer her to impart the cause  she   looked back with horror on the precipice she had fallen into  and   considered it as a kind of miracle  that she had recovered from it   unhurt  she could not reflect on what had passed  that by the levity of   her conduct she had been thought a common prostitute  had been treated   as such  and preserved from irrecoverable ruin by the mere mercy of a   man who was a perfect stranger to her  without feeling anew that   confusion which the most shocking moments of her distress inflicted  The   most bitter of her enemies could not have passed censure more severe   than she did on herself  and  in this fit of humiliation and repentance    would even have asked Mr  Trueworth pardon for the little regard she had   paid to his advice
