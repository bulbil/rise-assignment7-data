  Who wretched Exiles live   Sincerer were my silent Tears  Than hopeless Lovers give     73  A Home  or Mistress  all may find   And only Fools despair   A wise Man s Love is unconfin d   His Home is ev ry where   But one sincere and faithful Friend   Is the best Gift of Heaven   And all his Wishes there should end   To whom that Bliss is given   LETTER XLV  FRANCES to HENRY   THERE is something very provoking in your last Letter  which I have observed in several others  upon like Occasions  and  in short  there is  in your whole Behaviour towards me  something which often distresses me to the highest Degree  You first say  or do some rude  slighting  or unkind Thing to me  and when I resent it  by Speech or Letter  you throw yourself into your provoking Calmness  and are Master of so much Politeness  Address  and Power of Countenance  that you almost persuade me it was impossible for you to offend  Which is somewhat like the Archness of an Academick  who  when he has burned your Fingers  will give you Logick  to prove there is no Heat in Fire  which  tho  it amuses  does not not prevent   74 your Smarting  and  when I think to relieve myself by complaining to others  they do not believe me  against such Gentleness of Manners  and specious Shew   In the History of Reynard the Fox  there is a Story told  That  once upon a Time  all the Beasts of the Field rose in Arms against our Hero  on Account of some Rogueries charged upon him  which  they thought  brought a Disgrace on their Bruteships  But  when they came to his Den  they found him reading his Credo  and concluded the Information to be malicious  When Nero was seen playing on his Harp  who could have thought it was he who had just fired the City   In short  my dear Harry  I wish you would resolve to be either an Angel  or a Devil   for you can be either  and preserve Constancy in your Option  because this Suspence  you hold me in  is the most uneasy State in the World  as I cannot determine on any certain Scheme of loving or hating you  So I shall conclude  at present  with a Tag from one of Martial s Epigrams    There is no Living with you  or without you     Adieu   Frances     75  LETTER XLVI  FRANCES to HENRY   THERE is no News in this Town  but what  to be sure  you have heard before  that — is gone off with —  I pity her extremely  for  as she is very pretty  and very young  she has probably a long and shocking Scene to go thro   Had she erred with any other Man  she might have the common Excuse of being deceived  of a Dependance upon his Honour   c  But she abandons herself to the ilest Infamy    Who swells the Triumph of known Perjury     If a Woman is tempted to forfeit her own Character  she ought  at least  to take Care that the Man has some Character to lose  so as  tho  she becomes a private Victim  she shall not be made a publick Sacrifice  If I was to do an Act  which I could not justify to the World  I would  at least  take Care to have something to excuse me to myself  But poor Miss — has nothing of all this to palliate her Indiscretion  for she has  as Young movingly expresses it    Set out to Sea upon a shatter d Plank   And puts her Trust in Miracles for Safety     I feel a mortified Pride and Indignation upon all Occasions like this  as I suppose you Men do  when you hear the Story of a Coward  lest   76 it should bring a Reflection upon human Nature in general  for Custom  tho  not Ethicks  or Religion  has put Courage in your Sex  and Chastity in ours  upon the same Footing  How inequitable a Law that is  may be proved from this one Consideration  That you have but seldom any Occasion of exerting your imaginary Point of Honour  while poor weak Women may have  every Day  an Enemy to combat  either within  or without  and sometimes  hard Fate  may be attacked by both at once   Some French Writer says    Qu elle est a plaindre  qui à au meme témps  L amour  et la Vertu   but I say more justly   Qu elle est a plaindre  qui à que L amour seulemen▪    I am ashamed at having ceded so much in this Argument  but there is no disguising our Sentiments to you Natural Philosophers  and  to those who are acquainted with the Frame of human Nature  I think it prudent to own the Truth  lest our Actions might be deemed as disingenuous  as our Words  which puts me
