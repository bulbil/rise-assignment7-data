messengers of Lord William  who had landed on the coast  of Cornwall  and was soon to resume the possession of his castle  the  information they had receive on their way of the nuptials of the  Countess had filled them with consternation  three of them had resolved  to return and convey this intelligence to their Lord  whilst an equal  number now  hastened forward  if possible to prevent so fata a purpose — Behold    said he  pointing downwards from the window which commanded a sull view  of the castle gates         their speed hath equalled mine  and they are now entering         —Grey rushed out  and ordered the domestic to follow  He received the  unwelcome guests with an appearance of respect  They were conducted to  an apartment  and entertained with due courtesy by the man who had  brought the news of their arrival  and who now had strict charge  that  for a while they should be kept from any intercourse or conference with  the other attendants   A small ray of hope seemed to dart through the gloom which had possessed  the mind of Grey  when he found that Lord William himself was not yet  arrived  A little respite seemed of moment  as it allowed him to  reflect  and to concert his suture measures  At first  he thought of  abandoning his Lord  and securing himself by flight  but although  Raymond should not be able to revenge such desertion  the power and  resentment of Lord Hubert were terrible  and could not fail to destroy  him  Gay hopes of sharing in the riches of this great house of  Salisbury  had long possessed his imagination  and he now felt the most  implacable hatred of the man who was approaching to defeat these gay  hopes  His malice and his fears conspired to recommend the most  desperate course of action  He resolved to make one daring effort more   and  if possible  still to establish the pretensions of his master  and  to remove his rival by a bold assassination     In such dispositions did this wicked minion return to his Lord  He found  him sunk in despair  and tortured with distraction  Scarcely had he  begun to speak  when Raymond  starting up in frantic emotion  seized  upon him with dreadful menaces of vengeance  as the treacherous  murderer of his honour and his peace  and curst himself and his vile  seducer in all the bitterness of remorse  Reginhald fled  and sought to  hide himself from the terror of his resentment  Grey   without the least expostulation  the least attempt to allay the fury of  his Lord  suffered the violence of passion to take its free course  and  to waste its force in fruitless execrations  And soon was the storm  allayed  and Raymond as if recovering from a sudden phrenzy  softened  into grief and tenderness condemned his own extravagance  and  entreated his favourite to advise  direct  and extricate him from this  difficult and dangerous situation     Grey neither endeavoured to palliate the disgrace  nor to lessen the  danger  which his lord dreaded  He observed that Raymond had indeed  proceeded so far as to leave no doubt that he had disregarded the  conditions imposed by the King  and had attempted the most lawless acts  of oppression  His own part in these transactions he represented as the  effects of his unbounded zeal for the service of his master  a zeal  which threatened to involve him in the fatal consequences of an injured  husband s vengeance  Such discourse only served to irritate the pain  which Raymond felt   Is there no way to retreat with honour   cried  he   no  nor with safety   returned his minion         Let us not think of retreat  We are engaged  and must pursue our  purpose  You wonder  but the way is obvious  and there is but one way   Perhaps this husband comes but slightly attended  you have Knights and  men of arms  Nay  start not  Shall we tamely hold our throats  and  receive death from him  No  this arm shall prevent the blow         —Raymond had long been accustomed to resign himself to the guidance of  this favourite  by him he had been gradually led on from one excess to  the other  and so thoroughly was his mind prepared to receive the very  worst impressions   such is the fatal consequence of the first deviation  from virtue  that  instead of trembling at this last proposal  he seemed  only sollicitous to know the surest means of effecting it —And  here  again  the favourite assumed that superiority which the pliant temper of  his Lord  and an intimate acquaintance with his weakness and unjust  designs  had given him  He desired that all future measures should be entrusted  to him  that from him the attendants should be directed to receive their  orders  Raymond acquiesced  yet not without the utmost anxiety  and  most melancholy presages  His retirement
