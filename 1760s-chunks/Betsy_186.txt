cried that lady in some surprize   Yes  upon my   honour   resumed he   the gentleman I mean had not left me above a   quarter of an hour before you came in  and I can tell you is one whom   you know     If I know him   replied she  after a pause   I fancy I need   not be at any loss to guess his name  by the description you have given   me of him  for I have seen no man  since my coming to town  who so well   deserves those encomiums as Mr  Trueworth     I am glad you think so     said Sir Bazil   for I am certain your judgment will go a great way with   Harriot  he is  in fact  the person I have been speaking of  and is so   every way deserving of my sister s affection  that she must not only be   the most insensible creature in the world  but also the greatest enemy   to her own interest and happiness to refuse him        He then repeated to her all the conversation he had had that morning   with Mr  Trueworth  the answers that gentleman had given him on the   proposition he had made on Mrs  Blanchfield s account  his declaration   of his passion for Miss Harriot  and every other particular  excepting   that of the non payment of her fortune  and that he concealed only   because he would not be suspected to have been bribed by it to say more   of his friend than he really merited       Mrs  Wellair was equally charmed and astonished at this report  and  on   Sir Bazil s telling her that Mr  Trueworth was under some apprehensions   that the pleasure she took in having her sister with her would be an   impediment to his desires  she very gravely replied  that she was very   sorry Mr  Trueworth should imagine she was so wanting in understanding    or true affection to her sister  as  for the self satisfaction of her   company  to offer any thing in opposition to her interest or happiness       After this they had a good deal of discourse together  concerning Mr    Trueworth s family and fortune  the particulars of both which Sir Bazil   was very well acquainted with  and Mrs  Wellair  being thoroughly   convinced  by what he said of the many advantages of the alliance   proposed  assured him  in the strongest terms she was able  that she   would do every thing in her power to promote it        I will entertain her on this subject while we are dressing   said she     your pleasantry on this white damask will furnish me with an excellent   pretence  I shall begin in the same strain you did  and then proceed to   a serious narrative of all you have been telling me relating to Mr    Trueworth  to which I shall add my own sentiments of the amiableness of   his person  parts  and accomplishments  and set before her eyes  in the   light it deserves  the generosity of his passion  in refusing so great a   fortune as Mrs  Blanchfield for her sake  and the respectfulness of it    in not daring to declare himself till he had engaged the only two who   may be supposed to have any influence over her  in favour of his suit         I know   said Sir Bazil   that you women are the fittest to deal with   one another  therefore  as I see you are hearty in the cause  shall   wholly depend on your management  but  hark ye  sister   continued he    perceiving she was going out of the room   I have one more thing to   add  I am to meet Trueworth at the chocolate house this evening  he will   be impatient for the success of the promise I have made him  now you   know we shall have a great deal of company at dinner to day  and I may   not have an opportunity of speaking to you in private before the time of   my going to him  for that reason we must have some watch word between   us  that may give an intimation in general how Harriot receives what you   have said to her         Oh  that is easy   cried Mrs  Wellair   as thus  you shall take an   occasion  either at table  or any time when you find it most proper  to   ask me how I do  and by my answer to that question  you will be able to   judge what success I have had     Very right   replied Sir Bazil   and I   will be sure to observe
