acquainted with them  and it is  in a great measure  on account of that very young lady  that I have quitted England —You must know  Sir   continued the communicative baronet   that I am a near neighbour of the Mildmays  and have    182 for above four years  entertained a passion of the most extravagant nature for their daughter—but somehow  though my fortune was as good as any other admirer s  and my proposals much more advantageous  still some freedoms which I had taken with the women  created unsurmountable objections to my character  and my addresses were rejected with a degree of disrespect that gave me no little mortification  Stung with resentment at the cavalier manner in which I was treated  and burning also to obtain Miss Mildmay  I made a fruitless attempt to carry her off —In some time after the failure of this design  one Sir Robert Harold   possibly the gentleman you mean  sir   commenced an acquaintance at Bath with Miss Mildmay  and worked himself so successfully into her affections  that a day was set apart for   183 the celebration of their nuptials  though this happy lover was  to the full  as great a profligate as myself  The family  however  paid dear for the preference which they gave this gentleman  for  before the wedding day  Sir Robert found means to gain the last favour from Miss Mildmay  and a quarrel happening between them immediately after  the intended bridegroom fairly took his leave  and left the disdainful Louisa to feel  in turn  every sting of disappointment  and every pungency of disgrace       Miss Mildmay on this was instantly sent to town  to the house of a relation  one Mrs  Darnel  and  as I had my spies continually at work  I found out at once the place of her destination  and followed her instantly  being still so ridiculously besotted  that her affair with Harold no way   184 lessened either the excess of my love  or the extravagance of my veneration  In fact  what would have damped the ardour of any other man s passion  only served to increase the fervour of mine  so that  instead of thinking to possess her on the same terms with that lucky dog Harold  I was uncommonly desirous of making her mine for ever  I wanted to be sure of her  and  notwithstanding I had a thousand times ridiculed other fellows  for scandalously stooping to patch up a cracked reputation  still I went on  as if her character had been unblemished  and felt infinitely more uneasiness on account of her prepossession for the destroyer of her honour  than for her actual deviation from the sentiments of virtue —But I beg your pardon   cried Hastings  interrupting himself   I am trespassing on your leisure  by a dull repetition   185 of an affair  which cannot possibly afford you the smallest entertainment  People are apt to teize others with those circumstances which affect their own peace  and I never hear Miss Mildmay s name mentioned  but what I am for entering into an account of my passion for her  and a narrative of my various disappointments      O  Sir   replied I    you cannot oblige me more  than by indulging yourself on the subject  I am extremely entertained by relations of this nature  and  if there is no particular secret   — Secret  Sir   returned my brother baronet—  O there is no secret—I dare say  by this time  every thing is public enough in England  and therefore I can have no objection to gratify your curiosity  since such a gratification is the highest pleasure I can do myself  You must   186 know  Sir  that Miss Mildmay had scarcely arrived at her cousin Darnel s  when the prevailing rethoric of one thousand guineas  and a five hundred pound annuity for life  prevailed upon the worthy relation to deliver her into my hands  The price  extravagant as it was  I did not matter sixpence  but it seems the unconscionable Jezabel was to receive something very handsome from Harold s sister  lady Haversham  for contriving a method of removing those inconveniencies to which the beautiful delinquent might be exposed  during her absence from her family  such as want of equi  and other essential articles —These  lady Haversham  as Harold s sister  could not be seen immediately to furnish  as Miss Mildmay s delicacy would be alarmed  and as Mrs  Darnel s circumstances were narrow  she was to   187 receive a secret sufficiency for the purpose  and to be properly considered for her politeness into the bargain  This was the reason why she insisted upon the exorbitant terms I have mentioned —But enough of terms—let it satisfy  therefore  that she contrived a feasible excuse to leave Louisa alone one evening—that the servants were all sent out of the way  and that  with the assistance of four or five friends  who were provided in case of accidents  I carried her off to a house which I had at Hampstead  and kept her there for full seven months     Now  Melmoth  see my astonishing command of temper— Seven months   interrupted I  so calmly—   Well
