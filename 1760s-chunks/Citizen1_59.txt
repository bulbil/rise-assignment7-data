to one who had lost the power of distinguishing colours  General directions are therefore commonly useless  and to be particular would exhaust volumes  since each individual may require a peculiar system of precepts to direct his choice   Every mind seems capable of entertaining a certain quantity of happiness  which no institutions can encrease  no circumstances alter  and entirely independent on fortune  Let any man compare his present fortune with the past  and he will probably find himself  upon the whole  neither better nor worse than formerly   Gratified ambition  or irreparable calamity may produce transient sensations of pleasure or distress  Those storms may discompose in proportion as they are strong  or the mind is pliant to their impression  But the soul  though at first lifted up by the event  is every day operated upon with diminish d influence  and at length subsides into the level of its usual tranquility Should some unexpected turn of fortune take thee from fetters  and place thee on a throne  exultation would be natural upon   186 the change  but the temper  like the face  would soon resume its native serenity   Every wish therefore which leads us to expect happiness somewhere else but where we are  every institution which teaches us that we should be better  by being possessed of something new  which promises to lift us a step higher than we are  only lays a foundation for uneasiness  because it contracts debts which it cannot repay  it calls that a good  which when we have found it  will in fact add nothing to our happiness   To enjoy the present  without regret for the past  or solicitude for the future  has been the advice rather of poets than philosophers  And yet the precept seems more rational than is generally imagined  It is the only general precept respecting the pursuit of happiness  that can be applied with propriety to every condition of life  The man of pleasure  the man of business  and the philosopher are equally interested in its disquisition  If we do not find happiness in the present moment  in what shall we find it  Either in reflecting on the past  or prognosticating the future  But let us see how these are capable of producing satisfaction   A remembrance of what is past  and an anticipation of what is to come  seem to be the two faculties by which man differs most from other animals  Though brutes enjoy them in a limited degree  yet their whole life seems taken up in the present  regardless of the past and the future  Man  on the contrary  endeavours to derive his   187 happiness  and experiences most of his miseries from these two sources   Is this superiority of reflection a prerogative of which we should boast  and for which we shall thank nature  or is it a misfortune of which we should complain and be humble  Either from the abuse  or from the nature of things  it certainly makes our condition more miserable   Had we a privilege of calling up  by the power of memory  only such passages as were pleasing  unmixed with such as were disagreeable  we might then excite at pleasure an ideal happiness  perhaps more poignant than actual sensation  But this is not the case  the past is never represented without some disagreeable circumstance  which tarnishes all its beauty  the remembrance of an evil carries in it nothing agreeable  and to remember a good is always accompanied with regret  Thus we lose more than we gain by remembrance   And we shall find our expectation of the future to be a gift more distressful even than the former  To fear an approaching evil is certainly a most disagreeable sensation  and in expecting an approaching good  we experience the inquietude of of wanting actual possession   Thus  whichever way we look  the prospect is disagreeable  Behind  we have left pleasures we shall never more enjoy  and therefore regret  and before  we see pleasures which we languish to possess  and are consequently uneasy till we possess them  Was there any method of seizing   188 the present  unimbittered by such reflections  then would our state be tolerably easy   This  indeed  is the endeavour of all mankind  who untutored by philosophy  pursue as much as they can a life of amusement and dissipation  Every rank in life  and every size of understanding  seems to follow this alone  or not pursuing it  deviates from happiness  The man of pleasure pursues dissipation by profession  the man of business pursues it not less  as every voluntary labour he undergoes is only dissipation in disguise  The philosopher himself  even while he reasons upon the subject  does it unknowingly with a view of dissipating the thoughts of what he was  or what he must be   The subject therefore comes to this  Which is the most perfect sort of dissipation  pleasure  business  or philosophy  which best serves to exclude those uneasy sensations  which memory or anticipation produce   The enthusiasm of pleasure charms only by intervals  The highest rapture lasts only for a moment  and all the senses seem so combined  as to be soon tired into languor by the gratification of any one of them  It is only among the poets we hear of men
