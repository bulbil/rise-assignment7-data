 when they were overtaken by another genius  who  with a precipitate pace seem d travelling the same way  He was instantly known by the other to be the genius of Probability  He wore two wide extended wings at his back    156 which incessantly waved  without increasing the rapidity of his motion  his countenance betrayed a confidence that the ignorant might mistake for sincerity  and he had but one eye  which was fixed in the middle of his forehead   Servant of Hormizda  cried he  approaching the mortal pilgrim  if thou art travelling to the Land of Certainty  how is it possible to arrive there under the guidance of a genius  who proceeds forward so slowly  and is so little acquainted with the way  follow me  we shall soon perform the journey to where every pleasure awaits our arrival   The peremptory tone in which this genius spoke  and the speed with which he moved forward  induced the traveller to change his conductor  and leaving his modest companion behind  he proceeded forward with his more confident director  seeming not a little pleased at the encreased velocity of his motion   But soon he found reasons to repeat  Whenever a torrent crossed their way  his guide taught him to despise the obstacle by plunging him in  whenever a precipice presented  he was directed to fling himself forward  Thus each moment miraculously escaping  his repeated escapes only served to encrease his guide s temerity  He led him therefore forward  amidst infinite difficulties  till they arrived at the borders of an ocean which appeared unnavigable from the black mists that lay upon its surface  It s unquiet waves were of the darkest hue  and gave a lively representation of the various agitations of the human mind     157The genius of Probability now confessed his temerity  own d his being an improper guide to the Land of Certainty  a country where no mortal had ever been permitted to arrive  but at the same time offered to supply the traveller with another conductor  who should carry him to the Land of Confiden•e  a region where the inhabitants lived with the utmost tranquillity  and tasted almost as much satisfaction as if in the Land of Certainty  Not waiting for a reply  he stamp d three times on the ground  and called forth the Daemon of Error  a gloomy fiend of the servants of Arimanes  The yawning earth gave up the reluctant savage  who seemed unable to bear the light of the day  His stature was enormous  his colour black and hideous  his aspect betrayed a thousand varying passions  and he spread forth pinions that were fitted for the most rapid slight The traveller at first was shocked at the spectre  but finding him obedient to superior power  he assumed his former tranquillity   I have called you to duty  cries the genius to the daemon  to bear on your back a son of mortality over the Ocean of Doubts into the Land of Confidence  I expect you ll perform your commission with punctuality  And as for you  continued the genius  addressing the traveller  when once I have bound this fillet round your eyes  let no voice of persuasion  nor threats the most terrifying  persuade you to unbind it in order to look round  keep the fillet fast  look not at the ocean below  and you may certainly expect to arrive at a region of pleasure     158Thus saying  and the traveller s eyes being covered  the daemon muttering curses  raised him on his back  and instantly up borne by his strong pinions  directed his flight among the clouds  Neither the loudest thunder  nor the most angry tempest  could persuade the traveller to unbind his eyes  The daemon directed his flight downwards  and skimmed the surface of the ocean  a thousand voices  some with loud invective  others in the sarcastic tones of contempt  vainly endeavoured to persuade him to look round  but he still continued to keep his eyes covered  and would in all probability have arrived at the happy land  had not flattery effected what other means could not perform  For now he heard himself welcomed on every side to the promised land  and an universal shout of joy was sent forth at his safe arrival  the wearied traveller  desirous of seeing the long wished for country  at length pulled the fillet from his eyes  and ventured to look round him  But he had unloosed the band too soon  he was not yet above half way over  The daemon  who was still hovering in the air  and had produced those sounds only in order to deceive  was now freed from his commission  wherefore throwing the astonished traveller from his back  the unhappy youth fell headlong into the subjacent Ocean of Doubts  from whence he never after was seen to rise     159  LETTER XXXVII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   WHEN Parmenio  the Grecian  had done something which excited an universal shout from the surrounding multitude  he was instantly struck with the doubt  that what had their approbation must certainly be wrong  and turning to a philosopher who stood near him  Pray sir  says he  pardon me  I fear I have been
