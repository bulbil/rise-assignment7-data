how little am I  in my own eyes  The Lady will still be his  She must  She shall  She will change her mind  So earnest he  So fervently in love with him  she  Who will presume to hope a place in his affections after her  My pride  my dear  is all up  Can I  How mean will any one now appear in his eyes  when he thinks of his Clementina  And who can be contented with half a heart  Nay  not half a one  if he does justice to this wonder of a woman  It was always my consolation  when I looked upon him as lost to myself  that it was to a person of superior merit   But who can forbear pitying the glorious man  O my dear  I am lost in the subject  I know not what to say  Were I to tell you what I thought  what were my emotions  as I read now his generous pity for the Count of Belvedere—Now his affectionate and Page  205 respectful address to the noble Lady—Her agitations of mind  previous to the delivery of her paper to him—That paper  the contents so greatly surpassing all that I had read of woman  Yet so much of a piece with the conduct she shewed  when the struggle between her Religion and her Love cost her her reason  His delicacy  yet equal steadiness  in his religion—In short  the whole of his conduct and hers  in the various lights in which they appeared in the different conversations with her  with her family—Were I to tell you  I say  what I thought  and what were my emotions  as I read  a volume would not be sufficient  nor know I what measure would contain my tears  Suffice it to say  that I was not able to rise in two days and nights  and it has been with the greatest difficulty  that I obtained pen and ink  and leave to write  and the physician talks of confining me to my chamber for a week to come   Sir Charles cries out upon suspence  Indeed it is a grievous thing   You will observe  that in these last Letters he mentions me but once  and that is  in making me a compliment on the favour which the beloved Four conferred upon me  and all of us  in the visit you were so good as to make us  And why do you think I take notice of this —Not from petulance  I assure you  But for the praise of his justice as well as delicacy  For could Sir Charles Grandison excusably  if  on other occasions he remembred the poor girl whom he rescued  could he excusably  I say  while his soul was agitated by his own suspence  occasioned by the uncommon greatness of Clementina s behaviour  think of any other woman in the world   But you see  my Charlotta  that the excellent man has been  perhaps is  greatly indisposed  Can we wonder at it  Such a prize in view  so many difficulties overcome  as he had to struggle with  yet  at last  a seemingly insuperable one arising from the Lady herself  Page  206 and from motives that increased his admiration of her  But a woman may be eloquent  from grief and disappointment  when a man  though his nobler heart is torn in pieces  must hardly complain —How do I pity the distresses of a manly heart   But should this noble Lady  on his return to Bologna  after a month s absence  hold her purpose  unless he changes his religion  I will tell you my thoughts of what will probably be the result  He will not marry at all  If he cannot love another woman  as well as he does Clementina  ought he  And who can equally deserve his Love  Have we not heard from himself  as well as from Dr  Bartlett  that all the troubles he has had  have proceeded from our Sex  It is true  that men and women can hardly ever have any great troubles  but what must arise from each other  And his have arisen from good women too  I hope Lady Olivia is not deliberately bad   And why should so good a man continue to make himself subject to the petulance  to the foibles  of us wayward women  who hardly know our own minds  as Signor Jeronymo told his friend  when our wishes are in our power   But  sick or well  you see Sir Charles Grandison loses not his spirit  His enlarged heart can rejoice in the happiness of his friends  I will have joy  said he once to me  And must he not have it in the hopes of the recovery of his friend Jeronymo  In the restoration of the admirable Clementina  And in the happiness those recoveries must give to a worthy and illustrious family  Let me enumerate  from him  the pleasure he enjoys  in the felicity he has given to many  tho  he cannot be  in himself  the happy person he makes others  Is he not delighted with the happiness of Lord and Lady W   Of his Beauchamp  and his Beauchamp s father and mother —Of Lady Mansfield  and her family
