ready to obey     Harold Harefoot and Hardicanute  his Danish successors  were unworthy of him  the first is remarkable for no virtue  and the latter is distinguished  principally  for his cruelty and avarice  This last  dying suddenly  at a feast  left the Danish race of Kings so hated  by their exactions and impositions on the people  that Edward  sirnamed the Confessor  of the Saxon race  found  both from Danes and Saxons  an easy accession to the crown   Thus expired  not only the dominion  but all attempts or invasions of the Danes for the future  Though their ravages had continued for above two hundred years  yet they left no change of laws  customs  language  or religion  The many castles they had built  and the many families they left behind them  served alone to discover the places of their establishment  After the accession of Edward the Confessor to the crown  the English and Danes  as if wearied with mutual slaughter  united to support his government  and  peaceably living amongst each other  formed ever after but one people   The reign of Edward the Confessor was long and happy  He had lived long in Normandy  and  in some measure  adopted the language and learning of that country  His wars were successful  both in Scotland and Wales  though managed   52 by his leaders  and without his personal attendance  The easiness of his disposition  however  together with his credulity and superstition  paved the way for another invasion of his country  as if the English were destined to be governed only by foreign masters   The Earl Godwin  by whose interest Edward had come to the crown  exerted all his influence to establish his own son  Harold  as his successor  This too powerful subject pretended to be much displeased at the favour shewn  by the King  to the Norman nobility  who came over  in numbers  to the English court  These discontents at length produced an insurrection  Edward  now grown old  and indolent by nature  undertook to oppose those disorders  rather by negotiations than arms  Treating with rebels is a certain method of increasing their power  by this means Harold gained  by degrees  the authority he contended for  and had power sufficient to settle the succession upon himself   While Edward was thus leaving his earthly kingdom to contention and misery  he was  in the mean time  busily employed in gaining  as he imagined  an heavenly one  It was not sufficient for him to aspire to all the virtues necessary for carrying him to heaven  he desired to be reckoned a saint of the first order  He pretended to several revelations  was possessed of the gift of prophecy  and was the first who touched for those scrophulous disorders  which  from hence  have been denominated the King s Evil  But what gained him a distinguished place among the saints  was his continence  his refraining from the woman to whom he was actually married  It is said he espoused the beautiful Editha  purely to exercise his   53 virtues  by withstanding a continual temptation  This  as we may suppose  left her to sterility  and thus his leaving no issue was the cause of numberless miseries which fell upon the kingdom soon after   Edward  as I observed  had no children  He seemed  however  desirous of leaving the crown to his nephew Edgar Atheling  but  distrusting his weakness to defend this title  and knowing the strength of Harold  his opponent  he left the succession undecided  It is probable  however  this weak Monarch was no way sollicitous who succeeded in a government which he seemed himself to despise   I am   c   LETTER IX   UPON the death of Edward  Harold now alledged that he was appointed  by will  his successor  This was no more than what the people of England had expected long before  his pretensions were believed by some  and allowed by all  He had some right to a crown  hitherto elective  from his private virtues  and he confirmed his rights by the most irresistible argument  his power  Thus this Monarch came to the throne by the most equitable of all titles  I mean  the consent of the people   His exaltation seemed only to be the commencement of his calamities  His first trouble was from his own brother  who  being the elder  obtained assistance from Norway to set up a title to the English crown  Harold immediately levied a numerous army  and marched to meet the Norwegians    54 who  with a vast force  had overrun all the northern parts of the kingdom  and had committed incredible devastation  Both armies soon joined battle  the Norwegians  for some time  bravely defended a bridge which lay between them  but  at length  the valour of the English surmounted every obstacle  Harold passed the bridge  renewed the assault  and  after an obstinate resistance  entirely routed the invaders  There had never before been seen in England an engagement between two such numerous armies  each having no less than threescore thousand men  The news of this victory diffused the greatest joy over the whole
