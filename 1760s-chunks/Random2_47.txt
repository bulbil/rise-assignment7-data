throwing away my fire  desiring him to ask his life  or prepare for another world —but this stout Hibernian refused to condescend  and complained bitterly of my having quitted my ground before he could return my shot  saying I ought to go back to my station  and let him have an equal chance with me —I endeavoured to persuade him that I had given him a double chance already  and it was my business to prevent him from enjoying a third —but now  since I had an opportunity  I demanded a parley  and desired to know his condition  and reason for calling me to the field  who  to the best of my remembrance  so far from having done him any injury  had never before seen him —He told me  that he was a gentleman of fortune  who had spent all he had  and hearing that Melinda had got ten thousand pounds  he intended to make himself master of that sum by espousing her  and was determined  in an honourable way  to cut the throats of all those who stood between him and his hopes —I then demanded to know the foundation of his hopes  and now that I had seen him  being more and more astonished at the circumstance of the promise  desired he would explain that mystery —He gave me to understand  that he trusted entirely to his birth and personal merit  that he had frequently wrote to Melinda  setting forth his claim and pretensions  but she was never kind enough to send an answer  or even to admit him into her presence  and that the promise he mentioned in his letter  was made by his friend Mr  Gaghagan  who assured him  that no woman   135 could resist a man of his appearance —I could not forbear laughing to excess  at the simplicity of my rival  who did not seem to relish my mirth  but began to be very serious  Upon which I endeavoured to appease him  by giving him my word and honour  that so far from prejudicing his addresses to the lady  I would represent him to her in the most favourable light I could  with any regard to truth  but he must not be surprized if she should remain blind to his deserts  for nothing was more capricious than a woman s mind  and the affection of that sex was seldom purchased with virtue alone —That my declaration might have the better effect  I took notice of his dishabille  and professing sorrow at seeing a gentleman reduced  slipt two guineas into his hand  at the sight of which  he threw away his pistols  and hugging me in his arms  cried    Arrah  by Jesus  now  you are the best friend I have met with these seven long years  —  When I had suffered some minutes in his embrace  he quitted me  and picking up his rusty arms  wished the devil might burn him if ever he should give me any further trouble about woman kind     The quarrel being thus amicably composed  I begged leave to look at his pistols  which I found so crazy and so foul  that  I believe  it was happy for him neither of them was discharged  for one of them would certainly have split in the going off  and he would  in all probability  have lost his hand in the explosion  but what gave me a lively idea of the man s character  was to find  upon examination  that one of them had been loaded without being primed  and the other primed without a charge     136 While we walked homeward together  I expressed a desire of knowing my new friend s history  and he informed me of his having served in the German army as a volunteer against the Turks  that for his behaviour at the siege of Belgrade  he had been honoured with an ensign s commission  and afterwards promoted to the rank of lieutenant  in which station  it was his misfortune to affront his captain  who challenged him to the field  and was killed in the duel  upon which he was obliged to retreat —that he had been in England some years solliciting his friends for provision in the British army  but being hitherto unsuccessful  he was desired by Mr  Gaghagan to turn his thoughts to matrimony  and make his fortune by an advantageous match  in consequence of which advice  he had made up to Melinda  and having heard  by means of an Irish footman in the family  that I was her chief favourite  had called me out in hopes of removing by my death  the greatest obstruction to his desires  but now he was convinced of my honour and generosity  he swore by the blessed Virgin  he would think of her no more  if there was not another woman in the world —As a further proof of his veracity  which I did not at all doubt  he opened an old iron snuff box  and pulled out his commission in the imperial army  and his captain s challenge  which he preserved as testimonials of his character —I was so well convinced of this poor man s honesty and courage  that I determined to speak in his behalf to some of my acquaintance  who might recommend his case to the consideration of those who could
