who thus have some little faithful attendant  who never forsakes them  but prepares to wrangle and to praise against every opposer  at once ready to encrease their pride while living  and their character when dead  For you and I  my friend  who have no humble admirer thus to attend us  we  who neither are  nor ever will be great men  and who do not much care whether we are great men or no  at least let us strive to be honest men  and to have common sense   LETTER LXXII  To the same   THERE are numbers in this city who live by writing new books  and yet there are thousands of volumes in every large library unread and forgotten  This  upon my arrival  was one of those contradictions which I was unable to account for  Is it possible  said I  that there should be any demand for new books  before those already published are read  Can there be so many employed in producing a commodity with which the market is already overstocked  and with goods also better than any of modern manufacture   What at first view appeared an inconsistence  is a proof at once of this people s wisdom and refinement  Even allowing the works of their ancestors better written than theirs  yet those of the moderns   45 acquire a real value  by being marked with the impression of the times  Antiquity has been in the possession of others  the present is our own  let us first therefore learn to know what belongs to ourselves  and then  if we have leisure  cast our reflections back to the reign of Shonou  who governed twenty thousand years before the creation of the moon   The volumes of antiquity  like medals  may very well serve to amuse the curious  but the works of the moderns  like the current coin of a kingdom  are much better for immediate use  the former are often prized above their intrinsic value  and kept with care  the latter seldom pass for more than they are worth  and are often subject to the merciless hands of sweating critics  and clipping compilers  the works of antiquity were ever praised  those of the moderns read  the treasures of our ancestors have our esteem  and we boast the passion  those of cotemporary genius engage our heart  although we blush to own it  The visits we pay the former resemble those we pay the great  the ceremony is troublesome  and yet such as we would not chuse to forego  our acquaintance with modern books  is like sitting with a friend  our pride is not flattered in the interview  but it gives more internal satisfaction   In proportion as society refines  new books must ever become more necessary  Savage rusticity is reclaimed by oral admonition alone  but the elegant excesses of refinement are best corrected by the still voice of studious enquiry  In a polite age  almost every person becomes a reader  and receives more instruction from the press than the pulpit  The preaching Bonse may instruct the illiterate   46 peasant  but nothing less than the insinuating address of a fine writer can win its way to an heart already relaxed in all the effeminacy of refinement  Books are necessary to correct the vices of the polite  but those vices are ever changing  and the antidote should be changed accordingly  should still be new   Instead therefore of thinking the number of new publications here too great  I could wish it still greater  as they are the most useful instruments of reformation  Every country must be instructed either by writers or preachers  but as the number of readers encreases  the number of hearers is proportionably diminished  the writer becomes more useful  and the preaching Bonse less necessary   Instead  therefore  of complaining that writers are overpaid  when their works procure them a bare subsistance  I should imagine it the duty of a state not only to encourage their numbers  but their industry  A Bonse is rewarded with immense riches for instructing only a few  even of the most ignorant  of the people  and sure the poor scholar should not beg his bread  who is capable of instructing a million   Of all rewards  I grant  the most pleasing to a man of real merit  is fame  but a polite age  of all times  is that in which scarce any share of merit can acquire it  What numbers of fine writers in the latter empire of Rome  when refinement was carried to the highest pitch  have missed that fame and immortality which they had fondly arrogated to themselves  How many Greek authors  who wrote at that period when Constantinople was   47 the refined mistress of the empire  now rest either not printed  or not read  in the libraries of Europe  Those who came first  while either state as yet was barbarous  carried all the reputation away  Authors  as the age refined  became more numerous  and their numbers destroyed their fame  It is but natural  therefore  for the writer  when conscious that his works will not procure him fame hereafter  to endeavour to make them turn out to his temporal interest here   Whatever be the motives which induce men to write  whether avarice or fame  the
