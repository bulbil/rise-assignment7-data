submission  At sight of me he wept  nor did I  behold his tears unmoved  My heart was overcharged with tenderness and  sorrow  for having offended such an indulgent parent  so that I mingled  my tears with his  while my dear husband  whose soul was of the softest  and gentlest mould  melted with sympathy at the affecting scene  Being  thus reconciled to my father  we attended him into the country  where  we were received by my mother  who was a sensible good woman  though  not susceptible to love  and therefore less apt to excuse a weakness  to which she was an utter stranger  This was likewise the case with an  uncle  from whom I had great expectations  He was a plain good natured  man  and treated us with great courtesy  though his notions  in point  of love  were not exactly conformable to ours  Nevertheless  I was   and seemed to be so happy in my choice  that my family not only became  satisfied with the match  but exceedingly fond of Lord W      After a short stay with them in the country  we returned to London  in  order to be introduced at court  and then set out for the north  on a  visit to my brother in law the duke of H    who had  by a letter to Lord  W    invited us to his habitation  My father accordingly equipped us  with horses and money  for our own finances were extremely slender   consisting only of a small pension  allowed by his grace  upon whom  the brothers were entirely dependent  the father having died suddenly   before suitable provision could be made for his younger children    When I took leave of my relations  bidding adieu to my paternal home   and found myself launching into a world of care and trouble  though the  voyage on which I embarked was altogether voluntary  and my companion  the person on whom I doted to distraction   I could not help feeling  some melancholy sensations  which  however  in a little time  gave way  to a train of more agreeable ideas  I was visited in town by almost  all the women of fashion  many of whom  I perceived  envied me the  possession of a man who had made strange havoc among their hearts  and  some of them knew the value of his favour  One in particular endeavoured  to cultivate my friendship with singular marks of regard  but I thought  proper to discourage her advances  by keeping within the bounds of bare  civility  and  indeed  to none of them was I lavish of my complaisance   for I dedicated my whole time to the object of my affection  who  engrossed my wishes to such a degree  that  although I was never  jealous  because I had no reason to be so  I envied the happiness of  every woman whom he chanced at any time to hand into a coach    The duchess of     who was newly married to the earl of P    a  particular friend of Lord W   s  carried me to court  and presented  me to the queen  who expressed her approbation of my person in very  particular terms  and  observing the satisfaction that appeared in  my countenance  with marks of admiration  desired her ladies to take  notice  how little happiness depended upon wealth  since there was more  joy in my face than in all her court besides    Such a declaration could not fail to overwhelm me with blushes  which    6 22 15  3 45 PM   her Majesty seemed to behold with pleasure  for she frequently repeated  the remark  and showed me to all the foreigners of distinction  with  many gracious expressions of favour  She wished Lord W   happiness  instead of joy  and was pleased to promise  that she would provide for  her pretty beggars  And poor enough we certainly were in every article  but love  Nevertheless  we felt no necessities  but passed the summer  in a variety of pleasures and parties  the greatest part of which were  planned by Lord W   s sister and another lady  who was at that time  mistress to the prime minister  The first was a wit  but homely in  person  the other a woman of great beauty and masculine understanding   and a particular friendship subsisted between them  though they were  both lovers of power and admiration    This lady  who sat at the helm  was extremely elegant  as well  as expensive in her diversions  in many of which we bore a share   particularly in her parties upon the water  which were contrived in all  the magnificence of taste  In the course of these amusements  a trifling  circumstance occurred  which I shall relate as an instance of that  jealous sensibility which characterised Lord W   s disposition  A large  company of ladies and gentlemen having agreed to dine at Vauxhall  and  sup at Marble hall  where
