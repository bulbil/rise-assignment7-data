you have seen the poor hardly earn the little reputation they acquired  and their merit only acknowledged when they were incapable of enjoying the pleasures of popularity  such  however  is the reputation worth possessing  that which is hardly earned is hardly lost   Adieu     121  LETTER XCI  From Hingpo in Moscow  to Lien Chi Altangi in London   WHERE will my disappointments end  Must I still be doomed to accuse the severity of my fortune  and shew my constancy in distress rather than moderation in prosperity  I had at least hopes of conveying my charming companion safe from the reach of every enemy  and of again restoring her to her native soil  But those hopes are now no more   Upon leaving Terki  we took the nearest road to the dominions of Russia  We passed the Ural mountains covered in eternal snow  and traversed the forests of Ufa  where the prowling bear and shrieking hyena keep an undisputed possession  We next embarked upon the rapid river Bulija  and made the best of our way to the banks of the Wolga  where it waters the fruitful valleys of Casan   There were two vessels in company properly equipped and armed in order to oppose the Wolga pyrates  who we were informed infested this river  Of all mankind these pyrates are the most terrible  They are composed of the criminals and outlawed peasants of Russia  who fly to the forests that lie along the banks of the Wolga for protection  Here they join in parties  lead a savage life  and have no other subsistence but plunder  Being deprived of houses  friends  or a fixed habitation  they become more terrible even than the tyger  and as insensible   122 to all the feelings of humanity  They neither give quarter to those they conquer  nor receive it when overpowered themselves  The severity of the laws against them serve to encrease their barbarity  and seem to make them a neutral species of beings between the wildness of the lion and the subtilty of the man  When taken alive their punishment is hideous  A floating gibbet is erected  which is let run down with the stream  here upon an iron hook stuck under their ribs  and upon which the whole weight of their body depends  they are left to expire in the most terrible agonies  some being thus found to linger several days successively   We were but three days voyage from the confluence of this river into the Wolga  when we perceived at a distance behind us an armed barque coming up with the assistance of sails and oars  in order to attack us  The dreadful signal of death was hung upon the mast  and our captain with his glass could easily discern them to be pyrates  It is impossible to express our consternation on this occasion  the whole crew instantly came together to consult the properest means of safety  It was therefore soon determined to send off our women and valuable commodities in one of our vessels  and that the men should stay in the other and boldly oppose the enemy  This resolution was soon put into execution  and I now reluctantly parted from the beautiful Zelis for the first time since our retreat from Persia  The vessel in which she was disappeared to my longing eyes  in proportion as that of the pyrates approached us  They soon came up  but  upon examining our strength  and perhaps sensible of the manner in which we   123 had sent off our most valuable effects  they seemed more eager to pursue the vessel we had sent away than attack us  In this manner they continued to harrass us for three days  still endeavouring to pass us without fighting  But  on the fourth day  finding it entirely impossible  and despairing to seize the expected booty  they desisted from their endeavours  and left us to pursue our voyage without interruption   Our joy on this occasion was great  but soon a disappointment more terrible  because unexpected  succeeded  The barque  in which our women and treasure were sent off  was wrecked upon the banks of the Wolga  for want of a proper number of hands to manage her  and the whole crew carried by the peasants up the country  Of this however we were not sensible till our arrival at Moscow  where expecting to meet our separated barque  we were informed of its misfortune  and our loss  Need I paint the situation of my mind on this occasion  Need I describe all I feel  when I despair of beholding the beautiful Zelis more  Fancy had dressed the future prospect of my life in the gayest colouring  but one unexpected stroke of fortune has robbed it of every charm  Her dear idea mixes with every scene of pleasure  and without her presence to enliven it  the whole becomes tedious  insipid  insupportable  I will confess  now that she is lost  I will confess  I loved her  nor is it in the power of time  or of reason  to erase her image from my heart   Adieu     124  LETTER XCII  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo  at Moscow    YOUR misfortunes are mine  But as every period of life is marked with its own  you must learn to endure them  Disappointed love makes the
