forth with to the strong box  where  as our lucky stars have contrived it  there is money enough for both of us  Accordingly  three days afterwards I carried off a second bag  containing  like the first  five hundred crowns  of which I would only handle the fourth part  let Gaspard be as pressing as he pleased to force upon me a brotherly division  share and share alike   As soon as this young man found himself so flush of money  and consequently in a condition to gratify his hankering after women and play  he gave himself up entirely to the devices of his own imagination  nay  his evil genius pursued him so far  as to make him fall desperately in love with one of those female harpies  who devour without remorse or intermission  and swallow up the largest fortunes  His disbursements at her instigation were frightful  and thus it became necessary for me to pay so many visits to the strong box  that old Velasquez at length found out he had been robbed  Scipio  said he one morning  I must give you a piece of information  some one robs me  my friend  my strong box has been opened  several bags have been taken out  that is a certain fact  Whom ought I to accuse of this theft  or rather  who else but my son can have committed it  Gaspard must have got by stealth into my chamber  or else you yourself must have played booty with him  for I am tempted to believe you are in league with him  though to outward appearance you do not set up your horses together  And yet I am unwilling to harbour that suspicion  because Father Alexis undertook to answer for your honesty  I gave him to understand that  by the blessing of heaven on a good natural disposition  my neighbours  goods had no temptation in my sight  and I so happily suited the action to the lie  and the lie to the action  that my judge pronounced a verdict of acquittal on the evidence of grimace and hypocrisy   Accordingly the old man dropped the subject  but for all that  there was a general misgiving in his breast  and it would sometimes light upon me  taking precautions  therefore  against our further attacks  he had a new lock put to his strong box and always carried the key in his pocket By these means  an embargo being laid on our traffic with the bags  we looked excessively foolish  especially Gaspard  who  being unable any longer to keep his nymph in her usual style  knew very well that he was likely to be tossed out of her window  He had  however  invention enough to devise an expedient for keeping his head above water a few days longer  and that was neither more nor less than to get into his clutches  in the form of a loan  my dividend on the joint stock of the strong box  I refunded to the last farthing  and this restitution  it is to be hoped  may be set off as an anticipated act of justice to the old draper  in the person of his heir   The young man  having exhausted this scanty supply  and desperate of any other  fell into a deep melancholy  and into ultimate derangement  He no longer looked on his father in any other light than as the bane of his life  His frenzy broke out into the most dreadful projects  so that  without listening to the voice of consanguinity or nature  the wretch conceived the impious design of poisoning him  He was not content with making me privy to the atrocious design  but even proposed to render me the instrument of parricide  At the very thought  my blood ran cold within me  Sir  said I  is it possible that you are so rejected of heaven as to have formed this horrid plot  What  is it in your nature to murder the author of your existence  Shall Spain  the favoured abode of the Christian faith  bear witness to the commission of a crime  at the first blush of which transatlantic savages would recoil with horror  No  my dear master  added I  throwing myself on my knees  no  you will not be guilty of an action which would raise the hand of all mankind against you  and be overtaken by an infamous punishment  I pressed many arguments beside on Gaspard  to dissuade him from so fearful an enterprise  How the deuce I came by all the moral and religious topics  which I brought to act against the fortress of his despair  is more than I can account for  but it is certain that I preached like a doctor of Salamanca  though a mere stripling  born of a gipsy fortune teller  And yet it was to no purpose that I suggested the duty of communing with his own better resolutions  and stoutly wrestling with the fiend  who was lying in wait for his immortal soul  my pious eloquence was dissipated into air  His head hung sullenly on his bosom  and his tongue uttered no sound  in answer to all my mollifying exhortations  so that there was every reason to conclude he would not swerve from his purpose   Hereupon  taking my own measures  I requested a private interview
