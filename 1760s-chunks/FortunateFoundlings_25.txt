  time a very strong affection for them  but there was yet another and   more powerful motive which rendered his captivity not only pleasing  but   almost destroyed in him an inclination ever to see his native   country again       The baron de la Valiere had long been passionately in love with a young   lady  who was one of the maids of honour to king James s queen  he went   almost every day to St  Germains  in order to prosecute his addresses    and frequently took Horatio with him  The motive of his first   introducing him to that court was  perhaps  the vanity of shewing him   that no reverse of fate could make the French regardless of what was due   to royalty  since the Chevalier St  George seem d to want no requisite   of majesty but the power  but he afterwards found the pleasure he took   in those visits infinitely surpassed what he could have expected  and   that his heart had an attachment  which made him no sooner quit that   palace than he would ask with impatience when they should go thither   again  The baron had a great deal of penetration  and as those who feel   the power of love in themselves can easily perceive the progress it   makes in others  a very few visits confirmed him that Horatio had found   something there more attractive than all he could behold elsewhere  nor   was he long at a loss to discover  among the number or beauties which   composed the trains of the queen and princess  which of them it was that   had laid his prisoner under a more lasting captivity than war had done       Princess Louisa Maria Teresa  daughter of the late king James  was then   but in her thirteenth year  the ladies who attended her were all of them   much of the same age  and to shew the respect the French had for this   royal family  tho  in misfortunes  were also the daughters of persons   whose birth and fortune might have done honour to the service of the   greatest empress in the world  nor were any of them wanting in those   perfections which attract the heart beyond the pomp of blood or titles    but she who had influenced that of our Horatio  was likewise in the   opinion of those  who felt not her charms in the same degree he did    allowed to excel her fair companions in every captivating grace  and to   yield in beauty to none but the princess herself  who was esteemed a   Prodigy  This amiable lady was called Charlotta de Palfoy  only daughter   to the baron of that name  and having from her most early years   discovered a genius above what is ordinarily found in her sex  had been   educated by her indulgent parents in such a manner  as nature left   nothing for want of the improvements of art  yet did not all the   accomplishments  she was mistress of give her the least air of   haughtiness  on the contrary  there was a certain sweetness of temper in   her which gave a double charm to every thing she said or did  she was   all affability  courtesy and chearfulness  she could not therefore avoid   treating so agreeable a stranger as Horatio with all imaginable marks of   civility  but she had been a very small time acquainted with him before   her liking ripened into a kind of tenderness little inferior to what he   was possessed of for her  and tho  both were then too young to be able   to judge of the nature of this growing inclination  yet they found they   loved without knowing to what end       As both the Chevalier St  George and the princess his sister were   instructed in the English language  and besides many of their court were   natives of Great Britain  whose loyalty had made them follow the exil d   monarch  the French belonging to them had also an ambition to speak in   the same dialect  mademoiselle Charlotta being but lately come among   them had not yet attained the proper accent  any more than Horatio had   that of the French  so they agreed that to improve each other in the   different languages  he should always speak to her in French  and she   should answer him in English  This succeeded not only for the purpose it   was intended  but likewise drew on a greater intimacy between them than   might otherwise have happened  at least in so short a time       The baron having a real friendship for Horatio  rejoiced to find he had   so powerful an attachment to continue among them  and without taking any   notice how far he saw into his sentiments  encouraged his visits at St    Germains all he could  Thus indulged in every thing he wished  he began   insensibly to lose all desires of returning to
