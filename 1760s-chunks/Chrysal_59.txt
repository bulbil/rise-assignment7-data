s rage instantly    and his only concern was how to make up the matter so as to avoid   the ridicule of such a mistake  He  therefore  told his lordship   that he was very sorry for his error  and hoped that he would at    tribute the consequences of it to that delicate sensibility which   every man of honour must have under such an apprehension  This   was sufficient   his lordship  instead of harbouring resentment    was glad to get so easily rid of the affair   and to convince the   gentleman  both of the sincerity of his reconciliation  and that he   had no other design than what he said in the action that gave   him the offence  he undertook to make him a pair of buckskin   breeches  only from the measure he had taken  that should fit him   better than any he had worn in his life          48 ADVENTVBES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XVI     THE CHAEACTBB OF A VIETUOSO â€” THE HISTOBT OP A HOENBD COCK     WITH SOME CUBIOirs PHILOSOPHICAL EBMARK3 ON CORNTJTED   ANIMALS     Opposite to him sits one of those philosophers who build their   pretences to scientific fame on making collections of the anomalous   frolics of nature  without ever attempting to investigate the wisdom   and power displayed in the regular process of her works  In the   course of this study  a whimsical adventure lately happened to the   noble virtuoso before us  A man that bought poultry round the   country  to supply the markets of this great city  having got intelli    gence of his lordship s taste  resolved to turn it to his own advan    tage  He  accordingly  procured a most beautiful gamecock  and   sawing off the spurs of another cook that had very long ones  con    trived to fix them firmly with wax on the head of this bird  on each   side of the comb  with the points turned backwards  and inclining   from each other  like the horns of a goat  in such a manner that they   appeared to have grown naturally there      As soon as he found that he could bring his scheme to a prob    ability of success  he waited on the virtuoso  and giving notice   that he had something curious to communicate  was immediately   admitted to an audience in his museum  where he informed him   that he had received intelligence from a particular friend pf his    a Scotch pedlar  that in the farthest part of the Highlands there   was a most remarkable cook  with two sui rising horns gtowing   out of the back of his head  in the possession of an old woman    who was famous for the second sight   that upon his admiring the   creature  the woman had offered to sell it to him for a pound of   tobacco and a bottle of brandy  but he was afraid to meddle with   it  as the country said it was her familiar  though he had iieen it   himself scrape the dunghill  and tread the hens like any other cock     and that upon hearing the news  he was come to inform his lordship   of it  and to offer his service to go aU the way himself for the bird    and bring him up  if he would promise to reimburse him the ex    penses of his journey  and give him some little consideration for his   trouble   and to convince his lordship that he had no design to   impose upon him  he would go at his own hazard and desire nothing   if he did not succeed      The first mention of such a curiosity threw the virtuoso into the   highest rapture   he embraced the fellow  conjured him not to lose   a minute  nor drop the least syllable of the affair to any person   living till he had brought him the cock   and to secure his fidelity   pulled out his purse  and gave him ten guineas  with the promise   of fifty more  the moment he should receive him  The man pro    mised him everything he required and went away  hugging himself   in the suoces of his scheme  Accordingly he left that part of the   country directly  and  taking care to keep beyond the reach of   his lordship s inquiry  followed his business as usual  for the time   that he might be thought to have spent in his expedition  In thÂ©         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 49     meanwhile  the virtuoso could not conceal the pride of his heart on   the prospect of so great an acquisition   but in all his letters to his   philosophical correspondents gave mysterious hints of something   immensely fine  rare
