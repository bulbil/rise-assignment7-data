most passionate lovers  hung on her neck  smothered her with kisses  and was observed by her to shed tears  so much had joy taken possession of his soul  She  on her part  was not backward in giving him the most convincing proofs of her affection towards him  They then gave each other as succinct an account  as their memories would allow  of the various accidents which had befallen  during their long absence  and concluded with mutually promising each other  that   162 being once more met together  they would never part   They visited each other almost every day  and never parted without assurances on both sides of the tender regard they had for each other   M—y represented to Miss ELLIOT  that being now rich enough to live in a genteel independence  without re entering into her former slate of life  he thought it highly consistent with prudence  that she should make her will  and settle her concerns as soon as convenient  This advice she greatly approved of  and therefore desired him to draw it up for her  but he declined the office  lest the censorious world should say that the deed was rather his than that of our heroine   Miss ELLIOT applied to an attorney of Gray s Inn  to whom she had been recommended by M—y  who for the usual fee made her one  and she caused it to be register d in the Commons in proper form  and this matter being adjusted  she and her old lover went to pass a few   163 days at a country house she had hired at Turnham green  where they passed their time in the most agreeable manner possible  till a most fatal accident damped their joy and cost Miss ELLIOT her life   One day at dinner  having eaten too heartily of a melon  she found herself out of order  and lay down to try if a little repose would be of service to her  She got up again in about half an hour  imagining she was better  and the same night  as she and her lover were in bed  she grew very bad  insomuch that the immediate attendance of a physician was indispensably necessary  As there was none of note in the place where she then was  Mr  M—y ordered a servant to saddle him a horse  and he set out full speed for London  to fetch to her assistance the ablest he could find of the faculty  He returned in about two hours  and brought with him two of the most renowned in all their prosession   When they arrived  they enquired into the origin of Miss ELLIOT S disorder  and being acquainted with it  they gave it as their opinion  that she ought to be conveyed   164 directly to London  where more proper care would be taken of her than where she was  adding  that this could not be done too soon  as a delay in her removal might be attended with the most fatal consequences  Their orders were obeyed  and our heroine was carried to London in a chaise  where  being arrived  she was put to bed  and to the great grief of all present  she appeared to grow every hour worse   About a week after her return to London  she seemed rather better  and continued mending for several days  when the fever  which raged with great violence in her  resumed its former inveteracy  and thus  if I am allowed the expression  she continued ebbing and flowing sometimes better  at other times much worse for above a month  Having continued in this state for the above mentioned time  her disease quite baffled the physicians art  and they entirely gave her over   Being made acquainted with the judgment the doctors  who had consulted together on her disorder  had passed on it    165 and finding that the grim tyrant death was inexorable  she prepared to meet her fate with courage and resignation  She earnestly desired to see her father and her sister before she died  and a messenger was instantly dispatched to Tunbridge to acquaint him with Miss ELLIOT S desire  The sister  who resided in Wales  was then at Tunbridge on a visit to her father They no sooner received the melancholly news  than they immediately set out for London   A pious clergyman attended her in her illness  and all who were about her had the pleasure to find that she expressed great compunction for her failings  She was often heard to exclaim  May my much offended God prepare me to meet death with Christian fortitude  and may I  oh  may I meet with mercy at the throne of grace   When the minister had made an end of his prayers and pious exhortations  Mr  M—y   went into the chamber  and   166 kneeling by her bedside  kissed her with great earnestness  and begged of her  that if he had ever disobliged her in any respect to forgive him  She sighed and said she was too guilty a sinner  and had too much need of forgiveness herself to deny it to any body  who had done any injury to her  That so far from having offended her  she was greatly indebted to him for the love and affection he had always bore to her —Having said this
