 and an acquaintance with   the unwary easiness of his disposition  made him cast a wishful   eye upon it  and form schemes for getting it absolutely into his   possession      At first he strove to tempt his indiscretion by the offer of more   money to supply his pleasures   but finding that would not take    and that the sense of his former extravagances dwelt so strongly   on him  as to give his mind a kind of tm n to industry  did he know   how to apply it  his ready genius struck out a method that he imagined   could not fail of success      He therefore cultivated an intimacy with the gentleman  in which   upon all occasions  he affected to boast of his own success in life   and to attribute it to his having always a command of money to   take the advantage of any bargain that might offer      As this Uxcn  of conversation seemed to flow only from the fulness         98 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     of his heart  and to be free from all design  it had the effect he   proposed  and raised a desire in his friend to follow a method which   had been so successful with him  He therefore one day communi    oated to him a resolution which he had formed of selling his estate   and applying the money to business  and desired his friend s assist    ance to execute his design  After an appearance of surprise  the   scrivener testified his pleasure and approbation of his prudence   by the readiness with which he undertook to serve him      The ease with which the first part of his scheme had succeeded    made him form further hopes  and think of getting the estate he   desired even at a cheaper rate than purchasing it      After some time spent  as he said  in fruitless inquiries for a   purchaser  he most artfully drew his friend to desire that he would   buy it himself   at first he seemed to hesitate  but then  as it were    yielding to the impulse of his friendship  he concluded a bargain   for it  on terms evidently advantageous to the seller      All things being agreed upon  the parties met to conclude the   affair   when the writings being read over  and the money lying   on the table  while the scrivener told it  the gentleman executed   the deeds of conveyance  and receipt before proper witnesses  who   withdrew as soon as they had signed them      In the meantime the scrivener continued to tell the money  till   a servant entered hastily with a letter as from a lord  who was one   of his best clients  and desired to see him that moment  The diffi    culty this threw him into was soon solved by his friend s compliance   to defer his business for a few hours  as the lord s urgency would   not admit the least delay  Accordingly  he put up both the deeds   and money  in all the apparent confusion of hurry  and went away   to his lordship      Next morning the gentleman called to receive the price of his   estate  but his friend was not at home  nor to be spoken with   in the afternoon  for his turn was now served  and he neither desired    nor perhaps thought it safe  to keep up any further acquaintance   with him      As such things might happen to a man in business  the gentleman   took no notice of them  but quietly swallowed the same excuses   for some days successively  At length his patience began to be   exhausted  and his fears alarmed at a behaviour so strange and   contrary to that height of intimacy that had subsisted between   them  even where there was no business in the case      In this perplexity he went one morning  resolving not to quit   the house till he should see him  and when a message to that purpose   was  aftÂ«r long attendance  complied with  upon a warm expostula    tion  he received for answer  from his friend that    he had been of   late too much engaged in affairs of consequence to attend   compliments  and knew not any business he could have with   him          Not know my business  sir    replied the gentleman in astonish    ment    I come  sir  for my money  and shall hereafter never trouble   you more with business or compliment          YoTu  money  sir I I do not understand you  Pray  sir  what   money do you mean
