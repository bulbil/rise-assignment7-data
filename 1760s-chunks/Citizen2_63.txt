of the literati here  that fill my soul with apprehension  I may safely aver  that I never gave any creature in this good city offence  except only my rival Doctor Rock  yet by the letters I every day receive  and by some I have seen printed  I am arraigned at one time as being a dull fellow  at another as being pert  I am here petulant  there I am heavy  by the head of my ancestors  they treat me with more inhumanity than a flying fish  If I dive and run my nose to the bottom  there a devouring shark is ready to swallow me up  If I skim the surface  a pack of dolphins are at my tail to snap me  but when I take wing and attempt to escape them by flight  I become a prey to every ravenous bird  that winnows the bosom of the deep   Adieu   LETTER CXI  To the same   THE Formalities  delays and disappointments  that precede a treaty of marriage here  are usually as numerous as those previous to a treaty of peace  The laws of this country are finely calculated   196 to promote all commerce  but the commerce between the sexes  Their encouragements for propagating hemp  madder and tobacco  are indeed admirable  Marriages are the only commodity that meet with none   Yet from the vernal softness of the air  the verdure of the fields  the transparency of the streams  and the beauty of the women  I know few countries more proper to invite to courtship  Here love might sport among painted lawns and warbling groves  and revel upon gales  wafting at once both fragrance and harmony  Yet it seems he has forsaken the island  and when a couple are now to be married  mutual love or an union of minds is the last and most trifling consideration  If their goods and chattles can be brought to unite  their sympathetic souls are ever ready to guarantee the treaty  The gentleman s mortgaged lawn becomes enamoured of the ladies marriagable grove  the match is struck up  and both parties are piously in love—according to act of Parliament   Thus they  who have fortune  are possessed at least of something that is lovely  but I actually pity those that have none  I am told there was a time  when Ladies with no other merit but youth  virtue and beauty  had a chance for husbands  at least  among the ministers of the church  or the officers of the army  The blush and innocence of sixteen was said to have a powerful influence over these two professions  But of late  all the little traffic of blushing  ogling  dimpling  and smiling  has been forbidden by an act in that case wisely made and provided  A Lady s whole cargo of smiles  sighs and whispers  is declared utterly   197 contraband  till she arrives in the warm latitudes of twenty two  where commodities of this nature are too often found to decay  She is then permitted to dimple and smile  when the dimples and smiles begin to forsake her  and when perhaps grown ugly  is charitably entrusted with an unlimited use of her charms  Her lovers  however  by this time have forsaken her  the captain has changed for another mistress  the priest himself leaves her in solitude  to bewail her virginity  and she dies even without benefit of clergy   Thus you find the Europeans discouraging love with as much earnestness as the rudest savage of Sofala  The Genius is surely now no more  In every region I find enemies in arms to oppress him  Avarice in Europe  jealousy in Persia  ceremony in China  poverty among the Tartars  and lust in Circassia  are all prepared to oppose his power  The Genius is certainly banished from earth  though once adored under such a variety of forms  He is no where to be found  and all that the Ladies of each country can produce  are but a few trifling reliques as instances of his former residence and favour   The genius of Love  says the eastern Apologue  had long resided in the happy plains of Abra  where every breeze was health  and every sound produced tranquility  His temple at first was crowded  but every age lessened the number of his votaries  or cooled their devotion  Perceiving  therefore  his altars at length quite deserted  he was resolved to remove to some more propitious region  and he apprized the fair sex of every country  where he could hope for a proper reception    198 to assert their right to his presence among them  In return to this proclamation  embassies were sent from the Ladies of every part of the world to invite him  and to display the superiority of their claims   And first the beauties of China appeared  No country could compare with them for modesty  either of look  dress  or behaviour  their eyes were never lifted from the ground  their robes of the most beautiful silk hid their hands  bosom and neck  while their faces only were left uncovered  They indulged no airs that might express loose desire  and they seemed to study only the graces of inanimate beauty  Their black teeth and plucked eyebrows were  however  alledged by
