 by some accident  had heard   of Mrs  Munden s marriage       Though both these ladies were much more taken up with each other than   with examining the trifles they came to see  yet neither of them would   quit the shop without becoming customers  Lady Loveit perceiving that   Mrs  Munden had neither coach nor chair at the door  after having asked   what part of town she lived in  and finding it was not too much out of   her way  desired she would give her leave to set her down in her   chariot       Mrs  Munden readily accepted the offer  and  being come to the door of   her house  would have persuaded Lady Loveit to alight and come in  but   she excused herself  and  at the same time  gave her a pressing   invitation to her house as soon as an opportunity permitted   I know    Madam   said she  smiling   that it is my duty to pay the first visit to   your ladyship  yet  as you are here     I should not stand on that   punctilio with you   interrupted Lady Loveit  with the same good humour     but I expect company at home  and I know not but that they already wait   for me   The other then told her she would do herself the favour to   attend her ladyship in a day or two  and this was all that passed at   this first interview       Mrs  Munden was extremely rejoiced at the opportunity of renewing her   acquaintance with this lady  in which she had not the least room to   doubt but that she should find what she so much wanted  a faithful   adviser and an agreeable companion  They had always loved each   other  there was a great parity of sentiment and principle between them    and as nothing but their different ways of thinking  in point of conduct   towards the men  had hindered them from becoming inseparable friends    that bar being removed by Mrs  Munden s change of temper  and her being   now what Lady Loveit always was  no other remained to keep them from   communicating their thoughts with the utmost freedom to each other       The visit promised by Mrs  Munden was not delayed beyond the time she   mentioned  Lady Loveit received her without the least reserve  and they   soon entered into conversation with the same sprightliness as before the   change of their conditions       Mrs  Munden had resolved within her self not to make the least mention   of Mr  Trueworth s name  but feeling  notwithstanding  a good deal of   impatience to hear something of him  artfully entered into a discourse   which she knew must draw the other in to say something concerning him        I need not ask   said she   how you liked the country  it is pretty   plain  from your continuing there such a length of time  that you found   more pleasures at Sir Bazil s seat than any you had left behind     The   house is well situated  indeed   replied Lady Loveit   yet I have passed   the least part of my time there since I left London  nor have we staid   away so long entirely through choice  but have in a manner been detained   by a succession of accidents altogether unforeseen        It took up six weeks   continued she   to receive the visits which were   every day crowded upon us from all parts of the country  This hurry   being over  we could do no less than accompany Mr  Wellair and his lady    who had been with us all this while  to their house  where we staid   about a fortnight  after which  Sir Bazil having promised my brother and   sister Trueworth to pass some time with them in Oxfordshire  we crossed   the country to that gentleman s fine seat  where  you may suppose  his   arrival was welcomed in much the same manner Sir Bazil s had been in   Staffordshire  Besides all his relations  intimate friends  tenants  and   dependants  I believe there was scarce a gentleman or lady  twenty miles   round  who did not come to congratulate him on his marriage and return        For the reception of those guests   went she still on   the generous   Mr  Trueworth omitted nothing that might testify his joy on the occasion   of their coming  Feasting employed their days  and balls their nights    But  alas  in the midst of these variegated scenes of pleasure  death    sudden death  snatched away the source of all our joys  and turned the   face of gladness into the most poignant
