 and extracting from it the more diversion  Peregrine  proposed that some foreigners should partake of the banquet  and the  task being left to his care and discretion  he actually bespoke the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   company of a French marquis  an Italian count  and a German baron  whom  he knew to be egregious coxcombs  and therefore more likely to enhance  the joy of the entertainment   Accordingly  the hour being arrived  he conducted them to the hotel  where the physician lodged  after having regaled their expectations with  an elegant meal in the genuine old Roman taste  and they were received  by Mr  Pallet  who did the honours of the house  while his friend  superintended the cook below  By this communicative painter  the guests  understood that the doctor had met with numerous difficulties in  the execution of his design  that no fewer than five cooks had been  dismissed  because they could not prevail upon their own consciences to  obey his directions in things that were contrary to the present practice  of their art  and that although he had at last engaged a person  by  an extraordinary premium  to comply with his orders  the fellow was so  astonished  mortified  and incensed at the commands he had received   that his hair stood on end  and he begged on his knees to be released  from the agreement he had made  but finding that his employer insisted  upon the performance of his contract  and threatened to introduce him  to the commissaire if he should flinch from the bargain  he had  in the  discharge of his office  wept  sang  cursed  and capered for two whole  hours without intermission   While the company listened to this odd information  by which they were  prepossessed with strange notions of the dinner  their ears were invaded  by a voice that exclaimed in French   For the love of God  dear sir  for  the passion of Jesus Christ  spare me the mortification of the honey  and oil   Their ears still vibrated with the sound  when the doctor  entering  was by Peregrine made acquainted with the strangers  to whom  he  in the transports of his wrath  could not help complaining of the  want of complaisance he had found in the Parisian vulgar  by which his  plan had been almost entirely ruined and set aside  The French marquis   who thought the honour of his nation was concerned at this declaration   professed his sorrow for what had happened  so contrary to the  established character of the people  and undertook to see the  delinquents severely punished  provided he could be informed of their  names or places of abode   The mutual compliments that passed on this occasion were scarce  finished  when a servant  coming into the room  announced dinner  and  the entertainer led the way into another apartment  where they found a  long table  or rather two boards joined together  and furnished with a  variety of dishes  the steams of which had such evident effect upon the  nerves of the company  that the marquis made frightful grimaces  under  pretence of taking snuff  the Italian s eyes watered  the German s  visage underwent several distortions of features  our hero found means  to exclude the odour from his sense of smelling  by breathing only  through his mouth  and the poor painter  running into another room   plugged his nostrils with tobacco  The doctor himself  who was the only  person present  whose organs were not discomposed  pointing to a couple  of couches placed on each side of the table  told his guests that he was  sorry he could not procure the exact triclinia of the ancients  which  were somewhat different from these conveniences  and desired they would  have the goodness to repose themselves without ceremony  each in his  respective couchette  while he and his friend Mr  Pallet would place  themselves upright at the ends  that they might have the pleasure of  serving those that lay along  This disposition  of which the strangers    6 22 15  3 45 PM   had no previous idea  disconcerted and perplexed them in a most  ridiculous manner  the marquis and baron stood bowing to each other   on pretence of disputing the lower seat  but in reality with a view of  profiting by the example of one another  for neither of them understood  the manner in which they were to loll  and Peregrine  who enjoyed their  confusion  handed the count to the other side  where  with the most  mischievous politeness  he insisted upon his taking possession of the  upper place   In this disagreeable and ludicrous suspense  they continue acting a  pantomime of gesticulations  until the doctor earnestly entreated them  to waive all compliment and form  lest the dinner should be spoiled  before the ceremonial could be adjusted  Thus conjured  Peregrine took  the lower couch on the left hand side  laying himself gently down  with  his face towards the table  The marquis  in imitation of this pattern
