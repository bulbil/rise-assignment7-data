this court  till I have first heard your worshipful sentiments  but I now feel myself called upon to take the lead  and to offer  with humble deference to your mightinesses  my opinion on the manner in which we should take up this very important cause —I am a lawyer it is true —but I am also a nobleman —and it is for the honour of Spain that our lawyers are such —I find here before me  a process  the intention of which is to stigmatize with infamy a princess of the noblest blood in Europe  We have the continued acknowledgment of parents —We have their positive and dying testimony  with the positive and dying testimony of a woman who was present at the birth of the  Page  37  defendant —I lay my hand upon my heart  and I judge as I would wish to be judged  Can I then suppose all this to be a complication of guilt  of deliberate and downright perjury —No  signors —I cannot  unless upon a strong proof indeed  And what is the proof that has been brought  These testimonies remain untouched —They are uniform and consistent in the grand point  Upon what then do the plaintiffs rest their extraordinary plea —They have embarked us in a mare magnum of circumstances  picked up at the distance of fourteen years  And I must say  picked up from the streets of Paris  from the very dregs of the French Canaille  It is true  that the defendant has also his ragged evidences  but let us consider who first called in  Page  38  the lame and the blind  Had not the plaintiffs built  the defendant had not been obliged to pull down —Signors  I am only surprised to see Don Pedro here  I know him  and I regard him  and it has all along been most difficult for me to reconcile the cause and the lawyer  but when I consider how imperceptibly he has been led away  I excuse him  and I here publickly acquit his honour  For my own part  signors  I have no difficulty  and were not the prince of Arvidoso a minor  these plaintiffs should not go without paying costs of suit      Thus spoke the chief justice  with a warmth of feeling which went to the heart of every spectator  Several of the senators delivered their sentiments in terms a little different  but  Page  39  to the same purpose with their head  and only one or two remained still under the cloud of prejudice  but did not venture to say one word   The spectators could not contain their joy  but shouted as at a bullfight  or any other of the superb spectacles of Spain  Most of the windows of Sevile were that evening illuminated  and bonefires blazed in every corner of the city  while health and prosperity was drunk to the prince Ferdinand of← Dorando →    Stung to the quick  the Arvidoso train gnashed their teeth in rage and despair  They however carried their cause by appeal  before the grandees of Spain at Madrid  but it only served to make their desperate scheme fall upon their own heads with redoubled vengeance  That illustrious assembly could hardly hear them  Page  40  with patience  One of the grandees muttered  that the Arvidoso party had said strong things —that they had a heavy memorial —   Heavy  cryed the chancellor of Spain  with a violence that made his brother shrink within himself —Heavy  yes it is heavy  but heavy as was chaos    Nec quicquam  nise pondus iners  congestaque eodem  Non bene junctarum discordia semina rerum     An illustrious grandee—the greatest minister that Spain ever saw  and whose eloquence vied with that of the orators of Greece and Rome  rose up  and looking around him with a piercing eye—he thus began—   Though long accustomed to hold with a steady hand the balance of Europe  and mark the fate of nations  I confess  most mighty signors  that I have at no time been more affected than I now am by  Page  41  this private question—Private  did I say —I recall the expression—It is a question of the most public nature—in the event of which every thing that is dear and valuable to humanity is concerned—What is Spain  What is our country  It is not the valleys though ever so gay—It is not the fields  though ever so rich  that attach us to our native land—No  It is our family—It is our wives—It is our children—And what have we before us  A daring attempt to render our children uncertain  If adulterers have been thought worthy of death  what punishment do those deserve  who would introduce what is still more dangerous to society  A few wives may be unfaithful  but every wife may be attacked like the princess of ← Dorando →   Have we not here  Page  42  the constant acknowledgment of parents unredargued  unconcussed  but by vague suspicions mustered up twice seven years after the birth of the prince  And must we then prove the birth of our children  I tremble—I shudder at the consequences  They are big with danger and destruction to society  Shall those brave officers whom I have chosen—whom I have sent out—whom I have inspirited—shall those souls of fire who have carried the Spanish arms to the most distant corners—who have
