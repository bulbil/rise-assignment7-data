 he attended the event  so far safe  that no   one could endanger his safety by betraying him  there being no   person there  not even of the order  privy to the action  for secrets   of this importance are always entrusted to as few as possible      While he thus calmly looked on as an unconcerned spectator  it   is impossible to describe the distraction that reigned all over   the city  where every person suspected his neighbour  and was   almost afraid to converse with his brother  for fear of being sus    pected of a participation in a crime of which he knew not the person   guilty      At court  in the meantime  the most mysterious silence was ob    served  and all conversation on the subject discouraged  This was   thought to be the most probable way of coming to the knowledge   of so dark an afiair  as their spies could thereby mix with the people   with less suspicion  and make their observations with the greater   certainty  when they shoiild be off their guard  Not that they were   at a loss to think from whence the blow had come  but by whom it   was struck was the difficulty to find out  that so they might found   their proceedings on an evidence of justice  for the Jesuits were too   mighty a body to be attacked upon an uncertainty      The reason for suspecting them of this fact was  that upon the   miscarriage of their premature attempt in America  the king was so   incensed against the whole society  that he dismissed them from the   direction of his conscience  and every other place and employment   about his person and court  Such an indignity he was sensible     1 Pombal  the prime minister of Joseph I of Portugal  charged the   Jesuits collectively with complicity in the Tavora Plot  Sept  3  1758     in which the king was fired at and wounded  The evidence as to their   guilt cannot be substantiated  At any rate  all Jesuits were ordered   to be deported from Portugal and its dependencies          278 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     must alarm the resentment of a set of men not remarkable for   patience  or forgiving affronts   he had  therefore  taken every   precaution to guard against them  as far as human prudence could   direct his fears  which was only against disturbances in the state    for of such an attempt as this he could not suspect them  While   things hung in this suspense  I had an opportunity of seeing into   the character of the people I was among   but hujnan language   wants force to describe them  I have already given you the genuine   character of the Dutch   to that  let us add poverty  pride  super    stition  bigotry  and its inseparable attendant  cruelty  and they   will give you some idea of the present Portuguese  A people of   whom it is hard to say whether to abstracted speculation they are   more ridiculous or execrable  the struggle between their follies and   vices is so unremitted and so strong      A little before I arrived there  the city had been reduced to ashes   by lightning  and  before they had recovered from the consternation   which such a misfortune threw them into  they received an account   of the capital of their American dominions being swallowed by an   earthquake  Such signal instances of the wrath of Heaven might   have been expected to alarm their consciences to look for the causes   of it in their vices  and to try to avert it by repentance and amend    ment  But  instead of that  the first proof they gave of coming to   their reason  or  I should rather say  of coming to themselves  for   reason it was not  after their fright  was to attribute these mis    fortunes to a relaxation in superstitious severity  and to demand    as victims to it  the only people under heaven whose good nature   had given effectual relief to their distress  At length  after a calm   so long that people began to think the storm was quite allayed    it broke out with a fury that amazed not only the unhappy heads   on which it burst  but also the whole nation beside  I told you that   the attempt had been made upon the king  as he was returning   from a love meeting  The person with whom he had been was   descended from the first  and related or allied to all the greatest   families in his kingdom      In a country whose characteristics are pride and revenge  such an   intercourse must be dangerous even to royalty  as the honour of   all those families
