that we could not resist —But if I was alarmed at his voice  what must my amazement be  when I discovered by the light  the very person of my lamented friend  Perceiving my confusion  which was extreme  he clasped me in his arms and bedewed my face with tears —It was some time ere I recovered the use of my reason  overpowered with this event  and longer still before I could speak    318 So that all I was capable of  was to return his embraces  and to mingle the overflowings of my joy with his  while honest Brayl  affected with the scene  wept as fast as either of us  and signified his participation of our happiness  by hugging us both  and capering about the room like a mad man —At length I retrieved the use of my tongue  and cried    Is it possible  can you be my friend Thomson  No certainly  alas  he was drowned  and I am now under the deception of a dream  —  Then I relapsed into tears —He was at great pains to convince me of his being the individual person whom I regretted  and bidding me sit down and compose myself  promised to explain his sudden disappearance from the Thunder  and to account for his being at present in the land of the living —This he acquitted himself of  after I had drank a glass of punch  and recollected myself  by informing us  that with a determination to rid himself of a miserable existence  he had gone in the nighttime to the head  while the ship was on her way  from whence he slipped down  as softly as he could by the bows  into the sea  where  after he was heartily ducked  he began to repent of his precipitation  and as he could swim very well  kept himself above water  in hopes of being taken up by some of the ships astern —that in this situation  he hailed a large vessel and begged to be taken in  but was answered  that she was a heavy sailor  and therefore they did not chuse to lose time  by bringing to  however  they threw an old chest over board  for his convenience  and told him  that some of the ships a stern would certainly save him —that no other vessel came   319 within sight or cry of him  for the space of three hours  during which time he had the mortification of finding himself in the middle of the ocean alone  without support or resting place  but what a few crazy boards afforded  till at last  he discerned a small sloop steering towards him  upon which he set up his throat  and had the good fortune to be heard and rescued from the dreary waste  by their boat  which was hoisted out on purpose —   I was no sooner brought on board  continued he  than I fainted  and when I recovered my senses  found myself in bed  regaled with a most noisome smell of onions and cheese  which made me think at first  that I was in my own hammock  along side of honest Morgan  and that all which had passed was no more than a dream —Upon enquiry I understood that I was on board of a schooner belonging to Rhode Island  bound for Jamaica  with a cargo of geese  pigs  onions  and cheese  and that the master s name was Robertson  by birth a North Briton  whom I knew at first sight to be an old school fellow of mine —When I discovered myself to him  he was transported with surprize and joy  and begged to know the occasion of my misfortune  which I did not think fit to disclose  because I knew his notions with regard to religion  were very severe and confined  therefore contented myself with telling him  I fell over board by accident  but made no scruple of explaining the nature of my disagreeable station  and of acquainting him with my determined purpose never to return to the Thunder man of war  —   Although he was not of my opinion in that   320 particular  knowing that I must lose my cloaths  and what pay was due to me  unless I went back to my duty  yet  when I described the circumstances of the hellish life I led  under the tyrannic sway of Oakhum and Mackshane  and among other grievances  hinted a dissatisfaction at the irreligious deportment of my ship mates  and the want of the true Presbyterian gospel doctrine  he changed his sentiments  and conjured me with great vehemence and zeal to lay aside all thoughts of rising in the navy  and that he might shew how much he had my interest at heart  undertook to provide for me in some shape or other  before he should leave Jamaica —This he performed to my heart s desire  by recommending me to a gentleman of fortune  with whom I have lived ever since  in quality of surgeon and overseer to his plantations —He and his lady are now at Kingston  so that I am  for the present  master of this house  to which  from my soul  I bid you welcome  and hope you will favour me with your company during the remaining part of the night  —  I
