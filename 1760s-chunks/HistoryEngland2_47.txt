 rigour  and prejudice  gratified private animosity under the mask of public justice  and  in their pretended love of justice  forgot humanity  On the other hand  the pretender s party aimed not only at subverting the government  but the religion of the kingdom  bred a Papist himself  he confided only in counsellors of his own persuasion  and most of those who adhered to his cause were men of indifferent morals  or bigotted principles  Clemency  however  in the government  at that time  would probably have extinguished all the factious spirit which has hitherto disturbed the peace of this country  for it has ever been the character of the English  that they are more easily led than driven to loyalty   I am   c   LETTER XV   IN a government  so very complicated as that of England  it must necessarily change from itself  in a revolution of even a few years  as some of its weaker branches acquire strength  or its stronger decline  At this period  the rich and noble seemed to possess a greater share of power than they had done for some ages preceding  the house of commons became   126 each day a stronger body  at once more independent on the crown and the people  It was now seen that the rich could at any time buy their election  and that while their laws governed the poor  they might be enabled to govern the law  The rebellion was now extinguished  and the severities which justice had inflicted  excited the discontent of many  whose humane passions were awakened as their fears began to subside  This served as a pretext for continuing the parliament  and repealing the act by which they were to be dissolved at the expiration of every third year  An act of this nature  by which a parliament thus extended their own power  was thought  by many  the ready means of undermining the constitution  for if they could with impunity extend their continuance for seven years  which was the time proposed  they could also for life continue their power  but this  it was observed  was utterly incompatible with the spirit of legislation  The bill  however  passed both houses  all objections to it were considered as disaffection  and  in a short time  it received the royal sanction  The people might murmur at this encroachment  but it was now too late for redress   Domestic concerns being thus adjusted  the King began to turn his thoughts to his Hanoverian dominions  and determined upon a voyage to the continent  Nor was he without his fears for his dominions there  as Charles XII  of Sweden  professed the highest displeasure at his having entered into a confederacy against him in his absence  Having therefore passed through Holland to Hanover  in order to secure his German territories  he entered into a treaty with the Dutch and the Regent of France  by which they promised mutually to assist each other  in case of invasion  but the death of the Swedish Monarch  who was killed by a cannonball at the siege of Frederickstadt  soon put an   127 end to his disquietudes from that quarter  However  his Majesty  to secure himself as far as alliances could add to his safety  entered into various negotiations with the different powers of Europe  some were brought to accede by money  others by promises  Treaties of this kind seldom give any real security  they may be considered as mere political playthings  they amuse for a while  and then are thrown neglected by  never more to be heard of  as nothing but its own internal strength or situation can guard a country from insult   Among other treaties concluded with such intentions  was that called the Quadruple Alliance  It was agreed upon between the Emperor  France  England  and Holland  that the Emperor should renounce all pretensions to the crown of Spain  and exchange Sardinia for Sicily with the Duke of Savoy  That the succession to the Duchies of Tuscany  Parma  and Placentia  should be settled on the Queen of Spain s eldest son  in case the present possessors should die without male issue  This treaty was by no means favourable to the interests of England  as it interrupted the commerce with Spain  and  as it destroyed the balance of power in Italy  by throwing too much into the hands of Austria  However  England sitted out a strong squadron in order to bring Spain to terms  if that kingdom should insist upon its rights in Italy  The war between the Emperor and King of Spain was actually begun in that country  and the mediation of the King of England was rejected  as partial and unjust  It was therefore resolved by the court of London to support its negotiations with the strongest reasons  namely  those of war  Sir George Byng sailed to Naples with twenty two ships of the line  where he was received as a deliverer  that city having been under the utmost terrors of an invasion from Spain    128 Here the English admiral received intelligence  that the Spanish army  amounting to thirty thousand men  had landed in Sicily  wherefore he immediately determined to sail thither  fully resolved to pursue the Spanish fleet  Upon doubling Cape Faro  he perceived two small Spanish vessels
