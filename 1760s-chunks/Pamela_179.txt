more   liberty with the world than we ought to do  wantoning  very probably    as you contemplative folks would say  in the sunbeams of a dangerous   affluence  and cannot think of confining ourselves to the common paths    though the safest and most eligible  after all  And you may believe I   could not very well like to be supplanted in a view that lay next my   heart  and that by an old acquaintance  whose good  before this affair    I was studious to promote       I would only say  sir  said he  that my first motive was entirely such   as became my function  And  very politely  said my master  he added  And   I am very sure  that however inexcusable I might seem in the progress   of the matter  yourself  sir  would have been sorry to have it said  you   had cast your thoughts on a person  that nobody could have wished for   but yourself       Well  Mr  Williams  said I  I see you are a man of gallantry  as well as   religion  But what I took most amiss was  that  if you thought me doing   a wrong thing  you did not expostulate with me upon it  as your function   might have allowed you to do  but immediately determined to counterplot   me  and attempt to secure to yourself a prize you would have robbed   me of  and that from my own house  But the matter is at an end  and I   retain not any malice upon it  though you did not know but I might  at   last  do honourably by her  as I actually intend       I am sorry for myself  sir  said he  that I should so unhappily   incur your displeasure  but I rejoice for her sake in your honourable   intentions  give me leave only to say  that if you make Miss Andrews   your lady  she will do credit to your choice with every body that   sees her  or comes to know her  and  for person and mind both  you may   challenge the county       In this manner  said my master  did the parson and I confabulate  and   I set him down at his lodgings in the village  But he kept your secret    Pamela  and would not own  that you gave any encouragement to his   addresses       Indeed  sir  said I  he could not say that I did  and I hope you believe   me  I do  I do  said he  but  tis still my opinion  that if  when I saw   plots set up against my plots  I had not discovered the parson as I did    the correspondence between you might have gone to a length that would   have put our present situation out of both our powers       Sir  said I  when you consider  that my utmost presumption could not   make me hope for the honour you now seem to design me  that I was so   hardly used  and had no prospect before me but dishonour  you will allow   that I should have seemed very little in earnest in my professions of   honesty  if I had not endeavoured to get away  but yet I resolved not   to think of marriage  for I never saw the man I could love  till your   goodness emboldened me to look up to you       I should  my dear Pamela  said he  make a very ill compliment to my   vanity  if I did not believe you  though  at the same time  justice   calls upon me to say  that it is  some things considered  beyond my   merit       There was a sweet  noble expression for your poor daughter  my dear   father and mother   And from my master too       I was glad to hear this account of the interview between Mr  Williams   and himself  but I dared not to say so  I hope in time he will be   reinstated in his good graces       He was so good as to tell me  he had given orders for the chapel to   be cleared  O how I look forward with inward joy  yet with fear and   trembling          Friday       About twelve o clock came Sir Simon  and his lady and two daughters  and   Lady Jones  and a sister in law of hers  and Mr  Peters  and his   spouse and niece  Mrs  Jewkes  who is more and more obliging  was much   concerned I was not dressed in some of my best clothes  and made me
