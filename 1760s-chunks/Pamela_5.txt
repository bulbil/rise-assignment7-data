  the school you attempted to set up  but was forced to go to such hard   labour  But this is more pride to me  that I am come of such honest   parents  than if I had been born a lady       I hear nothing yet of going to Lady Davers  and I am very easy at   present here  for Mrs  Jervis uses me as if I were her own daughter    and is a very good woman  and makes my master s interest her own  She is   always giving me good counsel  and I love her next to you two  I think    best of any body  She keeps so good rule and order  she is mightily   respected by us all  and takes delight to hear me read to her  and all   she loves to hear read  is good books  which we read whenever we are   alone  so that I think I am at home with you  She heard one of our men    Harry  who is no better than he should be  speak freely to me  I think   he called me his pretty Pamela  and took hold of me  as if he would have   kissed me  for which  you may be sure  I was very angry  and she took   him to task  and was as angry at him as could be  and told me she was   very well pleased to see my prudence and modesty  and that I kept all   the fellows at a distance  And indeed I am sure I am not proud  and   carry it civilly to every body  but yet  methinks  I cannot bear to be   looked upon by these men servants  for they seem as if they would look   one through  and  as I generally breakfast  dine  and sup  with Mrs    Jervis   so good she is to me   I am very easy that I have so little to   say to them  Not but they are civil to me in the main  for Mrs  Jervis s   sake  who they see loves me  and they stand in awe of her  knowing her   to be a gentlewoman born  though she has had misfortunes  I am going on   again with a long letter  for I love writing  and shall tire you  But    when I began  I only intended to say  that I am quite fearless of any   danger now  and  indeed  cannot but wonder at myself   though your   caution to me was your watchful love   that I should be so foolish as   to be so uneasy as I have been  for I am sure my master would not demean   himself  so as to think upon such a poor girl as I  for my harm  For   such a thing would ruin his credit  as well as mine  you know  who  to   be sure  may expect one of the best ladies in the land  So no more at   present  but that I am                                                 Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER VI         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       My master has been very kind since my last  for he has given me a suit   of my late lady s clothes  and half a dozen of her shifts  and six fine   handkerchiefs  and three of her cambric aprons  and four holland ones    The clothes are fine silk  and too rich and too good for me  to be sure    I wish it was no affront to him to make money of them  and send it to   you  it would do me more good       You will be full of fears  I warrant now  of some design upon me  till I   tell you  that he was with Mrs  Jervis when he gave them me  and he gave   her a mort of good things  at the same time  and bid her wear them in   remembrance of her good friend  my lady  his mother  And when he gave me   these fine things  he said  These  Pamela  are for you  have them made   fit for you  when your mourning is laid by  and wear them for your good   mistress s sake  Mrs  Jervis gives you a very good word  and I would   have you continue to behave as prudently as you have done hitherto  and   every body will be your friend       I was so surprised at his goodness
