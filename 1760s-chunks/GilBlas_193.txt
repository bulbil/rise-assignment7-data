speak a word with you in private  The obsequious publican shewed us into a room  where Lamela  now that we had got him to ourselves  said  I have the honour to be an unworthy member of the holy office  and am come here on a business of very great importance  At this intimation  the man of liquor turned pale  and answered in a tremulous tone that he was not conscious of having given any umbrage to the holy inquisition  True  replied Ambrose with encouraging affability  neither do we meditate any harm against you  Heaven forbid  that august tribunal  too hasty in its punishments  should make no distinction between guilt and innocence  It is unrelenting  but always just  to become obnoxious to its vengeance  you must have earned its displeasure by wickedness or contumacy  Be satisfied therefore that it is not you who bring me to Xelva  but a certain dealer and chapman  by name Samuel Simon  A very ugly story about him has come round to us  He is still a Jew in his heart  they say  and has only embraced Christianity from sordid and secular motives  I command you  in the name of the tremendous court I represent  to tell me all you know about that man  Beware how you are induced by good neighbourhood  or possibly by close friendship  to gloss over and palliate his errors  for  I warn you authoritatively  if I detect the slightest prevarication in your evidence  you are yourself even as one of the abandoned and accursed  Where is my secretary  pursued he  turning down towards Don Raphael  Sit down and do your duty   Mr Secretary  with his paper already in his hand and his pen behind his ear  took his seat most pompously  and made ready to take down the landlord s deposition  who promised solemnly on his part not to suppress one tittle of the real fact  So far  so good  said the worshipful commissioner  we have only to proceed in our examination  You will only just answer my questions  but do not interlard your replies with any comments of your own  Do you often see Samuel Simon at church  I never thought of looking for him  said the drawer of corks  but I do not know that I ever saw him there in my life  Very good  cried the inquisitor  Write down that the defendant never goes to church  I do not say so  your worship  answered the landlord  I only say that I never happened to see him there  We may have been at church together and yet not have come across each other  My good friend  replied Lamela  you forget that you are deposing to facts  and not arguing  Remember what I told you  contempt of court is a heinous offence  You are to give a sound and discreet evidence  every iota of what makes against him  and not a word in his favour  if you knew volumes  If that is your practice  O upright and impartial judge  resumed our host  my testimony will scarcely be worth the trouble of taking  I know nothing about the tradesman you are inquiring after  and therefore can tell neither good nor harm of him  but if you wish to examine into the history of his private life  I will run and call Gaspard  his apprentice  whom you may question as much as you please  The lad comes and takes his glass here sometimes with his friends  Bless us  what a tongue  He will rip up all the minutest actions of his master s life  and find employment for your secretary till his wrist aches  take my word for it   I like your open dealing  said Ambrose with a nod of approbation  To point out a man so capable of speaking to the bad morals of Simon  is an instance of Christian charity as well as of religious zeal  I shall report you very favourably to the inquisition  Make haste  therefore  go and fetch this Gaspard  of whom you speak  but do the thing cautiously  so that his master may have no suspicion of what is going forward  The multiplier of scores acquitted himself of his commission with due diligence and laudable privacy  Our little shopman came along with him  The youth had a tongue with a tang  and was just the sort of fellow that we wanted  Welcome  my good young man  said Lamela  You behold in me an inquisitor  appointed by that venerable body to collect informations against Samuel Simon  on an accusation of still adhering to Judaism in his secret devotions  You are an inmate of his family  consequently you must be an eye witness to many of his most private transactions  It probably may be unnecessary to warn you  that you are obliged in conscience  and by fear of punishment  to declare all you know about him  notwithstanding any promise to the contrary  when I order you so to do on the part of the holy inquisition  May it please your reverence  answered the plodding little rascal  I am quite ready to satisfy your heart s desire on that head  without being commanded thereto in the name of the holy office  If ever my acquittal was to depend on my master s character
