English monarchy unimpaired   The clemency and the justice of this Monarch s reign early appeared from that spirit of moderation which he shewed to the professors of each religion  the minds of the people had been long irritated against each other  and each party persecuted the rest  as it happened to prevail  James wisely observed  that men should be punished only for actions  and not for opinions  each party murmured against him  and the universal complaint of every sect was the best argument of his moderation towards all   Yet  mild as he was  there was a project contrived  in the very beginning of his reign  for the re establishment of Popery  which seemed to be   303 even of infernal extraction  a more horrid  or a more terrible scheme  never entered into the human mind  the massacre of St  Bartholomew  in France  in which sixty thousand Protestants were murdered in cold blood  was  in reality  not so dreadful  The Catholics of England had expected some condescensions from the King  which he was unwilling to grant  this refusal determined them to take different measures for the establishment of their religion and their party  they were resolved to cut off the King and both houses of parliament at one blow  the house  where the parliament of England sits  is built on arched vaults  and in these the Papists were determined to lay gun powder  in order to blow up the King and all the members of both houses at their next sitting  For this deed of desperation a number of persons united  among which were Robert Catesby  Thomas Percy  kinsman to the Earl of Northumberland  John Grant  Ambrose Rookwood  Christopher Wright  Francis Tresham  Guy Fawkes  and Everard Digby  How horrid soever the contrivance  yet every member seemed faithful and secret in the league  and  about two months before the sitting of parliament  they hired the cellar under the Parliament house  and bought a quantity of coals with which it was then filled  as if for their own use  the next thing done was to convey  privately  thirty six barrels of gun powder  which had been purchased in Holland  and which were covered under the coals and faggots  The day for the sitting of the parliament approached  never was treason more secret  or ruin more apparently inevitable  the conspirators expected the day with impatience  and gloried in their meditated guilt  A remorse of private friendship saved the kingdom    304 when all the ties  divine and human  were too weak to save it  Sir Henry Piercy conceived a desire of saving the life of the Lord Monteagle  his inmate friend and companion  About ten days before the sitting  this nobleman  upon his return home  received a letter from a person unknown  the messenger making off as soon as he had delivered it  the letter was to this effect    Stay away from this parliament  for God and man have concurred to punish the wickedness of the times  Think not slightly of this warning  though the danger does not appear  yet they shall receive a terrible blow  without knowing from whence it comes  The danger will be past as soon as you have burnt this letter  and this counsel may do you good  but cannot do you harm   The contents of this mysterious letter surprized and puzzled the nobleman to whom it was addressed  he communicated it instantly to the Secretary of State  and the Secretary shewed it to the council  none of them were capable of comprehending the meaning of it  and it was resolved to communicate it to the King  In this universal agitation between doubt and apprehension  the King was the first who penetrated the meaning of its fatal contents  he concluded that some sudden danger was preparing  by means of gun powder  The Lord Chamberlain sent proper persons  the very night before the sitting of parliament  to examine the vaults above mentioned  there the whole train of powder was discovered  and a man in a cloak and boots  with a dark lanthorn in his hand  preparing the dreadful attempt  this was Guy Fawkes  who passed for Piercy s servant  The atrociousness of his guilt inspired him with resolution  and  with an undaunted air he told them  that had he blown them and himself up together  he had been happy  He   305 obstinately refused to name his accomplices  the sight of the rack  however  at length brought him to a confession  No nation fears death less than the English  but none dread torments more     The conspirators  who had prepared all things to second the mine at Westminster  finding their plot discovered  fled different ways to assemble their Catholic friends  whom they expected to rise in their defence  but  the country being every where alarmed against them  they were at last forced  to the number of about an hundred  to stop at an house in Warwickshire  where they were resolved to sell their lives dearly  A spark of fire happening to fall among some gun powder that was laid to dry  it blew up  and so maimed the principal conspirators  that the survivors resolved to open the gate and sally through the multitude that surrounded the house
