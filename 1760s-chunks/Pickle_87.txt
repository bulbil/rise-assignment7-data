 served only to exasperate her mother to a higher pitch of  indignation  which discharged itself in invectives against Peregrine   whom she reviled with the epithets of a worthless  abandoned reprobate   The youth  hearing these unjust aspersions  trembled with resentment  through every limb  assuring the upbraider that he considered her as an  object of compassion   for without all doubt   said he   your diabolical  rancour must be severely punished by the thorns of your own conscience   which this very instant taxes you with the malice and falsehood of your  reproaches  As for my sister  I bless God that you have not been able  to infect her with your unnatural prejudice  which  because she is too  just  too virtuous  too humane to imbibe  you reject her as an alien to  your blood  and turn her out unprovided into a barbarous world  But even  there your vicious purpose shall be defeated  that same Providence  that  screened me from the cruelty of your hate  shall extend its protection  to her  until I shall find it convenient to assert by law that right of  maintenance which Nature  it seems  hath bestowed upon us in vain  In    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the mean time  you will enjoy the satisfaction of paying an undivided  attention to that darling son  whose amiable qualities have so long  engaged and engrossed your love and esteem    This freedom of expostulation exalted his mother s ire to mere frenzy   she cursed him with the bitterest imprecations  and raved like a  bedlamite at the door  which she attempted to burst open  Her efforts  were seconded by her favourite son  who denounced vengeance against  Peregrine  and made furious assaults against the lock  which resisted  all their applications  until our hero espying his friends Gauntlet and  Pipes stepping over a stile that stood about a furlong from the window   called them to his assistance  giving them to understand how he was  besieged  he desired they would keep off his mother  that he might the  more easily secure his sister Julia s retreat  The young soldier entered  accordingly  and  posting  himself between Mrs  Pickle and the door   gave the signal to his friend  who  lifting up his sister in his arms   carried her safe without the clutches of this she dragon  while Pipes   with his cudgel  kept young master at bay   The mother  being thus deprived of her prey  sprang upon Gauntlet like  a lioness robbed of her whelps  and he must have suffered sorely in the  flesh  had he not prevented her mischievous intent by seizing both her  wrists  and so keeping her at due distance  In attempting to disengage  herself from his grasp  she struggled with such exertion  and suffered  such agony of passion at the same time  that she actually fell into  a severe fit  during which she was put to bed  and the confederates  retired without further molestation   In the mean time  Peregrine was not a little perplexed about the  disposal of his sister  whom he had rescued  He could not endure the  thoughts of saddling the commodore with a new expense  and he was afraid  of undertaking the charge of Julia  without his benefactor s advice and  direction  for the present  however  he carried her to the house of a  gentleman in the neighbourhood  whose lady was her godmother  where she  was received with great tenderness and condolence  and he purposed to  inquire for some creditable house  where she might be genteelly boarded  in his absence  resolving to maintain her from the savings of his own  allowance  which he thought might very well bear such reduction  But  this intention was frustrated by the publication of the whole affair   which was divulged next day  and soon reached the ears of Trunnion   who chid his godson for having concealed the adventure  and  with the  approbation of his wife  ordered him to bring Julia forthwith to the  garrison  The young gentleman  with tears of gratitude in his eyes   explained his design of maintaining her at his own expense  and  earnestly begged that he might not be deprived of that satisfaction  But  his uncle was deaf to all his entreaties  and insisted upon her living  in the garrison  though for no other reason than that of being company  to her aunt  who  he observed  was lost for want of conversation   Julia was accordingly brought home  and settled under the tuition of  Mrs  Trunnion  who  whatever face she might put on the matter  could  have dispensed with the society of her niece  though she was not without  hope of gratifying her pique to Mrs  Pickle  by the intelligence she  would receive from the daughter of that lady s economy and domestic  behaviour  The mother herself seemed conscious of this advantage which  her sister in law had now gained over her  being as much chagrined at  the news of Julia s reception in the garrison  as if she
