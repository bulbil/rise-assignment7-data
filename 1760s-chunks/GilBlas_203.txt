held out an additional security against the caprices of fortune  Besides  Toledo offered me a retreat exactly to my mind  There could not be a doubt but the Count de Polan would take a pleasure in giving a kind reception to one of his deliverers  and would insist on his accepting an apartment in his own house  But I only looked upon this nobleman as a very distant resource  and determined  before laying any tax on his grateful recollection  to spend part of my ready cash in travelling over the provinces of Murcia and Grenada  which I had a very particular inclination to see  With this intention I took the Almanza road  and afterwards  following the route chalked out  travelled from town to town as far as the city of Grenada  without stumbling on any sinister occurrence  It should seem as if fortune  wearied out with the school girl s tricks she had been playing me  was contented at last to leave me as she found me  But she still had her skittish designs upon me  as will be seen in the sequel   One of the first persons I met in the streets of Grenada was Signor Don Ferdinand de Leyva  son in law  as well as Don Alphonso  of the Count de Polan  We were both of us equally surprised at meeting so far from home  How is this  Gil Blas  exclaimed he  to find you in this city  What the devil brings you hither  Sir  said I  if you are astonished at seeing me in this country  you will be ten times more so when you shall know why I have quitted the service of Signor Don Caesar and his son  Then I recounted to him all that had passed between Sephora and myself  without garbling the facts in any particular  He laughed heartily at the recital  then  recovering his gravity  My friend  said he  my mediation is at your service in this affair  I will write to my sister in law         No  no  sir  interrupted I  do not write upon the subject  I beseech you  I did not quit the castle of Leyva to go back again  You may  if you please  make another use of the kindness you have expressed for me  If any of your friends should be looking out for a secretary or a steward  I should be much obliged to you to speak a good word in my favour  I will take upon me to assure you that you will never be reproached with recommending an improper object  You have only to command me  answered he  I will do whatever you desire  My business at Grenada is to visit an old aunt in an ill state of health  I shall be here three weeks longer  after which I shall set out on my return to my castle of Lorqui  where I have left Julia  That is my lodging  added he  shewing me a house about a hundred yards from us  Call upon me in a few days  probably I may by that time have hit upon some eligible appointment   And  in fact  so it was  for the very first time that we came together again  he said to me  My Lord Archbishop of Grenada  my relation and friend  is in want of a young man with some little tinge of literature  who can write a good hand and make fair copies of his manuscripts  for he is a great author  He has composed I know not how many homilies  and still goes on composing more every day  which he delivers to the high edification of his audience  As you seem to be just the thing for him  I have mentioned your name  and he has promised to take you  Go  and make your bow to him as from me  you will judge  by his reception of you  whether my recommendation has been couched in handsome terms   The situation was  to all appearance  exactly what I should have picked out for myself  That being the case  with such an arrangement of my air and person as seemed most likely to square with the ideas of a reverend prelate  I presented myself one morning before the archbishop  If this were a gorgeous romance  and not a grave history  here might we introduce a pompous description of the episcopal palace  with architectural digressions on the structure of the building  here would be the place to expatiate on the costliness of the furniture like an upholsterer  to criticise the statues and pictures like a connoisseur  and the pictures themselves would be nothing to the uninformed reader  without the stories they represent  till universal history  fabulous and authentic  sacred and profane  should be pressed into the service  But I shall content myself with modestly stating  that the royal palace itself is scarcely superior in magnificence   Throughout the suite of apartments  there was a complete mob of ecclesiastics and other officers  consisting of chaplains  ushers  upper and menial servants  Those of them who were laymen were most superbly attired  one would sooner have taken them for temporal nobility than for spiritual understrappers  They were as proud as the devil  and gave themselves intolerably consequential airs  I could not help laughing
