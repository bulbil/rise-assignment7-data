these happy tidings  and must return immediately to put the last hand to my work  With these words  he left me  and went back to court  At the week s end my expeditious agent returned  with the intelligence that the prince had procured my liberty  not without some difficulty  On the same day my generous keeper confirmed the assurance in person  with the kindest congratulations  and the following notice     Your prison doors are open  but on two conditions  which I am sorry that my duty obliges me to announce  because they will probably be disagreeable to you  His majesty expressly forbids you to shew your face at court  or to be found within the limits of the two Castiles on this day month  I am extremely sorry that you are interdicted from court  And I am delighted at it  answered I  Witness all the powers above  I asked the king for only one favour  he has granted me two   With my liberty thus confirmed  I hired a couple of mules  on which we mounted the next day  after taking leave of Cogollos  and thanking Tordesillas a thousand times for all his instances of friendship  We set forward cheerfully on the road to Madrid  to draw our deposit out of Signor Gabriel s hands  amounting to a thousand doubloons  On the road my fellow traveller observed  If we are not rich enough to purchase a splendid property  we can at least secure ease and competency to ourselves  A cabin  answered I  would be large enough for my most ambitious thoughts  Though scarcely at the middle period of life  the world has lost its charms for me  its hopes  its fears  its cares  its duties  are all absorbed in the selfishness of philosophical retirement  Independently of these principles  I can assure you I have painted for myself a rural landscape  with a foreground of innocent pleasures  and pastoral simplicity in the perspective  Already does the enamel of the meadows glitter under my eyes  already does the river s murmur accord with the winged chorus of the grove  hunting exasperates the manly virtues  and fishing preaches patience  Only figure to yourself  my friend  what a continual round of amusement solitude may furnish  and you will pant to be admitted of her crew  Then for the economy of our table  the simplest will be the cheapest  and of course the best  Unadulterated Ceres shall be our official caterer  when hunger shall have tamed our fastidious appetites into sobriety  a mumbled crust will relish like an ortolan  The supreme delight of eating is not in the thing ate  but in the palate of him who eats  a proposition in culinary philosophy  proved by the frequent loathing of my own stomach  through a long series of ministerial dinners  Abstemiousness is a luxury of the most exquisite refinement  and the best recipe in the materia medica   With your good leave  Signor Gil Blas  interrupted my secretary  I am not altogether of your mind respecting the luscious treat of abstemiousness  Why should we mess like the bankrupt sages of antiquity  Surely we may indulge the carnal man a little  without any reasonable offence to the spiritual  Since we have  by the blessing of Providence and my forecast  wherewithal to keep the spit and the spigot in exercise  do not let us take up our abode with famine and wretchedness  As soon as we get settled  we must stock our cellar  and establish a respectable larder  like people who know what is what  and do not separate themselves from the vulgar crowd to renounce the good things of this life  but to taste them with a more exquisite relish  As Hesiod says  Enjoy thy riches with a liberal soul Plenteous the feast  all smiling be the bowl  And again To stint the wine a frugal husband shows When from the middle of the cask it flows   What the devil  Master Scipio  interrupted I in my turn  you can cap verses out of the Greek poets  And pray where did you get acquainted with Hesiod  In very learned company  answered he  I lived some time with a walking dictionary at Salamanca  a fellow up to the elbows in quotation and commentary  He could put a large volume together like a house of cards  His library furnished him with a hodge podge of Hebrew  Greek  and Latin common places  which he translated into buckram Castilian  As I was his transcriber  some tags of verses  stings of epigrams  and sage truisms stuck by the way  With such an apparatus  replied I  your memory must be most philosophically stocked  But  not to lose sight of our future prospects  whereabouts in Spain had we best fix our Socratic abode  My voice is for Arragon  resumed my counsellor  We shall there enjoy all the beauties of nature  and lead the life of Paradise  Well  then  for Arragon  said I  May it teem with all the dear delights that youthful poets fancy when they dream       CH  X     Their doings at Madrid  The rencounter of Gil Blas in the street  and its consequences   ON our arrival in Madrid  we alighted at a little
