bashfully  it was hardly noticeable  and  because unnoticed  I paid my compliments in a deeper courtesy  And then  finding my hand in his  when I knew not whether I had an hand or not—I am grieved  Sir  sad I  to be the occasion  to be the cause—And I sighed for one reason  perhaps you can guess what that was  and blushed for two  because I knew not what to say  nor how to look  and because I was under obligations which I could not return   He kindly saved my further confusion  by making light of what had passed  And  leading me to a seat  took his place by me   May I ask  Sir Charles —said my cousin Reeves  and stopt   The conversation was too tedious  and too various  to be minutely related  Mr  Reeves  But Sir Hargrave had  by Mr  Bagenhall s desire  got his shorthand writer in a closet  and that unknown to me  till all was over  I am to have a copy of what passed  You shall see it  if you please  when it is sent me  Mean time  what think you of a compromise at your expence  Miss Byron   I dare abide by every thing that Sir Charles Grandison has stipulated for me     32 It would be cruelty to keep a Lady in suspence  where doubt will give her pain  and cannot end in pleasure  Sir Hargrave is resolv d to wait upon you  Are you willing to see him   If  Sir  you would advise me to see him   I advise nothing  Madam  Pursue your inclinations  Mr  Reeves is at liberty to admit whom he pleases into his House  Miss Byron to see in it  or wheresoever she is  whom she pleases  I told him my mind very freely  But I left him determined to wait on you  I have reason to believe he will behave very well  I should be surprised  if he does not in the humblest manner ask your pardon  and yours  Mr  Reeves  and your Lady s  But if you have any apprehensions  Madam  to me  I will be ready to attend you at five minutes notice  before he shall be admitted to your presence   It is very good  Sir  said Mr  Reeves  to be ready to favour Miss Byron with your countenance on such an occasion  But I hope we need not give you that trouble in this house   Sir Charles went away soon after  and Mr  Reeves has been accusing himself ever since  with answering him too abruptly  tho  he meant nothing but the truest respect  And yet as I have written it  on re perusal  I don t above half like Mr  Reeves s answer  But where high respect is entertained  grateful hearts will always  I believe  be accusing themselves of imperfections  which none other see  or can charge them with   As Sir Charles is safe  and I have now nothing to apprehend but Sir Hargrave s visit  I will dispatch this Letter  with assurances that I am  my dear Lucy   Your ever affectionate HARRIET BYRON     33  LETTER IV  Miss HARRIET BYRON  To Miss LUCY SELBY    Friday  One o Clock  Mar  3   SIR Charles had just sent the impatiently expected Paper  transcribed by the short hand writer from his minutes of the conversation that passed on Sir Charles s intrepid visit at Sir Hargrave s  Intrepid  I call it  But had I known of it  as Mr  Reeves did  before the event  in some measure  justified the rashness  I should have called it rash  and been for proposing to send Peace officers to Cavendish Square  or taking some method to know whether he were safe in his person  especially when three o clock approached  and his dinner time is earlier than that of most other people of fashion   Mr  Reeves has been so good as to undertake to transcribe this long paper for me  that I may have time to give you an account of three particular visits which I have received  I asked Mr  Reeves  If it were not a strange way of proceeding in this Bagenhall to have his short hand writer  and now turned listener  always with him  He answered  It was not a usual way  but  in cases of this nature  where murder  and a tryal  were expected to follow the rashness  in a court of justice  he thought it carried with it  tho  a face of premeditation  yet a look of fairness  and there was no doubt but the man had been in bad scrapes before now  and was willing to use every precaution for the future   The PAPER   On Thursday morning  March the 2d  17   I Henry Cotes  according to notice given me the preceding evening  went to the house of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  Baronet  in Cavendish Square  about half an hour after eight in the morning  in order to take   34 minutes  in short hand  of a conversation that was expected
