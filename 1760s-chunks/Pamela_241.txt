entertainment at some inn on the way  put up   their rest there  and never think of pursuing their journey to their   proper home   This  I remember  was often a reflection of my good   lady s  to whom I owe it          Eleven o clock       Mrs  Jewkes has been with me  and asked if I will have her for a   bed fellow  in want of a better  I thanked her  but I said  I would see   how it was to be by myself one night       I might have mentioned  that I made Mrs  Jewkes dine and sup with me    and she was much pleased with it  and my behaviour to her  And I could   see  by her manner  that she was a little struck inwardly at some of her   former conduct to me  But  poor wretch  it is much  I fear  because I am   what I am  for she has otherwise very little remorse I doubt  Her talk   and actions are entirely different from what they used to be  quite   circumspect and decent  and I should have thought her virtuous  and even   pious  had I never known her in another light       By this we may see  my dear father and mother  of what force example is    and what is in the power of the heads of families to do  And this shews    that evil examples  in superiors  are doubly pernicious  and doubly   culpable  because such persons are bad themselves  and not only do no   good  but much harm to others  and the condemnation of such must  to be   sure  be so much the greater   And how much the greater still must my   condemnation be  who have had such a religious education under you    and been so well nurtured by my good lady  if I should forget  with all   these mercies heaped upon me  what belongs to the station I am preferred   to   O how I long to be doing some good  For all that is past yet  is   my dear  dear master s  God bless him  and return him safe to my wishes    for methinks  already   tis a week since I saw him  If my love would not   be troublesome and impertinent  I should be nothing else  for I have a   true grateful spirit  and I had need to have such a one  for I am poor   in every thing but will          Tuesday morning  eleven o clock       My dear  dear  master  I m sure I should still say  but I will learn to   rise to a softer epithet  now and then  is not yet come  I hope he is   safe and well   So Mrs  Jewkes and I went to breakfast  But I can do   nothing but talk and think of him  and all his kindness to me  and to   you  which is still me  more intimately   I have just received a letter   from him  which he wrote overnight  as I find by it  and sent early this   morning  This is a copy of it             TO MRS  ANDREWS          MY DEAREST PAMELA  Monday night        I hope my not coming home this night will not frighten you  You may   believe I can t help it  My poor friend is so very ill  that I doubt he   can t recover  His desires to have me stay with him are so strong  that   I shall sit up all night with him  as it is now near one o clock in the   morning  for he can t bear me out of his sight  And I have made him and   his distressed wife and children so easy  in the kindest assurances I   could give him of my consideration for him and them  that I am looked   upon  as the poor disconsolate widow  as she  I doubt  will soon be    tells me   as their good angel  I could have wished we had not engaged   to the good neighbourhood at Sir Simon s for to morrow night  but I am   so desirous to set out on Wednesday for the other house  that  as well   as in return for the civilities of so many good friends  who will be   there on purpose  I would not put it off  What I beg of you  therefore    my dear  is  that you would go in the chariot to Sir Simon s  the sooner   in the day the better  because you will
