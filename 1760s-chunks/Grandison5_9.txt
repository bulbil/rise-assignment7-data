 she should be impatient  and we should lose the ground we had gained   I laid before the young Lady  in presence of her mother and Mrs Beaumont  in a plain and simple manner  my obligation to leave her for a few days  and the reason for it  To Florence  said she  Does not Lady Olivia live at Florence —She does  usually  answered Mrs  Beaumont  But she is abroad on her travels   Well  Sir  it is not for me to detain you  if you have business  But what will become of my poor Jeronymo in the mean time —But  before I could answer  What a silly question is that  I will be his comforter   Father Marescotti just then entered—O Father  rambled the poor Lady  you have not prayed with me for a long time  O  Sir  I am an undone creature  I am a lost soul —She fell on her knees  and with tears bemoaned herself   She endeavoured  after this  to recollect what she had been talking of before  We make it a rule not to suffer her  if we can help it  to puzzle and perplex herself  by aiming at recollection  and therefore I told her what was our subject  She fell into it again with chearfulness—Well  Sir  and when may Jeronymo expect you again —In about ten days  I told her  And taking her hint  I added  that I doubted not but she would comfort Signor Jeronymo in my absence  She promised she would  and wished me happy   I attended Mrs  Beaumont accordingly  I concluded  Page  23 to my satisfaction  all that remained unadjusted of my Emily s affairs  in two days after my arrival at Florence  I had a happy two days more with Mrs  Beaumont  and the Ladies her friends  and I stole a visit out of the ten days to the Count of Belvedere  at Parma   This excursion was of benefit to my health  and having had a Letter from Mr  Lowther  as I had desired at Modena  in my way to Parma  with very favourable news  in relation both to the sister and brother  I returned to Bologna  and met with a joyful reception from the Marquis  his Lady  the Bishop  and Jeronymo  who all joined to give me a share in the merit that was principally due to Mr  Lowther  and his assistants  with regard to the brother s amendment  and to their own soothing methods of treating the beloved sister  who followed strictly the prescriptions of her physicians   I was introduced to Lady Clementina by her mother  attended only by Camilla  The young Lady met me at the entrance of her antechamber  with a dignity like that which used to distinguish her in her happier days  You are welcome  Chevalier  said she  But you kept not your time  I have set it down  pulling out her pocket book—Ten days  madam  I told you ten days  I am exactly to my time—You shall see that  I cannot be mistaken  smiling  But her smiles were not quite her own   She referred me to her book  You have reckoned two days twice over  madam  See here—  Is it possible —I once  Sir  was a better accomptant  Well  but we will not stand upon two days in so many  I have taken great care of Jeronymo in your absence  I have attended him several times  and would have seen him oftener  but they told me there was no need   I thanked her for her care of my friend—  That s good enough  said she  to thank me for the care of myself  Jeronymo is myself   Page  24 Signor Jeronymo  replied I  cannot be dearer to his sister than he is to me   You are a good man  returned she  and laid her hand upon my arm  I always said so  But  Chevalier  I have quite forgot my English  I shall never recover it  What happy times were those  when I was innocent  and was learning English   My beloved young Lady  said Camilla  was always innocent   No  Camilla —No —And then she began to ramble—And taking Camilla under the arm  whispering  Let us go together  to that corner of the room  and pray to God to forgive us  You  Camilla  have been wicked as well as I   She went and kneeled down  and held up her hands in silence  Then rising  she came to her mother  and kneeled to her  her hands lifted up—Forgive me  forgive your poor child  my mamma   God bless my child  Rise  my Love —I do forgive you —But do you forgive me  tears trickling down her cheeks  for ever suffering you to go out of my own sight  for delivering you into the management of less kind  and less indulgent relations   And God forgive them too  rising  Some of them made me crazy  and then upbraided me with being so  God forgive them  I do   She then came to me  and  to my great surprize
