accident  that your father  however  had been forced out of the room from the colonel  as talking did much injury to the latter  and that the old gentleman  upon withdrawing  said something about altering his will  Butler added  that   7 your brother desired a visit from me above all things  and he believed would request a favour of that kind if he was any way better in the morning   You conjure me by all our friendship  my dearest Louisa  to give you a minute account of every thing  to mitigate no description  and to conceal no distress  I obey you  though against my inclinanation  as I know how a sensibility like your s must be wounded by a repetition of some circumstances  but my sweet  my ever amiable friend  exert your utmost resolution  and prepare to meet those evils with fortitude  which are impossible to be avoided—True magnanimity is never seen till the day of distress  and those have naturally the noblest minds who make the firmest stand against affliction     8From some things which have escaped your brother since I wrote the foregoing part of this letter  I have reason to imagine that Sir Robert Harold was not altogether so much in fault  in the late rencounter  as we were inclined to imagine  colonel Mildmay himself acknowledges  that he used every provocation before he could prevail upon the baronet to engage  and he even intimates  that Sir Robert was actually going to town with an intention of throwing himself at your feet  and imploring your forgiveness—If this was the case  it was certainly rash in the colonel to carry matters to such an extremity  he ought to consider that the happiness of more people than one is dependent upon his welfare  and that the hazarding of his life may increase the general misfortune  but can never have the smallest tendency to remove it  but he has too nice a sensibility for his own ease  and is frequently running   9 into real ills to avoid imaginary misfortunes  You know  my dear  my partiality for your brother  and you also know that  on the present occasion  prudence will not allow me to give such a loose to my feelings as I should naturally shew  were we on such a footing as you have frequently wished us—Perhaps  it may be something of this very partiality which induces me to wish  that  in the course of the recent transaction  he had made use of a little less spirit  and a little more understanding  You cannot conceive  my dearest Louisa  how it distresses me to think of his situation  to find myself in the same house with him  and yet to be under a necessity of seeming only a friendly partaker in the common calamity—This cruel constraint is too much  and I pine  I sicken  I die  for an interview with him  though I am sensible such a circumstance in his present condition must fill me with the   10 most poignant affliction  hitherto he has never said a single syllable that could furnish a reasonable hope of his considering me with any tenderness of prepossession  but he has nevertheless been studious to gain my good opinion  though he has declined to solicit for my love  and I have a strong notion that he intends to be particular the very first opportunity  my heart at least interprets things in that sense  and who knows—But my sweet Louisa forgive me  how could I possibly indulge the most distant thought of happiness  while you are sinking under the deepest distress  and while the life of the dear youth is at stake  on whom my whole happiness so materially depends  O  Louisa  excuse the woman at my heart  which  in spite of my best efforts  would talk about your brother  though the share which you know I partake in his danger must add in a very considerable   11 degree to your anxiety  If possible  I will forbear to mention him with regard  that I may avoid wounding so nice a part of your sensibility  since I am conscious with what a generous concern you feel for your Harriot  and am but too apprehensive that this concern will lead you into some self accusations equally injurious to the recovery of your own peace  and the stability of her friendship   In my last  I told you that my mother  upon hearing what an unexpected cloud had overcast the happiness of your family  gave me permission to stay for a few days with her dear Mrs  Mildmay  tenderly as well as wisely considering  that  in the present state of things  her venerable friend would naturally want somebody to sooth the anguish of her mind  who was really interested in her distress  You cannot conceive how kindly the worthy lady  your mother  has   12 received this little instance of our attachment—She wept over me when I mentioned my design to remain at Mildmay Hall till my attendance became unnecessary  and  ardently pressing me to her bosom  condescended to kiss my cheek  and called me her true Harriot  her other Louisa—Ever since she has honoured me with a more than common share of her confidence  is desirous of being alone with me upon every occasion  and you may easily conjecture  my ever amiable girl  what subject principally engrosses our
