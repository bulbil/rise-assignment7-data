fool   I hope these gentlemen will not follow me to town  as they threaten  If they do  I will not see them  if I can any way avoid it  Yet  for me to appear to them solicitous on this head  or to desire them not to go  will be in some measure to lay myself under an obligation to   13 their acquiescence  It is not therefore for me to hope to influence them in this matter  since they expect too much in return for it from me  and since they will be ready to found a merit in their passion  even for disobliging me   I cannot bear  however  to think of their dangling after me where ever I go  These men  my dear  were we to give them importance with us  would be greater infringers of our natural freedom than the most severe Parents  and for their own sakes  Whereas Parents  if ever so despotic  if not unnatural ones indeed  mean solely our good  tho  headstrong girls do not always think so  Yet such  even such  can be teazed out of their wills  at least out of their duty  by the men who stile themselves Lovers  when they are invincible to all the entreaties and commands of their Parents   O that the next eight or ten years of my life  if I find not in the interim a man  on whom my whole undivided heart can fix  were happily over  As happily as the last alike important four years  To be able to look down from the elevation of thirty years  my principles fix d  and to have no capital folly to reproach myself with  what an happiness would that be   My Cousin Reeves s time of setting out holds  the indulgence of my dearest Friends continues  and my resolution holds  But I will see my Nancy before I set out  What  shall I enter upon a party of pleasure  and leave in my heart room to reflect  in the midst of it  that there is a dear suffering friend who had reason to think I was afraid of giving myself pain  when I might  by the balm of true love and friendly soothings  administer comfort to her wounded heart —No  my Lucy  believe me  if I have not generosity enough  I have selfishness enough  to make me avoid a sting so severe as this would be  to  Your HARRIET BYRON     14  LETTER IV  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Grosvenor Street Tuesday  Jan  24   WE are just arrived  We had a very agreeable journey   I need not tell you that Mr  Greville and Mr  Fenwick attended us to our first baiting  and had a genteel dinner ready provided for us  The gentlemen will tell you this  and all particulars   They both renewed their menaces of following me to London  if I stay d above one month  They were so good as to stretch their fortnight to a month   Mr  Fenwick  in very pathetic terms  as he found an opportunity to engage me alone for a few minutes  besought me to love him  Mr  Greville was as earnest with me to declare  that I hated him  Such a declaration  he said  was all he at present wished for  It was strange  he told me  that he neither could prevail on me to encourage his Love  nor to declare my Hatred  He is a whimsical creature   I rallied him with my usual freedom  and told him  that if there was one person in the world that I was capable of hating  I could make the less scruple to oblige him  He thank d me for that   The two gentlemen would fain have proceeded farther  But as they are never out of their way  I dare say  they would have gone to London  and there have dangled on till we should not have got rid of them  for my whole time of being in town   I was very gravely earnest with them to leave us  when we stept into the coach in order to proceed  Fenwick  you dog  said Mr  Greville  we must return  Miss Byron looks grave  Gravity  and a rising colour in the finest face in the world  indicates as much as the frowns of other Beauties  And in the most respectful manner they both took leave of me    15 insisting  however  on my hand  and that I would wish them well   I gave each my hand  I wish you very well  gentlemen  said I  And I am obliged to your civility in seeing me so far on my journey  Especially as you are so kind as to leave me here   Why  dear Madam  did you not spare your Especially  said Mr  Greville —Come  Fenwick  let us retire  and lay our two loggerheads together  and live over again the past hour  and then hang ourselves   Poor Mr  Orme  The coach  at our first setting out  passed by his Park gate  you know  There was he—on the very ridge of the highway  I saw him not
