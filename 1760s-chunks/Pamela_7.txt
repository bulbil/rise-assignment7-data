DEAR PAMELA       I cannot but renew my cautions on your master s kindness  and his free   expression to you about the stockings  Yet there may not be  and I hope   there is not  any thing in it  But when I reflect  that there possibly   may  and that if there should  no less depends upon it than my child s   everlasting happiness in this world and the next  it is enough to make   one fearful for you  Arm yourself  my dear child  for the worst  and   resolve to lose your life sooner than your virtue  What though the   doubts I filled you with  lessen the pleasure you would have had in your   master s kindness  yet what signify the delights that arise from a few   paltry fine clothes  in comparison with a good conscience       These are  indeed  very great favours that he heaps upon you  but so   much the more to be suspected  and when you say he looked so amiably    and like an angel  how afraid I am  that they should make too great an   impression upon you  For  though you are blessed with sense and prudence   above your years  yet I tremble to think  what a sad hazard a poor   maiden of little more than fifteen years of age stands against the   temptations of this world  and a designing young gentleman  if he should   prove so  who has so much power to oblige  and has a kind of authority   to command  as your master       I charge you  my dear child  on both our blessings  poor as we are  to   be on your guard  there can be no harm in that  And since Mrs  Jervis is   so good a gentlewoman  and so kind to you  I am the easier a great deal    and so is your mother  and we hope you will hide nothing from her  and   take her counsel in every thing  So  with our blessings  and assured   prayers for you  more than for ourselves  we remain       Your loving FATHER AND MOTHER       Be sure don t let people s telling you  you are pretty  puff you up  for   you did not make yourself  and so can have no praise due to you for   it  It is virtue and goodness only  that make the true beauty  Remember   that  Pamela                LETTER IX         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I am sorry to write you word  that the hopes I had of going to wait on   Lady Davers  are quite over  My lady would have had me  but my master    as I heard by the by  would not consent to it  He said her nephew might   be taken with me  and I might draw him in  or be drawn in by him  and he   thought  as his mother loved me  and committed me to his care  he ought   to continue me with him  and Mrs  Jervis would be a mother to me  Mrs    Jervis tells me the lady shook her head  and said  Ah  brother  and that   was all  And as you have made me fearful by your cautions  my heart   at times misgives me  But I say nothing yet of your caution  or my own   uneasiness  to Mrs  Jervis  not that I mistrust her  but for fear she   should think me presumptuous  and vain and conceited  to have any fears   about the matter  from the great distance between such a gentleman  and   so poor a girl  But yet Mrs  Jervis seemed to build something upon Lady   Davers s shaking her head  and saying  Ah  brother  and no more  God  I   hope  will give me his grace  and so I will not  if I can help it  make   myself too uneasy  for I hope there is no occasion  But every little   matter that happens  I will acquaint you with  that you may continue to   me your good advice  and pray for                                     Your sad hearted PAMELA                LETTER X         DEAR MOTHER       You and my good father may wonder you have not had a letter from me in   so many weeks  but a sad  sad scene  has been the occasion of it  For to
