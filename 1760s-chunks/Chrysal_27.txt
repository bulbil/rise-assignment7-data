into the   public fund  as may be proved by many examples of small poor   states conquering large wealthy ones  Whereas the spirit of com    merce centres all in self  discouraging and despising as folly every   thought which does not tend that way   and so breaking that una    nimity which is the very essence of power  and only can give it   success   a reflection this  my son  which observation confirnas too   strongly at present  and which seems to overcast the prospect of   this happy nation        My advice to you  therefore  is  to retire from business  though   not to idleness  You will have a fortune that will make you of   consequence in the state  and give you sufficient employment in   the conduct of it  without embarrassing your mind with anxiety   for more  And  to enable you to follow this advice with the greatest   ease  I have settled all my affairs  and shall leave you free from   every entanglement of life  This is the advice  the request  of a   fond father  who desires compliance from his dear son  and would   not force unwilling obedience by an act of authority or command    But should the love of business have taken such a hold of your   heart  as habit gave it of mine  and not permit you to comply with   this request  take  my son  the advice of experience  and hold fast   the clue it offers to guide you through the labjrrinths of trade  in   which the vivacity of your genius may otherwise lose its way  Nor   are the rules I shall hint to you many to be remembered  or difficult   to be observed        Be just  my son  in all your dealings   wrong not individuals     nor defraud the pubUc        These are all the rules I recommend   but in them is comprised   more than  perhaps  appears at first view  Do not therefore think   them too obvious to have been necessary to be repeated  nor let   the mention of them give offence by any seeming implication of   personal doubt        In the business of a merchant these rules comprehend a great   extent of meaning  though I shall mention but a few instances of it   at present        As for the first  every misrepresentation to mislead ignorance   or abuse credulity  every taking advantage by superior knowledge    is a wrong to the party so deceived   as every artifice to evade the   intention of the legislature is a fraud against the public  nay    against yourself  and every individual who claims the benefits   provided by the ordinances  so defeated of their support        This indeed is so obvious that it were an aiiront to reason to   insist on any proof of it  The most eager pursuer of illicit trade   wiU not vindicate a general indulgence of it   and if it is not lawful   for aU  how can it be for him   or with what colour can he claim   a profit which he is conscious arises only from deceit  and from the   benefit of those very laws which he thus defeats        The temptations to this breach of honesty  I own  are many   and great  and some of them perhaps plausible  particularly in those         8 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     branches of trade which seem to bear a more than equal share of   the weight imposed for general advantage  But  in opposition to   this  it must be considered that it is impossible to provide so exactly   for a thing of so fluctuating a nature as trade  that the balance   shall not incline  in some one instance   and that it must  by the   same motion which oppresses one be favourable to some other  and   so preserve the equipoise in the whole   and this obviates the only   shadow of an argument that can be brought in defence of this too   common practice        As for the former  of avoiding private wrong  that is more diffi    cult and less defensible  if possible  than even this  For where aU   the powers of the mind are turned to make advantage  it is very   hard to refrain from taking it  where we ought not  and bringing the   great business of Ufe into common practice in its minutest concerns        The man whose soul is on the stretch to take advantage in a   bargain for thousands on the Exchange  will be apt  perhaps in    sensibly  to overlook an error that is not to his disadvantage
