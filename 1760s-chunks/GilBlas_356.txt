will be puzzled to guess how  When vessels clear out from Seville or Lisbon for those parts of the world  he ships wine  oil  grain  and other articles  the produce of his own estate  and his consignments are duty free  With that perquisite in his pocket  he sells his merchandise for four times its current price in Spain  and then lays out the money in spices  colouring materials  and other things which cost next to nothing in the new world  and are sold very dear in Europe  Already has he realized some millions by this traffic  without detracting from the dues of his royal master   You will easily account for it  continued he  that the people concerned in carrying on this trade return with great fortunes in their pockets  for my lord thinks it but reasonable that they should divide their diligence between his business and their own   That shrewd son of chance and opportunity  of whom we are speaking  overheard our conversation  and could not help interrupting Don Raymond to the following purport  Upon my word  Signor Caporis  I should like to be one of those people  for I am fond of travelling  and have long wished to see Mexico  Your inclinations as a tourist shall soon be gratified  said the steward  if Signor de Santillane will not stand in the way of your wishes  However particular I may think it my duty to be about the persons whom I send to the West Indies in that capacity  and they are all of my appointment  you shall be placed on the list at all adventures  if your master wishes it  You will confer on me a particular favour  said I to Don Raymond  be so good as to do it in kindness to me  Scipio is a young fellow much in my good graces  very capable in business  and will be found irreproachable in his conduct  In a word  I would as soon answer for him as myself   That being the case  replied Caporis  he has only to repair immediately to Seville  the ships are to sail for South America in a month  I shall give him a letter at his departure for a man who will put him in the way of making a fortune  without the slightest interference in his excellency s dues and profits  which ought to be held sacred by him   Scipio  delighted with his berth  was in haste to set out for Seville with a thousand crowns with which I furnished him  to make purchases of wine and oil in Andalusia  and enable him to trade on his own bottom in the West Indies  And yet  overjoyed as he was to make a voyage  and as he hoped his fortune therewithal  he could not part from me without tears  and the separation raised the waters even from my dry fountains       CH  XII     Don Alphonso de Leyva comes to Madrid  the motive of his journey a severe affliction to Gil Blas  and a cause of rejoicing subsequent thereon   No sooner had I parted with Scipio than one of the minister s pages brought me a note conceived in the following terms   If Signor de Santillane will take the trouble of calling at the sign of Saint Gabriel  in the Street of Toledo  he will there see a friend who is not indifferent to him    Who can this nameless friend possibly be  said I to myself  What can be the meaning of all this mystery  Obviously to occasion me the pleasure of a surprise  I attended the summons immediately  and on my arrival at the place appointed  was not a little astonished to find Don Alphonso de Leyva there  Is it possible  exclaimed I  you here  my lord  Yes  my dear Gil Blas  answered he with a close compression of my hand in his  it is Don Alphonso himself  Well  but what brings you to Madrid  said I  You will be not a little startled  rejoined he  and no less vexed at the occasion of my journey  They have taken my government of Valencia from me  and the prime minister has sent for me to give an account of my conduct  For a whole quarter of an hour I was like a man stupefied  then recovering the powers of speech  Of what  said I  are you accused  I know nothing at all about it  answered he  but my disgrace is probably owing to a visit paid about three weeks ago to the Cardinal Duke of Lerma  who was banished about a month since to his seat at Denia   Yes  indeed  cried I in a pet  you may well attribute your misfortune to that imprudent visit  there is no occasion to look out for causes and effects else where  but give me leave to say that you have not acted with your usual good sense  in claiming acquaintance with that favourite out of favour  The leap is taken  and the neck broken  said he  and I have nothing to do but to make the best out of a bad bargain  I shall retire with my family to our paternal estate at Leyva  where the remnant of my days will glide away in peace and obscurity
