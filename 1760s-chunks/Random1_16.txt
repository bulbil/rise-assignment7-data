for the love he bears to me  and let you want for nothing  and it shall go hard  but I will see him one day repaid —No more at present  but rests  Your dutiful uncle and servant  till death  Thomas Eowling   This letter  which with the other was dated from Port Lou s in Hispaniola  was no sooner read  than the apothecary shaking his head  began —   I have a very great regard for Mr    36 Bowling  that s certain —and could be well content—but times are very hard —There s no such thingas money to be got—I believe  tis all vanished under ground  for my part —Besides  I have been out of pocket already  having entertained you since the beginning of this month  without receiving a six pence —and G—d knows if ever I shall —for I believe it will go hard with your uncle —And more than that  I was thinking of giving you warning  for I want your apartment for a new  prentice  whom I expect from the country every hour —So  I desire you will this week provide yourself with another lodging  —  The indignation which this harangue inspired  gave me spirits to support my reverse of fortune  and to tell him  I despised his mean  selfish disposition so much  that I would rather starve than be beholden to him for one single meal  Upon which  out of my pocket money  I paid him to the last farthing of what I owed  and assured him  I would not sleep another night under his roof —This said  I sallied out  in a transport of rage and sorrow  without knowing whither to fly for shelter  having not one friend in the world capable of relieving me  and only three shillings in my purse —After giving way for a few minutes to the dictates of my rage  I went and hired a small bed room at the rate of one shilling and six pence per week  which I was obliged to pay per advance  before the landlord would receive me  hither I removed my luggage  and next morning got up  with a view of craving the advice and assistance of a person who had on all occasions  loaded me with caresses  and made frequent offers of friendship  while I was under   37 no necessity of accepting them —He received me with his wonted affability  and insisted on my breakfasting with him  which I did not think fit to refuse —But when I communicated the occasion of my visit  he appeared so disconcerted  that I concluded him wonderfully affected with the misery of my condition  and looked upon him as a man of the most extensive sympathy and benevolence —He did no leave me long under this mistake  for recovering himself out of his confusion  he told me  he was grieved at my misfortune  and desired to know what had passed between my landlord Mr  Potion and me  Whereupon I recounted the conversation  and when I repeated the answer I made to his ungenerous remonstrance with regard to my leaving his house  this pretended friend affected a stare  and exclaimed    Is it possible you could behave so ill to the man who had treated you so kindly all along  —  My surprise at hearing this  was not at all affected  whatever his might be  and I gave him to understand  with some warmth  that I did not imagine he would so unreasonably espouse the cause of a scoundrel  who ought to be expelled from every social community —This heat of mine  gave him all the advantage he desired over me  and our discourse  after much altercation  concluded in his desiring never to see me again in that place  to which I yielded my consent  assuring him  that had I been as well acquainted with his principles formerly as I was now  he never should have had an opportunity to make that request —And thus we parted     On my return  I met my old comrade  squire Gawky  whom his father had sent  some time ago  to town  for his improvement in writing    38 dancing  fencing  and to see the world  As I had lived with him  since his arrival  on the footing of our old intimacy  I made no scruple of informing him of the lowness of my circumstances  and asking a small supply of money  to answer my present expence  upon which he pulled out an handful of half pence with a shilling or two among them  and swore that was all he had to keep his pocket till next quarter day  having lost the greatest part of his allowance the night before at billiards  Though this might very well be true  I was extremely mortified at his indifference  for he neither discovered any sympathy for my mishap  nor desire of alleviating my distress  and accordingly  I left him without uttering one word  But when I afterwards understood  that he was the person who had formerly betrayed me to the malice of my cousins  to whom likewise he had carried the tidings of my forlorn situation  which afforded them great matter of triumph and exultation  I determined with myself to call him to a severe account  for which purpose  I borrowed a sword  and wrote
