and   pacified       When we came out of the garden  his chariot was ready  and he said    Well  sister  I had most assuredly gone away towards my other house  if   things had not taken this happy turn  and  if you please  instead of   it  you and I will take an airing  And pray  my dear  said he to me  bid   Mrs  Jewkes order supper by eight o clock  and we shall then join you       Sir  added he  to her nephew  will you take your horse and escort us  I   will  said he  and am glad  at my soul  to see you all so good friends       So my dear lord and master handed my lady into his chariot  and her   kinsman and his servants rode after them and I went up to my closet to   ruminate on these things  And  foolish thing that I am  this poor Miss   Sally Godfrey runs into my head   How soon the name and quality of a   wife gives one privileges  in one s own account   Yet  methinks  I want   to know more about her  for  is it not strange  that I  who lived   years in the family  should have heard nothing of this  But I was so   constantly with my lady  that I might the less hear of it  for she  I   dare say  never knew it  or she would have told me       But I dare not ask him about the poor lady   Yet I wonder what became of   her  Whether she be living  And whether any thing came of it   May be I   shall hear full soon enough   But I hope not to any bad purpose       As to the other unhappy case  I know it was talked of  that in his   travels  before I was taken into the family long  he had one or two   broils  and  from a youth  he was always remarkable for courage  and is   reckoned a great master of his sword  God grant he may never be put to   use it  and that he may be always preserved in honour and safety       About seven o clock my master sent word  that he would have me not   expect him to supper  for that he  and my lady his sister  and nephew    were prevailed upon to stay with Lady Jones  and that Lady Darnford  and   Mr  Peters s family  had promised to meet them there  I was glad they   did not send for me  and the rather  as I hoped those good families   being my friends  would confirm my lady a little in my favour  and so I   followed my writing closely       About eleven o clock they returned  I had but just come down  having   tired myself with my pen  and was sitting talking with Mrs  Jewkes and   Mrs  Worden  whom I would  though unwillingly on their sides  make sit   down  which they did over against me  Mrs  Worden asked my pardon  in a   good deal of confusion  for the part she had acted against me  saying    That things had been very differently represented to her  and that she   little thought I was married  and that she was behaving so rudely to the   lady of the house       I said  I took nothing amiss  and very freely forgave her  and hoped my   new condition would not make me forget how to behave properly to every   one  but that I must endeavour to act not unworthy of it  for the honour   of the gentleman who had so generously raised me to it       Mrs  Jewkes said  that my situation gave me great opportunities of   shewing the excellence of my nature  that I could forgive offences   against me so readily  as she  for her own part  must always  she said    acknowledge  with confusion of face       People  said I  Mrs  Jewkes  don t know how they shall act  when their   wills are in the power of their superiors  and I always thought one   should distinguish between acts of malice  and of implicit obedience    though  at the same time  a person should know how to judge between   lawful and unlawful  And even the great  though at present angry they   are not obeyed  will afterwards have no ill opinion of a person for   withstanding them in their unlawful commands       Mrs  Jewkes seemed a little concerned at this  and I said  I spoke   chiefly from my own experience
