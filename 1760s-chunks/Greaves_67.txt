found his noble charger fastened to a tree  He forthwith untied and mounted him  then  laying the reins upon his neck  allowed him to choose his own path  in which he began to travel with equal steadiness and expedition  They had not proceeded far  when the knight s ears were again saluted by the cries of Crabshaw  which Bronzomarte no sooner heard  than he pricked up his ears  neighed  and quickened his pace  as if he had been sensible of the squire s distress  and hastened to his relief  Sir Launcelot  notwithstanding his own disquiet  could not help observing and admiring this generous sensibility of his horse  He began to think himself some hero of romance  mounted upon a winged steed  inspired with reason  directed by some humane enchanter  who pitied virtue in distress  All circumstances considered  it is no wonder that the commotion in the mind of our adventurer produced some such delirium  All night he continued the chase  the voice  which was repeated at intervals  still retreating before him  till the morning began to appear in the east  when  by divers piteous groans  he was directed to the corner of a wood  where he beheld his miserable squire stretched upon the grass  and Gilbert feeding by him altogether unconcerned  the helmet and the lance suspended at the saddle bow  and the portmanteau safely fixed upon the crupper   The knight  riding up to Crabshaw  with equal surprise and concern  asked what had brought him there  and Timothy  after some pause  during which he surveyed his master with a rueful aspect  answered   The devil  — One would imagine  indeed  you had some such conveyance   said Sir Launcelot   I have followed your cries since last evening  I know not how nor whither  and never could come up with you till this moment  But  say  what damage have you sustained  that you lie in that wretched posture  and groan so dismally    I can t guess   replied the squire   if it bean t that mai hoole carcase is drilled into oilet hools  and my flesh pinched into a jelly  — How  wherefore   cried the knight   who were the miscreants that treated you in such a barbarous manner  Do you know the ruffians  — I know nothing at all   answered the peevish squire   but that I was tormented by vive houndred and vifty thousand legions of devils  and there s an end oon t  — Well  you must have a little patience  Crabshaw—there s a salve for every sore  — Yaw mought as well tell ma  for every zow there s a zirreverence  — For a man in your condition  methinks you talk very much at your ease—try if you can get up and mount Gilbert  that you may be conveyed to some place where you can have proper assistance —So—well done—cheerly    Timothy actually made an effort to rise  but fell down again  and uttered a dismal yell  Then his master exhorted him to take advantage of a park wall  by which he lay  and raise himself gradually upon it  Crabshaw  eyeing him askance  said  by way of reproach  for his not alighting and assisting him in person   Thatch your house with t—d  and you ll have more teachers than reachers  —Having pronounced this inelegant adage  he made shift to stand upon his legs  and now  the knight lending a hand  was mounted upon Gilbert  though not without a world of ohs  and ahs  and other ejaculations of pain and impatience   As they jogged on together  our adventurer endeavoured to learn the particulars of the disaster which had befallen the squire  but all the information he could obtain  amounted to a very imperfect sketch of the adventure  By dint of a thousand interrogations  he understood  that Crabshaw had been  in the preceding evening  encountered by three persons on horseback  with Venetian masks on their faces  which he mistook for their natural features  and was terrified accordingly  That they not only presented pistols to his breast  and led his horse out of the highway  but pricked him with goads  and pinched him  from time to time  till he screamed with the torture  That he was led through unfrequented places across the country  sometimes at an easy trot  sometimes at full gallop  and tormented all night by those hideous demons  who vanished at daybreak  and left him lying on the spot where he was found by his master   This was a mystery which our hero could by no means unriddle  It was the more unaccountable  as the squire had not been robbed of his money  horses  and baggage  He was even disposed to believe that Crabshaw s brain was disordered  and the whole account he had given no more than a mere chimera  This opinion  however  he could no longer retain  when he arrived at an inn on the post road  and found  upon examination  that Timothy s lower extremities were covered with blood  and all the rest of his body speckled with livid marks of contusion  But he was still more chagrined when the landlord informed him  that he
