consented  though unwillingly  and  leaving me with all the exulting raptures of successful love  went to Florence to prepare a priest to unite us  promising to return with him in the morning  the next day passed  and the next  without my hearing of him  a whole week elapsed in the same manner  convinced of his affection  my fears were all for his safety  my imagination presented danger in every form  and  no longer able to support        2 86       the terrors of my mind filled with a thousand dreadful ideas  I sent a servant to enquire for him at the house where he lodged  who brought me word he had left Florence the very morning on which I expected his return  Those only who have loved like me can conceive what I felt at this news  but judge into what an abyss of misery I was plunged  on receiving a few hours after a letter from his sister  pressing me to return to her at Paris  where she was still waiting  in compliance with order from home for her brother  who was to accompany her to England directly  to marry an heiress for whom he had been long intended by his father  she added that I must not lose a moment  for that her brother would  before I could receive the letter  be on the road to Paris      Rage  love  pride  resentment  indignation  now tore my bosom alternately  After a conflict of different passions  I determined          2 87       on forgetting my unworthy lover  whose neglect appeared to me the contemptible insolence of superior fortune  I left the place the next day  as if for Paris  but  taking the nearest way to England  came hither to a clergyman s widow  who had been a friend of my mother s  to whom I told my story  and with whom I determined to stay concealed  till I heard the fate of my lover  I made a solemn vow  in the first heat of my resentment  never to write to him  or let him know my retreat  and  though with infinite difficulty  I have hitherto kept it  But what have I not suffered for this conduct  which  though my reason dictates  my heart condemns  A thousand times have I been on the point of discovering myself to him  and at least giving him an opportunity of vindicating himself  I accused myself of injustice in condemning him unheard  and on appearances which might be false  So weak is a heart in love  that  though  when I chose my place of retreat  I was ignorant        2 88       of that circumstance  it was with pleasure  though a pleasure I endeavoured to hide from myself  that I heard it was only ten miles from his father s eat  I ought certainly to have changed it on this knowledge  but find a thousand plausible reasons to the contrary  and am but too successful in deceiving myself      Convinced of the propriety of my conduct in avoiding him  I am not the more happy  My heart betrays me  and represents him continually to my imagination in the most amiable light  as a faithful lover  injured by my suspicions  and made wretched by my loss        Torn by sentiments which vary every moment  the struggles of my soul have impaired my health  and will in time put an end to a life  to the continuance of which  without him  I am perfectly indifferent            2 89          Determined  however  to persist in a conduct  which  whatever I suffer from it  is certainly my duty  I cannot  as I hear he is returned  consent to come to Belmont  where it is scarce possible I should fail meeting a man of his rank  who must undoubtedly be of Lord Belmont s acquaintance         Till he is married  or I am convinced I have injured him  I will not leave this retreat  at least I will not appear where I am almost certain of meeting him whom I ought for ever to avoid        Oh  Lady Anne  How severe is this trial  How painful the conquest over the sweetest affections of the human heart  How mortifying to love an object which one has ceased to esteem  Convinced of his unworthiness  my passion remains the same  nor will ever cease but with life  I at once despise and adore him  yes  my tenderness is  if possible  more lively than ever  and           2 90       though he has doomed me to misery  I would die to contribute to his happiness      You  Madam  will  I know  pity and forgive the inconsistencies of a heart ashamed of its own weaknesses  yet to sincere to disguise or palliate them
