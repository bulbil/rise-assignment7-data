 and to know how the puppy George  as he calls him  had behaved to me  After having satisfied himself in this enquiry  in a way the most favourable I could for my brother  I told him that as I had really found both him  and his lady extremely penitent and mortified  I had asked them to dine with me that day  I am glad of it  said he  very quick  I’llbe here to snoutch them  Dear Sir  said I  for heaven’s sake have a little compassion  you cannot conceive how humbled they are  they dare not look you in the face  and it was one of their conditions with me  before they would consent to come  that they should not see you  Ho  ho  said he  exultingly  have they changed their Note  Well  I will not distress you so far in your own house  as to mortify them with my company at dinner  but if I should take it in my head to drop in  in the afternoon  you must not take it amiss  I only want to see them look a little like fools   I could not venture to oppose him in this  but resolved to make it as easy as possible by preparing my brother and sister for his visit   I told him that would do extremely well  and he went away rejoicing at the thoughts of his intended triumph   Mr Warner had but just left me when I was surprized with a message that Sir George was below  I went down to him directly  and seeing him in his morning dress  imagined that something had happened which prevented their dining with me  and that he called to excuse himself  but he undeceived me presently  As I had not an opportunity  said he  of asking you any questions the other day  and shall be prevented probably in the same manner this day  I am come to have an hour’s chat with you before dinner  And first pray inform    me  Sidney  where you have lived ever since my mother’s death  and how it comes to pass that in all this time you never took any notice of either Lady Sarah or me  As to your first question  brother  it is easily answered  I have never been out of London  for the rest  lest us avoid all retrospection  which can now answer no end to either of us   You surprize me  said he  I understood you had been in the country  Lady Sarah told me that you were gone to Lady V——   She was misinformed  I replied— What was the meaning  then  said he  that you never called  or sent to her  She had no resentment to you  though I had   Dear Sir George  ask me no more questions  I thought it had been premised that we were not to talk of the past   I see  Sidney  answered he  there is something you have no mind to explain  you know I love and respect my wife  and that I cannot easily be brought to take any thing ill of her  but she was so extremely earnest with me not to ask you any questions  that it made me suspect there was something she had a mind to conceal from me  What confirms me in this opinion is  that as I know you are ingenuous and open to conviction you would have made me some apology for a neglect both of me and Lady Sarah  which  you could not but suppose  offended me  if you had not looked upon yourself as by much the most injured Person   You urge me very home  brother  I thought I was injured when you disclaimed all relationship to me  if I did not comply in a certain particular  which I was not at liberty to do   I was very angry with you  said he  but should not have carried my resentment any lengths after my mother’s death  if you had made any concession  or desired to throw yourself under my protection  instead of a stranger’s  for Lady V—— comparatively is one  I could not suppose you were in immediate want of my assistance  as I understand my mother’s private purse was not inconsiderable  and to tell you the truth  I was resolved till you did condescend to inform me of your situation  not to give myself any pain about you   I can only tell you in two words  Sir George  that you have been extremely misled in regard to me  I wish not to revive so disagreeable a subject  pray say no more of it   But one word more  said he  just for my own satisfaction  and then I have done  was Lady Sarah made acquainted with your circumstances  You must have lived in miserable obscurity to be so long in London without my knowlege     You love and respect your wife  brother  you must not take any thing ill of her   I am answered he replied  He walked about the room  and I could see he was ashamed and affected   You will make me very unhappy  Sir George  said I  if you resent any thing on my account to your lady
