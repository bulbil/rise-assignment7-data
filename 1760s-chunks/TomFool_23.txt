they were treated by me  I wish what I have suffered might deter others from too much indulging the strong Sallies of their Imagination  and by my Example would remember  that they who attempt to make others ridiculous  always lay themselves open to Revenge   All that Lady Veltry could leave from her Son  she gave me  and after her   96Decease  in Money  Bills and Jewels  I found myself worth upwards of five thousand Pounds  As soon as the Funeral was over  I sat out for London  A Wheel of my Chaise giving Way on the Road  I put up at Noon time at an Inn  a single House  upon the Bench before the Door  I saw a very neat dressed young Woman sit crying  her Arms had some black and blue Marks on them  and her Cap and Hat was in Disorder  I enquired of the By standers  what was the Reason of her Distress  They told me  her Husband had been beating her  and just at the Instant he came back  a black  ill looking Fellow  I asked him  mildly  the Reason of his using so prettya young Creature so barbarously  He replied  surlily  she was his Wife  and no Body had any Business with her  but himself  However  I at last  by giving him some Money  pacified him  I took such a Fancy to the young Woman  that I brought her to Town  and kept her with me  She had been educated by her Parents on Purpose to go into Place as an upper Servant  her Father was a Jailor  where this Fellow of her s had been committed for smuggling  nay  outlaw d  she took Pity of him  helped him to make his   97Escape  and went off with him  They had been rambling about the Country for six Months  he was a Tinker  and she was very ingenious  she made and sold artificial Flowers at the Gentlemen and Farmers Houses about the Country  But in the last Town they came from  a very rich Man wanted to be rather too familiar with her  she repulsed him  but her Lover would not give it over  went to her Husband  and proffered him a Sum of Money to sell his Wife —The Fellow consented  and the Blows she had received  were because she would not comply  This Relation I could not help entering in my Account Courant against your Sex  and yet I own  Sir  I wished to meet with some Incidents  that would make me think better of Mankind   In the Afternoon  a Man on Horseback called to my Postillion to stop  but just as he came up to the Chaise  his Crape dropped from his Face  and I knew him to be one of Lady Veltry s Servants  who had been discharged about two Months before  I then thought there was some Injustice in his Dismission  and I remember  at his taking Leave of me  I put a Moidore in his Hand  and to his Gratitude I imputed   98my not being robbed by him  The next Morning  my Servant came to tell me  that he was sure he saw the Highwayman in the Yard  that stopped the Chaise Yesterday  and asked my Leave to have him taken up  I was shocked at the News  and ordered him on his Peril not to say a Word  but sent my Woman with him down Stairs to find the poor Wretch out  and bid him get off— They did so  and it gave me great Ease  when they told me of it  for I dreaded  if he was seized  that I must have taken an Oath in a Court of Justice upon Life and Death — That Action  I knew  would sit heavy upon my Mind as long as I lived—to be accessary in hanging any Person  even tho  they deserved it  was what I could not reconcile to myself  It may be looked on as a foolish Woman s Prejudice  but I can no more get over it  than several of your Sex can their Tremblings at Cats  Cheese  and many other Antipathies   That Evening  as I sat at Supper  I received a Letter directed to me  It surprized me  how any Person could send me a Letter as I was upon a Journey— but I could hardly fancy myself awake  or in my right Senses  when I found it   99was from the Wretch  who  but that Morning  I cautioned to make his Escape—and that it was a Love letter too—I read it over so often  it is not easy for me to forget it  He began with hoping my Honour wasn t frightened when he came up to the Chaise  for he wouldn t hurt a Hair of my Head for all the World  hoped I would pardon his Boldness in breaking his Mind to me  That  to be sure  he never could have had the Boldness to think  that so fine a Lady as I was  could have liked him so very much  not but that his Fellow Servants used to say  when he lived at Lady Veltry s  that young Madam  meaning me  took his Part very much— but  to be sure
