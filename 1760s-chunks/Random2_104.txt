the captain s speech—our pursuer happens to be an English man of war—we arrive on the coast of Guinea  purchase 400 negroes  sail for Paraguay  get safe into the river of Plate  and sell our cargo to great advantage   IT was now I put in execution the scheme I had projected at London  and asking leave of the captain  for Strap and me to stay on shore till the wind should become favourable  my request was granted  because he had orders to remain in the Downs until he should receive some dispatches from London  which he did not expect in less than a week —Having imparted my resolution to my trusty valet  who  tho  he endeavour d to dissuade me from such a rash undertaking  would not quit me in the enterprize  I hired horses  and set out immediately for that part of Sussex where my charmer was confined  which was not above thirty miles distant from Deal where we mounted —As I was perfectly well acquainted with the extent of the Squire s estate and influence  I halted within five miles of his house  where we remained   314  till the twilight  at which time we set forward  and  by the favour of a dark night  gained a copse about half a mile from the village where Mrs  Sagely lived —Here we left our horses tied to a tree  and went directly to the house of my old benefactress  Strap trembling all the way  and venting ejaculatory petitions to heaven for our safety  Her habitation being quite solitary  we arrived at the door without being observed  when I ordered my companion to enter by himself  and in case there should be company with her  deliver a letter which I had wrote for the purpose  and say that a friend of hers in London  understanding that he intended to travel this road  had committed it to his care —He rapped at the door  to which the good old matron coming  told him  that being a lone woman  he must excuse her  if she did not open it  until he had declared his name and business —He answered  that his name was unknown to her  and that his business was to deliver a letter  which  to free her from all manner of apprehension  he would convey to her through the space between the door and threshold —This he instantly performed  and she no sooner read the contents  which specified my being present  than she cried     If the person who wrote this letter be at hand  let him speak  that I may be assured by his voice whether or not I may safely admit him  —  I forthwith applied my mouth to the key hole  and pronounced    Dear mother  you need not be afraid  it is I  so much indebted to your goodness  who now crave admittance  —  She knew my voice  and opening the door immediately  received me with a truly maternal affection  manifesting by the tears she let fall  her concern lest I   315 should be discovered  for she had been informed of every thing that had happened between Narcissa and me  from the dear captive s own mouth —When I explained the motive of my journey  which was no other than a desire of seeing the object of my love before I should quit the kingdom  that I might in person convince her of the necessity I was under to leave her  reconcile her to that event  by describing the advantages that in all probability would attend it  repeat my vows of eternal constancy  and enjoy the melancholy pleasure of a tender embrace at parting—I say  when I had thus signified my intention  Mrs  Sagely told me  that Narcissa  upon her return from the Bath  had been so strictly watched  that no body  but one or two of the servants devoted to her brother  was admitted to her presence  that afterwards she had been a little enlarged  and was permitted to see company  during which indulgence  she had been several times at her cottage  but of late she had been betrayed by one of the servants  who discovered to the squire  that he had once carried a letter from her to the post house directed to me  upon which information  she was now more confined than ever  and that I could have no chance of seeing her  unless I would run the risque of getting into the garden  where she and her maid were every day allowed to take the air  and lie hid until I should have an opportunity of speaking to them—an adventure which would be attended with such danger  that no man in his right wits would attempt it —This enterprize  hazardous as it was  I resolved to perform  in spite of all the arguments of Mrs  Sagely  who reasoned  chid  and intreated by turns  and the tears and prayers of Strap  who   316 conjured me on his knees  to have more regard to myself as well as to him  than to tempt my own destruction in such a precipitate manner  But I was deaf to every thing  but the suggestions of my love  and ordering him to return immediately with the horses to the inn from whence we set out  and wait for my
