sake       I am very sad about these things  If he really loved me  methinks he   should not be so angry  that his servants loved me too   I know not what   to think          Friday night       I have removed my papers from under the rose bush  for I saw the   gardener begin to dig near that spot  and I was afraid he would find   them       Mrs  Jewkes and I were looking yesterday through the iron gate that   fronts the elms  and a gipsy like body made up to us  and said  If    madam  you will give me some broken victuals  I will tell you both your   fortunes  I said  Let us hear our fortunes  Mrs  Jewkes  She said  I   don t like these sort of people  but we will hear what she ll say to   us  however  I shan t fetch you any victuals  woman  but I will give you   some pence  said she       But Nan coming out  she said  Fetch some bread  and some of the cold   meat  and you shall have your fortune told  Nan       This  you ll think  like some of my other matters  a very trifling thing   to write about  But mark the discovery of a dreadful plot  which I have   made by it  O  bless me  What can I think of this naughty  this very   naughty gentleman   Now will I hate him most heartily  Thus it was         Mrs  Jewkes had no suspicion of the woman  the iron gate being locked    and she on the outside  and we on the inside  and so put her hand   through  She said  muttering over a parcel of cramp words  Why  madam    you will marry soon  I can tell you  At that she seemed pleased  and   said  I am glad to hear that  and shook her fat sides with laughing    The woman looked most earnestly at me  all the time  and as if she   had meaning  Then it came into my head  from my master s caution  that   possibly this woman might be employed to try to get a letter into my   hands  and I was resolved to watch all her motions  So Mrs  Jewkes said    What sort of a man shall I have  pray   Why  said she  a man younger   than yourself  and a very good husband he ll prove   I am glad of that    said she  and laughed again  Come  madam  let us hear your fortune       The woman came to me  and took my hand  O  said she  I cannot tell your   fortune  your hand is so white and fine  I cannot see the lines  but    said she  and  stooping  pulled up a little tuft of grass  I have a way   for that  and so rubbed my hand with the mould part of the tuft  Now    said she  I can see the lines       Mrs  Jewkes was very watchful of all her ways  and took the tuft  and   looked upon it  lest any thing should be in that  And then the woman   said  Here is the line of Jupiter crossing the line of life  and   Mars  Odd  my pretty mistress  said she  you had best take care of   yourself  for you are hard beset  I ll assure you  You will never be   married  I can see  and will die of your first child  Out upon thee    woman  said I  better thou hadst never come here       Said Mrs  Jewkes  whispering  I don t like this  it looks like a cheat    Pray  Mrs  Pamela  go in  this moment  So I will  said I  for I have   enough of fortune telling  And in I went       The woman wanted sadly to tell me more  which made Mrs  Jewkes threaten   her  suspecting still the more  and away the woman went  having told Nan   her fortune  and she would be drowned       This thing ran strongly in all our heads  and we went  an hour after  to   see if the woman was lurking about  and took Mr  Colbrand for our guard    Looking through the iron gate  he spied a man sauntering about the   middle of the walk  which filled Mrs  Jewkes with still more suspicions    and she said  Mr  Colbrand  you and I will walk towards
