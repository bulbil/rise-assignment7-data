it  prepossessed as she was before  by knowing the material point   The account was given with levity at the first mention of the young lady  Then she understood he had bought her of her aunt  there is a paragraph which looks like it  and to be sure she attended not to the explanation  Fatal oversight  she read not far enough to have this matter cleared up  She took nothing but the bare facts into her account  A young lady dishonoured  her disgrace likely to be public  then her tenderness for the man who had undone her  and that man rejecting her  and on the point of marrying another  These were the only points of view in which my mother beheld the story  Her justice  her humanity  and her religion prompted her to act as she did  and her conduct stands fully acquitted to my judgment  though my heart must upon this full conviction of Mr Faulkland’s honour  sigh at recollecting the past     I know that the memory of my mother’s own first disastrous love wrought strongly on her mind  She was warm in her passions  liable to deep impressions  and always adhered strictly to those opinions she first imbibed  Her education had been severe and recluse  and she had drawn all her ideas of mankind from her own father and mine  who  I have been told  were both men of exemplary lives  From all these considerations  I must again say  that I entirely acquit my dear mother  in regard to her whole conduct  however I have suffered by it   October 30  I am now fixed in a very humble situation  Shall I own it to you  my Cecilia  I was shocked at the change  A room two pairs of stairs high  with a closet  and a small indifferent parlour  compose the whole of my apartment  Hither did my faithful Patty  my two children  and myself  remove this day  It put us not to much trouble  having nothing to take with us but our wearing apparel  which is all the worldly goods of which I am now possessed   When I wrote to Lady V——   which was a day or two before my mother’s death  I mentioned not that she was then in so dangerous a way  I know the generosity and good nature of that worthy woman  but I have already been too much obliged to her to lay any fresh tax on her friendship  which I am sure she would too readily pay  if she were acquainted with my situation  I shall therefore  as long as I can  defer acquainting her with my mother’s death  and when I do  I shall not give her room to suspect that my brother has cast me off  which I have now too much reason to believe he has  otherwise sure  in more than a fortnight  he might have found time to write to me  I neither expect ceremony  nor tenderness from him  but the occasion of my letter demanded some notice   November 2  Patty has just now been informed  that Lady Sarah Bidulph is arrived in town  She met one of their servants  who told her that my brother is not come with her  it seems  they parted on the road  He is gone to Sidney Castle  which is now his  and Lady Sarah chose to come to London  She has  I find  been in London four days  though she has not yet vouchsafed to send me any notice of her arrival  She could not be at a loss where to find me  as I left my direction at my former lodging  in case of any letter or message  coming from any of my friends  though I desired the people of the house not to inform any    indifferent visitants where I was to be found   Though George has  in his turbulent way  renounced me as his sister  yet sure his wife  whom I never disobliged  ought not to depart so from humanity and common good breeding  as not to enquire after the sister of her husband  who has an occasion of grief so recent  in which she ought to partake  I shall not however take notice of this slight  but am preparing to send Patty to her  with an enquiry after her health  and to know when my brother is expected in town — Patty is just returned from her embassy to Lady Sarah  I will give you the conversation she had with her   Patty sent in her message  with great respect  by a footman  and waited for her answer in the hall  though her pretty figure and genteel mourning dress had induced the servant to ask her into the house keeper’s room   Lady Sarah was alone in the parlour  and desired her to be called to the door  So  young woman  said she  your mistress desires to know when Sir George will be in town  I am really surprised  after the letter she received from him  that she can fancy Sir George means to concern himself about her  Do you know her business with him  you are in your mistress’s secrets I suppose  I do not know  Madam  answered Patty  what particular business my lady
