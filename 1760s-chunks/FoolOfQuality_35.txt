the threat   of hell  as the appointed and appropriate motives to a virtuous life    fall far below the best of the ancients  and do what they can to   give to human morality an essentially selfish character    if by  as   Mr  Mill says    discarding those so called secular standards  derived   from Greek and Koman writers  which heretofore co existed with   and supplemented ethics    which should be called not Christian    but monastic  and the   secular   correctives of which still remain    thank God  in the teaching of our public schools  and of our two great   universities     receiving some of its spirit  and infusing into it some   of theirs  there is even now resulting a low  abject  servile type of   character  which  submit itself as it may to what it deems the   Supreme will  is incapable of rising to or sympathizing in the con    ception of Supreme goodness    if this  or half of this  be true    then it may be worth while for earnest men to consider well if these   seemingly impertinent sermonizings of Henry Brooke be not needed   now a days   even though he dares to tell his reader  and indeed to   take as his text throughout the book  that   all virtues  even justice   itself  are merely different forms of benevolence   and that   bene    volence produces and constitutes the heaven or beatitude of God   himself  He is no other than an infinite and eternal GOOD WILL    Benevolence must  therefore  constitute the beatitude or heaven of   all dependent beings       It may be well  too  to see how  in his eyes  it was not only right   and useful  but possible likewise for a British nobleman of the 17th   century to copy God who made him   how  in enforcing that dream   of hig  he did not disdain to use those apologues and maxims of   wise old heathens  which will live  we may hope  as long as an   English school and an English scholar exist on earth  how his   conception of the ideal of humanity  because it is founded on the   belief that that ideal is the very image of God  is neither   low    abject  nor servile   but altogether chivalrous and heroic  and   lastly how  in his eyes  the humblest resignation and the loftiest   aspiration are so far from being contradictory virtues  that it is   only  so he holds  by rising to the   conception of the Supreme   goodness   that man can attain   submission to the Supreme will     And when the reader has considered this  and more which he may   find in this book  he will irritate himself no more about defects of   outward method  but will be content to let the author teach his   own lesson in his own way  trusting  and he will not trust in vain    that each seeming interruption is but a step forward in the moral   process at which the author aims   and that there is full and conscious   consistency in Mr  Brooke s method  whether or not there be dramatic   unity in his plot  By that time also one may hope the earnest         PREFACE  Ivii     reader will have begun to guess at the causes which have made   this book forgotten for a while   and perhaps to find them not in   its defects but in its excellencies   in its deep and grand ethics  in   its broad and genial humanity  in the divine value which it   attaches to the relations of husband and wife  father and child     and to the utter absence both of that sentimentalism and that   superstition which have been alternately debauching of late   years the minds of the young  And if he shall have arrived at this   discovery  he will be able possibly to regard at least with patience   those who are rash enough to affirm that they have learnt from this   book more which is pure  sacred  and eternal  than from any which   has been published since Spenser s Fairy Queen      So go forth once more  brave book  as God shall speed thee    and wherever thou meetest  whether in peasant or in peer  with a   royal heart  tender and true  magnanimous and chivalrous  enter in   and dwell there   and help its owner to become  as thou canst   help him  a Man  a Christian  and a Gentleman  as Henry Brooke   was before him      C  KINGSLEY            DRAMATIS PERSONS
