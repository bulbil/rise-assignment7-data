have I not had   reason  Do you think I should ever have forgot myself  if he had not   forgot to act as my master  Tell me from your own heart  dear Mrs    Jervis  said I  if you think I could stay and be safe  What would you   think  or how would you act in my case       My dear Pamela  said she  and kissed me  I don t know how I should act    or what I should think  I hope I should act as you do  But I know nobody   else that would  My master is a fine gentleman  he has a great deal of   wit and sense  and is admired  as I know  by half a dozen ladies  who   would think themselves happy in his addresses  He has a noble estate    and yet I believe he loves my good maiden  though his servant  better   than all the ladies in the land  and he has tried to overcome it    because you are so much his inferior  and  tis my opinion he finds he   can t  and that vexes his proud heart  and makes him resolve you shan t   stay  and so he speaks so cross to you  when he sees you by accident       Well  but  Mrs  Jervis  said I  let me ask you  if he can stoop to like   such a poor girl as me  as perhaps he may   for I have read of things   almost as strange  from great men to poor damsels   What can it be   for   He may condescend  perhaps  to think I may be good enough for his   harlot  and those things don t disgrace men that ruin poor women  as the   world goes  And so if I was wicked enough  he would keep me till I was   undone  and till his mind changed  for even wicked men  I have read    soon grow weary of wickedness with the same person  and love variety    Well  then  poor Pamela must be turned off  and looked upon as a vile   abandoned creature  and every body would despise her  ay  and justly   too  Mrs  Jervis  for she that can t keep her virtue  ought to live in   disgrace       But  Mrs  Jervis  I continued  let me tell you  that I hope  if I was   sure he would always be kind to me  and never turn me off at all  that I   shall have so much grace  as to hate and withstand his temptations  were   he not only my master  but my king  and that for the sin s sake  This   my poor dear parents have always taught me  and I should be a sad wicked   creature indeed  if  for the sake of riches or favour  I should forfeit   my good name  yea  and worse than any other young body of my sex    because I can so contentedly return to my poverty again  and think it   a less disgrace to be obliged to wear rags  and live upon rye bread and   water  as I used to do  than to be a harlot to the greatest man in the   world       Mrs  Jervis lifted up her hands  and had her eyes full of tears    God bless you  my dear love  said she  you are my admiration and   delight   How shall I do to part with you       Well  good Mrs  Jervis  said I  let me ask you now   You and he have had   some talk  and you mayn t be suffered to tell me all  But  do you think    if I was to ask to stay  that he is sorry for what he has done  Ay  and   ashamed of it too  For I am sure he ought  considering his high degree    and my low degree  and how I have nothing in the world to trust to but   my honesty  Do you think in your own conscience now   pray answer me   truly   that he would never offer any thing to me again  and that I   could be safe       Alas  my dear child  said she  don t put thy home questions to me  with   that pretty becoming earnestness in thy look  I know this  that he is   vexed at what he has done  he was vexed the first time  more vexed the   second time       Yes  said I  and so he will be vexed  I suppose  the third  and the   fourth time too  till he has quite ruined your poor maiden  and who will
