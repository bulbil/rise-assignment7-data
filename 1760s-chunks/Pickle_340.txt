the whole process  before the Royal Society  which would  doubtless  present him with a  medal  and give him a place among their memoirs  as a distinguished  promoter of the useful arts   If   said he   you had employed your  studies in finding out some effectual method to destroy those insects  which prejudice and annoy mankind  in all probability you must have  been contented with the contemplation of the good you had done  but this  curious expedient for multiplying maggots will surely entitle you to an  honourable rank in the list of learned philosophers     I don t wonder    replied the naturalist   that you should be so much averse to the  propagation of insects  because  in all likelihood  you are afraid that  they will not leave you a cabbage to cut down with the same miraculous  machine     Sir   answered the mechanic  with great bitterness of  voice and aspect   if the cabbage be as light headed as some muck worm  philosophers  it will not be worth cutting down     I never dispute  upon cabbage with the son of a cucumber   said the fly breeder  alluding  to the pedigree of his antagonist  who  impatient of the affront   started up with fury in his looks  exclaiming    Sdeath  meaning me   sir    Here the patron  perceiving things drawing towards a rupture  interposed  his authority  rebuking them for their intemperance and recommending  to them amity and concord against the Goths and Vandals of the age  who  took all opportunities of ridiculing and discouraging the adherents of  knowledge and philosophy  After this exhortation  they had no pretence  for carrying on the dispute  which was dropped in all appearance  though  the mechanic still retained his resentment  and after breakfast  when  the company broke up  accosted his adversary in the street  desiring to  know how he durst be so insolent as to make that scurrilous reflection  upon his family  The fly fancier  thus questioned  accused the  mathematician of having been the aggressor  in likening his head to  a light cabbage  and here the altercation being renewed  the engineer  proceeded to the illustration of his mechanics  tilting up his hand  like a balance  thrusting it forward by way of lever  embracing the  naturalist s nose like a wedge betwixt two of his fingers  and turning  it round  with the momentum of a screw or peritrochium  Had they been  obliged to decide the dispute with equal arms  the assailant would have  had great advantage over the other  who was very much his inferior in  muscular strength  but the philosopher being luckily provided with a  cane  no sooner disengaged himself from this opprobrious application   than he handled his weapon with great dexterity about the head and  shoulders of his antagonist  who  finding this shower of blows very  disagreeable  was fain to betake himself to his heels for shelter  and  was pursued by the angry victor  who chased him from one end of  the street to the other  affording unspeakable satisfaction to the  multitude  as well as to our hero and to his introductor  who were  spectators of the whole scene   Thus was our adventurer initiated into the society of Yelpers  though  he did not as yet fully understand the nature of his office  which was  explained by the young physician  who chid him for his blunt behaviour  in the case of the medal  and gave him to understand  that their  patron s favour was neither to be gained nor preserved by any man that  would pretend to convict him of a mistake  He therefore counselled him  to respect this foible  and cultivate the old gentleman with all the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   zeal and veneration which a regard to his own character would permit him  to say  This task was the easier to one of our young gentleman s pliant  disposition  because the virtuoso s behaviour was absolutely free from  that insolent self conceit  which he could not bear without disgust  The  senior was  on the contrary  mild and beneficent  and Pickle was rather  pleased than shocked at his weakness  because it flattered his vanity  with the supposition of his own superior sense  Cautioned in this  manner  Peregrine profited so much by his insinuating qualifications   that  in a very little time  he was looked upon as one of the chief  favourites of the patron  to whom he dedicated a small occasional poem   and everybody believed he would reap the fruits of his attachment among  the first of the old gentleman s dependents   CHAPTER XCVI   Peregrine  finding himself neglected by Sir Steady Steerwell   expostulates with him in a Letter  in consequence of which he is forbid  his House  loses his Pension  and incurs the charge of Lunacy   This prospect of success  together with his expectations from the  minister  whom he did not neglect  helped to comfort him under the  reverse of fortune which he had undergone
