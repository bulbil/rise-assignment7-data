and entered by a postern  which was altogether  unknown to her admirer  and her uncle did not arrive until it was so  late that he could not  with any decency  demand a conference   Next morning  he did not fail to present himself at the door  and his  mistress being denied by her own express direction  insisted upon  seeing the master of the house  who received him with such coldness of  civility  as plainly gave him to understand that he was acquainted with  the displeasure of his niece  He  therefore  with an air of candour   told the citizen  he could easily perceive by his behaviour that he was  the confidant of Miss Emily  of whom he was come to ask pardon for the  offence he had given  and did not doubt  if he could be admitted to her  presence  that he should be able to convince her that he had not erred  intentionally  or at least propose such reparation as would effectually  atone for his fault   To this remonstrance the merchant  without any ceremony or  circumlocution  answered  that though he was ignorant of the nature of  his offence  he was very certain  that it must have been something  very flagrant that could irritate his niece to such a degree  against a  person for whom she had formerly a most particular regard  He owned  she  had declared her intention to renounce his acquaintance for ever  and   doubtless  she had good reason for so doing  neither would he undertake  to promote an accommodation  unless he would give him full power to  treat on the score of matrimony  which he supposed would be the only  means of evincing his own sincerity  and obtaining Emilia s forgiveness   Peregrine s pride was kindled by this blunt declaration  which he could  not help considering as the result of a scheme concerted betwixt the  young lady and her uncle  in order to take advantage of his heat  He  therefore replied  with manifest signs of disgust  that he did not  apprehend there was any occasion for a mediator to reconcile the  difference betwixt Emilia and him  and that all he desired was an  opportunity of pleading in his own behalf  The citizen frankly told    6 22 15  3 45 PM   him  that  as his niece had expressed an earnest desire of avoiding his  company  he would not put the least constraint upon her inclination   and  in the meantime  gave him to know  that he was particularly  engaged  Our hero  glowing with indignation at this supercilious  treatment   I was in the wrong   said he   to look for good manners so  far on this side of Temple bar  but you must give me leave to tell you   sir  that unless I am favoured with an interview with Miss Gauntlet   I shall conclude that you have actually laid a constraint upon her  inclination  for some sinister purposes of your own     Sir   replied  the old gentleman   you are welcome to make what conclusions shall seem  good unto your own imagination  but pray be so good as to allow me  the privilege of being master in my own house   So saying  he very  complaisantly showed him to the door  and our lover being diffident of  his own temper  as well as afraid of being used with greater indignity   in a place where his personal prowess would only serve to heighten his  disgrace  quitted the house in a transport of rage  which he could not  wholly suppress  telling the landlord  that if his age did not protect  him  he would have chastised him for his insolent behaviour   CHAPTER LXXVIII   He projects a violent Scheme  in consequence of which he is involved in  a most fatiguing Adventure  which greatly tends towards the Augmentation  of his Chagrin   Thus debarred of personal communication with his mistress  he essayed  to retrieve her good graces by the most submissive and pathetic letters   which he conveyed by divers artifices to her perusal  but  reaping no  manner of benefit from these endeavours  his passion acquired a degree  of impatience little inferior to downright frenzy  and he determined to  run every risk of life  fortune  and reputation  rather than desist  from his unjustifiable pursuit  Indeed  his resentment was now as deeply  concerned as his love  and each of these passions equally turbulent and  loud in demanding gratification  He kept sentinels continually in pay   to give him notice of her outgoings  in expectation of finding some  opportunity to carry her off  but her circumspection entirely  frustrated this design  for she suspected everything of that sort from a  disposition like his  and regulated her motions accordingly   Baffled by her prudence and penetration  he altered his plan  On  pretence of being called to his country house by some affair of  importance  he departed from London  and  taking lodgings at a farmer s  house that stood near the road through which she must have necessarily  passed in her return
