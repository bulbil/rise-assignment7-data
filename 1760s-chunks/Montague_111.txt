O N D O N   Printed for J  DODSLEY  in Pall Mall   MDCCLXIX      I   THE  HISTORY  OF  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CLXXXI   181   To Colonel RIVERS  at Bellfield  Rutland   Rose hill  Sept  17   CAN you in earnest ask such a question  can you suppose I ever felt the least degree of love for Sir George  No  my Rivers  never did your Emily feel tenderness till she saw the loveliest  the most amiable of his sex  till those eyes spoke the sentiments of a soul every idea of which was similar to her own       Yes  my Rivers  our souls have the most perfect resemblance  I never heard you speak without finding the feelings of my own heart developed  your conversation conveyed your Emily s ideas  but cloathed in the language of angels       I thought well of Sir George  I saw him as the man destined to be my husband  I fancied he loved me  and that gratitude obliged me to a return  carried away by the ardor of my friends for this marriage  I rather suffered than approved his addresses  I had not courage to resist the torrent  I therefore gave way to it  I loved no other  I fancied my want of affection a native coldness of temper  I felt a languid esteem  which I endeavored to flatter myself was love  but the moment I saw you  the delusion vanished       Your eyes  my Rivers  in one moment convinced me I had a heart  you staid some weeks with us in the country  with what transport do I recollect those pleasing moments  how did my heart beat whenever you approached me  what charms did I find in your conversation  I heard you talk with a delight of which I was not mistress  I fancied every woman who saw you felt the same emotions  my tenderness increased imperceptibly without my perceiving the consequences of my indulging the dear pleasure of seeing you       I found I loved  yet was doubtful of your sentiments  my heart  however  flattered me yours was equally affected  my situation prevented an explanation  but love has a thousand ways of making himself understood        How dear to me were those soft  those delicate attentions  which told me all you felt for me  without communicating it to others       Do you remember that day  my Rivers  when  sitting in the little hawthorn grove  near the borders of the river  the rest of the company  of which Sir George was one  ran to look at a ship that was passing  I would have followed  you asked me to stay  by a look which it was impossible to mistake  nothing could be more imprudent than my stay  yet I had not resolution to refuse what I saw gave you pleasure  I stayed  you pressed my hand  you regarded me with a look of unutterable love       My Rivers  from that dear moment your Emily vowed never to be another s  she vowed not to sacrifice all the happiness of her life to a romantic parade of fidelity to a man whom she had been betrayed into receiving as a lover  she resolved  if necessary  to own to him the tenderness with which you had inspired her  to entreat from his esteem  from his compassion  a release from engagements which made her wretched       My heart burns with the love of virtue  I am tremblingly alive to fame  what bitterness then must have been my portion had I first seen you when the wife of another       Such is the powerful sympathy that unites us  that I fear  that virtue  that strong sense of honor and fame  so powerful in minds most turned to tenderness  would only have served to make more poignant the pangs of hopeless  despairing love       How blest am I  that we met before my situation made it a crime to love you  I shudder at the idea how wretched I might have been  had I seen you a few months later       I am just returned from a visit at a few miles distance  I find a letter from my dear Bell  that she will be here to morrow  how do I long to see her  to talk to her of my Rivers       I am interrupted       Adieu  Yours   EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CLXXXII   182   To Mrs  TEMPLE   Rose hill  Sept  18  Morning   I HAVE this moment  my dear Mrs  Temple s letter  she will imagine my transport at the happy event she mentions  my dear Rivers has  in some degree  sacrificed even filial affection to his tenderness for me  the consciousness of this has ever cast a damp on the pleasure I should otherwise have felt  at the prospect of spending my life with the most excellent of mankind  I shall now be his  without the painful reflection of having lessened the enjoyments of the best parent that ever existed       I should be blest indeed  my amiable friend  if I did
