too closely laced  and she seeming perfectly   recovered from  the conversation was renewed on the same subject it had   turned upon before this interruption  and the name of monsieur du   Plessis being often mentioned  confirmed Louisa  if before she could   have had the least remains of doubt  that it was her lover who    neglectful of his own affairs  and the remonstrances of his expecting   friends  was about to range in search of one who  he imagined  was   ungrateful both to his love and friendship       After having listened  with the utmost attention  to all the countess   said of him  and other matters becoming the topic of discourse  she took   her leave  in order to reflect alone what she ought to do in   this affair       She debated not long within herself before she resolved to write to him    and prevent the unprofitable journey he was about to take  and having   heard  by madam d  Espargnes  the name of the village where he was   obliged to wait  both for the recovery of his wounds and for remittances   for his expences  she wrote to him in the following terms        To monsieur  DU PLESSIS           I should ill return the proofs I have received   of your generous disinterested friendship    to delay one moment that I had it in my power    in endeavouring to convince you that it was a   quite contrary motive than ingratitude to you    that carried me from Bolognia   but the story   is too long for the compass of a letter  when   you know it  you will  perhaps  own this action    whatever you may now think of it  merits   more  than any thing I could have done  your   approbation   this seeming riddle will be easily   expounded  if  on the recovery of your   wounds  you repair immediately to Paris  where   you will find       Your much obliged        LOUISA           Having finished this little billet  a scruple rose in her head  that   being now under the care of a father  she ought not to do any thing of   this nature without his permission   she had already told him how   greatly she had been indebted to du Plessis for his honourable passion    but had not mentioned the least tittle of the tender impressions it had   made on her  and she so lately knew him to be her father  that she was   ashamed to make him the confidant of an affair of this nature  but then    when she considered the quality of du Plessis  which she was now   confirmed of  and the sense Dorilaus testified he had of his behaviour   to her while he believed her so infinitely his inferior  made her   resolve to drain her modesty so far as to inform him all       She began by relating her accidental meeting with madam  the countess   d Espargnes and the conversation that passed at mademoiselle de   Palfoy s  and then  tho  not without immoderate blushes  shewed him what   she had wrote  and beseeched him to let her know whether it would be   consistent with a virgin s modesty  and also agreeable to his pleasure    that she gave this demonstration of her gratitude for the favours she   had received from this young gentleman       Dorilaus was charmed with this proof of her duty and respect  and told   her  that he was so far from disapproving what she had wrote  that had   she omitted it  or said less than she did  he should have looked upon   her as unworthy of so perfect a passion as that which monsieur du   Plessis on all occasions  testified for her   that  in his opinion  she   owed him more than she could ever pay  and that it should be his   endeavour to shew he had not placed his affections on the daughter of   one who knew not how to set a just value on merit such as his   he made   her also add a postscript to the letter  to give a direction in what   part of Paris he might find her on his arrival  but Louisa would by no   means give the least hint of the alteration in her circumstances  not   that she wanted any farther proofs of his sincerity  but that she   reserved the pleasure of so agreeable a surprize to their meeting  This   letter was dispatched immediately  to the end he might receive it  at   least  as soon as that from his sister with the expected remittances             CHAP  XXV
