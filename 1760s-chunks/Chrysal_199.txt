have hunting enough          But what will your highness have me to do about provisions for   the entertainment of the princes   I believe they design a long   visit  for they have brought all the young princes and princesses of   their illustrious families with them          A town belonging to the German Bansc or Hanseatio League          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 223       I care not  I am not to be disturbed on such trifles now  when the   fate of nations depends on my resolutions  Let them go home again          Not fasting  I presume  for they have already signified  some of   them  that they have come without their breakfasts  by calling for   refreshment the moment they arrived   and  indeed  I fear the   principal motive of this visit of their highnesses was want of any    thing to eat at home          Confusion   What can I do   Here  take this money  and send   for victuals for them        The sight of a handful of guineas was an agreeable surprise to the   steward  who had not heard of the arrival of the subsidy from   England  He received them with evident pleasure  and I felt no   less in being delivered from this scene of sovereignty  of which I   was sincerely sick  though  by the change  I fell from being the   price of armies to the domestic office of going to market for a morsel   of bread   from the glory of causing the slaughter of thousands to   the virtue of supporting the lives of a few  The steward  as soon   as he withdrew from the presence of his highness  called the other   officers of the household together  and told them  with joy in his   countenance  that there was no foundation for the report of their   master s breaking with England  so that they might look famine in   the face for another year  and confirmed the glad tidings by show    ing them the gold  The pleasing sight raised universal joy   they   licked their lips  feasted in imagination  and prepared things for   getting dinner ready  with all the alacrity of willing minds and keen   appetites  while the steward  not caring to trust a commission of   that importance to any inferior officer  waited only to wash down a   mouldy crust with a draught of sour wine  and then went to market   for them himself      The appearance of things changed as soon as I left the hereditary   dominions of his highness  and entered into the little territories of   a free state  Plenty was the reward of industry  and content sup    plied well the place of grandeur  As his higbness s minister had   pressing motives to accelerate his negotiations  he went directly   to the several dealers in provisions  and  ordering a comfortable   supply on the credit of our appearance  returned with the greatest   dispatch to the discharge of the offices of his high employment  in   the ceremonials of the court      In the course of these transactions  it fell to my lot to be paid to   a Jew for bacon and sausages  the butchers of his religion being   held to make the best of the latter  as they never cut out the nice   bits to eat themselves          CHAPTER XVIII     OOMPABISON BETWEEN TWO DEALBES IN FLESH â€” THE CELEBKATION   OF THE PASSOVEE IN THE TRADITIONAL WAY  AND THE METHOD   OF PROOTJEING  HTJMAN  LAMBS EXPLAINED     I NOW entered into a service  the most diametrically opposite of   any in nature to my last  my present master den3 ing himself the         224 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     very necessaries of life to hide his riches under the appearance of   poverty  as my last lived in the most vain ostentation of splendour    to conceal his poverty under the appearance of riches  It is diffi    cult to say which hypocrisy was most absurd  and contradictory   to the immutable laws of moral justice  the former basely stealing    as I may say  from the public  that wealth which was ordained to   be of advantage to it  and whose value arises only from its being   used  by thus secreting it in his coffers  and the latter  in gratifica    tion of a vanity as unjustifiable as that of avarice  committing   every kind of actual violence to supply the want of it      I here was soon initiated into all the mysteries of that lower species   of trade called peddling  which
