asks me the  question  in order to be revenged upon this unyielding humourist  Did  the dear fellow discover no inclination to see me  in all the term of  his releasement  Well  if ever I can catch the fugitive again  he shall  sing in his cage for life    It is impossible to convey to the reader a just idea of Peregrine s  transports  while he overheard this declaration  which was no sooner    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pronounced  than  unable to resist the impetuosity of his passion   he sprung from his lurking place  exclaiming   Here I surrender   and  rushing into her presence  was so dazzled with her beauty  that his  speech failed  He was fixed like a statue to the floor  and all his  faculties were absorbed in admiration  Indeed  she was now in the full  bloom of her charms  and it was nearly impossible to look upon her  without emotion  What then must have been the ecstasy of our youth   whose passion was whetted with all the incitements which could stimulate  the human heart  The ladies screamed with surprise at his appearance   and Emilia underwent such agitation as flushed every charm with  irresistible energy  her cheeks glowed with a most delicate suffusion   and her bosom heaved with such bewitching undulation  that the cambric  could not conceal or contain the snowy hemispheres  that rose like a  vision of paradise to his view   While he was almost fainting with unutterable delight  she seemed to  sink under the tumults of tenderness and confusion  when our hero   perceiving her condition  obeyed the impulse of his love  and circled  the charmer in his arms  without suffering the least frown or symptom  of displeasure  Not all the pleasures of his life had amounted to the  ineffable joy of this embrace  in which he continued for some minutes  totally entranced  He fastened upon her pouting lips with all the  eagerness of rapture  and  while his brain seemed to whirl round with  transport  exclaimed  in a delirium of bliss   Heaven and earth  this is  too much to bear    His imagination was accordingly relieved  and his attention in some  measure divided  by the interposition of Sophy  who kindly chid him for  his having overlooked his old friends  Thus accosted  he quitted his  delicious armful  and  saluting Mrs  Gauntlet  asked pardon for his  neglect  observing that such rudeness was excusable  considering the  long and unhappy exile which he had suffered from the jewel of his  soul  Then turning to Emilia   I am come  madam   said he   to claim  the performance of your promise  which I can produce under your own  fair hand  You may  therefore  lay aside all superfluous ceremony and  shyness  and crown my happiness without further delay  for  upon my  soul  my thoughts are wound up to the last pitch of expectation  and  I shall certainly run distracted  if I am doomed to any term of  probation    His mistress having by this time recollected herself  replied  with a  most exhilarating smile   I ought to punish you for your obstinacy  with the mortification of a twelvemonth s trial  but it is dangerous to  tamper with an admirer of your disposition  and therefore  I think  I  must make sure of you while it is in my power     You are willing  then to take me for better  for worse  in presence of heaven and these  witnesses   cried Peregrine kneeling  and applying her hand to his lips   At this interrogation  her features softened into an amazing expression  of condescending love  and  while she darted a side glance that thrilled  to his marrow  and heaved a sigh more soft than Zephyr s balmy wing  her  answer was   Why  ay  and heaven grant me patience to bear the humours  of such a yoke fellow     And may the same powers   replied the youth    grant me life and opportunity to manifest the immensity of my  love  Meanwhile  I have eighty thousand pounds  which shall be laid  immediately in your lap    So saying  he sealed the contract upon her lips  and explained the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   mystery of his last words  which had begun to operate upon the wonder of  the two sisters  Sophy was agreeably surprised with the account of his  good fortune  nor was it  in all probability  unacceptable to the  lovely Emilia  though  from this information  she took an opportunity  to upbraid her admirer with the inflexibility of his pride  which   she scrupled not to say  would have baffled all the suggestions of his  passion  had it not been gratified by this providential event   Matters being thus happily matured  the lover begged that immediate  recourse might be had to the church  and his happiness ascertained  before night  But the bride
