—I think only of my two good Aunts  at the present writing  Miss Clements  you know  is a youngish woman  and I respect her much  One would not jest upon the unsightliness of person  or plainness of feature  but think you she will not be one of those    271 who twenty years hence may put in a boast of her quondam beauty   How I run on  I think I ought to be ashamed of myself      Very true  Charlotte      And so it is  Harriet  I have done—Adieu —Lord G  will be silly again  I doubt  but I am prepared  I wish he had half my patience      Be quiet  Lord G   What a fool you are    —The man  my dear  under pretence of being friends  run his sharp nose in my eye  No bearing his fondness  It is worse than insolence  How my eye waters —I can tell him—But I will tell him  and not you —Adieu  once more     CHARLOTTE  G   LETTER  XXXIX  Mr  LOWTHER  To JOHN ARNOLD  Esq  his Brother in Law  in London   Bologna  May 5—16   I Will now  my dear Brother  give you a circumstantial account of our short  but flying journey  The 20th of April  O  S  early in the morning  we left Paris  and reached Lyons the 24th at night   Resting but a few hours  we set out for Pont Beauvoisin  where we arrived the following evening  There we bid adieu to France  and found ourselves in Savoy  equally noted for its poverty and rocky mountains  Indeed it was a total change of the scene  We had left behind us a blooming spring  which enlivened with its verdure the trees and hedges on the road we passed  and the meadows already smiled with flowers  The chearful inhabitants were busy in adjusting their limits  lopping their trees  pruning their vines  tilling their fields  But when we entered Savoy  nature wore a very different face    272 and I must own  that my spirits were great sufferers by the change  Here we began to view on the nearer mountains  covered with ice and snow  notwithstanding the advanced season  the rigid winter  in frozen majesty  still preserving its domains  And arriving at St  Jean de Maurienne the night of the 26th  the snow seemed as if it would dispute with us our passage  and horrible was the force of the boistrous winds  which sat full in our faces   Overpowered by the fatigues I had undergone in •he expedition we had made  the unseasonable coldness of the weather  and the sight of one of the worst countries under heaven  still cloathed in snow  and deformed by continual hurricanes  I was here taken ill  Sir Charles was greatly concerned for my indisposition  which was increased by a great lowness of spirits  He attended upon me in person  and never had man a more kind and indulgent friend  Here we stayed two days  and then  my illness being principally owing to fatigue  I found myself enabled to proceed  At two of the clock in the morning of the 28th  we prosecuted our journey  in palpable darkness  and dismal weather  tho  the winds were somewhat laid  and reaching the foot of Mount Cenis by break of day  arrived at Lanebourg  a poor little village  so environed by high mountains  that  for three months in the twelve  it is hardly visited by the chearing rays of the sun  Every object which here presents itself is excessively miserable  The people are generally of an olive complexion  with wens under their chins  some so monstrous  especially women  as quite disfigure them   Here it is usual to unscrew and take in pieces the chaises  in order to carry them on mules over the mountain  and to put them together on the other side  For the Savoy side of the mountain is much more difficult to pass than the other  But Sir Charles chose not to lose time  and therefore left the chaise   273 to the care of the inn keeper  proceeding  with all expedition  to gain the top of the hill   The way we were carried  was as follows  A kind of horse  as it is called with you  with two poles  like those of chairmen  was the vehicle  on which is secured a sort of elbow chair  in which the traveller sits  A man before  another behind  carry this open machine with so much swiftness  that they are continually running and skipping  like wild goats  from rock to rock  the four miles of that ascent  If a traveller were not prepossessed that these mountaineers are the surest footed carriers in the universe  he would be in continual apprehensions of being overturned  I  who never undertook this journey before  must own  that I could not be so fearless  on this occasion  as Sir Charles was  tho  he had very exactly described to me how every thing would be  Then  tho  the sky was clear when we
