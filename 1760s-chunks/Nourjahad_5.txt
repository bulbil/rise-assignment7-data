by groping about  for there was scarce any light  he judged it large enough to contain his treasures     Whether his guardian genius had contrived it purely for his use  or whether it had been originally made for some other purpose  he did not trouble himself to enquire  but glad to have found so safe a place  in which to deposite his wealth  he returned to his house   Page  26  and having given orders that no visitors should approach him  he shut himself up in his chamber for the rest of the day  in order to contemplate his own happiness  and without interruption  to lay down plans of various pleasures and delights for ages to come     Whilst ← Nourjahad → was rich only in speculation  he really thought that he should be able to keep his word with the genius  That the employing his wealth to noble and generous purposes  would have constituted great part of his happiness  and that without plunging into guilt  he could have gratified the utmost of his wishes  But he soon found that his heart had deceived him  and that there is a wide difference between  Page  27  the fancied and actual possession of wealth  He was immediately absorbed in selfishness  and thought of nothing but the indulgence of his own appetites  My temper  said he  as he lay stretched at length on a sopha  does not much incline me to take any trouble  I shall therefore never aspire at high employments  nor would I be the sultan of Persia  if I might  for what addition would that make to my happiness  None at all  it would only disturb my breast with cares  from which I am now exempt  And which of the real  substantial delights of life  could I then possess  that are not now within my power  I will have a magnificent house in town  and others in the country  with delicious parks and gardens  What does it signify  Page  28  whether or not they are dignified with the names of palaces  or whether I am attended by princes or slaves  The latter will do my business as well  and be more subservient to my will  There are three particulars indeed  in which I will exceed my master  In the beauties of my seraglio  the delicacies of my table  and the excellence of my musicians  In the former of these especially  King Solomon himself shall be outdone  All parts of the earth shall be explored for women of the most exquisite beauty  art and nature shall combine their utmost efforts  to furnish the boundless variety and elegance of my repasts  the sultan s frigid temperance shall not be a pattern to me  Then no fear of surfeits  I may riot to excess  and bid defiance to death   Page  29  Here he started  on recollection that he had not requested the genius to secure him against the attacks of pain or sickness  I shall not however be impaired by age  said he  and this too perhaps is included in his gift  But no matter  since I cannot die  a little temporary pain will make me the more relish my returning health  Then  added he  I will enjoy the charms of music in its utmost perfection  I will have the universe searched for performers of both sexes  whose exquisite skill both in instrumental and vocal harmony  shall ravish all hearts  I shall see the line of my posterity past numeration  and all the while enjoy a constant succession of new delights  What more is there wanting to consummate happiness  and  Page  30  who would ever wish to change such an existence  for one of which we are entirely ignorant  Here he paused  But are there not  he proceeded  some things called intellectual pleasures  Such as Schemzeddin used to talk of to me  and for which  when I was poor  I fancied I had a sort of relish  They may have their charms  and we will not leave them quite out of our plan  I will certainly do abundance of good  besides  I will retain in my family half a score of wise and learned men  to entertain my leisure hours with their discourse  Then when I am weary of living in this country  I will set out with some chosen companions to make a tour through the whole earth  There shall not be a spot of the habitable world  which contains  Page  31  any thing worthy of my curiosity  that I will not visit  residing longest in those places which I like best  and by this means I may pass through two or three centuries  even before I have exhausted the variety of my prospects  after that I must content myself with such local enjoyments  as may fall in my way     With such thoughts as these he entertained himself  waiting for the hour when his slaves should be retired to rest  as he had resolved to take that opportunity of burying his treasure     He had tried the weight of the urns one by one  those which contained the gold he found so extreamly heavy that it was impossible for him to lift them   Page  32
