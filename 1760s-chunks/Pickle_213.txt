PM   who learned the story from their own mouths  that the lady was the only  daughter of a rich Jew  and her attendant no other than his apprentice   who had converted her to Christianity  and married her at the same time   that this secret having taken air  the old Israelite had contrived  a scheme to separate them for ever  and they being apprised of his  intention  had found means to elope from his house  with a view of  sheltering themselves in France  until the affair could be made up   that  seeing three men ride after them with such eagerness  they  never doubted that the pursuers were her father  and some friends  or  domestics  and on that supposition had fled with the utmost despatch and  trepidation  until they had found themselves happily undeceived  at that  very instant when they expected nothing but mischief and misfortune   Lastly  the Swiss gave him to understand  that  after having professed  some concern for his deplorable situation  and enjoyed a slight  refreshment  they had taken their departure for Dover  and  in all  likelihood  were safely arrived at Paris   In four and twenty hours after Pipes was charged with his commission   he brought back an answer from the mother of Emilia  couched in these  words          Sir   I received the favour of yours  and am glad  for your       own sake  that you have attained a due sense and conviction       of your unkind and unchristian behaviour to poor Emy  I thank       God  none of my children were ever so insulted before  Give       me leave to tell you  sir  my daughter was no upstart  without       friends or education  but a young lady  as well bred  and       better born  than most private gentlewomen in the kingdom        and therefore  though you had no esteem for her person  you       ought to have paid some regard to her family  which  no       disparagement to you  sir  is more honourable than your own        As for your proposal  Miss Gauntlet will not hear of it        being that she thinks her honour will not allow her to listen       to any terms of reconciliation  and she is not yet so       destitute as to embrace an offer to which she has the least       objection  In the meantime  she is so much indisposed  that       she cannot possibly see company  so I beg you will not take       the trouble of making a fruitless journey to this place        Perhaps your future conduct may deserve her forgiveness        and really  as I am concerned for your happiness  which you       assure me depends upon her condescension  I wish with all my       heart it may  and am  notwithstanding all that has happened        your sincere well wisher               Cecilia Gauntlet    From this epistle  and the information of his messenger  our hero  learned  that his mistress had actually profited by his wild goose  chase  so as to make a safe retreat to her mother s house  Though sorry  to hear of her indisposition  he was also piqued at her implacability   as well as at some stately paragraphs of the letter  in which  he  thought  the good lady had consulted her own vanity  rather than  her good sense  These motives of resentment helped him to bear his  disappointment like a philosopher  especially as he had now quieted  his conscience  in proffering to redress the injury he had done  and   moreover  found himself  with regard to his love  in a calm state of  hope and resignation   A seasonable fit of illness is an excellent medicine for the turbulence    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of passion  Such a reformation had the fever produced on the economy of  his thoughts  that he moralized like an apostle  and projected several  prudential schemes for his future conduct  In the meantime  as soon  as his health was sufficiently re established  he took a trip to the  garrison  in order to visit his friends  and learned from Hatchway s own  mouth  that he had broke the ice of courtship to his aunt  and that his  addresses were now fairly afloat  though  when he first declared himself  to the widow  after she had been duly prepared for the occasion  by her  niece and the rest of her friends  she had received his proposal with  a becoming reserve
