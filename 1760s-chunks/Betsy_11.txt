 These were the reasons which determined her to keep the whole thing a   secret from every one  At first she was tempted to write to Gayland  and   testify her disdain of his presumption in terms which should convince   him how grossly his vanity had imposed upon him  but she afterwards   considered that a letter from her was doing him too much honour  and   though ever so reproachful  might draw another from him  either to   excuse and beg pardon for the temerity of the former  or possibly to   affront her a second time  by defending it  and repeating his request    She despised and hated him too much to engage in a correspondence with   him of any kind  and therefore resolved  as it was certainly most   prudent  not to let him have any thing under her hand  but when next she   saw him to shew her resentment by such ways as occasion should permit       He came not to Mr  Goodman s  however  for three days  possibly waiting   that time for a letter from Miss Betsy  but on the fourth he appeared at   Lady Mellasin s tea table  There were  besides the family  several   others present  so that he had not an opportunity of speaking in private   to Miss Betsy  but the looks she gave him  so different from all he had   ever seen her assume towards him  might have shewn any man  not blinded   with his vanity  how much she was offended  but he imagining her   ill humour proceeded only from the want of means to send to him  came   again the next day  and happening to find her alone in the parlour     What  my dear   said he  taking her in a free manner by the hand   have   you been so closely watched by your guardian and guardianesses here    that no kind moment offered for you to answer the devoirs of your   humble servant     The surest guardians of my fame and peace   replied   she  snatching her hand away   is the little share of understanding  I   am mistress of  which I hope will always be sufficient to defend my   honour in more dangerous attacks  than the rude impertinences of an idle   coxcomb        These words  and the air with which they were spoke  one would think   should have struck with confusion the person to whom they were directed    but Gayland was not so easily put out of countenance  and  looking her   full in the face   Ah  child   cried he   sure you are not in your right   senses today   Understanding  impertinences  idle coxcomb   Very   pleasant  i faith  but  upon my soul  if you think these airs become   you  you are the most mistaken woman in the world     It may be so     cried she  ready to burst with inward spite at his insolence   but I   should be yet more mistaken if I were capable of thinking a wretch like   you worthy of any thing but contempt   With these words she flung out of   the room  and he pursued her with a horse laugh  till she was out of   hearing  and then went into the dining room  where he found Lady   Mellasin  and several who had come to visit her       Miss Betsy  who had gone directly to her own chamber  sent to excuse   coming down to tea  pretending a violent headache  nor would be   prevailed upon to join the company till she heard Gayland had taken his   leave  which he did much sooner than usual  being probably a good deal   disconcerted at the shock his vanity had received                CHAPTER IV       Verifies the old proverb  that one affliction treads upon the heels of   another          As Miss Betsy was prevented from discovering to any one the impudent   attempt Gayland had made on her virtue  by the shame of having   emboldened him to it by too unreserved a behaviour  so also the shame of   the disappointment and rebuff he had received from her  kept him from   saying any thing of what had passed between them  and this resolution on   both sides rendered it very difficult for either of them to behave to   the other  so as not to give some suspicion  Betsy could not always   avoid seeing him when he came to Lady Mellasin s  for he would not all   at once desist his visits for two reasons  first  because it might give   occasion for an enquiry into the cause  and  secondly  because Miss   Betsy would plume herself on the occasion
