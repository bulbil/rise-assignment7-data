So much for this elegant epistle  When Aurora had finished hers  which rang the changes on similar topics  she sealed them  wrapped them up together  and giving me the packet    There  Gil Blas  said she  take care that comes to Isabella s hands this very evening  You comprehend me  added she  with a glance from the corner of her eye  which admitted of no doubtful construction  Yes  my lord  answered I  your commands shall be executed to a tittle   I lost no time in taking my departure  no sooner in the street than I said to myself    So ho  Master Gil Blas  your part then is that of the intriguing footman in this comedy  Well  so be it  my friend  shew that you have wit and sense enough to top it over the favourite actor of the day  Signor Don Felix thinks a wink as good as a nod  A high compliment to the quickness of your apprehension  Is he then in an error  No  His hint is as clear as daylight  Don Lewis s letter is to drop its companion by the way  A lucid exposition of a dark hieroglyphic  enough to shame the dulness of the commentators  The sacredness of a seal could never stand against this bright discovery  Out came the single letter of Pacheco  and away went I to hunt after Doctor Murcia s abode  At the very threshold  whom should I meet but the little page who had been at our lodging  Comrade  said I  do not you happen to live with the great lawyer s daughter  His answer was in the affirmative  I see by your countenance  resumed I  that you know the ways of the world  May I beg the favour of you to slip this little memorandum into your mistress s hand   The little page asked me on whose behalf I was a messenger  The name of Don Lewis Pacheco had no sooner escaped my lips  than he told me    Since that is the case  follow me  I have orders to shew you up  Isabella wants to confer with you  I was introduced at once into a private apartment  where it was not long before the lady herself made her appearance  The beauty of her face was inexpressibly striking  I do not recollect to have seen more lovely features  Her manner was somewhat mincing and infantine  yet for all that it had been thirty good years at least since she had mewled and puked in her nurse s arms  My friend  said she with an encouraging smile  are you on Don Lewis Pacheco s establishment  I told her I had been in office for these three weeks  With this I fired off my paper popgun against her peace  She read it over two or three times  but if she had rubbed her eyes till doomsday she would have seen no clearer  In point of fact  nothing could be more unexpected than so cavalier an answer  Up went her eyes towards the heavens  appealing to their rival luminaries  The ivory fences  of her pretty mouth committed alternate trespass on her soft and suffering lips  and her whole physiognomy bore witness to the pangs of her distressed and disappointed heart  Then coming to herself a little  and recovering her speech    My friend  said she  has Don Lewis taken leave of his senses  Tell me  if you can  his motive for so heroic an epistle  If he is tired of me  well and good  but he might have taken his leave like a gentleman   Madam  said I  my master most assuredly has not acted as I should have acted in his place  But he has in some sort been compelled to do as he has done  If you would give me your word to keep the secret  I could unravel the whole mystery  You have it at once  interrupted she with eagerness  depend on it you shall be brought into no scrape by me  therefore explain yourself without reserve  Well  then  replied I  the fact is  without paraphrase  circumlocution  loss of time  or perplexity of understanding  as I shall distinctly state in two short words    Not half a minute after the receipt of your letter  there came into our house a lady  under a veil as impenetrable as her purpose was dark  She inquired for Signor Pacheco  and talked with him in private for some time  At the close of the conversation  I overheard her saying    You swear to me never to see her more  but we must not stop there  to set my heart completely at rest you must instantly write her a farewell letter of my dictating  You know my terms  Don Lewis did as she desired  then giving the result into my custody    Acquaint yourself  said he  where Doctor Murcia de la Liana lives  and contrive to administer this love potion to his daughter Isabella   You see plainly  madam  pursued I  that this uncivil epistle is a rival s handiwork  and that consequently my master is not so much to blame as he appears  Oh  heaven  exclaimed she  he is more so than I
