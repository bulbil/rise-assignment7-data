 that I could not tell what to say    I courtesied to him  and to Mrs  Jervis for her good word  and said  I   wished I might be deserving of his favour  and her kindness  and nothing   should be wanting in me  to the best of my knowledge       O how amiable a thing is doing good   It is all I envy great folks for       I always thought my young master a fine gentleman  as every body says he   is  but he gave these good things to us both with such a graciousness    as I thought he looked like an angel       Mrs  Jervis says  he asked her  If I kept the men at a distance  for  he   said  I was very pretty  and to be drawn in to have any of them  might   be my ruin  and make me poor and miserable betimes  She never is wanting   to give me a good word  and took occasion to launch out in my praise    she says  But I hope she has said no more than I shall try to deserve    though I mayn t at present  I am sure I will always love her  next to   you and my dear mother  So I rest                                          Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER VII         DEAR FATHER       Since my last  my master gave me more fine things  He called me up to my   late lady s closet  and  pulling out her drawers  he gave me two suits   of fine Flanders laced headclothes  three pair of fine silk shoes  two   hardly the worse  and just fit for me   for my lady had a very little   foot   and the other with wrought silver buckles in them  and several   ribands and top knots of all colours  four pair of white fine cotton   stockings  and three pair of fine silk ones  and two pair of rich stays    I was quite astonished  and unable to speak for a while  but yet I was   inwardly ashamed to take the stockings  for Mrs  Jervis was not there    If she had  it would have been nothing  I believe I received them very   awkwardly  for he smiled at my awkwardness  and said  Don t blush    Pamela  Dost think I don t know pretty maids should wear shoes and   stockings       I was so confounded at these words  you might have beat me down with a   feather  For you must think  there was no answer to be made to this  So    like a fool  I was ready to cry  and went away courtesying and blushing    I am sure  up to the ears  for  though there was no harm in what he   said  yet I did not know how to take it  But I went and told all to Mrs    Jervis  who said  God put it into his heart to be good to me  and I must   double my diligence  It looked to her  she said  as if he would fit me   in dress for a waiting maid s place on Lady Davers s own person       But still your kind fatherly cautions came into my head  and made all   these gifts nothing near to me what they would have been  But yet  I   hope  there is no reason  for what good could it do to him to harm such   a simple maiden as me  Besides  to be sure no lady would look upon   him  if he should so disgrace himself  So I will make myself easy  and    indeed  I should never have been otherwise  if you had not put it into   my head  for my good  I know very well  But  may be  without these   uneasinesses to mingle with these benefits  I might be too much puffed   up  So I will conclude  all that happens is for our good  and God bless   you  my dear father and mother  and I know you constantly pray for a   blessing upon me  who am  and shall always be                                           Your dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER VIII
