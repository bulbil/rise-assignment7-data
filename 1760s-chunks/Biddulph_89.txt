I determined not on any account to encourage such a wild expectation  yet I intended to make a discreet use of it  besides  I knew it would afford me a handle for keeping a respectful distance   We landed next evening  She had been very sick at sea  and continued so much out of order  that she was put to bed as soon as we got to the inn  She ordered her maid not to stir from her  the very thing I wished  so that I had nothing to do but to be very troublesome in my enquiries after her health  and very sorry for her indisposition   The next morning however set all to rights  and after congratulating her on her recovery  and the revival of her beauty  I told her I meant to carry her to Boulogne  whither I had sent Pivet the night before to take lodgings for us  in a private house which he knew  I found that neither Mrs Gerrarde nor her maid spoke French  a circumstance I was very glad of  though the former bitterly lamented her having forgot it  She made not the least objection to the travelling from Calais to Boulogne  as she had done before  her late indisposition gave me a pretence for insisting on Rachael’s attending her in the chariot   The lodgings Pivet had taken were very handsome  our apartments were on the same floor  separated only by a lobby  Mrs Rachael had a little bed fitted up for her by my directions in her lady’s dressing room  Thus far I had sailed before the wind  but now came the difficult part of my task  It was impossible for Mrs Gerrarde to conceive that any thing  but down right love for her person  could have induced me to do what I had done  I had actually run away with her  put myself to some hazard  and  what in her estimation was no small matter  some expence too  No other motive had appeared in all my conduct towards her  and tho’ I had not absolutely made love to her  yet what other construction could my actions bear  for my words  to say the truth  were equivocal  She must necessarily have concluded that I had no other view but a piece of gallantry with her  Her designs on me were of a much more serious nature  and her vanity made her imagine  that  notwithstanding my thorough knowledge of her character  her    cunning  joined to my passion  might lead me into her snare   Now  I had two nice points to consider of  and two difficulties to surmount  The first was  not  by any part of my conduct  to carry the deception so far as to give her the least room to hope I could be mad enough to marry her  This  bad as she is  and extravagant as I am  I could not think of doing  even to gain my favourite point  The other was  to keep up such an appearance of gallantry towards her as she must naturally expect  and at the same time avoid all approaches which usually forerun the catastrophe of an amour  than which nothing was more repugnant to my wishes   To steer between these two extremes was the difficult task  particularly the latter  for  between ourselves  I began to be much more afraid of her than she was of me  I knew it would be impossible for me to keep up the farce long  the sooner it was over the better  and therefore I determined to enter on my part directly   I had been ruminating on my project all the way as I rode  When we arrived at Boulogne  I found myself a little out of order  having caught cold  and as I was really somewhat feverish  a thought started into my head  that this illness might aid me in my design  When we came to our lodgings  I made my excuses to Mrs Gerrarde for not being able to attend her  I told her I found myself ill  and must be obliged to go to bed  She said she was very sorry  and perhaps she spoke truth   I left her in possession of her new apartment with her maid Rachael  Their being strangers to the language of the country cut off all communication with the people of the house  who could not speak English  I introduced Pivet to them  whom they had never seen before  for he had taken particular care to keep out of their view during the whole journey   as a gentleman who was to be their interpreter  and having thus settled my household  I retired to my bed chamber   Not well  nor sick enough to go to bed  I threw myself however down on it  and after revolving in my mind all the occurrences of the three or four past days  I started up again  sat down to my desk  and have given you  my Bidulph  a faithful narrative of my proceedings down to the present period of time  being November 20  eight o’clock in the evening   You may soon expect to have the second part of this my delectable history  ‘Shewing how Orlando  not being able to prevail  with all his eloquence  on the as fair and beautiful
