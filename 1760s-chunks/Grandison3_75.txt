in Italian or French  was in her newly acquired language  But the moment he was gone  her countenance fell  and she was studious to find opportunities to get from company    What think you of my sortitude  Lucy  Was I not a good girl  But my curiosity kept up my spirits  When I come to reflect  thought I  I shall have it all upon my pillow      184 Her parents were in the deepest affliction  They consulted physicians  who all pronounced her malady to be Love  She was taxed with it  and all the indulgence promised her that her heart could wish  as to the object  but still she could not  with patience  bear the imputation  Once she asked her woman  who told her that she was certainly in Love  Would you have me hate myself —Her mother talked to her of the passion in favourable terms  and as laudable  She heard her with attention  but made no answer   The evening before the day I was to set out for Germany  the family made a sumptuous entertainment  in honour of a guest on whom they had conferred so many favours  They had brought themselves to approve of his departure the more readily  as they were willing to see  whether his absence would affect their Clementina  and  if it did  in what manner   They left it to her choice  Whether she would appear at table  or not  She chose to be there  They all rejoiced at her recovered spirits  She was exceeding chearful  She supported her part of the conversation  during the whole evening  with her usual vivacity and good sense  insomuch that I wished to myself  I had departed sooner  Yet it is surprising  thought I that this young Lady  who seemed always to be pleased  and even since these resveries have had power over her  to be most chearful in my company  should rejoice in my departure  should seem to owe her recovery to it  a departure which every one else kindly regrets  And yet there was nothing in her behaviour or looks that appeared in the least affected  When acknowlegements were made to me of the pleasure I had given to the whole family  she joined in them  When my health and happiness were wished  she added her wishes by chearful bows  as she sat  When they wished to see me again  before I went to England  she did the same  So that my heart was   185 dilated  I was overjoyed to see such an happy alteration  When I took leave of them  she stood forward to receive my compliments  with a polite French freedom  I offered to pres• her hand with my lips  My brother s deliverer  said she  must not affect this distance  and  in manner  offered her cheek  adding  God preserve my tutor where ever he set his foot  and in English  God convert you too  Chevalier   May you never want such an agreeable friend as you have been to us   Signor Jeronymo was not able to be with us  I went up to take leave of him  O my Grandison  said he  and flung his arms about my neck  and will you go —Blessings attend you —But what will become of a brother and sister  when they have lost you   You will rejoice me  replied I  if you will favour me with a few lines  by a servant whom I shall leave behind me for a few days  and who will find me at Inspruck  to let me know how you all do  and whether your sister s health continues   She must  she shall be yours  said he  if I can manage it  Why  why  will you leave us   I was surprised to hear him say this  He had never before been so particular   That cannot  cannot be  said I  There are a thousand obstacles—  All of which  rejoined he  that depend upon us  I doubt not to overcome  Your heart is not with Olivia   They all knew  from that Lady s indiscretion  of the proposals that had been made me  relating to her  and of my declining them  I assured him  that my heart was free   We agreed upon a correspondence  and I took leave of one of the most grateful of men   But how much was I afflicted when I received at Inspruck the expected Letter  which acquainted me  that this sunshine lasted no longer than the next day    186 The young Lady s malady returned  with redoubled force  Shall I  madam  briefly relate to you the manner in which  as her brother wrote  it operated upon her   She shut herself up in her chamber  not seeming to regard or know that her woman was in it  nor did she answer to two or three questions that her woman asked her  but  setting her chair with its back towards her  over against a closet in the room  after a profound silence  she bent forwards  and  in a low voice  seemed to be communing with a person in the closet —
