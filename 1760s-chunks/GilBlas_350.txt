be canvassed among them  I pricked up my ears  and greedily took in their discourse  if anything worth repeating was said  his excellency was sure to hear of it  It can scarcely be necessary to hint  that I never carried home anything which was not likely to pay for the porterage   One day  returning from one of these little conversational parties  my road lay in front of an hospital  It occurred to me to go in  I walked through two or three wards  filled with diseased patients  and examined their beds to see that they were properly taken care of  Among these unhappy wretches  whom I could not look at without the most painful feelings  I observed one whose features struck me  it surely could be no other than Fabricio  my countryman and chum  To look at him more closely  I drew near his bedside  and finding beyond a possibility of doubt that it was the poet Nunez  I stopped to look at him for a few seconds without saying a word  He also fixed his regards on me  At length breaking silence  Do not my eyes deceive me  said I  Is it indeed Fabricio  and here  It is indeed  answered he  coldly  and you need not wonder at it  Since we parted  I have been working indefatigably at the trade of an author  I have written novels  play  and works of genius in every department  My brain is fairly spun out  and here I am   I could not help laughing at such a sketch of literary biography  and still more at the serious air of the accompanying action  What  cried I  has your muse brought you to this pass  Has she played you such a jade s trick as this  Even as you witness  answered he  this establishment is a sort of halfpay receptacle for invalids on the muster roll of disabled wit  You have acted discreetly  my good friend  to lay yourself out for promotion in a different line  But they tell me  you are no longer a courtier  and that your prospects in political life were all blasted  nay  they went so far as to affirm  that you were committed to close custody by the king s order  They told you no more than the truth  replied I  the delightful vision of political eminence wherein you left me last  soon shifted the scene of my incoherent dreams to a prison and complete destitution  But for all that  my friend  here you behold me again in a better plight than ever  That is quite out of the question  said Nunez  your deportment is discreet and decent  you have not that supercilious and devil  take the hindermost sort of aspect  which good keep communicates to the human face  The reverses of this chequered life  replied I  have brought me down to the level of the more modest virtues  I have taken a lesson in the school of adversity  to enjoy the possession of a good stud without riding the great horse   Tell me then candidly  cried Fabricio  raising his head upon his hand with his elbow upon the pillow  what your present occupation can possibly be  A steward perhaps to some nobleman out at elbows  or man of business to some rich widow  Something better than either the one or the other  rejoined I  but excuse me from saying more at present  another time your curiosity shall be satisfied  It is enough at present to assure you that my means are equal to my inclination  and that you may command independence through me  but then you must submit to an embargo on your wit  and a non intercourse act between you and the faculty of writing  whether in verse or prose  Can you make this sacrifice to my friendship  I have already made it to the powers above  said he  in my last critical sickness  A Dominican made me forswear poetry  as an amusement bordering on criminality  but at all events beside the turnpike road of good sense  I wish you joy  my dear Nunez  replied I  beware of a revoke  There is not the least danger on that head  rejoined he  the Muses and I have agreed on terms of separation  just as you came in at that door  I was conning over a farewell ode  Good master Fabricio  said I  with a wise swagging to and fro of my head  it is a doubtful question whether your vow of abjuration ought to pass current with the Dominican and myself  you seem over head and ears in love with those virgins incarnate  No  no  contended he peevishly  I have cut the connection asunder  Nay more  I have quarrelled with their keepers  the public  The readers of these days do not deserve an author of more genius than themselves  I should be sorry to write down to their comprehension  You are not to suppose that this is the language of disgust  it is my sincere and well weighed opinion  Applause and hisses are just the same to me  It is a toss up who fails and who succeeds  the wit of to  day is the blockhead of to morrow  What cursed fools our dramatists must be  to care
