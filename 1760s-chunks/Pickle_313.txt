 over and above the garrison and its appendages  which he  reckoned at sixty pounds a year  He therefore desired  that  as his  lordship had been so kind as to favour him with his friendship and  advice  he would extend his generosity still farther  by putting him in  a way of making the most advantage of his money  My lord said  that   for his own part  he did not choose to meddle in money matters  that  Mr  Pickle would find abundance of people ready to borrow it upon land  security  but that he ought to be extremely cautious in a transaction of  such consequence  promising  at the same time  to employ his own steward  in seeking out a mortgager to whom it might be safely lent   This agent was accordingly set at work  and for a few days made a  fruitless inquiry  so that the young gentleman was obliged to have  recourse to his own intelligence  by which he got notice of several  people of reputed credit  who offered him mortgages for the whole sum   but when he made a report of the particulars to his noble friend  his  lordship started such doubts and objections relating to each  that he  was deterred from entering into any engagements with the proposers   congratulating himself  in the meantime  on his good fortune  in being  favoured with the advice and direction of such a sage counsellor   Nevertheless  he began to be impatient  after having unsuccessfully  consulted all the money brokers and conveyancers about town  and  resolved to try the expedient of a public advertisement  But he was  persuaded by my lord to postpone that experiment  until every other  method should have failed  because it would attract the attention of  all the pettifoggers in London  who  though they might not be able to  overreach  would infallibly harass and tease him out of all tranquility   It was on the back of this conversation that Peregrine  chancing to meet  the steward near his lord s house  stopped him in the street  to give  him an account of his bad luck  at which the other expressed some  concern  and rubbing his chin with his hand  in a musing posture  told  Pickle  there was a thought just come into his head  pointing out one  way of doing his business effectually  The youth  upon this intimation   begged he would accompany him to the next coffee house  in which having  chosen a private situation  this grave manager gave him to understand   that a part of my lord s estate was mortgaged  in consequence of a debt  contracted by his grandfather  for provision to the younger children of  the family  and that the equity of redemption would be foreclosed in a  few months  unless the burden could be discharged   My lord   said he    has always lived in a splendid manner  and  notwithstanding his ample  fortune  together with the profits accruing from the posts he enjoys   he saves so little money  that  upon this occasion  I know he will  be obliged to borrow ten thousand pounds to make up the sum that is  requisite to redeem the mortgage  Now  certain I am  that  when his  design comes to be known  he will be solicited on all hands by people  desirous of lending money upon such undoubted security  and  tis  odds but he has already promised the preference to some particular  acquaintance  However  as I know he has your interest very much at  heart  I will  if you please  sound his lordship upon the subject  and  in a day or two give you notice of my success      6 22 15  3 45 PM   Peregrine  ravished with the prospect of settling this affair so much  to his satisfaction  thanked the steward for his friendly hint and  undertaking  which he assured him should be acknowledged by a more solid  proof of his gratitude  provided the business could be brought to bear   and next day he was visited by this kind manager  with the happy news  of his lordship s having consented to borrow ten thousand pounds of his  stock upon mortgage  at the interest of five per cent  This information  he received as an instance of the singular esteem of his noble patron   and the papers being immediately drawn and executed  the money was  deposited in the hands of the mortgager  who  in the hearing of the  lender  laid strong injunctions on his steward to pay the interest  punctually at quarter day   The best part of our hero s fortune being thus happily deposited  and  the agent gratified with a present of fifty pieces  he began to put his  retrenching scheme in execution  all his servants  Pipes excepted  were  discharged  his chariot and running horses disposed of  his housekeeping  broken up  and his furniture sold by auction  nay  the heat of his  disposition was as remarkable in this as any other transaction in  his life  for every step of his saving project was
