have me a gentleman  he supposed  at any rate  and their poverty could not afford the necessary education —This exordium did not at all contribute to the recovery of my spirits  but on the contrary  reduced me to such a situation that I was scarce able to stand  which being perceived by a plump gentleman  who sat opposite to me  with a skull before him  he said Mr  Snarler was too severe upon the young man  and turning towards me  told me  I need not be afraid  for no body would do me any harm  then bidding me take time to recollect myself  he examined me touching the operation of the trepan  and was very well satisfied with my answers —The next person who questioned me was a wag  who began by asking me if I had ever seen amputation performed  to which I replying in the affirmative  he shook his head and said    What  upon a dead subject  I suppose  If  continued he  during an engagement at sea  a man should be brought to you with his head shot off  how would you behave  —  After some hesitation  I owned  such a case had never come under my observation  neither did I remember to have seen any method of cure proposed for such an accident  in any of the systems of surgery I had perused  Whether it was owing to the simplicity of my answer  or the archness of the question  I know not  but every member at the board deigned to smile  except Mr  Snarler  who seemed to have very little of the animal risibile in his constitution    137 —The facetious member  encouraged by the success of his last joke  went on thus    Suppose you was called to a patient of a plethoric habit  who had been bruised by a fall  what would you do    I answered  I would bleed him immediately    What   said he  before you tied up his arm  —  But this stroke of wit not answering his expectation  he desired me to advance to the gentleman who sat next him  and who with a pert air  asked what method of cure I would follow in wounds of the intestines —I repeated the method of cure as it is prescribed by the best chirurgical writers  which he heard to an end  and then said with a supercilious smile    So  you think with such treatment the patient might recover  —  I told him I saw nothing to make me think otherwise —   That may be  resumed he  I won t answer for your foresight —but did you ever know a case of this kind succeed    I acknowledged I did not  and was about to tell him I had never seen a wounded intestine  but he stopt me  by saying with some precipitation    Nor never will —I affirm  that all wounds of the intestines  whether great or small  are mortal  —   Pardon me  brother  says the fat gentleman  there is very good authority —  Here he was interrupted by the other  with   Sir  excuse me  I despise all authority —Nullius in verba —I stand upon my own bottom  —   But Sir  Sir   replied his antagonist  the reason of the thing shews —   A fig for reason  cried this sufficient member  I laugh at reason  give me ocular demonstration  —  The corpulent gentleman began to wax warm  and observed that no man acquainted with the anatomy of the parts  would   138 advance such an extravagant assertion —This inuendo enraged the other so much  that he started up  and in a furious tone exclaimed    What Sir  do you question my knowledge in anatomy  —  By this time  all the examiners had espoused the opinion of one or other of the disputants  and raised their voices all together  when the chairman commanded silence and ordered me to withdraw  In less than a quarter of an hour  I was called in again  and received my qualification sealed up  and was ordered to pay five shillings —I laid down my half guinea upon the table  and stood some time  until one of them bid me begone  to this I replied  I will  when I have got my change  upon which another threw me five shillings and six pence  saying  I would not be a true Scotchman if I went away without my change  I was afterwards obliged to give three shillings and six pence to the beadles  and a shilling to an old woman who swept the hall  This disbursement sunk my finances to thirteen pence half penny  with which I was sneaking off  when Jackson perceiving it  came up to me  and begged I would tarry for him and he would accompany me to the other end of the town  as soon as his examination should be over  I could not refuse this to a person that was so much my friend  but I was astonished at the change of his dress  which was varied in half an hour from what I have already described  to a very grotesque fashion —His head was covered with an old
