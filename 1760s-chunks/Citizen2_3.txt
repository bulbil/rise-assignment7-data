if we can  for love  We receive but little advantage from repeated protestations of gratitude  but they cost him very much from whom we exact them in return  exacting a grateful acknowledgement is demanding a debt by which the creditor is not advantaged  and the debtor pays with reluctance     4As Mencius the Philosopher was travelling in the pursuit of wisdom  night overtook him at the foot of a gloomy mountain  remote from the habitations of men  Here as he was straying  while rain and thunder conspired to make solitude still more hideous  he perceived a hermit s cell  and approaching  asked for shelter  Enter  cries the hermit  in a severe tone  men deserve not to be obliged  but it would be imitating their ingratitude to treat them as they deserve  Come in  examples of vice may sometimes strengthen us in the ways of virtue   After a frugal meal  which consisted of roots and tea  Mencius could not repress his curiosity to know why the hermit had retired from mankind  the actions of whom taught the truest lessons of wisdom  Mention not the name of man  cries the hermit  with indignation  here let me live retired from a base ungrateful world  here among the beasts of the forest  I shall find no flatterers  the lion is a generous enemy  and the dog a faithful friend  but man  base man  can poison the bowl  and smile while he presents it  You have been used ill by mankind  interrupted the philosopher shrewdly  Yes  returned the hermit  on mankind I have exhausted my whole fortune  and this staff  and that cup  and those roots are all that I have in return  Did you bestow your fortune  or did you only lend it  returned Mencius  I bestowed it  undoubtedly  replied the other  for where were the merit of being a money lender  Did they ever own that they received it  still adds the philosopher  A thousand times  cries the hermit  they every day loaded me with professions of gratitude  for obligations received  and solicitations   5 for future favours  If then  says Mencius  smiling  you did not lend your fortune  in order to have it returned  it is unjust to accuse th•m of ingratitude  they own d themselves obliged  you expected no more  and they certainly earn d each favour by frequently acknowledging the obligation  The hermit was struck with the reply  and surveying his guest with emotion  I have heard of the great Mencius  and you certainly are the man  I am now fourscore years old  but still a child in wisdom  take me back to the school of man  and educate me as one of the most ignorant and the youngest of your disciples   Indeed  my son  it is better to have friends in our passage through life than grateful dependants  and as love is a more willing  so it is a more lasting tribute than extorted obligation  As we are uneasy when greatly obliged  gratitude once refused  can never after be recovered  the mind that is base enough to disallow the just return  instead of feeling any uneasiness upon recollection  triumphs in its new acquired freedom  and in some measure is pleased with conscious baseness   Very different is the situation of disagreeing friends  their separation produces mutual uneasiness  Like that divided being in fabulous creation  their sympathetic souls once more desire their former union  the joys of both are imperfect  their gayest moments tinctured with uneasiness  each seeks for the smallest concessions to clear the way to a wished for explanation  the most trifling acknowledgement  the slightest accident serves to effect a mutual reconciliation     6But instead of pursuing the thought  permit me to soften the severity of advice  by an European story which will fully illustrate my meaning   A fidler and his wife  who had rubbed through life  as most couples usually do  sometimes good friends  at others not quite so well  one day happened to have a dispute  which was conducted with becoming spirit on both sides  The wife was sure she was right  and the husband was resolved to have his own way  What was to be done in such a case  the quarrel grew worse by explanations  and at last the fury of both rose to such a pitch  that they made a vow never to sleep together in the same bed for the future  This was the most rash vow that could be imagined  for they still were friends at bottom  and besides they had but one bed in the house  however  resolved they were to go through with it  and at night the fiddle case was laid in bed between them  in order to make a separation  In this manner they continued for three weeks  every night the fiddle case being placed as a barrier to divide them   By this time  however  each heartily repented of their vow  their resentment was at an end  and their love began to return  they wished the fiddle case away  but both had too much spirit to begin  One night  however  as they were both lying awake with the detested fiddle case between them  the husband happened to sneeze
