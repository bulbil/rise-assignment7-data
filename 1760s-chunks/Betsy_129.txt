  the only deception she had practised on him   It was a debt   said she     contracted by my former husband  which I knew not of  I thought the   effects he left behind him were more than sufficient to have discharged   whatever obligations he lay under  and foolishly took out letters of   administration  The demand of Marplus came not upon me till some time   after  I then inconsiderately gave him my own bond  which he  however    promised not to put in force without previously acquainting me        This excuse was too weak  as well as all the affection Mr  Goodman had   for her  to pacify the emotions of his just indignation   And pray     cried he  in a voice divided between scorn and anger   of what advantage   would it have been to me your being previously acquainted with it  Could   you have paid the money without robbing or defrauding me  No  Madam     continued he   I shall for the future give credit to nothing you can   say  and as I cannot be assured that this is the only misfortune I have   to dread on your account  shall consider what steps I ought to take for   my defence        In speaking these words he rung the bell for a servant  and ordered that   bed to which he had invited Mr  Thoughtless  should that instant be made   ready for himself  All the tears and intreaties of Lady Mellasin were in   vain to make him recede from his resolution of lying alone that night    and  as soon as he was told his orders were obeyed  he flung out of the   room  saying   Madam  perhaps  we never more may meet between a pair of   sheets   Whether at that time he was determined to carry his resentment   so far  or not  is uncertain  but what happened very shortly after left   him no other part to take than that which he had threatened                CHAPTER XIV       Gives a full explanation of some passages which hitherto have seemed   very dark and mysterious          This was a night of great confusion in Mr  Goodman s family  Lady   Mellasin either was  or pretended to be  in fits  Miss Flora was called   up soon after she went to bed  but Mr  Goodman himself would not be   prevailed upon to rise  though told the condition his wife was in  and   that she begged with the utmost earnestness to see him       This behaviour in a husband  lately so tender and affectionate  is a   proof not only that the greatest love  once turned  degenerates into its   reverse  but also that the sweetest temper  when too much provoked by   injuries  is not always the most easy to be reconciled  The perfect   trust he had put in Lady Mellasin  the implicit faith he had given to   all she said  and the dependance he had on the love she had professed   for him  made the deception she was now convicted of appear in worse   colours than otherwise it would have done       The more he reflected on this ugly affair  the more he was convinced of   the hypocrisy of his wife  in whom he had placed such confidence   We   have been married near five years   said he to himself   how comes it to   pass  that the penalty of this bond was not in so long a time demanded    It must be that she has kept it off by large interest and for bearance   money  and who knows how far my credit may be endangered for the raising   of it  It is likely  that while I thought every thing necessary for my   family was purchased with ready money  I may stand indebted to all the   tradesmen this wicked woman has had any dealings with  nay  I cannot   even assure myself that other obligations of the same kind with this I   have already suffered for  may not some time or other call upon me for   their discharge        With these disturbed meditations  instead of sleep  did he pass what was   remaining of the night when he went to bed  yet he rose the next day   full as early as he was accustomed to do after having enjoyed the best   repose       The first thing he did was to send for as many of those tradespeople  as   he either knew himself  or his servants could inform him  had at any   time sent goods into his house  On their presenting themselves before   him  he found  more to his vexation than surprize
