general panic   Peregrine was seized with this epidemic distemper to a violent degree   and  after having lost a few loose hundreds  in his progress through the  various rookeries of the place  entered into partnership with his noble  friend in a grand match  upon the issue of which he ventured no less  than three thousand pounds  Indeed he would not have risked such a  considerable sum  had not his own confidence been reinforced by the  opinion and concurrence of his lordship  who hazarded an equal bet upon  the same event  These two associates engaged themselves in the penalty  of six thousand pounds  to run one chaise and four against another   three times round the course  and our adventurer had the satisfaction of  seeing his antagonist distanced in the first and second heat  but  all  of a sudden  one of the horses of his machine was knocked up  by which  accident the victory was ravished almost from his very grasp  and he was  obliged to endure the damage and the scorn   He was deeply affected with this misfortune  which he imputed to his  own extravagance and temerity  but discovered no external signs of  affliction  because his illustrious partner bore his loss with the most  philosophic resignation  consoling himself  as well as Pickle  with the  hope of making it up on some other occasion  Nevertheless  our young    6 22 15  3 45 PM   gentleman could not help admiring  and even envying his equanimity  not  knowing that his lordship had managed matters so as to be a gainer by  the misfortune  which to retrieve  Peregrine purchased several horses   at the recommendation of his friend  and  instead of returning to  London  made a tour with him to all the celebrated races in England  at  which  after several vicissitudes of fortune  he made shift  before the  end of the season  to treble his loss   But his hopes seemed to increase with his ill luck  In the beginning of  winter he came to town  fully persuaded that fortune must necessarily  change  and that next season he should reap the happy fruits of his  experience  In this confidence  he seemed to drown all ideas of prudence  and economy  His former expense was mere parsimony  compared with that  which he now incurred  He subscribed to the opera  and half a dozen  concerts at different parts of the town  was a benefactor to several  hospitals  purchased a collection of valuable pictures  took a house   and furnished it in a most magnificent taste  laid in a large stock  of French wines  and gave extravagant entertainments to his quality  friends  who  in return  loaded him with compliments  and insisted upon  his making use of their interest and goodwill   CHAPTER LXXXIX   He is taken into the Protection of a great Man  Sets up for a Member  of Parliament  Is disappointed in his Expectation  and finds himself  egregiously outwitted   Among these professed patrons  the greatest part of whom Peregrine  saw through  there was one great personage  who seemed to support with  dignity the sphere in which fortune had placed him  His behaviour to  Pickle was not a series of grinning complaisance in a flat repetition of  general expressions of friendship and regard  He demeaned himself with  a seemingly honest reserve  in point of profession  his advances to  Peregrine appeared to be the result of deliberation and experiment  he  chid the young gentleman for his extravagance  with the authority of  a parent  and the sincerity of a fast friend  and having  by gradual  inquiries  made himself acquainted with the state of his private  affairs  condemned his conduct with an air of candour and concern   He represented to him the folly and dangerous consequences of the  profligate life in which he had plunged himself  counselled him  with great warmth to sell off his race horses  which would otherwise  insensibly eat him up  to retrench all superfluous expense  which would  only serve to expose him to the ridicule and ingratitude of those who  were benefited by it  to lay out his money upon secure mortgages  at  good interest  and carry into execution his former design of standing  candidate for a borough  at the ensuing election for a new parliament   in which case this nobleman promised to assist him with his influence  and advice  assuring him  that  if he could once procure a seat in the  house  he might look upon his fortune as already made   Our adventurer perceiving the wisdom and sanity of this advice  for  which he made his acknowledgments to his generous monitor  protested    6 22 15  3 45 PM   that he would adhere to it in every particular  and immediately set  about a reformation  He accordingly took cognizance of his most minute  affairs  and  after an exact scrutiny  gave his patron to understand   that  exclusive of his furniture  his fortune was reduced to fourteen  thousand three hundred and thirty pounds  in Bank and South sea  annuities
