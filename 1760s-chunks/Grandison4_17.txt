I was silent —Ah  Lucy  had Lady D  been the mother of Sir Charles Grandison  with what pleasure could I have listened to her   You said  my dear  that Sir Charles Grandison will soon leave England  And then you sighed—Will you be quite open hearted —May I ask you a question in hope that you will   I was silent  Yet the word Yes  was on my lips   You have caused it to be told me  that your affections are engaged  This has been a cruel blow upon us  My Lord  nevertheless  has heard so much of you  He is reall a good young man  my dear   that  against my advice▪ I own  he would have me introduce him into your company  I see by his looks  that he could admire you above all women  He never was in love  I should be sorry if he were disappointed in his first love  I hope his promised prudence will be his guard  if there be no prospect of his succeeding with you—She paused—I was still silent—  It will be a mark of your frankness of heart  my dear  if  when you take my full meaning  you prevent me speaking more than I need  I would not oppress you  my sweet love—Such a delicacy  and such a frankness mingled  have I never seen in young woman—But tell me  my dear  has Sir Charles Grandison made his addresses to you   It was a grievous question for me to answer—But why was it so  my Lucy  when all the hopes I ever had  proceeded from my own presumption  confirmed  that s true  of late   by his sisters partiality in my favour  and when his unhappy Clementina has such a a preferable claim   What says Miss Byron   She says  madam  that she reveres Lady D  and   43 will answer any questions that she puts to her  however affecting—Sir Charles Grandison has not   Once I thought proceeded she  that I never would make a second motion  were the woman a princess  who had confessed a prior love  or even liking  But the man is Sir Charles Grandison  whom all women must esteem  and the woman is Miss Byron  whom all men must love  Let me ask you  my dear—Have you any expectation  that the first of men  I will call him so  and the loveliest and most amiable minded of women  can come together —You sighed  you know  when you mentioned  that Sir Charles was soon to leave England  and you own that he has not made addresses to you—Don t be uneasy  my love —We women  in these tender cases  see into each other s hearts from small openings—Look upon me as your mother—What say you  love   Your Ladyship compliments me with delicacy and frankness—It is too hard a question  if I have any of the first to answer without blushes  A young woman to be supposed to have an esteem for a man  who has made no declarations  and whose behaviour to her is such only as shews a politeness to which he is accustomed  and only the same kind of tenderness as he shews to his sister —and whom sometimes he calls sister—as if—Ah  madam  how can one answer   You have answered  my dear  and with that delicacy and frankness too▪ which make a principal part of your character  If my son  and he shall not be encouraged in his hopes  if he sees you not  mind as well as person  with his mother s eyes  should not be able to check himself  by the apprehensions he has had reason for  of being but a second man in the favour of the object of his wishes  We  my dear  have our delicacies  could you not allow him a second place in your favour  that might  in time  as he should merit  and as you should subdue your prepossessions  give him a first —Hush—my dear  for one moment—   44 Your honour  your piety  are my just dependence  and will be his —And now speak  It is to me  my dear  Speak your whole heart  Let not any apprehended difficulty—I am a woman as well as you  And prepared to indulge—  Your goodness  madam  and nothing else  interrupted I  gives me difficulty —My Lord D  seems to me to be a man of merit  and not a disagreeable man in his person and manners  What he said of Sir Charles Grandison  and of his emulation being fired by his example  gave him additional merit with me  He must have a good mind  I wish him acquainted with Sir Charles  for his own sake  and for the sake of the world  which might be benefited by his large power  so happily directed —But as to myself  I should forfeit the character of frankness of heart  which your Ladyship s goodness ascribes to me  if I did not declare  that altho  I cannot  and  I think  ought not  to entertain an hope with regard to Sir Charles Grandison  since there is a Lady who deserved him by severe sufferings before I knew him  yet
