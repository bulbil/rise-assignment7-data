humane Disposition  perhaps  few People feel more of Tenderness in their Hearts  than I do  and  from a certain Softness in my Nature  tho  I have not the Appearance of it in my Manners  I often experience a fond Temper for other People s Children  which sometimes their Parents are insensible of  Therefore the Arguments  I amused the Time with  in the Letter you mention  proceeded merely from a certain Method  I have always put in Practice  ever since I ventured to think for myself  which was  never to take any Opinion  or Dogma  upon the common received Notions of the World  or the ipse dixit of the Schools  without first making it pass thro  the Scrutiny of Sense and Reason  which is the surest Way of allowing the full Value to every Virtue or Quality in human Nature   Besides  I am jealous for the Honour or Dignity of Man  and would endeavour to rescue   264 every Thing from Instinct  which can be attributed to Reflection  or universal Benevolence  I think too  that the Doctrine of natural Affection has often had several very bad Consequences attending it  in making many Children  depending on that Prejudice  behave themselves more unworthily toward their Parents  than they would venture to do to their Patrons  and many Fathers have left immense Fortunes to graceless Sons  from this Mistake  while they have left an honest Servant  or valuable Friend  unrewarded   I expected a good deal from you upon the Subject of my late Letters  or  what was better  something relating to yourself  but your Apologies put me in Mind of what was said by a surly Courtier to King William  that King Charles refused a Favour with a better Grace  than he granted one   I have often in Conversation  in reading to you  and by Letter  endeavoured to lead you into Subjects of some Intricacy  or Depth  in order to make you experience your own Genius  and be sensible of your Strength  and  tho  you are sometimes too cowardly to engage  yet your slight Touches and irregular Essays are like the Tuning of an Instrument by a masterly Hand  which has something more pleasing to a good Ear  than the irregular Performance of a middling one     265  Like Shakespear  Fancy s sweetest Child   Warbling his native Wood notes wild   LETTER CXXXVII   Dear HARRY   I AM sorry the Song did not please you  but  as I have not the Misfortune to be a Connoisseur  I like it mightily  I am not overburthened with Knowledge of any Kind  and yet I sincerely wish I had less  as the little I have serves more to improve my Folly  than Reason  by giving me a general Disrelish to most Things that I understand  For Instance —let the Words and Musick of a Song be  like that I sent you  equally bad  and I shall be disgusted with the Words  and pleased with the Tune  when  perhaps  if I understood Musick  even as well as I do Poetry  I should not have received any Pleasure from either  Query  could my understanding Crotchets and Quavers make me Amends for robbing me of Half an Hour s Entertainment   Your Sentiments on natural Affection  may  for aught I know  be perfectly right  but I think it is vastly more to the Honour of human Nature  to suppose  that our Virtues are innate   which is but another Name for Instinct  than acquired  and it is to me quite certain  that this particularly must proceed from honest Instinct  for the very utmost Effect  which can   266 arise from Reflection in this Case  is not to make us feel  but act  as if we felt  the natural Touch   I am quite sensible of my own Incapacity to engage  on any Topick  with you  and  if ever I venture to give my Opinion on Subjects  that I neither am  nor ever shall be Mistress of  it must be owing to a strong Reliance on your Indulgence  and to the Pleasure  I always took  in having you for a Preceptor  There is a Kind of Pride in receiving Instruction from the Man I love  which compensates for the Mortification of being ignorant  For these Reasons  I think your Sarcasm rather severe  than just  For  were I even a greater Fool  than I am  it would be cruel to condemn me for being so  while I make no Claim to Sense  or Knowledge  but you are welcome to say what you please  nor am I angry at your being witty  There is yet another Reason  which I may offer  in Defence of my Cowardice  and is  perhaps  the most valid of any —the continual Hurry I have been in  ever since you left Town  While you was here  I neither saw  nor went to see any Creature  of Course  had not only many Visits  but Apologies to make  and these  joined to more Business than ever I was engaged in  with a thousand perplexing Circumstances  have left me hardly Time to eat or sleep  I have fretted myself to Death
