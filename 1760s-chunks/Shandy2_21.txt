and halters  oblige us to it     I see plainly  said my father  that this sermon has been composed to be preached at the Temple —or at some Assize —I like the reasoning —and 〈◊〉sorry that Dr  Slop has fallen asleep before the time of his conviction —for it is now clear  that the Parson  as I thought at first  never insulted St Paul in the least —nor has there been  brother  the least difference between them —A great matter  if they had differed  replied my uncle Toby —the best friends in the world may differ sometimes —True —brother Toby  quoth my father  shaking hands with him —we ll fill our pipes  brother  and then  Trim shall go on     Well —what dost thou think of it  said my father  speaking to Corporal Trim  as he reach d his tobacco box   I think  answer d the Corporal  that the seven watch men upon the tower  who  I suppose  are all centinels there —are more  an  please your Honour  than were necessary —and  to go on at that rate  would harrass a regiment all to pieces  which a commanding officer  who loves his men  will never do  if he can help it  because two centinels  added the Corporal  are as good as twenty —I have been a commanding officer myself in the Corps de Garde a hundred times  continued Trim  rising an inch higher in his figure  as he spoke —and all the time I had the honour to serve his Majesty KingWilliam  in relieving the most considerable posts  I never left more than two in my life —    Very right  Trim  quoth my uncle Toby —but you do not consider  Trim  that the towers  in Solomon s days  were not such things as our bastions  flank d and defended by other works —this  Trim  was an invention since Solomon s death  nor had they horn works  or ravelins before the curtin  in his time —or such a fossé as we make with a cuvette in the middle of it  and with cover d ways and counterscarps pallisadoed along it  to guard against a Coup de main —So that the seven men upon the tower were a party  I dare say  from the Corps de Garde  set there  not only to look out  but to defend it —They could be no more  an  please your Honour  than a Corporal s Guard —My father smiled inwardly —but not outwardly —the subject between my uncle Toby and Corporal Trim being rather too serious  considering what had    happened  to make a jest of —So putting his pipe into his mouth  which he had just lighted —he contented himself with ordering Trim to read on  He read on as follows     To have the fear of God before our eyes  and  in our mutual dealings with each other  to govern our actions by the eternal measures of right and wrong —The first of these will comprehend the duties of religion —the second  those of morality  which are so inseparably connected together  that you cannot divide these two tables  even in imagination  tho  the attempt is often made in practice  without breaking and mutually destroying them both    I said the attempt is often made  and so it is —there being nothing    more common than to see a man who has no sense at all of religion —and indeed has so much honesty as to pretend to none  who would take it as the bitterest affront  should you but hint at a suspicion of his moral character —or imagine he was not conscientiously just and scrupulous to the uttermost mite    When there is some appearance that it is so —tho  one is unwilling even to suspect the appearance of so amiable a virtue as moral honesty  yet were we to look into the grounds of it  in the present case  I am persuaded we should find little reason to envy such a one the honour of his motive    Let him declaim as pompously as he chooses upon the subject  it will    be found to rest upon no better foundation than either his interest  his pride  his ease  or some such little and changeable passion as will give us but small dependance upon his actions in matters of great stress    I will illustrate this by an example    I know the banker I deal with  or the physician I usually call in    There is no need  cried Dr  Slop   waking  to call in any physician in this case   to be neither of them men of much religion  I hear them make a jest of it every day  and treat all its sanctions with so much scorn  as to put the matter past doubt  Well —notwithstanding this  I put my fortune into the hands of the one —and what is dearer still to me     I trust my life to the honest skill of the other    Now  let me examine what is my reason for this great confidence —Why  in the first place  I believe there is no probability that either of them will employ the power I put
