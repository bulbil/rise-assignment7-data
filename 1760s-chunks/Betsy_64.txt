misfortune  but endeavour to prevent it  by proving  by all        the ways I am able  that I am  with the most profound submission         Madam  your very humble  obedient  and eternally devoted servant            C  TRUEWORTH        Miss Betsy  after having read this letter  ordered the person who   brought it should come into the parlour  on which he delivered to her   the present mentioned in the letter  which she received with a great   deal of sweetness  gave the fellow something to drink her health  and   sent her service to his master  with thanks  and an assurance she should   be glad to see him whenever it suited with his convenience       All the ladies then began to examine the squirrel  which was  doubtless    the most beautiful creature of it s kind that could be purchased  The   chain  which fastened it to it s habitation  was gold  the links very   thick  and curiously wrought  Every one admired the elegance of the   donor s taste       Miss Betsy herself was charmed to an excess  both with the letter and   the present  but as much as she was pleased with the respectful passion   of Mr  Trueworth  she could not find in her heart to think of parting   with the assiduities of Mr  Staple  nor even the blunt addresses of   Captain Hysom  at least till she had exercised all the power her beauty   gave her over them       As the two last mentioned gentlemen were the friends of Mr  Goodman  he   went out somewhat before the hour in which either of them was expected   to come  chusing not to seem to know what it was not in his power to   amend  and determined  as he had promised Miss Betsy  not to interfere   between her and any of those who pretended to court her       These two lovers came to the door at the same time  and Mr  Staple   saying to the footman that opened the door  that he was come to wait on   Miss Betsy   I want to speak to that young gentlewoman  too   cried the   captain   if she be at leisure  Tell her my name is Hysom        Mr  Staple was immediately shewed up into the drawing room  and the   captain into the parlour  till Miss Betsy should be told his name   That   spark   said he to himself   is known here  I suppose he is one of those   Mr  Goodman told me of  that has a mind to Miss Betsy  but  as she knew   I was to be here  I think she might have left some orders concerning me    and not make me wait till that young gew gaw had spoke his mind to her        The fellow not coming down immediately  he grew very angry  and began to   call and knock with his cane against the floor  which  it may be easily   imagined  gave some sport to those above  Miss Betsy  however  having   told Mr  Staple the character of the man  and the diversion she intended   to make of his pretensions  would not vex him too much  and  to atone   for having made him attend so long  went to the top of the stairs   herself  and desired him to walk up       The reception she gave him was full of all the sweetness she could   assume  and excused having made him wait  and laid the blame on the   servant  who  she pretended  could not presently recollect his name    This put him into an exceeding good humour   Nay  fair lady   said he     as to that  I have staid much longer sometimes  before I could get to   the speech of some people  who I have not half the respect for as I have   for you  But you know   continued he  giving her a kiss  the smack of   which might be heard three rooms off   that I have business with   you  business that requires dispatch  and that made me a little   impatient        All the company had much ado to refrain laughing outright  but Miss   Betsy kept her countenance to a miracle   We will talk of business   another time   said she   we are going to hear a fine entertainment of   musick  You must not refuse giving us your company  Lady Mellasin has   got a ticket on purpose for you     I am very much obliged to her   ladyship   replied the captain
