duty of the   station to which I am so generously exalted  and to let you participate   with me the transporting pleasures that rise from my new condition  and   the favours that are hourly heaped upon me by the best of husbands  When   I had got my packet for you finished  I then set about writing  as he   had kindly directed me  to Mrs  Jervis  and had no difficulty till   I came to sign my name  and so I brought it down with me  when I was   called to supper  unsigned       My good master  for I delight  and always shall  to call him by that   name  had been writing to Mr  Longman  and he said  pleasantly  See    here  my dearest  what I have written to your Somebody  I read as   follows           Mr  LONGMAN        I have the pleasure to acquaint you  that last Thursday I was married   to my beloved Pamela  I have had reason to be disobliged with you  and   Mrs  Jervis and Jonathan  not for your kindness to  and regard for  my   dear spouse  that now is  but for the manner  in which you appealed to   my sister Davers  which has made a very wide breach between her and me    But as it was one of her first requests  that I would overlook what had   passed  and reinstate you in all your former charges  I think myself   obliged  without the least hesitation  to comply with it  So  if   you please  you may enter again upon an office which you have always   executed with unquestionable integrity  and to the satisfaction of    Yours etc         Friday afternoon         I shall set out next Tuesday or Wednesday for Bedfordshire  and desire   to find Jonathan  as well as you  in your former offices  in which    I dare say  you ll have the more pleasure  as you have such an early   instance of the sentiments of my dear wife  from whose goodness you may   expect every agreeable thing  She writes herself to Mrs  Jervis           I thanked him most gratefully for his goodness  and afterwards took the   above copy of it  and shewed him my letter to Mrs  Jervis  as follows           My DEAR MRS  JERVIS        I have joyful tidings to communicate to you  For yesterday I was   happily married to the best of gentlemen  yours and my beloved master    I have only now to tell you  that I am inexpressibly happy  that my   generous benefactor denies me nothing  and even anticipates my wishes    You may be sure I could not forget my dear Mrs  Jervis  and I made it my   request  and had it granted  as soon as asked  that you might return   to the kind charge  which you executed with so much advantage to our   master s interest  and so much pleasure to all under your direction  All   the power that is put into my hands  by the most generous of men  shall   be exerted to make every thing easy and agreeable to you  And as I shall   soon have the honour of attending my beloved to Bedfordshire  it will   be a very considerable addition to my delight  and to my unspeakable   obligations to the best of men  to see my dear Mrs  Jervis  and to be   received by her with that pleasure  which I promise myself from her   affection  For I am  my dear good friend  and always will be                           Yours  very affectionately  and gratefully                                                            PAMELA                He read this letter  and said   Tis yours  my dear  and must be good    But don t you put your name to it  Sir  said I  your goodness has given   me a right to a very honourable one but as this is the first occasion of   the kind  except that to my dear father and mother  I think I ought to   shew it you unsigned  that I may not seem over forward to take advantage   of the honour you have done me
