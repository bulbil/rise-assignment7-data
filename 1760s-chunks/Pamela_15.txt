  May I  said I  Lucretia like  justify myself with my death  if I am used   barbarously  O my good girl  said he  tauntingly  you are well read    I see  and we shall make out between us  before we have done  a pretty   story in romance  I warrant ye       He then put his hand in my bosom  and indignation gave me double   strength  and I got loose from him by a sudden spring  and ran out of   the room  and the next chamber being open  I made shift to get into it    and threw to the door  and it locked after me  but he followed me so   close  he got hold of my gown  and tore a piece off  which hung without   the door  for the key was on the inside       I just remember I got into the room  for I knew nothing further of the   matter till afterwards  for I fell into a fit with my terror  and there   I lay  till he  as I suppose  looking through the key hole  spyed me   upon the floor  stretched out at length  on my face  and then he called   Mrs  Jervis to me  who  by his assistance  bursting open the door  he   went away  seeing me coming to myself  and bid her say nothing of the   matter  if she was wise       Poor Mrs  Jervis thought it was worse  and cried over me like as if she   was my mother  and I was two hours before I came to myself  and just as   I got a little up on my feet  he coming in  I fainted away again with   the terror  and so he withdrew  but he staid in the next room to let   nobody come near us  that his foul proceedings might not be known       Mrs  Jervis gave me her smelling bottle  and had cut my laces  and set   me in a great chair  and he called her to him  How is the girl  said he    I never saw such a fool in my life  I did nothing at all to her  Mrs    Jervis could not speak for crying  So he said  She has told you  it   seems  that I was kind to her in the summer house  though I ll assure   you  I was quite innocent then as well as now  and I desire you to keep   this matter to yourself  and let me not be named in it       O  sir  said she  for your honour s sake  and for Christ s sake   But   he would not hear her  and said  For your own sake  I tell you  Mrs    Jervis  say not a word more  I have done her no harm  And I won t have   her stay in my house  prating  perverse fool  as she is  But since she   is so apt to fall into fits  or at least pretend to do so  prepare her   to see me to morrow after dinner  in my mother s closet  and do you be   with her  and you shall hear what passes between us       And so he went out in a pet  and ordered his chariot and four to be got   ready  and went a visiting somewhere       Mrs  Jervis then came to me  and I told her all that had happened  and   said  I was resolved not to stay in the house  And she replying  He   seemed to threaten as much  I said  I am glad of that  then I shall be   easy  So she told me all he had said to her  as above       Mrs  Jervis is very loath I should go  and yet  poor woman  she begins   to be afraid for herself  but would not have me ruined for the world    She says to be sure he means no good  but may be  now he sees me so   resolute  he will give over all attempts  and that I shall better know   what to do after tomorrow  when I am to appear before a very bad judge    I doubt       O how I dread this to morrow s appearance  But be as assured  my dear   parents  of the honesty of your poor child  as I am of your prayers for                                              Your dutiful DAUGHTER       O
