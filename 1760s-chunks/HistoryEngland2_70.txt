drove   188 the Austrians intirely out  and then appointed commanders  and guarded the walls with the utmost regularity   This revolution in a little city  the transactions of which has filled whole Folios of history  should not be passed over without remark  though no longer capable of maintaining its liberties amidst the shock of the enormous powers of Europe  yet still we find it possessed of its ancient spirit  only to lose it  however  by the prevailing power of the Senate  which established their aristocracy on the necks of the citizens  as before   In this manner we see victory and miscarriage mutually declaring for either  all sides growing more feeble  and none acquiring any real recompence for the losses sustained  Thus  about this time  the English made an unsuccessful expedition into France  in order to attack Port l Orient  in which they came off without any honour  The French gained a considerable victory at Rocroux in Flanders  over the allies  although it procured them no real advantage  and it cost them a greater number of lives than those whom they obliged to retire  The Dutch  in this general conflict  seemed the greatest losers  A victory gained over the allies at La Feldt served to reduce them to a still greater degree of distrust in their Generals  than they had hitherto shewn  but the taking of Bergen op Zoom  the strongest fortification of Dutch Brabant  and which put the French in possession of the whole navigation of the Schelde  threw them almost into despair  But these victories  in favour of France  were counterbalanced with almost equal disappointments  In Italy  the French General  Marshal Bellisle s brother  at the head of thirty four thousand men  attempted to penetrate into Piedmont  but his troops were put to the route  and he himself slain  The French King equipped an unsuccessful armament for the recovery of Cape Breton    189 and  not discouraged by this failure  fitted out two squadrons  one to make a descent upon the British Colonies in America  and the other to assist the operations in the East Indies  These  however  were attacked by Anson and Warren  and nine of their ships were taken  Soon after this Commodore Fox  with six ships of war  took above forty French ships laden from St  Domingo  and this loss was soon after followed by another defeat  which the French fleet sustained from Admiral Hawke  in which seven ships of the line  and several frigates  were taken   This variety of success served to make all the powers at war heartily desirous of a peace  The States General had  for some years  endeavoured to stop the progress of a war  in which they could gain no advantages  and had all to lose  The King of France was sensible  that  after a victory  was the most advantageous opportunity of proposing terms of peace  and even expressed his desire of general tranquility  in a personal conversation with Sir John Ligonier  who had been made prisoner in the last victory obtained by the French at La Feldt  The bad success of his admirals at sea  his Generals misfortunes in Italy  the frequent bankruptcies of his subjects  the election of a Stadtholder in Holland  who opposed his interests  his views in Germany intirely frustrated by the elevation of the Duke of Tuscany to rule the Empire  all these contributed to make him weary of the war  An accommodation was therefore agreed upon  and the contending powers agreed to a congress at Aix la Chapelle  where the Earl of Sandwich and Sir Thomas Robinson assisted as plenipotentiaries from the King of Great Britain  The treaty which takes its name from that city  was concluded on the seventh day of October  a lasting instance of precipitate counsels and English humility  By this it was agreed  that all prisoners  on each ide  should be mutually restored  and all conquests   190 given up  That the Duchies of Parma  Placentia  and Guastalla  should be ceded to Don Philip  heir apparent to the Spanish throne  and his heirs  but in case of his succeeding to the crown of Spain  that then these dominions should revert to the house of Austria  That the fortifications of Dunkirk to the sea should be demolished  that the ship annually sent with slaves to the coast of Spain  should have this privilege continued for four years  that the King o Prussia should be secured in the possession of Silesia which he had conquered  and that the Queen o Hungary should be secured in her patrimonial domi¦nions  But one article of the peace was more dis¦pleasing and afflictive to the English than all the rest for it was agreed  that she should give two person of rank and distinction to France as hostages  unt restitution should be made of all the conquests whic England possessed of the enemy  either in the Ea… or West Indies  This was a mortifying stipulation but there was no mention made of the searchin English ships in the American seas  upon which th war originally began  The treaty of Utrecht ha long been a subject of reproach to those by whom 〈◊〉 was negotiated  but  with all its faults  the trea… that was just concluded was far more despicable a… erroneous  The
