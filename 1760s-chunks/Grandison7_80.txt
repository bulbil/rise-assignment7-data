  All of us most eagerly besought her to go on   The excellent Mrs  Eggleton knew my heart better than I did myself  Even now  said she  you dislike not this worthy man  You can make no reasonable objection to his offer  You are one of many Sisters  We were then a numerous family—Alas  how many dear friends have I out lived   A match so advantageous for you  will be of real benefit to your whole family  Esteem  heightened by Gratitude  and enforced by Duty  continued she  will soon ripen into Love  The only sort of Love that suits this imperfect state  a tender  a faithful affection  There   205is a superior ardor due only to Supreme perfection and only to be exercised by us mortal creatures in humble devotion  My dear Henrietta  concluded she  condescend to be happy in such a way as suits this mortal state   I replied to her  with distress of mind  proceeded Mrs  Shirley  that I could not depend upon my own sentiments  I had seen little of the world  Suppose  after I have vowed Love to a man quite indifferent to me  I should meet with the very one  the kindred soul  who must irresistably claim my whole heart  I will not suspect myself of any possibility of misconduct  where the duty and the crime would be so glaring  but must I not  in such a case  be for ever miserable   The mild Mrs  Eggleton did not chide  She only argued with me  Often afterwards did I with delight  repeat this conversation to the best of men  my dear Mr  Shirley  when a length of happy years had verified all she said   Dear madam  cried Kitty  tell us how she argued  or we shall all remain on your side of the question   O my children  said the venerable parent  in what talkativeness do you engage me   I fear  Henrietta  said Mrs  Eggleton  that tho  you are a good christian  your opinions in this point are a little heathenish  You look upon Love as a blind irresistable Deity  whose darts fly at random  and admit neither defence nor cure  Consider the matter  my dear  in a more reasonable light  The passions are intended for our servants  not our masters  and we have  within us  a power of controuling them  which it is the duty and the business of our lives to exert  You will allow this readily in the case of any passion that poets and romance writers have not set off with their false colourings  To instance in anger  Will my Henrietta own  that she thinks it probable  anger should ever transport her beyond the bounds of duty     206 I pleaded  that I was not naturally of an angry temper  and was asked with a smile  whether I meant by that distinction  to own myself of a loving one   I could not be angry with my good Mrs  Eggleton  yet I remember I was vexed to the heart   But why then  rejoined she  should you think yourself more likely to fall in Love after you are married  than before   At least  said I  a little peevishly  let me stay till I am in Love  as you are pleased to call it  before I marry   I would not by any means  replied she  have you marry a man for whom you have not a preferable inclination  but why may you not find  on admitting Mr  Shirley s addresses  young  agreeable  worthy  and every way suitable to you  as he is  that he is that man whom your inclination can approve   I never saw him yet  said I  with the least emotion  I have no aversion to him  I might esteem him  But what is that to the Love one is so solemnly to vow a husband  And should I  after that vow  behold an object whom I could indeed have loved —  A Duke de Nemours  said she  taking up the Princess of Cleves  that unluckily lay on my table—Ah  my Henrietta  have I found you out —That princess  my dear  was a silly woman  Her story is written with dangerous elegance  but the whole foundation of her distresses was an idle one  To fansy herself in Love with a mere stranger  because he appeared agreeable at a Ball  when she lived happily with a worthy husband  was mistaking mere Liking for Love  and combating all her Life after with a chimera of her own creating  I do not tell you it is impossible for you to meet hereafter with persons in some external accomplishments superior to the deserving man whose wish is to make you happy  But will you suffer your eye to lead you into misery then  when   207 an additional tie of duty forbids its wandering  If so  I must suppose it would equally mislead you now  Tell me  Henrietta  What think you of those girls  who blast all the hopes of their fond parents  by eloping with a well drest captain  a spruce dancingmaster  or a handsome player   She
