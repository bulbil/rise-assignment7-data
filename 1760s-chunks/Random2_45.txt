them with a candle  on the supposition that the boards would sustain no damage  because it is the nature of flame to ascend  but by some very extraordinary accident  the wood was invaded  and began to blaze with great violence  which disordered him so much  that he had not presence of mind enough to call for assistance  and the whole house must have been consumed with him in the midst of it  had not the smoke that rolled out of the windows in clouds alarmed the neighbourhood  and brought people to his succour —That he had lost a pair of black velvet breeches and a tye wig in the hurry  besides the expence of the rags  which were rendered useless by the water used to quench the flame  and the damage of the floor  which he was compelled to repair —That his landlord believing him distracted  had insisted on his quitting his apartment at a minute s warning  which put him to incredible inconvenience  but now he was settled in a very comfortable house  and had the   128 use of a large paved yard for preparing his tinder  So that he hoped in a very short time to reap the fruits of his labour   After having congratulated the doctor on his prospect  and read the papers  we repaired to an auction of pictures  where we entertained ourselves an hour or two  from thence we adjourned to the Mall  and after two or three turns  went back to dinner  Banter assuring us  that be intended to roast Medlar  at the ordinary  and indeed  we were no sooner set than this Cynic began to execute his purpose by telling the old gentleman  he looked extremely well  considering the little sleep he had enjoyed last night  To this compliment Medlar made no reply  but by a stare  accompanied with a significant grin —and Banter went on thus     I don t know whether most to admire the charity of your mind  or the vigour of your body —Upon my soul  Mr  Medlar  you do generous things with the best taste of any man I know  You extend your compassion to real objects  and exact only such returns as they are capable of making —You must know  gentlemen   said he  turning to the company  I had been up most part of the night with a friend who is bad of a fever  and on my return home this morning  I chanced to pass by a gin shop still open  whence issued a confused sound of mirth and jollity  Upon which I popped in my head  and perceived Mr  Medlar dancing bare headed in the midst of ten or twenty ragged Bunters  who rejoiced at his expence  But indeed  Mr  Medlar  you ought not to sacrifice your constitution to your benevolence —Consider you grow old apace  and therefore   129 have a reverend care of your health  which must certainly be very much impaired by these nocturnal expeditions  —  The testy senior could no longer contain himself  but cried hastily     Tis well known that your tongue is no slander  —   I think  said the other  you might spare that observation  as you are very sensible that my tongue has done you signal service on many occasions —You may remember  that when you made your addresses to the fat widow  who kept a publick house at Islington  there was a report spread very much to the prejudice of your manhood  which coming to the ears of your mistress  you was discarded immediately  and I brought matters to a reconciliation  by assuring her you had three bastards at nurse in the country  How you ruined your own affair afterwards  it is neither my business nor inclination to relate  —  This anecdote  which had no other foundation than in Banter s own invention  afforded a good deal of mirth to every body present  and provoked Mr  Medlar beyond all sufferance  so that he started up in a mighty passion  and forgetting that his mouth was full  bespattered those who sat next to him  while he discharged his indignation in a volly of oaths  and call d Banter insignificant puppy  impertinent jackanapes  and an hundred such appellations  telling the company  he had invented these false malicious aspersions  because he would not lend him money to squander away upon rooks and whores —   A very likely story   said Banter  that I should attempt to borrow money of a man who is obliged to practice a thousand shifts to make his weekly allowance hold out to Saturday s   130 night  Sometimes he sleeps four and twenty hours at a stretch  by which means he saves three meals besides coffee house expence —Sometimes he is fain to put up with bread and cheese and small beer for dinner  and sometimes he regales on two pennyworth of ox cheek in a cellar  —   You are a lying miscreant  cried Medlar  in an exstacy of rage  I can always command money enough to pay your taylor s bill  which I m sure is no trifle  and I have a good mind to give you a convincing proof of my circumstances  by prosecuting you for defamation  sirrah  —  By this time the violence of his wrath had deprived him of his
