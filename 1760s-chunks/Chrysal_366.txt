the family   of the colonel  My master s principal  who  though  in the course   of law and nature  had the first expectations  as I have said before    could not believe it to be true  so high was his confidence in the         440 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     honesty and attachment of my master  To satisfy  however  the   importunities of his family  he came to him  and with a look of in    dignation at the baseness of such a report  rather than apprehension   of the truth of it    I am come    said he    to tell you a piece of news    I have just this moment heard  which is  that the colonel has left   his whole fortune between that jade  his mistress  and you   and   that you were privy to his will  which he left in your hands when   he was going abroad  But the latter part of the story makes me   easy about the rest   for  whatever his capricious temper might   lead him to do  I am convinced you would have no hand in so base   an affair  nor even conceal his having such an intention from me   a moment  I see you are shocked at the scandalous imputation     but do not think I mention it as if I believed it  I could not do   you so much wrong        The first impressions of youth can never be totally effaced    Though my master could lay schemes to cheat his principal  and   revile him behind his back  he had learned to look at him with   an awe  when a beggar about his brother s house  and afterwards   his servant  that he could never after get over  when in his presence    This awe  added to the confusion of conscious guilt  made him unable   to make any answer for some moments  and had wrought that   change in his countenance which the other took notice of      As soon as he could collect spirits to speak    I â€” I â€” I am obliged   to every one f â€” f â€” for their good opinion of me    said he  with his   eyes fixed on the grormd  and faltering at every word     and hope   I shall not f â€” f â€” forfeit it by accepting the favours of my friends          How     interrupted the other  eagerly    What can you mean   by that   You surely do not  cannot  avow           As for that  sir    returned my master  plucking up a little more   assurance    what I avow or disavow is nothing to the purpose    I presume that my most dear and worthy friend  the colonel  had   a right to leave his fortune to whom he pleased   and that whoever   he has left it to has also a right to take it  without being answerable   to your opinion  or that of any others  who may be prejudiced by   you   for the world will judge better  and be satisfied that he had   sufficient reasons for what he has done          And so  then  it is even so    replied the other  after a long pause     â   and this is the return I meet for raising you from wretchedness    and admitting you to the first place in the esteem and confidence   of my heart  Cherish a viper in your bosom  and he will sting you   to death  But it is beneath me to upbraid you  I leave the revenge   of my wrongs to yoxir own conscience and the justice of Heaven     and from this moment disclaim all intercourse with you   nor shall   my lips ever more utter your name  if I can help it  The sight of   you is a pain to me  I will send a person to take my affairs out of   your hands  and desire you will directly provide yourself another   habitation  Unhappy for me was the day when I first gave shelter   to your misery in mine    Saying this  he turned away  without   waiting for a reply  and left the room      This insolent behaviour â€” for so my master called it  as soon as   the other was gone â€” was such an affront to his honour as in his   opinion cancelled all obligations  and justified everything he had done          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 441     or could do against him  Giving vent to his resentment  therefore    in a
