hope for your critical Indulgence  while you read over these hasty and incorrect Pieces  wrote in the Hurry of a constant Correspondence  many of them in the Midst of Business  or Company  and several in the Height of Sickness  and in the Intervals of which    Aliter enim scribimus  quod eos solos quibus mittimus  aliter quod multos lecturos putamus        If I had taken the Pains of copying out these Letters myself  I could probably have put many of them in a better Dress  and Letter ccxxxvii I should have left out intirely  because I have   viii since been informed  that the natural Principle  which I presumed upon  in that Letter  about the Increase of Matter  is false  but I shall let it go along with several others  which I think not worth reading  because the Omission of them might break in upon the Thread of the Correspondence  and because I promised to send you  bonâ fide  every Letter which had been preserved  and this I take to be the best Way of dealing with a Friend  to throw ourselves on his Mercy  for the Whole of our Fault  rather than make a partial Palliation by secreting any Part of it   I send you the Originals  along with the Copy  that you may compare them together  which I confess I was too lazy to do  but should be pleased if any one else would take the Trouble of doing   There are four Letters in this Collection  and but four  which have been wrote to three different Persons  Letters clxxxvii  cxc  cxcii  cxciii  for having Occasion to write to those Persons  upon the same Subjects  the same Chain of Thought and Reasoning naturally   ix occurred  but  as they were wrote originally to Fanny  I thought they had a Right to take their Places in the Course of this Collection   Adieu   HENRY      unnumbered   THE EDITOR TO THE PUBLICK    I Here present you with a genuine Correspondence  which passed  for several Years  between a Gentleman and Lady of the Kingdom of Ireland  tho  the Scene has been laid in England  by the Authors  when the first Copy was made out  as they designed to keep themselves unknown  for Reasons which may be collected from some Parts of this Address  and several Passages in their Letters   I endeavoured to prevail on the Parties to take the Trouble of digesting this Collection into a more regular Series than they are  at present  offered to you in  but the various Business and family    xii Concerns which they are engaged in  in the Country  would not afford them Leisure  And  indeed  there seems to obtain  in them both  a certain Indolence of Mind  proceeding from a philosophick Acquiesence in their very narrow Fortunes  which would prevent either of them from giving themselves so much Trouble as a Task of this Kind might require   But tho  they would not condescend to be Compilers  even of their own Works  I was in Hopes that they might be prevailed upon to undertake a Work of Genius  by filling up the Chasms  which appear too often  in the Course of this Collection  But this too they refused me  from a certain Ingenuousness in their Natures  which proceeded so far  that tho  there were a good Number of entertaining Letters wrote  since the last of these  yet they would not suffer them to be inserted  because they were written since the first Design of publishing this Collection  which  however  was not any Thought of theirs  during the whole Course of their Correspondence  but hinted to them by Lady O—  so often   xiii mentioned  with Honour due  in these Letters  and who promised to prevail on Lord O—  a Nobleman of distinguished Sense  Learning  and classical Taste  and who has sunk many eminent Titles of both Kingdoms  in the private Character of the Man  to revise and correct them for the Press  but as higher Avocations have prevented them from appearing before the Publick  with that Honour and Advantage  I have obtained Leave  after a Twelve month s Sollicitation  to dispose of them after what Manner I please   But I have been so just to the Authors  and to the Publick too  that I have not left out even the most trifling Letter  which came to my Hands  my Design being not merely to give you a Collection of Letters  but to present you with the genuine Pictures of two Persons  whose Sense  Wit  and universal Benevolence do well intitle them to the publick Esteem  —  but their Characters are better described by their own Writings  than by any Thing I can say to recommend them  for which Reason I have not attempted to make a single Alteration  nor  upon comparing   xiv these Letters with the Originals  which were sent me along with the Copy  do I find there has been any Alteration made  except the changing of one Word for another  shifting the Scene  as I hinted in the Beginning  and the leaving out whole Paragraphs  which related  as Henry has expressed it  in
