signified his satisfaction in some curvetings and caprioles  which did not at all discompose the rider  who  addressing himself to the serjeant   Friend   said he   you ought to teach your drummer better manners  I would chastise the fellow on the spot for his insolence  were it not out of the respect I bear to his majesty s service    Respect mine a—   cried this ferocious commander  what  d ye think to frighten us with your pewter piss pot on your skull  and your lacquered pot lid on your arm  Get out of the way  and be d—ned  or I ll raise with my halbert such a clatter upon your target  that you ll remember it the longest day you have to live   At that instant  Crabshaw arriving upon Gilbert   So  rascal   said Sir Launcelot   you are returned  Go and beat in that scoundrel s drum head     The squire  who saw no weapons of offence about the drummer but a sword  which he hoped the owner durst not draw  and being resolved to exert himself in making atonement for his desertion  advanced to execute his master s orders  but Gilbert  who liked not the noise  refused to proceed in the ordinary way  Then the squire  turning his tail to the drummer  he advanced in a retrograde motion  and with one kick of his heels  not only broke the drum into a thousand pieces  but laid the drummer in the mire  with such a blow upon his hip bone  that he halted all the days of his life  The recruits  perceiving the discomfiture of their leader  armed themselves with stones  the serjeant raised his halbert in a posture of defence  and immediately a severe action ensued  By this time  Crabshaw had drawn his sword  and begun to lay about him like a devil incarnate  but  in a little time  he was saluted by a volley of stones  one of which knocked out two of his grinders  and brought him to the earth  where he had like to have found no quarter  for the whole company crowded about him  with their cudgels brandished  and perhaps he owed his preservation to their pressing so hard that they hindered one another from using their weapons    Sir Launcelot  seeing with indignation the unworthy treatment his squire had received  and scorning to stain his lance with the blood of plebeians  instead of couching it at the rest  seized it by the middle  and fetching one blow at the serjeant  broke in twain the halbert which he had raised as a quarter staff for his defence  The second stroke encountered his pate  which being the hardest part about him  sustained the shock without damage  but the third  lighting on his ribs  he honoured the giver with immediate prostration  The general being thus overthrown  Sir Launcelot advanced to the relief of Crabshaw  and handled his weapon so effectually  that the whole body of the enemy were disabled or routed  before one cudgel had touched the carcass of the fallen squire  As for the corporal  instead of standing by his commanding officer  he had overleaped the hedge  and run to the constable of an adjoining village for assistance  Accordingly  before Crabshaw could be properly remounted  the peace officer arrived with his posse  and by the corporal was charged with Sir Launcelot and his squire  as two highwaymen  The constable  astonished at the martial figure of the knight  and intimidated at sight of the havoc he had made  contented himself with standing at a distance  displaying the badge of his office  and reminding the knight that he represented his majesty s person    Sir Launcelot  seeing the poor man in great agitation  assured him that his design was to enforce  not violate the laws of his country  and that he and his squire would attend him to the next justice of peace  but  in the meantime  he  in his turn  charged the peace officer with the serjeant and drummer  who had begun the fray    The justice had been a pettifogger  and was a sycophant to a nobleman in the neighbourhood  who had a post at court  He therefore thought he should oblige his patron  by showing his respect for the military  but treated our knight with the most boorish insolence  and refused to admit him into his house  until he had surrendered all his weapons of offence to the constable  Sir Launcelot and his squire being found the aggressors  the justice insisted upon making out their mittimus  if they did not find bail immediately  and could hardly be prevailed upon to agree that they should remain at the house of the constable  who  being a publican  undertook to keep them in safe custody  until the knight could write to his steward  Meanwhile he was bound over to the peace  and the serjeant with his drummer were told they had a good action against him for assault and battery  either by information or indictment    They were not  however  so fond of the law as the justice seemed to be  Their sentiments had taken a turn in favour of Sir Launcelot  during the course of his examination  by
