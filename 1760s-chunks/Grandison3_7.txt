 and indeed I don t think  she would be safe there in a family of women  tho  very worthy ones  from the attempts of one of the sex  who  having brought her into the world  calls herself her mother  and especially now that the unhappy woman has begun to be troublesome there  I beg of you  therefore  my dear Dr  Bartlett  who know more of my heart and situation than any one living  my dear Beauchamp excepted  to consider what I have written  and give me your opinion of that part of it  which relates to Miss Byron and Emily   I was insensibly drawing myself in to enumerate the engagements  which at present press most upon me  Let me add to the subject—I must soon go to Paris  in order finally to settle such of the affairs of my late worthy friend  as cannot be so well done by any other hand  The three thousand pounds  which he has directed to be disposed of to charitable uses  in France as well as in England  at the discretion of his executor  is one of them   Perhaps equity will allow me to add to this limited sum from what will remain in my hands after the establishment of the nephews and niece  As they are young  and brought up with a hope that they will make a figure in the world by their diligence  I would not  by any means  make them independent on that  The whole estate  divided among them  would not be sufficient to answer that purpose happily  tho  it might be enough to abate the edge of their industry   The charity that I am most intent upon promoting in France  and in England too  is  that of giving little fortunes to young maidens in marriage with honest men of their own degree  who might  from such an   17 outsetting  begin the world  as it is called  with some hope of success   By this time  my dear Dr  Bartlett  you will guess that I have a design upon you  It is  that you will assist me in executing the Will of my late friend  Make enquiries after  and reccommend to me  objects worthy of relief  You was very desirous  some time ago  to retire to the Hall  But I knew not how to spare you  and I hoped to attend you thither  You shall now set out for that place as soon as you please  And that neither may be  or as little as possible  losers by the separation  every thing that we would say to each other  were we together  that  as we used to do  we will say by pen and ink  We will be joint executors  in the first place  for this sum of 3000 l   Make enquiries then  as soon as you get down  for worthy objects—The industrious poor  of all persuasions  reduced either by age  infirmity  or accident  Those who labour under incurable maladies  Youth  of either sex  capable of beginning the world to advantage  but destitute of the means  These  in particular  are the objects we both think worthy of assistance  You shall take 500 l  down with you  for a beginning   It is my pride  it is my glory  that I can say  Dr  Bartlett and Charles Grandison  on all benevolent occasions  are actuated by one soul  My dear friend  adieu   LETTER  III  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Sat  Night  March 18   I HAVE furnished the Ladies  and my Lord  with more letters  And so they have all my heart before them —I don t care  The man is Sir Charles Grandison  and they railly me not so much as before    18 while they thought I affected reserves to them  Indeed it would be cruel  if they did  and I should have run away from them   I am glad you all think  that the two sisters used me severely  They really did  But I have this gratification of my pride in reflecting upon their treatment of me—I would not have done so by them  had situations been exchanged  And I think myself nearer an equality with them  than I had thought myself before —But they are good ladies  and my sincere friends and well wishers  and I forgive them  And so must my dear grandmamma   I am sorry  m•thinks  that her delicacy has been offended on the occasion  And did she weep at the hearing read my account of that attack made upon her girl by the over lively Charlotte —O the dear  the indulgent  parent  How tender was it of my aunt too  to be concerned for the poor Harriet s delicacy  so hard put to it as she was  It did indeed  as she distinguishes in her usual charming manner  look  as if they put a great price upon their intended friendship to me  with regard to my interest in their brother s heart  As if the favour done to the humbled girl  if they could jointly procure for her their brother s countenance  might well allow of their raillery  —Don
