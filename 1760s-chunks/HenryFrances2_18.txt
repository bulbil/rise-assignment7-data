Page  66 be cloathed  with Decency  to be admired by Man  A blessed Spirit  as it has no   Sense to ake   can bear the transcendent Splendor of Truth  but her Glory is too dazzling for the human Mind to bear without a Veil  as we look at the Sun through a smoaked Glass  and are obliged to use Shades  to mark the Beauties of Proportion     Upon this Occasion  has happily occurred to me  Part of the most noble Descriptions of the State of the Blessed  that can be conceived  though it was imagined  by an unenlightened Heathen  Plotinus  a Philosopher of the Platonic Sect  A Translation will serve you  as well as the Original     In Heaven  the blessed Inhabitants enjoy a happy Tranquillity  having Truth itself for the Author of their Being  for their Essence and Support  They see Things there  not only as they are produced  but contemplate them in their first Principles  and behold themselves in those about them  for there all Things are obvious and perspicuous  nothing obscure  nothing opposite  All is conspicuous to all  intrinsical throughout  for Light every where blends with Light  Every one has every thing in himself  and beholds the same in others  All Things then are every where  and immense Splendor shines through all  Motion there is perfectly pure  for one Motion Page  67 does not impede another  Rest also there is never disturbed by Change  for it is not blended with unstable Nature  There dwells Beauty in the Abstract  independent of Form  or Matter  We may farther presume  that those  who behold these Things  can never be fatigued in the Contemplation of them  nor can any Satiety occur  to occasion any Fatigue  for there will be no Emptiness in any one  which  by being filled and satiated  may put an End to their Enjoyment     I have here given you the Sense of this beautiful Passage  though  I am afraid  I have but poorly imitated the Spirit of it  The whole Author is extremely fine  and this is but a very small Part of the great Description  he has so gloriously attempted  but it was all  which fairly occurred to me upon the Subject of this Letter  and  as I thought  had some Relation to it  Adieu   Henry   LETTER CCII  FRANCES to HENRY   THE Passage  you quote from Plotinus  is indeed a fine one  I have never met with any thing  which gives so strong  and beautiful an Idea of a future State  What a Page  68 Disgrace to our modern Philosophers and Divines  who have the Light of Revealed Religion for their Guide  to be so far outdone by the noble Spirit  and Blaze  of unenlightened Heathenism   I look upon Les petites Morales to be as absolutely necessary  to make a Man happy in this Life  as true Morality  to intitle him to  or render him capable of Happiness in the next   There is something so extremely elegant and tender in the first Part of your second Letter  as would render Life pleasing  under the severest Agonies  if  by enduring them  I might repay such Goodness  Indeed  thou dearest  kindest  best of Men  I will do all I can for the Recovery and Preservation of that Health  whose only Charm to me is  being dear to you  I wish I could tell you I was better  I think I grow worse every Day  but I do not make the least Doubt of my Recovery  for there is nothing dangerous in my Disorder  though I suffer more than I thought my Constitution could possibly bear  I am convinced I should mend  immediately  if you were with me  This may appear childish  but sick Folks  and Children  are fanciful alike  Tell me then  thou dear Physician to my Soul and Body  when wilt thou give me new Life  and Health  I consider myself in the same Situation as the little Butterfly  you mention  insensible to every thing Page  69 round me  or rather  like Promotheus s Man of Clay    I stand unmov d  and wait  in dull Suspence   Thy heav nly Charms  to warm me into Sense     I can  no more than you  determine  whether it is kind  or cruel  to prolong the Life of your little Favourite  What does it subsist on  during the Time of it s natural Existence  If you know  and can provide it with natural Sustenance  we may suppose it dies only for Want of the Sun s Heat  then  to revive it with an artificial Warmth cannot be Cruelty  But if it s Food  as I believe  be of the Summer s Pride  and is not now to be found in the vegetable World  I fear the poor little Insect suffers by your Fondness  as Annihilation is preferable to Misery  Besides  I fancy a Butterfly does not die  but  according to the Pythagorean System  changes it s Form  and Being  This I am not quite clear in  though I have met with
