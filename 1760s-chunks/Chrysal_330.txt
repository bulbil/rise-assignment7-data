THE   ABUSE OP WEALTH     You are astonished how such scenes of debauchery and excess   could be supported  either by the fortune of the entertainer  or   the constitutions of his guests   but this shall be explained      To prevent satiety or fatigue  these meetings were never pro    tracted beyond a week at a time  nor held oftener than twice a year     by which frugality of pleasure  they were always returned to with   the keenness of novelty  And as for the expense of them  that was   defrayed jointly by the whole community â€” the superior contribu    ting nothing more than any other member  except the first cost of   building the convent  which he thought himself amply recompensed   for by the honour of having struck out the plan â€” and regulated   by the strictest economy   the slaves of their lusts being sent back   to the brothels from whence they had been brought   and the   servants of their luxury discharged at the end of every meeting     and no more retained for the rest of the year than an old man and   woman  who took care of the place  To you who have supported   the dignity of your nature  by preferring the pleasures of that   reason which was given to distinguish man from brutes  to those   of sense  which they enjoy in common with him  the picture of this   whole scene must appear overcharged and irreconoileable with the   great principles of human action  which always propose some good    either present or future  however the judgment may err in the thing   proposed  But more acquaintance with life would solve this   difficulty to you  The general motive for attempting to turn re    ligion into ridicule has been already explained  But as some are   seen to give in to this practice who seem to cultivate their reason   with most success  and whose actions  and even inclinations    appear not to have the remotest tendency contrary to moral virtue    it may be proper to account for such an exception      The first principle of action  impressed by nature on everything   that lives  is self preservation  Prom this brute animals  which   by necessity proceed regularly in the course prescribed for them    never swerve   but the rational animal  man  bewildered in his own   imaginations by the abuse of that liberty  which was given him to   enhance the merit of his obedience to the dictates of reason    often substitutes another in its place  by whose impulse he acts in   direct opposition to it  This is vanity   the real source of that   ambition which courts danger  and plunges with open eyes into   destruction  however speciously it may be disguised under the   pompous titles of love of glory  and regard to the public good   as   well as of most of the extravagances and absurdities which puzzle   superficial observers  and make them presumptuously impeach          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 393     as a defect in the work of nature  their own neglect and perversion   of its laws      A particular inquiry into the effects of this suppositious principle    many of which  as I said  are blazoned as the brightest virtues    while more are acknowledged to be the most atrocious crimes   or   how nearly such virtues and crimes proceeding thus from the same   source  may be allied  though curious and interesting in itself  is   not necessary here  It is sufficient to observe that its power is   able to break the force of habit  reconcile contradictions  and   confound the essential difierences of things   to cope with prejudice    and overrule the infirmities of nature      This it is  for instance  that makes the constitutional coward    who trembles at the thought of danger  and would see his country   ruined rather than draw his sword in its defence  fight duels for a   doubtful punctilio of empty ceremony   the superstitious wretch    who finds omens in spilled salt and crossed straws  and sees goblins   and devils in the dark  profess infidelity  ridicule Providence  and   dare the wrath of Heaven by insults and bravadoes   and lastly    this it is that makes the hoary sage  whose life has been regulated   by the strictest principles of morality and religion  while passion   might have rebelled against them  commence libertine in the im    potence of old age  and glory in vices he has lost the power to practise    Of the justice of these remarks  the members of this society  of   which vanity was the cement  as it had been the origin  afforded   the most glaring proofs      You wonder
