 14   BY Madame Des Roches  who is going on shore  I write two or three lines  to tell you we have got thus far  and have a fair wind  she will send it immediately to Quebec  to be put on board any ship going  that you may have the greater variety of chances to hear of me        There is a French lady on board  whose superstition bids fair to amuse us  she has thrown half her little ornaments over board for a wind  and has promised I know not how many votive offerings of the same kind to St  Joseph  the patron of Canada  if we get safe to land  on which I shall only observe  that there is nothing so like ancient absurdity as modern  she has classical authority for this manner of playing the fool  Horace  when afraid on a voyage  having  if my memory quotes fair  vowed    His dank and dropping weeds  To the stern god of sea           The boat is ready  and Madame Des Roches going  I am very unwilling to part with her  and her present concern at leaving me would be very flattering  if I did not think the remembrance of your brother had the greatest share in it       She has wrote four or five letters to him  since she came on board  very tender ones I fancy  and destroyed them  she has at last wrote a meer complimentary kind of card  only thanking him for his offers of service  yet I see it gives her pleasure to write even this  however cold and formal  because addressed to him  she asked me  if I thought there was any impropriety in her writing to him  and whether it would not be better to address herself to Emily  I smiled at her simplicity  and she finished her letter  she blushed and looked down when she gave it me        She is less like a sprightly French widow  than a foolish English girl  who loves for the first time       But I suppose  when the heart is really touched  the feelings of all nations have a pretty near resemblance  it is only that the French ladies are generally more coquets  and less inclined to the romantic style of love  than the English  and we are  therefore  surprized when we find in them this trembling sensibility        There are exceptions  however  to all rules  and your little Bell seems  in point of love  to have changed countries with Madame Des Roches       The gale encreases  it flutters in the sails  my fair friend is summoned  the captain chides our delay       Adieu   ma chere Madame Des Roches  I embrace her  I feel the force of its being for the last time  I am afraid she feels it yet more strongly than I do  in parting with the last of his friends  she seems to part with her Rivers for ever       One look more at the wild graces of nature I leave behind       Adieu  Canada  adieu  sweet abode of the wood nymphs  never shall I cease to remember with delight the place where I have passed so many happy hours       Heaven preserve my dear Lucy  and give prosperous gales to her friends   Your faithful  A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXXIII   173   To Miss MONTAGUE   Isle of Bic  Aug  16   YOU are little obliged to me  my dear  for writing to you on ship board  one of the greatest miseries here  being the want of employment  I therefore write for my own amusement  not yours       We have some French ladies on board  but they do not resemble Madame Des Roches  I am weary of them already  though we have been so few days together        The wind is contrary  and we are at anchor under this island  Fitzgerald has proposed going to dine on shore  it looks excessively pretty from the ship   Seven in the evening       We are returned from Bic  after passing a very agreable day        We dined on the grass  at a little distance from the shore  under the shelter of a very fine wood  whose form  the trees rising above each other in the same regular confusion  brought the dear shades of Silleri to our remembrance        We walked after dinner  and picked raspberries  in the wood  and in our ramble came unexpectedly to the middle of a visto  which  whilst some ships of war lay here  the sailors had cut through the island       From this situation  being a rising ground  we could see directly through the avenue to both shores  the view of each was wildly majestic  the river comes finely in  whichever way you turn your sight  but to the south  which is more sheltered  the water just trembling to the breeze  our ship which had put all her streamers out  and to which the tide gave a gentle motion  with a few scattered houses  faintly seen amongst the trees at a
