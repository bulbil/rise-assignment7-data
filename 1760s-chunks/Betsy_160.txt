sometimes come into his   thoughts  it was only with a friendly concern for her imagined fall   It   is no wonder   would he often say to himself   that so young and lovely   a creature  under the tuition of a woman of Lady Mellasin s character    and the constant companion of one of Miss Flora s disposition  endued   with charms to excite the warmest wishes  and unprovided with sufficient   arms for her defence  should have yielded to the temptations of an   unwarrantable flame   In fine  he pitied her  but no more       Thus entirely freed from all prepossession  and his heart almost in the   same situation as before he ever knew what it was to love  he was easily   persuaded by his friends to give over all thoughts of going into the   country  and stay to partake  in a moderate way  those pleasures of the   town  which the many uneasy moments he had sustained  during his   courtship with Miss Betsy  had kept him hitherto from having any relish   for       But this state of indifference lasted not long  an object presented   itself to him  inspiring him with a passion  which had so much of reason   for its guide  as made him think it rather his glory  than his   misfortune  to be a second time enslaved       Among all the friends and acquaintance he had in town  there was none he   more valued and esteemed than Sir Bazil Loveit  they had been for some   time inseparable companions  but accidents  either on the one side or   the other  having hindered their meeting for several days  Mr  Trueworth   went one morning to visit him at his house  He found him at home  but   the hall so incumbered with trunks and boxes  that there was scarce a   passage to the parlour door   Welcome  my dear friend   said Sir Bazil    who  having seen him from a window  ran down stairs to receive him   you   find me in a strange disorder here  but I have got a couple of women out   of the country  and that sex  I think  like a general officer  can never   move without a waggon load of trumpery at their tail     What  married     cried Mr  Trueworth   No   faith   said the other   but the arrival of   two sisters last night from Staffordshire  gives me a sort of specimen   of the hurry I am to expect when I become a husband         The hurry   said Mr  Trueworth   you seem to complain of  must needs be   a very agreeable one  and I heartily congratulate you upon it  A single   man  like you  makes but a very solitary figure in a great wild house    these ladies will fill the vacuum  and give a double life to your   family     Nay   resumed Sir Bazil   I shall not have them long with me    they hate London  and never come but once in two years  to buy cloaths   and see fashions  besides  one of them is married  and the other fond of   her sister  that I believe she would not quit her to be a duchess    Indeed  it is not much to be wondered at  our mother dying when she was   very young  Harriot  for so she is called  was brought up under her   sister  who is eight years older than herself  and they never have been   asunder two days in their lives        Mr  Trueworth then expiated on the amiableness of such an harmony   between persons of the same blood  to which Sir Bazil replied  that it   was more than ordinarily fortunate for his sisters   For   said he   the   elder of them being married just before my mother s death  my father   committed to her the care of the younger  as she was reckoned a woman of   greater prudence than might be expected from her years  My brother   Wellair   for that is the name of the gentleman she married  though a   very good husband in the main  is a great sportsman  takes rather too   much delight in his hawks and hounds  and gives his wife but little of   his company in the day  so that  if it were not for Harriot  she would   pass her time uncomfortably enough  In short  the younger is improved by   the lessons of the elder  and the elder diverted by the sprightliness   and good humour of the younger        Sir Bazil  who had an extreme regard for his sisters  could not forbear   entertaining
