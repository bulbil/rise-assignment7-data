State of Innocence  vainly imagine to recover Virtue from their Fall  like the Fable of Antaeus  who is said to have gained fresh Strength  when Hercules threw him on the Ground  Ovid is severe too on this Subject   Laesa pudicitia est  deperit illa semel   Which Passage is too grosly translated  to be quoted here  Rowe has a strong Line in his Shore   They set  like Stars which fall to rise no more     112 However I do not judge so hardly  in this Matter  as the Generality of People do  I agree with them indeed that  when Women fail from Wantoness  or Vice  it is very probable they may sin on to the End of Life  but a Woman may be overcome so many other Ways  Excess of Love  too great Confidence in the Lover s Honour  circumvented by Fraud  or overpowered by Surprize  that an Adventure of this Kind does not always betoken a Failure in Virtue  and a Person  injured in any of these Ways  may possibly recover Strength from their Misfortunes  as a Bone is said to knit firmer in the broken Part than in the sound     The Story you tell me of — surprizes me more than the other  tho  it is of a Piece with his known Character  for  of all human Vices  Avarice astonishes me most  as it appears to me the most unreasonable  and unnatural too  I should think  that Misers may turn Prodigals  upon this Principle  that they may do so without Cost  for he who spends his own Fortune  certainly lives at the Expence of his Heir   You are welcome to buy the Books you mention for me  for  tho  I have read them before  I think they will not disgrace my Study  and this will give you an Opportunity of reading them yourself   Adieu   Henry     113  LETTER LXVI   Dear FANNY   I AM extremely angry at Mrs  —  for misrepresenting the Story you allude to  I said indeed the Words to her  and quoted them from a sprightly Lady of my Acquaintance  but mentioned no Name  and  as there was certainly Wit in them  she might probably attribute them to you  and meant to compliment you  with supposing you the Author  It was Mrs  — who made Use of those Expressions  on the Occasion I told her  I declare  that  in any Part  either of our Conversation or Correspondence  I never remember you to have used any Expression    less modest than the Speech of Prudes   or to have hinted  or even seemed to relish the least double Entendre  and I assure you  I have often wondered  that a Person  who has as much Wit  Spirit  and Wildness in her Imagination  as any one I know  should have  in Reality  more Delicacy in her Sentiments  and more Decency in her Expressions  than I ever met with in any other Woman     It is upon this Account  that I give you the Credit of more Wit  than other Women  as that Beauty must have greater Charms  who   114 pleases a Man  when she is cloathed  than are necessary to move him  when she is naked   But indeed  I think  in general  that  when Lewdness  or Prophaneness  are called in  as Helps to Wit  they but betray the Weakness of it  as narrow Waters mark their Limits  by exposing the Shallows   Cowley speaks very prettily upon this Subject  but I need not quote  because you have him by Heart   Adeiu   LETTER LXVII   My dear FANNY   I AM  thank God  quite well To day  but must be cautious  I shall stay at Home most Part of the Day  and only take a Chair for an Hour  to drink Tea with you  and return the Manuscripts  It was an Entertainment to read over most of the Letters I have wrote to you  since the Commencement of our Acquaintance  during the Course of a Correspondence remarkable for its Regularity and Constancy  I read them in a confused Manner  because there are but few of them dated  and I was sorry I had not yours in Town  to bring them   115 Face to Face  which would have been a great Amusement to me  during this Confinement  as my Head was not well enough to venture upon more abstruse Studies  I find you have destroyed a great many of my Letters  for I remember a Folio of Advice  which I suppose you mistook for Scolding  and threw into the Fire  I had a Mind to serve the rest after the same Manner  and only spared them  because you had done so   I send you West on the Employment of Time  which is worth Reading  not  for saying any Thing new  but for collecting together  upon so important a Subject  the Sense  not Opinions of Mankind  the thinking Part  Read the Preface last  which I think  might be better stiled an Appendix   Farewel   LETTER LXVIII  HENRY to
