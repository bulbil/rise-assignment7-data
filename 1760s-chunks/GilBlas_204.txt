in my sleeve  when I considered who and what they were  and how they behaved  Set a beggar on horseback  said I  These gentry are in luck to carry a pack without feeling the drag of it  for surely if they knew they were beasts of burden  they would not jingle their bells with so high a toss of the head  I ventured just to speak to a grave and portly personage who stood sentinel at the door of the archbishop s closet  to turn it upon its hinges as occasion might require  I asked him civilly if there was no possibility of speaking with my lord archbishop  Stop a little  said he  with a supercilious demeanour and repulsive tone  his grace will shortly come forth  to go and hear mass  you may snatch an audience for a moment as he passes on  I answered not a single syllable  Patience was all I had for it  and it even seemed advisable to try and enter into conversation with some of the jacks in office  but they began conning me over from the sole of my foot to the crown of my head  without condescending to favour me with a single interjection  after which they winked at one another  whispered  and looked out at the corners of their eyes  in derision of the liberty I had assumed  by intruding upon their select society   I felt more fool that I did so  quite out of countenance at such cavalier treatment from a knot of state footmen  My confusion was but beginning to subside  when the closet door opened  The archbishop made his appearance  A profound silence immediately ensued among his officers  who quitted at once their insolent behaviour  to adopt a more respectful style before their master  That prelate was in his sixty ninth year  formed nearly on the model of my uncle  Gil Perez the canon  which is as much as to say  as broad as he was long  But the highest dignitaries should always be the most amply gifted  accordingly his legs bowed inwards to the very extremity of the graceful curve  and his bald head retained but a single lock behind  so that he was obliged to ensconce his pericranium in a fine woollen cap with long ears  In spite of all this  I espied the man of quality in his deportment  doubtless  because I knew that he actually happened to be one  We common fellows  the fungous growth of the human dunghill  look up to great lords with a facility of being overawed  which often furnishes them with a Benjamin s mess of importance  when nature has denied even the most scanty and trivial gifts   The archbishop moved towards me in a minuet step  and kindly inquired what I wanted  I told him I was the young man about whom Signor Don Ferdinand de Leyva had spoken to him  He did not give me a moment to go on with my story  Ah  is it you  exclaimed he  is it you of whom so fine a character has been given me  I take you into my service at once  you are a mine of literary utility to me  You have only to take up your abode here  Talking thus condescendingly  he supported himself between two ushers  and moved onwards after having given audience to some of his clergy  who had ecclesiastical business to communicate  He was scarcely out of the room  when the same officers who had turned upon their heel  were now cap in hand to court my conversation  Here the rascals are  pressing round me  currying favour  and expressing their sincere joy at seeing me become as it were an heir loom of the archbishopric  They had heard what their master had said  and were dying with anxiety to know on what footing I was to be about him  but I had the ill nature not to satisfy their curiosity  in revenge for their contempt   My lord archbishop was not long before he returned  He took me with him into his closet for a little private conference  I could not but suppose that he meant to fathom the depth of my understanding  I was accordingly on my guard  and prepared to measure out my words most methodically  He questioned me first in the classics  My answers were not amiss  he was convinced that I had more than a schoolboy s acquaintance with the Greek and Latin writers  He examined me next in logic  nor could I but suppose that he would examine me in logic  He found me strong enough there  Your education  said he  with some degree of surprise  has not been neglected  Now let us see your hand writing  I took a blank piece of paper out of my pocket  which I had brought for the purpose  My ghostly father was not displeased with my performance  I am very well satisfied with the mechanical part of your qualifications  exclaimed he  and still more so with the powers of your mind  I shall thank my nephew  Don Ferdinand  most heartily  for having sent me so fine a lad  it is absolutely a gift from above   We were interrupted by some of the neighbouring gentry  who were come to dine with the archbishop  I left them together  and withdrew to the second table
