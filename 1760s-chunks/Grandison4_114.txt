he will sink under the necessary process  through weakness of habit  But  however  he is of opinion  that it is requisite to confine him to a strict dict  and to deny him wine and fermented liquors  in which he has hitherto been indulged  against the opinion of his own operators  who have been too complaisant to his appetite   An operation somewhat severe was performed on his shoulder yesterday morning  The Italian surgeons complimented Mr  Lowther with the lancet  They both praised his dexterity  and Signor Jeronymo  who will be consulted on every thing that he is to suffer  blessed his gentle hand   At Mr  Lowther s request  a physician was yesterday consulted  who advised some gentle aperitives  as his strength will bear it  and some balsamics  to sweeten the blood and juices   Mr  Lowther told me just now  that the fault of   284 the gentlemen who have now the care of him  has not been want of skill  but of critical courage  and a too great solicitude to oblige their patient  which  by their own account  had made them forego several opportunities which had offered to assist nature  In short  Sir  said he  your friend knows too much of his own case to be ruled  and too little to qualify him to direct what is to be done  especially as symptoms must have been frequently changing   Mr  Lowther doubts not  he says  but he shall soon convince Jeronymo that he merits his confidence  and then he will exact it from him  and  in so doing  shall not only give weight to his own endeavours to serve him  but rid the other two gentlemen of embarrasments which have often given them diffidencies  when resolution was necessary   Mean time the Marquis  his Lady  the Bishop  and Father Marescotti  are delighted with Mr  Lowther  They will flatter themselves  they say  with hopes of their Jeronymo s recovery  which however Mr  Lowther  for fear of disappointment  does not encourage  Jeronymo himself owns  that his spirits are much revived  and we all know the power that the mind has over the body   Thus have I given you  my reverend friend  a general notion of Jeronymo s case  as I understand it from Mr  Lowther s as general representation of it   The family have prevailed upon him to accept of an apartment adjoining to that of his patient  Jeronymo said  that when he knows he has so skilful a friend near him  he shall go to rest with confidence  and good rest is of the highest consequence to him   What a happiness  my dear Dr  Bartlett  will fall to my share  if I may be an humble instrument  in the hand of Providence  to heal this brother  and if his recovery shall lead the way to the restoration of his sister  each so known a lover of the other  that the world is more ready to attribute her malady to his   285 misfortune and danger  than to any other cause  But how early days are these  on which my love and my compassion for persons so meritorious  embolden me to build hopes so forward   Lady Clementina is now impatiently expected by every one  She is at Urbino The General and his Lady are with her  His haughty spirit cannot bear to think she should see me  or that my attendance on her should be thought of so much importance to her   The Marchioness  in a conversation that I have just now had with her  hinted this to me  and besought me to keep my temper  if his high notion of family and female honour should carry him out of his usual politeness   I will give you  my dear friend  the particulars of this conversation   She began with saying  that she did not  for her part  now think  that her beloved daughter  whom once she believed hardly any private man could deserve  was worthy of me  even were she to recover her reason   I could not but guess the meaning of so high a compliment  What answer could I return that would not  on one hand be capable of being thought cool  on the other of being supposed interested  and as if I were looking forward to a reward that some of the family still think too high  But while I knew my own motives  I could not be displeased with a Lady who was not at liberty to act  in this point  according to her own will   I only said  and it was with truth  That the calamity of the •••le Lady had endeared her to me  more than it was possible the most prosperous fortune could have done   I  my good Chevalier  may say any thing to you  We are undetermined about every▪thing  We know not what to propose  what to consent to  Your   286 journey  on the first motion  tho  but from some of us  the dear creature continuing ill  you in possession of a considerable estate  exercising yourself in doing good in your native country  You must think we took all opportunities of enquiring aster the man once so likely
