to dine with them next day  The solemn visit was to be made yesterday in the evening  and every visit near the time  would have been as so many farewels  My own heart  at least  told me so  and forbad me more than one parting scene  The time so near  they themselves wished it past   The Count had come from Urbino on purpose  with the two young Lords  to take leave of me  What blessings did that nobleman  and the Marquis and Marchioness  invoke upon me  The General had more than once tears in his eyes  He besought me to forgive him for every thing  in his behaviour  that had been disagreeable to me  His Lady permitted me to take leave of her in the most affectionate manner  and said  that she hoped to prevail on her Lord to visit me himself  and to allow her to bear him company  in my own country  The Bishop supplicated Heaven to reward me  for what he called my goodness to their family  Father Marescotti joined in his supplications  with a bent knee  The Marquis and Marchioness both wept  and called me by very endearing names  vowing everlasting love and gratitude to me  Jeronymo  my dear Jeronymo  one of the most amiable of men  how precious to my soul will ever be the remembrance of his friendly Love  His only consolation was  and it is mine  that  in a few Page  245 months  we shall meet in England  They wanted to load me with presents  They pained me with their importunities  that I would accept of some very valuable ones  They saw my pain  and  in pity to me  declined their generous solicitations   Clementina was not present at this parting scene  She had shut herself up for the greatest part of the day  Her mother  and her sister in law  had been her only visiters  And she having declared that she was afraid of seeing me  it was proposed to me  whether it were not best for me to depart  without seeing her  I can well spare to myself  said I  the emotions which  already so great  will  on taking leave of her  be too powerful for my heart  if you think  that  when I am gone  she will not wish  as once she was so earnest  even to discomposure  for a farewel visit  that she had allowed herself to see me   They all were then of opinion  that she should be prevailed upon  Camilla at that instant came down with her Lady s desire  that I would attend her  In what way  Camilla  is my Clementina  asked the Marchioness  Every one attending the answer  In great grief  madam  Almost in agonies  She was sending me down with her warmest wishes to the Chevalier  and with her excuses  but called me back  saying  she would subdue herself  She would see him  And bid me hasten for fear he should be gone   The two Marchionesses went up directly  I was in tremors  Surely  thought I  I am the weakest of men —The Bishop and General took notice of my emotion  and pitied me  They all joined in the wish so often repeated  that I could yet be theirs   I followed Camilla  Lady Clementina  when I entered  sat between the mother and sister  an arm round each of their necks  Her face was reclined  as if she were ready to faint  on the bosom of her mother  who held her salts to her  I was half way in the room  before either mother or daughter saw me  Page  246 The Chevalier Grandison  my best sister  said the young Marchioness  Look up  my Love   She reaised her head  Then stood up  courtesied  and  gushing into tears  turned her face from me   I approached her  Her mother gave me the hand of her Clementina—Comfort her  comfort my Clementina  good Chevalier—You only can—Sit down  my Love  Take my seat  Sir   The young Lady trembled  She sat down  Her mother seated herself  tears in her eyes  I sat down by Clementina  The dear Lady sobbed  and the more  as she endeavoured to suppress her emotion   I addressed myself to her sister in law  who had kept her seat—Your Ladyship  said I  gives me a very high pleasure  in the hope of seeing you  and your Lord  a few months hence  in company with my Jeronymo  What a blessing is it to us all  that that dear friend is so well recovered  I have no doubt but change of climate  and our salutary springs  will do wonders for him  Let us  by our patience and resignation  intitle ourselves to greater blessings  the consequence  as I hope  of those we have already received   Please God  I will see you in England  Chevalier  said the young Marchioness  if my Lord is in the least favourable to my wishes  And I hope my beloved sister may be of the party  You  madam  and the Marquis  I hope—looking at her
