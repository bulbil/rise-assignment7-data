to morrow       After we have breakfasted  added he  if you have no objection  Pamela    we ll take an airing together  and it shall be in the coach  because   we ll have your father s company  He would have excused himself  but   my master would have it so  but he was much ashamed  because of the   meanness of his appearance       My master would make us both breakfast with him on chocolate  and he   said  I would have you  Pamela  begin to dress as you used to do  for   now  at least  you may call your two other bundles your own  and if you   want any thing against the approaching occasion  private as I design   it  I ll send to Lincoln for it  by a special messenger  I said  My good   lady s bounty  and his own  had set me much above my degree  and I had   very good things of all sorts  and I did not desire any other  because   I would not excite the censure of the ladies  That would be a different   thing  he was pleased to say  when he publicly owned his nuptials  after   we came to the other house  But  at present  if I was satisfied  he   would not make words with me       I hope  Mr  Andrews  said he  to my father  you ll not leave us till   you see the affair over  and then you ll be sure I mean honourably  and    besides  Pamela will be induced to set the day sooner  O  sir  said he    I bless God I have no reason to doubt your meaning honourably  and I   hope you ll excuse me  if I set out on Monday morning  very early  to my   dear wife  and make her as happy as I am       Why  Pamela  says my good master  may it not be performed on Tuesday    And then your father  maybe  will stay   I should have been glad to   have had it to morrow  added he  but I have sent Monsieur Colbrand for   a license  that  you may have no scruple unanswered  and he can t very   well be back before to morrow night  or Monday morning       This was most agreeable news  I said  Sir  I know my dear father will   want to be at home  and as you was so good to give me a fortnight from   last Thursday  I should be glad you would be pleased to indulge me still   to some day in the second seven       Well  said he  I will not be too urgent  but the sooner you fix    the better  Mr  Andrews  we must leave something to these Jephthah s   daughters  in these cases  he was pleased to say  I suppose the little   bashful folly  which  in the happiest circumstances  may give a kind of   regret to quit the maiden state  and an awkwardness at the entrance into   a new one  is a reason with Pamela  and so she shall name her day  Sir    said he  you are all goodness       I went up soon after  and new dressed myself  taking possession  in a   happy moment  I hope  of my two bundles  as my good master was pleased   to call them   alluding to my former division of those good things   my lady and himself bestowed upon me   and so put on fine linen  silk   shoes  and fine white cotton stockings  a fine quilted coat  a delicate   green Mantea silk gown and coat  a French necklace  and a laced cambric   handkerchief  and clean gloves  and  taking my fan in my hand  I  like   a little proud hussy  looked in the glass  and thought myself a   gentlewoman once more  but I forgot not to return due thanks  for being   able to put on this dress with so much comfort       Mrs  Jewkes would help to dress me  and complimented me highly  saying    among other things  That now I looked like a lady indeed  and as  she   said  the little chapel was ready  and divine service would be read in   it to morrow  she wished the happy knot might then be tied  Said she    Have you not seen the chapel  madam  since it has been cleaned out  No    said I  but are we to have service in it to morrow  do you say   I am   glad of that  for I have been a sad heathen lately  sore against my   will
