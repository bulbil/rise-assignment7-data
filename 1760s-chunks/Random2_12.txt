at my learning—communicates her performances to me—I impart some of mine to her—am mortified at her faint praise—Narcissa approves of my production—I gain an involuntary conquest over the cook wench and dairymaid—their mutual resentment and insinuations—the jealousy of their lovers   DURING this season of love and tranquillity  my muse  which had lain dormant so long  awoke  and produced several small performances on the subject of my flame  But as it concerned me nearly to remain undiscovered in my real character and sentiments  I was under a necessity of mortifying my desire of praise  by confining my works to my own perusal and applause —In the mean time I strove to insinuate myself into the good opinion of both ladies  and succeeded so well  by my diligence and dutiful behaviour  that in a little time  I was at least a favourite servant  and frequently enjoyed the pleasure of hearing myself mentioned in French and Italian  with some degree of warmth and surprize  by the dear object of all my wishes  as a person who had so much of the gentleman in my appearance and discourse  that she could not for her soul treat me like a common lacquey —My prudence and modesty were not long proof   28 against these bewitching compliments  One day  while I waited at dinner  the conversation turned upon a knotty passage of Tasso s Gierusalem  which  it seems  had puzzled them both  After a great many unsatisfactory conjectures  my mistress taking the book out of her pocket  turned up the place in question  and read the sentence over and over without success  at length  despairing of finding the author s meaning  she turned to me  saying     Come hither  Bruno  let us see what fortune will do for us  I will interpret to thee what goes before and what follows this obscure paragraph  the particular words of which I will also explain  that thou may st  by comparing one with another  guess the sense of that which perplexes us  —  I was too vain to let slip this opportunity of displaying my talents  therefore  without hesitation  read and explained the whole of that which had disconcerted them  to the utter astonishment of both —Narcissa s face and lovely neck were overspread with blushes  from whence I drew a favourable omen  while her aunt  after having stared at me a good while with a look of amazement  exclaimed    In the name of heaven  Who art thou  —  I told her I had picked up a smattering of Italian  during a voyage up the Straits —At this she shook her head  and observed  that no smatterer could read as I had done —She then desired to know if I understood French  to which I answering in the affirmative  She asked if I was acquainted with the Latin and Greek  I replied    A little  —   Oho   continued she  and with philosophy and mathematicks  I suppose  —  I owned  I knew something of each —Whereupon she repeated her stare and interrogation —   29 I began to repent my vanity  and in order to repair the fault I had committed  said  it was not to be wondered at if I had a tolerable education  because learning was so cheap in my country  that every peasant was a scholar  but I hoped her ladyship would think my understanding no exception to my character —She was pleased to answer    No  no  God forbid  —  But during the rest of the time they sat at table  they behaved with remarkable reserve     This alteration gave me much uneasiness  and I passed the night without sleep  in melancholy reflections on the vanity of young men  which prompts them to commit so many foolish actions  contrary to their own sober judgment —Next day  however  instead of profiting by this selfcondemnation  I yielded still more to the dictates of the principle I had endeavoured to chastize  and if fortune had not befriended me more than prudence could expect  I should have been treated with the contempt I deserved —After breakfast  my lady  who was a true author  bid me follow her into the study  where she expressed herself thus     Since you are so learned  you cannot be void of taste  therefore I am to desire your opinion of a small performance in poetry  which I lately composed —You must know  I have planned a tragedy  the subject of which shall be the murder of a prince before the altar  where he is busy at his devotions —After the deed is perpetrated  the regicide will harrangue the people  with the bloody dagger in his hand  and I have already composed a speech  which I think will suit the character extremely —Here it is  —  Then taking up a   30 scrape of paper  she read with violent emphasis and gesture  as follows    Thus have I sent the simple king to hell    Without or coffin  shroud  or passing bell —   To me  what are divine and human laws    I court no sanction but my own applause    Rapes  robb ries  treasons yield my soul delight    And human carnage gratifies my sight
