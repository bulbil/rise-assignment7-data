 discomposed and incensed at the accident  which she even openly ascribed  to the obstinacy and whimsical oddity of the commodore  in such petulant  terms as evidently declared that she thought her great aim accomplished   and her authority secured against all the shocks of fortune  Indeed her  bedfellow seemed to be of the same opinion  by his tacit resignation   for he made no reply to her insinuations  but with a most vinegar    6 22 15  3 45 PM   aspect crawled out of his nest  and betook himself to rest in another  apartment  while his irritated spouse dismissed the lieutenant  and  from the wreck of the hammock made an occasional bed for herself on the  floor  fully determined to provide better accommodation for the next  night s lodging   Having no inclination to sleep  her thoughts  during the remaining part  of the night  were engrossed by a scheme of reformation she was  resolved to execute in the family  and no sooner did the first lark  bid salutation to the morn  than  starting from her humble couch  and  huddling on her clothes  she sallied from her chamber  explored her  way through paths before unknown  and in the course of her researches  perceived a large bell  to which she made such effectual application  as alarmed every soul in the family  In a moment she was surrounded  by Hatchway  Pipes  and all the rest of the servants half dressed  but  seeing none of the feminine gender appear  she began to storm at the  sloth and laziness of the maids  who  she observed  ought to have been  at work an hour at least before she called  and then  for the first  time  understood that no woman was permitted to sleep within the walls   She did not fail to exclaim against this regulation  and being informed  that the cook and chambermaid lodged in a small office house that stood  without the gate  ordered the drawbridge to be let down  and in person  beat up their quarters  commanding them forthwith to set about scouring  the rooms  which had not been hitherto kept in a very decent condition   while two men were immediately employed to transport the bed on which  she used to lie from her brother s house to her new habitation  so that   in less than two hours  the whole economy of the garrison was turned  topsy turvy  and everything involved in tumult and noise  Trunnion   being disturbed and distracted with the uproar  turned out in his shirt  like a maniac  and  arming himself with a cudgel of crab tree  made  an irruption into his wife s apartment  where  perceiving a couple of  carpenters at work in joining a bedstead  he  with many dreadful oaths  and opprobrious invectives  ordered them to desist  swearing he would  suffer no bulkheads nor hurricane houses to stand where he was master   but finding his remonstrances disregarded by these mechanics  who  believed him to be some madman belonging to the family  who had broken  from his confinement  he assaulted them both with great fury and  indignation  and was handled so roughly  in the encounter  that in a  very short time he measured his length on the floor  in consequence of a  blow that he received from a hammer by which the sight of his remaining  eye was grievously endangered   Having thus reduced him to a state of subjection  they resolved to  secure him with cords  and were actually busy in adjusting his fetters   when he was exempted from the disgrace by the accidental entrance of his  spouse  who rescued him from the hands of his adversaries  and  in the  midst of her condolence  imputed his misfortune to the inconsiderate  roughness of his own disposition   He breathed nothing but revenge  and made some efforts to chastise the  insolence of the workmen  who  as soon as they understood his quality   asked forgiveness for what they had done with great humility  protesting  that they did not know he was master of the house  But  far from  being satisfied with this apology  he groped about for the bell  the  inflammation of his eye having utterly deprived him of sight  and the  rope being  by the precaution of the delinquents  conveyed out of his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   reach  began to storm with incredible vociferation  like a lion roaring  in the toil  pouring forth innumerable oaths and execrations  and  calling by name Hatchway and Pipes  who  being within hearing  obeyed  the extraordinary summons  and were ordered to put the carpenters in  irons  for having audaciously assaulted him in his own house   His myrmidons  seeing he had been evil treated  were exasperated at the  insult he had suffered  which they considered as an affront upon the  dignity of the garrison  the more so as the mutineers seemed to put  themselves in a posture of defence and set their authority at defiance   they therefore unsheathed their cutlasses  which they commonly wore  as badges of their commission
