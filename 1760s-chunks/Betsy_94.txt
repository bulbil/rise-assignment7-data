  Goodman s  therefore wish you would appoint some place where I might   speak with you        Miss Betsy was very much startled at his mentioning such a thing  and   replied   No  Mr  Saving  I do not make a practice of consenting to   assignations with men  nor have yet forgot that which I consented to   with you     I am very well able to clear myself of any fault on that   score   said he   but  Madam  to ease you of those apprehensions  which   might  perhaps  make you think yourself obliged to keep me at a   distance  it is proper to acquaint you  that I am married  and that it   is only through a friendly regard for your honour and peace  that I   would warn you against the perfidy of a pretended friend   Perceiving   she started at these words  and repeated them two or three times over     Yes  Madam   resumed he   and if you will permit me to speak with you   in a proper place  will bring with me an unquestionable proof of the   truth of what I say        One of the ladies happening to turn back to say something to Miss Betsy    prevented him from adding farther  but what he had already spoke  made   a very deep impression on her mind  She could not conceive who the false   friend should be that he had mentioned  unless it were Miss Flora  but   though she had seen many instances of her insincerity  was not able to   form any conjecture what she could have been guilty of to her  that Mr    Saving  who had been so long absent  could possibly be made acquainted   with       Thinking  however  that she ought not to deny herself the satisfaction   of the eclaircissement he offered  especially as it was now to be given    not by a lover  but a friend  she sought and found a moment before they   left the Mall  of saying to him without the notice of the company   Sir    I have considered on the hint you gave me  whatever concerns my honour    or my peace  must certainly merit my attention  I have an acquaintance   in St  James s palace  whom I will visit as soon as dinner is over  if   you walk a turn or two in the gallery leading to the Chapel Royal  you   will see me pass that way between four and five o clock   To this Mr    Saving replied  that he would not fail to attend her there       Miss Flora  who had been informed by Miss Betsy  after they had parted   from Mr  Saving  that he was married  was full of the news when she came   home  but Mr  Goodman  to whom the whole story of that affair had been   related by the alderman  said  that the young gentleman had done very   wisely  in complying with the commands of his father  and added  that   the lady had a very agreeable person  a large fortune  and  above all    was extremely modest and discreet  so that there was no room to doubt   his happiness  There was some farther discourse at table  concerning   this new wedded pair  but Miss Betsy took little part in it  as giving   herself no pains for the interests of a person for whom she never had   any thing but the most perfect indifference       She was  notwithstanding  impatient enough for the account she expected   to receive from him  and  without saying one word  either to Miss Flora    or any of the family  where she was going  went at the time prefixed to   the place she had appointed to meet him       Mr  Saving  to avoid being accused of want of punctuality in the affairs   of friendship  as he had been in those of love  came somewhat before his   time into the palace  As she ascended the great stairs  she saw him   looking through one of the windows  waiting her approach  which greatly   pleased her  as she would not have thought it proper to have walked   there alone  nor would have been willing to have departed without the   gratification of that curiosity his words had excited in her       Excepting the time of divine service  and when the king  or any of the   royal family go to chapel  few places are more retired than this   gallery  none  besides the officers of the household passing on business   into some of the apartments  scarce ever going into it  so that the   choice Miss Betsy made  in her appointment with Mr  Saving
