would try his imperial majesty with a sound which he had always been known to prefer to every other species of music  and pulling out a huge purse of golden obans  began to chink them in his ear —This experiment so far succeeded  that the Dairo was perceived to smile  and even to contract one hand  but further effect it had none  At last Gotto mio starting up  threw a small quantity of aurum fulminans into the fire  which went off with such an explosion  that in the same instant Fika kaha fell flat upon his face  and Got hama baba   67 started upright in his bed  This  however  was no more than a convulsion that put an end to his life  for he fell back again  and expired in the twinkling of an eye —As for the Cuboy  tho  he did not die  he underwent a surprising transformation or metamorphosis  which I shall record in due season   Taycho was no sooner certified that Got hama baba had actually breathed his last  than he vanished from the council in the twinkling of an eye  and mounting the beast whose name is Legion  rode full speed to the habitation of Gio gio  the successor and descendant of the deceased Dairo —Gio gio was a young prince who had been industriously sequestered from the public view  and excluded from all share in the affairs of state by the jealousy of the   68 last emperor —He lived retired under the wings of his grand mother  and had divers preceptors to teach him the rudiments of every art but the art of reigning  Of all those who superintended his education  he who insinuated himself the farthest in his favour  was one Yak strot  from the mountains of Ximo  who valued himself much upon the antient blood that ran in his veins  and still more upon his elevated ideas of patriotism  Yak strot was honest at bottom  but proud  reserved  vain  and affected  He had a turn for nick nacks and gim cracks  and once made and mounted an iron jack and a wooden clock with his own hands  But it was his misfortune to set up for a connoisseur in painting and other liberal arts  and to announce himself an universal patron of genius  He did not fail to infuse   69 his own notions and conceits into the tender mind of Gio gio  who gradually imbibed his turn of thinking  and followed the studies which he recommended —With respect to his lessons on the art of government  he reduced them to a very few simple principles —His maxims were these  That the emperor of Japan ought to cherish the established religion  both by precept and example  that he ought to abolish corruption  discourage faction  and balance the two parties by admitting an equal number from each  to places and offices of trust in the administration  that he should make peace as soon as possible  even in despite of the public  which seemed insensible of the burthen it sustained  and was indeed growing delirious by the illusions of Taycho  and the cruel evacuations he had prescribed  that he should retrench all superfluous expence   70 in his houshold and government  and detach himself intirely from the accursed farm of Yesso  which some evil genius had fixed upon the breech of Japan  as a cancerous ulcer thro  which all her blood and substance would be discharged  These maxims were generally just enough in speculation  but some of them were altogether impracticable —for example  that of forming an administration equally composed of the two sactions  was as absurd as it would be to yoke two stone horses and two jack asses in the same carriage  which  instead of drawing one way  would do nothing but bite and kick one another  while the machine of government would stand stock still  or perhaps be torn in pieces by their dragging in opposite directions —The people of Japan had been long divided between two inveterate parties known by the names of Shit tilk ums heit   71 and She it kums hi til  the first signifying more fool than knave  and the other  more knave than fool  Each had predominated in its turn  by securing a majority in the assemblies of the people  for the majority had always interest to force themselves into the administration  because the constitution being partly democratic  the Dairo was still obliged to truckle to the prevailing faction —To obtain this majority  each side had employed every art of corruption  calumny  insinuation  and priest craft  for nothing is such an effectual ferment in all popular commotions as religious fanaticism —No sooner one party accomplished its aim than it reprobated the other  branding it with the epithets of traitors to their country  or traitors to their prince  while the minority retorted upon them the charge of corruption  rapaciousness    72 and abject servility  In short  both parties were equally abusive  rancorous  uncandid  and illiberal  Taycho had been of both factions more than once —He made his first appearance as a Shi tilk ums heit in the minority  and displayed his talent for scurrility against the Dairo to such advantage  that an old rich hag  who loved nothing so well as money  except the gratification of her revenge  made him a present of five thousand obans  on condition he should continue to revile the
