evening have now stretched themselves upon the earth  command Osmyn   to attend thee alone in the grove  where Solyman  thy father  was used   to meditate by night  and when thy form shall be impressed upon him  I   will there seal his eyes in sleep  till the charm shall be broken  so   shall no evil be attempted against thee  and the transformation shall be   known only to thyself        ALMORAN  whose breast was again illuminated by hope  was about to   express his gratitude and joy  but the Genius suddenly disappeared  He   began  therefore  immediately to follow the instructions that he had   received  he commanded Osmyn to attend him in the grove  and forbad   every other to approach  by the power of the talisman he assumed his   appearance  and saw him sink down in the supernatural slumber before   him  he then quitted the place  and prepared to visit HAMET in the   prison                CHAP  XVIII          The officer who commanded the guard that kept the gate of the prison    was Caled  He was now next in trust and power to Osmyn  but as he had   proposed a revolt to HAMET  in which Osmyn had refused to concur  he   knew that his life was now in his power  he dreaded lest  for some   slight offence  or in some fit of causeless displeasure  he should   disclose the secret to ALMORAN  who would then certainly condemn him to   death  To secure this fatal secret  and put an end to his inquietude  he   resolved  from the moment that ALMORAN was established upon the throne    to find some opportunity secretly to destroy Osmyn  in this resolution    he was confirmed by the enmity  which inferior minds never fail to   conceive against that merit  which they cannot but envy without spirit   to emulate  and by which they feel themselves disgraced without an   effort to acquire equal honour  it was confirmed also by the hope which   Caled had conceived  that  upon the death of Osmyn  he should succeed to   his post  his apprehensions likewise were increased  by the gloom which   he remarked in the countenance of Osmyn  and which not knowing that it   arose from fear  he imputed to jealousy and malevolence       When ALMORAN  who had now assumed the appearance of Osmyn  had passed   the subterranean avenue to the dungeon in which HAMET was confined  he   was met by Caled  of whom he demanded admittance to the prince  and   produced his own signet  as a testimony that he came with the authority   of the king  As it was Caled s interest to secure the favour of Osmyn   till an opportunity should offer to cut him off  he received him with   every possible mark of respect and reverence  and when he was gone into   the dungeon  he commanded a beverage to be prepared for him against he   should return  in which such spices were infused  as might expel the   malignity which  in that place  might be received with the breath of   life  and taking himself the key of the prison  he waited at the door       When ALMORAN entered the dungeon  with a lamp which he had received from   Caled  he found HAMET sitting upon the ground  his countenance was   impressed with the characters of grief  but it retained no marks either   of anger or fear  When he looked up  and saw the features of Osmyn  he   judged that the mutes were behind him  and  therefore  rose up  to   prepare himself for death  ALMORAN beheld his calmness and fortitude   with the involuntary praise of admiration  yet persisted in his purpose   without remorse   I am come   said he  by the command of ALMORAN  to   denounce that fate  the bitterness of which I will enable thee to   avoid    And what is there   said HAMET   in my fortunes  that has   prompted thee to the danger of this attempt    The utmost that I can   give thee   said ALMORAN   I can give thee without danger to myself  but   though I have been placed  by the hand of fortune  near the person of   the tyrant  yet has my heart in secret been thy friend  If I am the   messenger of evil  impute it to him only by whom it is devised  The rack   is now preparing to receive thee  and every art of ingenious cruelty   will be exhausted to protract and to increase the agonies of death      And what   said HAMET   can thy friendship offer me    I can offer
