 served him in my profession more than once  and from him I have   learned the whole story   and now leave me to set it out  I ll engage   to make a noble eighteenpennyTVorth of it  at least by to morrow   morning          Why  there may be something in that  but in the meantime   you should not let other matters cool          Never fear   pray  how did yesterday s pamphlet do           Why  tolerably well   but the scandal was so gross  that I was   almost afraid          Ay  ay  never fear me for a home cut   never fear me   1       But I hear nothing of the exercitations           No   I sent away the sheet above an hour ago          Then there s that book you promised to re write   someone   else wiU do it  and prevent you          Never fear  I have just laid down a scale for the style   besides  I   have altered the title already  and thatyouknowis the principal thing         That is right   Now you speak of titles  I want half a dozen   directly  this very day  if possible           It is rather too late now  but where are the books             62 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA       In the lumber garret  where they have lain these seven years          That s well   they are forgot by this          Forgot   why  they were never known   The author was a man   of fortime  who printed them at his own expense  but I prevented   the sale  and so had them for the publishing  ha   ha   ha   besides   a good consideration for buying up at a double price what I had   not sold of them   so that it was not a bad job   and now he is dead   they may safely come out under new titles  It wiU be too great   a delay to wait to see them  but here are the old titles  which I   suppose may do          Why  ay  they may do   but I cannot possibly write them   this evening  You know I must answer that pamphlet I wrote   last week  before it is forgotten  I have an answer ready that   will make a noise   I expect it will raise a curiosity that mU sell   another edition of the pamphlet  I left openings for such retorts   upon the characters I praised in that  and have such pieces of secret   history to hit them off with that I U engage for the success          Ay  secret history and stories of famihar misfortunes  and such   like  may do something  But I had Uke to have forgot the main   business of my coming  There is an account of the death of an   eminent divine this morning   could we not vamp up a volume or two   of sermons for him  think you   He was suspected of heresy and   atheism  and you know that would make anything in his name go off          Egad  a good thought   and particularly lucky at this time     for  as I have been engaged in divinity lately  I know the weak sides   of the question  and a httle infidelity wiU be a refreshment to me    It shall be done   the sermons shall be ready without delay   Have   you not got some by you that did not go off   Let me have one of   each  and I ll interline them to save time   but will you publish   them yourseK   I thought you had given up sermons           Myself   no   no   I ll send them in to Mr Vamp  I ll reserve   the confutation of them to myself           Egad  another good thought   the confutation wiU do better     and I ll take care to make it a smart one  and play the devil with   the author  ha   ha   ha   But  Mr Vellum  your coming here   this morning prevented my waiting on you   it is a great while since   you promised to settle with me
