 an inhabitant of the world above thee  and to the will of   thy brother  my powers have been obedient  upon him they have not   conferred happiness  but they have brought evil upon thee  It was my   voice  that forbad thy marriage with ALMEIDA  and my voice  that decreed   the throne to ALMORAN  I gave him the power to assume thy form  and  by   me  the hand of oppression is now heavy upon thee  Yet I have not   decreed  that he should be happy  nor that thou shouldst be wretched    darkness as yet rests upon my purpose  but my heart in secret is thy   friend    If thou art  indeed my friend   said HAMET   deliver me from   this prison  and preserve HAMET for ALMEIDA   Thy deliverance   said the   Genius  must depend upon thyself  There is a charm  of which the power   is great  but it is by thy will only  that this power can be exerted        The Genius then held out towards him a scroll  on which the seal of   seven powers was impressed   Take  said he   this scroll  in which the   mysterious name of Orosmades is written  Invoke the spirits  that reside   westward from the rising of the sun  and northward  in the regions of   cold and darkness  then stretch out thy hand  and a lamp of sulphur    self kindled  shall burn before thee  In the fire of this lamp  consume   that which I now give thee  and as the smoke  into which it changes    shall mix with the air  a mighty charm shall be formed  which shall   defend thee from all mischief  from that instant no poison  however   potent  can hurt thee  nor shall any prison confine  in one moment  thou   shalt be restored to the throne  and to ALMEIDA  and the Angel of death    shall lay his hand upon thy brother  to whom  if I had confided this   last best effort of my power  he would have secured the good to himself    and have transferred the evil to thee        ALMORAN  who had listened unseen to this address of the Genius to HAMET    was now confirmed in his suspicions  that evil had been ultimately   intended against him  and that he had been entangled in the toils of   perfidy  while he believed himself to be assisted by the efforts of   friendship  he was also convinced  that by the Genius he was not known   to be present  HAMET  however  flood still doubtful  and ALMORAN was   kept silent by his fears   Whoever thou art   said HAMET  the condition   of the advantages which thou hast offered me  is such as it is not   lawful to fulfill  these horrid rites  and this commerce with unholy   powers  are prohibited to mortals in the Law of life    See thou to   that   said the Genius   Good and evil are before thee  that which I now   offer thee  I will offer no more        HAMET  who had not fortitude to give up at once the possibility of   securing the advantages that had been offered  and who was seduced by   human frailty to deliberate at least upon the choice  stretched out his   hand  and receiving the scroll  the Genius instantly disappeared  That   which had been proposed as a trial of his virtue  ALMORAN believed   indeed to be an offer of advantage  he had no hope  therefore  but that   HAMET would refuse the conditions  and that he should be able to obtain   the talisman  and fulfill them himself  he judged that the mind of HAMET   was in suspense  and was doubtful to which side it might finally   incline  he  therefore  instantly assumed the voice and the person of   OMAR  that by the influence of his council he might be able to turn the   scale       When the change was effected  he called HAMET by his name  and HAMET    who knew the voice  answered him in a transport of joy and wonder   My   friend   said he   my father  in this dreary solitude  in this hour of   trial  thou art welcome to my soul as liberty and life  Guide me to thee   by thy voice  and tell while I hold thee to my bosom  how and wherefore   thou art come    Do not now ask me   said ALMORAN   it is enough that I   am here  and that I am permitted to warn thee of the precipice  on which   thou standest  It is enough  that concealed in this darkness
