found an opportunity of making you my debtor  The gentleman returned his thanks with all becoming expressions of gratitude  and when they were at some distance from one another  the obsequious churchman said to one of his attendants in waiting    I ought to know that man  I have some floating  indistinct idea of having seen him somewhere   Next after the bishop  came the son of a grandee  When I had introduced him into my lady s room    This nobleman  said Molina  is also an original in his way  You are to take notice that he often pays a visit  for the express purpose of talking over some urgent business with the friend on whom he calls  and goes away again without once thinking on the topic he came solely to discuss  But  added my showman on the sight of two ladies  here are Donna Angela de Penafiel and Donna Margaretta de Montalvan  This pair have not a feature of resemblance to each other  Donna Margaretta prides herself on her philosophical acquirements  she will hold her head as high as the most learned head among the doctors of Salamanca  nor will the wisdom of her conceit ever give up the point to the best reasons they can render  As for Donna Angela  she does not affect the learned lady  though she has taken no unsuccessful pains in the improvement of her mind  Her manner of talking is rational and proper  her ideas are novel and ingenious  expressed in polite  significant  and natural terms  This latter portrait is delightful  said I to Molina  but the other  in my opinion  is scarcely to be tolerated in the softer sex  Not over bearable indeed  replied he with a sneer  even in men it does but expose them to the lash of satire  The good marchioness herself  our honoured lady  continued he  she too has a sort of a philosophical looseness  There will be fine chopping of logic there to day  God grant the mysteries of religion may not be invaded by these disputants   As he was finishing this last sentence  in came a withered bit of mortality  with a grave and crabbed look  My companion shewed him no mercy  This fellow  said he  is one of those pompous  unbending spirits who think to pass for men of profound genius  under favour of a few common places extracted out of Seneca  yet they are but shallow coxcombs when one comes to examine them narrowly  Then followed in the train a spruce figure  with tolerable person and address  to say nothing of a troubled air and manner  which always supposes a plentiful stock of self  sufficiency  I inquired who this was  A dramatic poet  said Molina  He has manufactured an hundred thousand verses in his time  which never brought him in the value of a groat  but as a set off against his metrical failure  he has feathered his nest very warmly by six lines of humble prose  you will wonder by what magic touch a fortune could be made  And so I did  but a confounded noise upon the staircase put verse and prose completely out of my head  Good again  exclaimed my informer  here is the licentiate Campanario  He is his own harbinger before ever he makes his appearance  He sets out from the very street door in a continued volley of conversation  and you hear how the alarm is kept up till he makes his retreat  In good sooth  the vaulted roof re echoed with the organ of the thundering licentiate  who at length exhibited the case in which the pipes were contained  He brought a bachelor of his acquaintance by way of accompaniment  and there was not a sotto voce passage during the whole visit  Signor Campanario  said I to Molina  is to all appearance a man of very fine conversation  Yes  replied my sage instructor  the gentleman has his lucky hits  and a sort of quaintness that might pass for humour  he does very well in a mixed company  But the worst of it is  that incessant talking is one of his most pardonable errors  He is a little too apt to borrow from himself  and as those who are behind the scenes are not to be dazzled by the tinsel of the property man  so we know how to separate a certain volubility and buffoonery of manner from sterling wit and sense  The greater part of his good things would be thought very bad ones  if submitted  without their concomitant grimaces  to the ordeal of a jest book   Other groups passed before us  and Molina touched them with his wand  The marchioness too came in for a magic rap over the knuckles  Our lady patroness  said he  is better than might be expected for a female philosopher  She is not dainty in her likings  and bating a whim or two  it is no hard matter to give her satisfaction  Wits and women of quality seldom approach so near the atmosphere of good sense  and for passion  she scarcely knows what it is  Play and gallantry are equally in her black books  dear conversation is her first and sole delight  To lead such a life would be little better than penance to the common run of ladies  Molina s character of
