together  the gay scenes which hope had painted to our hearts  I wept over the friend I had so loved  I pressed his cold hand to my lips        Bellville  I am now accustomed to horrors        We have prevailed on the wretched parents to retire  Emily Howard and I have entreated to watch our angel friends till midnight  and then leave them to the village maids  to whom Lady Julia s weeping attendants insist on being joined        I dread the rising of to morrow s sun  he was meant to light us to happiness            2 185       Thursday Morning      Bellville  this morning is come  this morning once so ardently expected  who shall ever dare to say  To morrow I will be happy        At dawn of day we returned to the saloon  we bid a last adieu to the loved remains  my Lord and Colonel Mandeville had been before us  they were going to close the coffins  when Lady Belmont burst wildly into the room  she called eagerly for her Julia  for the idol of her agonizing soul   Let me once more behold my child  let me once more kiss those icy lips  Oh  Julia  this day first gave thee birth  this day fond hope set down for thy bridals  this day we resign thee to the grave         Overcome by the excess of her sorrow  she fainted into the arms of her woman  we took that opportunity to convey her from          2 186       this scene of terrors  her sense are not yet returned   Thursday Evening      What a day have I passed  may the idea of it be ever blotted from y mind     Nine o Clock      The sad procession begins  the whole village attend in tears  they press to perform the last melancholy duties  her servants crowd eagerly round  they weep  they beat their bosoms  they call on their angelic mistress  they kiss the pall that covers her breathless form  Borne by the youngest of the village maids    Oh  Bellville  never more shall I behold her  the loveliest of her sex  the friend on whom my heart doated    One grave receives the hapless lovers              2 187          They move on    far other processions    but who shall resist the hand of Heaven        Emily Howard comes this way  she has left the wretched parents  there is a wildness in her air which chills my blood  she will behold her friend once more  she proposes to meet and join the procession  I embraced the offer with transport    the transport of enthusiastic sorrow          We have beheld the closing scene    Bellville  my heart is breaking    the pride of the world  the loveliest pair that ever breathed the vital air  are now cold and inanimate in the grave            2 188         To Colonel Bellville   Sunday Morning      I AM just come from chapel with Lady Belmont  who has been pouring out the sorrows of her soul to her Creator  with a fervor of devotion which a mind like hers alone can feel  when she approached the seat once filled by Lady Julia  the tears streamed involuntarily down her cheeks  she wiped them away  she raised her eyes to Heaven  and falling on her knees  with a look of pious resignation  seemed to sacrifise her grief to her God  or at least to suspend the expression of it in his presence        Next Sunday she goes to the parish church  where the angelic pair are interred  I dread her seeing the vault  yet think she cannot too soon visit every place which must renew the excess of her affliction  she          2 189       will then  and not till then  find  by degrees  the violence of her sorrow subside  and give way to that pleasing melancholy  that tender regret  which  however strange it may appear  is one of the most charming sensations of the human heart      Whether it be that the mind abhors nothing like a state of inaction  or from whatever cause I know not  but grief itself is more agreeable to us than indifference  nay  if not too exquisite  is in the highest degree delightful  of which the pleasure we take in tragedy  or in talking of our dead friends  is a striking proof  we wish not to be cured of what we feel on these occasions  the tears we shed are charming  we even indulge in them  Bellville
