the privilege of youth to do whatever it   listed  provided the rules of virtue were unfringed  so that all he   could get from her was  that her amusements were innocent  that she   meant no harm in any thing she did  that it was dull for her to sit at   home alone  and  when in company  could not quit it abruptly on any   consideration of hours       Mr  Goodman found  that to bring her to a more just sense of what was   really her advantage  would be a task impossible for him to accomplish    he began heartily to wish she was under the care of some person who had   more leisure to argue with her on points so essential to her happiness    he told her  that he indeed had feared his house would be too melancholy   a recess for her since the revolution that had lately happened in his   family  and therefore wished some more proper place could be found for   her   And for such a one   said he   I shall make it my business to   enquire  and there seems not only a necessity for my doing so  but that   you should also choose another guardian  for as soon as the present   unlucky business I am engaged in shall be over  it is my resolution to   break up housekeeping  leave my business to my nephew  Ned Goodman    whom I expect by the first ship that arrives from the East Indies  and    having once seen him settled  retire  and spend the remainder of my days   in the country        The melancholy accents with which Mr  Goodman spoke these words  touched   Miss Betsy very much  she expressed  in terms the most affectionate  the   deep concern it gave her that he had any cause to withdraw from a way of   life to which he had so long been accustomed  but added  that if it must   be so  she knew no person so proper  in whose hands the little fortune   she was mistress of should be entrusted  as those of her brother   Thoughtless  if he would vouchsafe to take that trouble upon him        There is no doubt to be made of that  I believe   replied Mr  Goodman     and I shall speak to him about it the first time I see him   They had   some farther talk on Miss Betsy s affairs  and that young lady found he   had very largely improved the portion bequeathed her by her father  for   which  in the first emotions of her gratitude  she was beginning to pour   forth such acknowledgements as he thought it too much to hear  and   interrupted her  saying he had done no more than his duty obliged him to   do  and could not have answered to himself the omission of any part of   it       It is so natural for people to love money  even before they know what to   do with it  that it is not to be wondered at that Miss Betsy  now   arrived at an age capable of relishing all the delicacies of life    should be transported at finding so considerable  and withal so   unexpected  an augmentation of her fortune  which was no less than one   third of what her father had left her       The innate pleasure of her mind  on this occasion  diffused itself   through all her form  and gave a double lustre to her eyes and air  so   that she went with charms new pointed to a ball that night  for which   the obsequious Mr  Munden had presented her with a ticket  but though   she had all the respect in the world for Mr  Goodman  and indeed a kind   of filial love for him  yet she had it not in her power to pay that   regard to his admonitions she ought to have done  She came not home till   between one and two o clock in the morning  but was extremely surprized   to find  that when she did so  the knocker was taken off the door  a   thing which  in complaisance to her  had never before been done till she   came in  how late soever she staid abroad  she was  nevertheless  much   more surprized  as well as troubled  when  at the first rap her chairman   gave  a footman  who waited in the hall for her return  immediately   opened the door  and told her  with all the marks of sorrow in his   countenance  that his master had been suddenly taken ill  and that his   physician  as well as Mrs  Barns  the housekeeper  had given strict   orders there should be no noise made in the house  the former having   said his life depended
