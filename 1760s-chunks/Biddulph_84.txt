when a person should call on her  who would conduct her to a place where she should find her lady and me   I needed no arguments to persuade the girl  the thing appeared plausible enough  she was fully convinced of the intimacy between her mistress and me  and knowing her too well to have a doubt of her baseness  she concluded I acted by Mrs Gerrarde’s directions  and promised punctually to obey them  She said  she could easily carry away in the dark as many things as she could conveniently carry  and  to avoid observation from the rest of the servants  she would wait at a cottage hard by  which she named to me  till her conductor arrived   Whether any of the keys I gave her would fit the locks or not  I was not much concerned  if they did not  I concluded she would think her mistress had made a mistake  and that she would force them open  rather than fail  Having settled this material point  I got back to my Lord V——’s  without having been missed by the company   Our ball was very well conducted  I danced with Mrs Gerrarde  and we passed a very agreeable evening  We supped at twelve  and she had ordered her chariot to come a little after that hour  but I had given my fellows their cue  As the dancing was not renewed  the company broke up between one and two  Mrs Gerrarde was one of the first that offered to go  but as her servants were not to be found  she was detained till every body else had taken their leave  At length her coachman and footman were found in the cellar  with one of my mean  all so drunk that they were not able to stand  Her servants were really so  and mine counterfeited so well  there was no    discovering the cheat  In this emergency  nothing was more natural than the offering my servants to attend her home  and of course to wait on her myself to see her safe  She readily accepted the first offer  but declined the other  This was easily got over  I handed her into her chariot  and stepped in after her  Our route was settled  we drove from my Lord V——’s door  and turning short from the road that led to Mrs Gerrarde’s house  we struck down a lane which was to carry us by cross roads to our first destined stage  which was at the distance of seven miles  This was no other than a poor gardener’s house  to which place two of my emissaries had been dispatched that day to wait our coming  with a travelling chariot  and four stout horses  I had taken care  according to promise  to send a trusty groom for the maid  with a boy to carry her luggage  They were both well mounted  and had orders to carry her to an inn on the road to Rochester  and within about a mile of the town  This inn was kept by a fellow  who had formerly been my servant  I had placed him there  and he was intirely at my devotion  He had already received his instructions  and his house was to be our second stage  I concluded the maid had arrived there long before us  having had six or seven hours the start of us  and the place was not more than twenty miles from her own house   Mrs Gerrarde was not immediately aware of our going out of the road  she was in high spirits  and I kept her in chat  As soon as she perceived it  she cried out  with some surprize  Lord  Mr Faulkland  where is the fellow carrying us  He has missed his way  She called to him  but the coachman  who had orders not to stop unless I spoke to him  only drove the faster  Pray do call to him  said she  the wretch has certainly got drunk with the rest of the servants  I told her there was no possibility of turning in the narrow road in which we then were  that when we got out of it  I would speak to the coachman  and begged of her  in the mean while  not to be frightened  The lane was a very long one  but our rapid wheels soon carried us to the end of it  where I had appointed Pivet and one of my footmen to meet us on horseback  I had another servant behind the chariot  whom I purposed to send back with it in the morning   At the sight of two horsemen  who were apparently waiting for us  she screamed out  Oh  the villain  he has brought us here to be robbed  She had a good many jewels on her  and  to say the truth  had some reason for her fears  The chariot had now got on a good open road  and the horses rather flew than galloped  The two    horsemen joined us  and kept up with us at full speed  I saw she was heartily frightened  and thought it time to undeceive her  I was not ill natured enough to keep her longer under the apprehensions of highwaymen  and thought she would be less shocked at finding there was a
