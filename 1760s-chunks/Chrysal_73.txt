late master s story  in which my present bore a considerable   part      As soon as the general   had slept off the fumes of bis wine  and   awoke next morning  my master s hour of influence arrived  which   he never failed to improve  After a prelude of coughing and spit    ting  the scene opened thus   â€”     Who s there   William       Sir         William  was not I very drunk last night 7 my head aches most   confoundedly          Your excellency was a little cut  but you broke up much the   strongest of the company          Ay  I wonder at that  I spend myself with talking  when I   begin to go  and that helps a man on damnably   that story of   the battle  where I was taken prisoner  is a bottle in my way   always           fliat foreign gentleman  who never speaks a word  has a great   advantage  then   1       Ay  so he has   but he is a damned honest fellow  and a very   good companion   he always fills a bumper  and never speaks a   word  â€” But my head          Perhaps your excellency had better take something       No  I have taken too much already  though that s right  give   me a glass of the old Geneva   I am to go to council to day  and   must settle my head  Ay  that wiU do  I am much better now     there is nothing like a hair of the old dog        This conversation continued till he was seated to breakfast  when   my master turned to a new topic    I was very sorry    said he      that your excellency happened to sit in last night  as Mrs Motherly   was to call          Why  that s true  William   I did not think of one engagement   when I made the other   and when she called me out I was not in   cue   I was too far gone  We old fellows are not sparrows   the   spirit is often willing when the flesh is weak  ha  ha  ha           Your excellency is pleased to be merry  but  to my thinking    the youngest fellow of the age has not more vigour          Ay  William  do you think so  indeed   But why do you think   so  William           Because your excellency always chooses such green things   now   I should thiiik a ripe woman would be better   I am sure she would   give less trouble        Ha  ha  ha   why that s your taste   but youth is mine  and     1 Jean Louis Ligonier  first Earl Ligonier  1680 1770  Master General   of the Ordnance  1750 62  â€” an aged man with a glorious career   behind him  which had now been totally forgotten by the public     who regarded him as obselete   and as a cover for jobbery among his   subordinates        E         66 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     wliile I have powers â€” and I do not think mine quite gone yet   â€” I will please my taste  But what had Mrs Motherly last   night           A very fine girl as your excellency could wish to see          How old           About sixteen          Pshaw  mellow pears   I loath such trash          But Mrs Motherly said she could swear she was untouched    She came from the country but yesterday  a relation of her own     she  poor thing  knew nothing of the matter  and thought she came   to be hired for a laundry maid          Why  that is something  but I wish she were younger         If your excellency pleases but to wait a Uttle  I have one in   my eye that wiU suit your taste exactly   a sweeter child is not in all   England         Ay  good William    spitting once or twice
