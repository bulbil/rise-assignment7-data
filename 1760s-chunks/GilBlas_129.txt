myself  I tremble for all my snug arrangements  I tell you what  answered my mistress with congenial spirit  your fears are not without their foundation  Don Felix de Mendoza is rather formidable  so take care what you are about  This is not my first visit in this country  the ladies hereabouts  to my knowledge  are made of penetrable materials  About a month ago my way happened to lie through this city  I halted for eight days  and you are to know         but you must not mention it         that I set fire to the daughter of an old doctor of laws   It was evident enough that Don Lewis was disturbed by this declaration  Might one without impropriety  replied he  just ask the lady s name  What do you mean by impropriety  exclaimed the pretended Don Felix  Why make any secret about such a matter as that  Do you think me more of a Joseph than other young noblemen of my standing  Have a better opinion of my spirit  Besides  the object  between ourselves  is unworthy of any great reserve  she is but a little mushroom of the lower ranks  A man of fashion never quarrels with his conscience about such obscure gallantries  and even thinks it an honour conferred on a tradesman s wife or daughter when he leaves her without any  I shall therefore acquaint you in plain terms  that the name of the doctor s daughter is Isabella  And the doctor himself  interrupted Pacheco impatiently  he possibly may be Signor Marcia de la Liana  Precisely so  replied my mistress  Here is a letter sent me just now  Read it  and then you will see how deeply your humble servant has dipped into her good graces  Don Lewis just cast his eye upon the note  and recognizing the handwriting  was struck dumb with astonishment and vexation  What is the matter  cried Aurora  with an air of surprise  keeping up the spirit of her assumed character  You change colour  God forgive me  but you are a party concerned in this young lady  Ah  Plague take my officious tongue for having opened my affairs to you with so much frankness   I am very much obliged to you for it for my own part  said Don Lewis in a transport made up of spite and rage  Traitress  Jilt  My dear Don Felix  how shall I ever requite you  You have restored me to my senses when they were just on the wing for an eternal flight  I was tickling myself into a fool s paradise of credulous love  But love is too cold a term to express my extravagancies  I fancied myself adored by Isabella  The creature had wormed her self into my heart by feigning to give me her own  But now I know her clearly for a coquette  and as such despise her as she deserves  Your feelings on the occasion do you infinite credit  said Aurora  testifying a friendly sympathy in his resentment  A plodding pettifogger s worthless brood might have gorged to surfeit on the love of a young nobleman so captivating as yourself  Her fickleness is inexcusable  So far from taking her sacrifice of you in good part  it is my determination to punish her by the keenest contempt  As for me  rejoined Pacheco  I shall never set eyes on her again  and if that is not revenge  the devil is in it  You are in the right  exclaimed our masquerading Mendoza  At the same time  that she may fully understand how ineffably we both disdain her  I vote for sitting down  each of us  and writing her a sarcastic farewell  They shall be enclosed in one cover  and serve as an answer to her own letter  But do not let us proceed to this extremity till you have examined your heart  it may be you will repent hereafter of having broken off with Isabella  No  no  interrupted Don Lewis  I am not such a fool as that comes to  let it be a bargain  and we will mortify the ungrateful wretch as you propose   I immediately sent for pen  ink  and paper  when they sat themselves down at opposite corners of the table  and drew up a most tender bill of indictment against Doctor Murcia de la Llana s daughter  Pacheco  in particular  was at a loss for language forcible enough to convey his sentiments in all their acrimony  away went exordium after exordium  to the tearing and maiming of five or six fair sheets  before the words looked crooked enough to please his jealous eyes  At length  however  he produced an epistle which came up with his most tragical conceptions  It ran thus     Self knowledge is a leading branch of wisdom  my little philosopher  As a candidate for a professor s chair  lay aside the vanity of fancying yourself amiable  It requires merit of a far different compass to fix my affections  You have not enough of the woman about you to afford me even a temporary amusement  Yet do not despair  you have a sphere of your own  the beggarly servitors in our university have a keen appetite  but no very distinguishing palate
