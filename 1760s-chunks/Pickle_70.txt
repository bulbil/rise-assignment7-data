and disconcerted at the receipt of this  letter  which was quite different from what he had expected  and  declared in a resolute tone to the lieutenant  who brought it  that he  might return as soon as he pleased  for he was determined to consult his  own inclination  and remain for some time longer where he was   Hatchway endeavoured to persuade him  by all the arguments which his  sagacity and friendship could supply  to show a little more deference  for the old man  who was by this time rendered fretful and peevish by  the gout  which now hindered him from enjoying himself as usual  who  might  in his passion  take some step very much to the detriment of the  young gentleman  whom he had hitherto considered as his own son  Among  other remonstrances  Jack observed that mayhap Peregrine had got under  Emilia s hatches  and did not choose to set her adrift  and that if that  was the case  he himself would take charge of the vessel  and see her  cargo safely delivered  for he had a respect for the young woman  and  his needle pointed towards matrimony  and as  in all probability  she  could not be much the worse for the wear  he would make shift to scud  through life with her under an easy sail   Our lover was deaf to all his admonitions  and  having thanked him  for this last instance of his complaisance  repeated his resolution of  adhering to his first purpose  Hatchway  having profited so little by  mild exhortations  assumed a more peremptory aspect  and plainly told  him that he neither could nor would go home without him  so he had best  make immediate preparation for the voyage   Peregrine made no other reply to this declaration than by a contemptuous  smile  and rose from his seat in order to retire  upon which the  lieutenant started up  and  posting himself by the door  protested   with some menacing gestures  that he would not suffer him to run a head  neither  The other  incensed at his presumption in attempting to detain  him by force  tripped up his wooden leg  and laid him on his back in a  moment  then walked deliberately towards the park  in order to indulge  his reflection  which at that time teemed with disagreeable thoughts  He  had not proceeded two hundred steps when he heard something blowing and  stamping behind him  and  looking back  perceived the lieutenant at his  heels  with rage and indignation in his countenance  This exasperated    6 22 15  3 45 PM   seaman  impatient of the affront he had received  and forgetting all the  circumstances of their former intimacy  advanced with great eagerness  to his old friend  saying   Look ye  brother  you re a saucy boy  and if  you was at sea  I would have your backside brought to the davit for your  disobedience  but as we are on shore  you and I must crack a pistol at  one another  here is a brace  you shall take which you please    Peregrine  upon recollection  was sorry for having been laid under the  necessity of disobliging honest Jack  and very frankly asked his pardon  for what he had done  But this condescension was misinterpreted by the  other  who refused any other satisfaction but that which an officer  ought to claim  and  with some irreverent expressions  asked if Perry  was afraid of his bacon  The youth  inflamed at this unjust insinuation   darted a ferocious look at the challenger  told him he had paid but too  much regard to his infirmities  and bid him walk forward to the park   where he would soon convince him of his error  if he thought his  concession proceeded from fear   About this time  they were overtaken by Pipes  who  having heard the  lieutenant s fall and seen him pocket his pistols  suspected there was  a quarrel in the case  and followed him with a view of protecting  his master  Peregrine  seeing him arrive  and guessing his intention   assumed an air of serenity  and pretending that he had left his  handkerchief at the inn  ordered his man to go thither and fetch it to  him in the park  where he would find them at his return  This command  was twice repeated before Tom would take any other notice of the  message  except by shaking his head  but being urged with many threats  and curses to obedience  he gave them to understand that he knew their  drift too well to trust them by themselves   As for you  Lieutenant  Hatchway   said he   I have been your shipmate  and know you to be a  sailor  that s enough  and as for master  I know him to be as good a man  as ever stept betwixt stem and stern  whereby  if you have anything to  say to him  I am your man  as the saying is  Here s my sapling  and I  don t
