afraid to declare his passion  respectful    awed by the commanding dignity of my manner    poor dear creature  I think I must unbend a little  hide half the rays of my divinity  to encourage so timid a worshiper        Some flattering tawdry coxcomb  I suppose  some fool with a tolerable outside        No  you never was more mistaken  Bellville  his charms  I assure you  are not all external  His understanding is of the most exalted kind  and has been improved by a very extraordinary education  in projecting which his father has employed much time and thought  and half ruined himself by carrying it into execution  Above all  the Colonel has cultivated in his son an ardent love of independence  not quite so well          1 39       suited to his fortune  and a generous  perhaps a romantic  contempt of riches  which most parents if they had found would have eradicated with the utmost care  His heart is warm  noble  liberal  benevolent  sincere and violent in his friendships  he is not less so  though extremely placable  in his enmities  scorning disguise  and laying his faults as well as his virtues open to every eye  rash  romantic  imprudent  haughty to the assuming sons of wealth  but to those below him      Gentle   As Zephyr blowing underneath the violet       But whither am I running  and where was I when this divine creature seduced me from my right path  Oh  I remember  at chapel  it must be acknowledged my digressions are a little Pindaric  True  as I was saying  I go constantly to chapel           1 40        Tis strange  but this lady Belmont has the most unaccountable way in the world of making it one s choice to do whatever she has an inclination one should  without seeming to desire it  One sees so clearly that all she does is right  religion fits so easy upon her  her style of goodness is so becoming and graceful  that it seems want of taste and elegance not to endeavour to resemble her  Then my Lord too loves to worship in the beauty of holiness  he makes the fine arts subservient to the noblest purpose  and spends as much on serving his Creator as some people of his rank do on a kennel of hounds  We have every external incitement to devotion  exquisite paintings  an admirable organ  fine voices  and the most animated reader of prayers in the universe      Col  Mandeville  whom I should be extremely in love with if his son was not five and twenty years younger  leaves us tomorrow          1 41       morning  to join his regiment  the shire militia  he served in the late war with honour  but  meeting with some ill usage from a minister on account of a vote in parliament  he resigned his commission  and gave up his whole time to the education of my lovely Harry  whose tenderness and merit are a full reward for all his generous attention  Adieu   A  Wilmot      To Colonel Bellville   Belmont  Thursday      IL divino Enrico is a little in the Penseroso  Poor Harry  I am charmed with his sensibility  he has scarce been himself since he parted with his father yesterday  He apologizes for his chagrin  but says  no man on earth has such obligations to a parent  Entre nous  I fancy I know some few sons who would be of a different way of thinking  the Colonel has literally          1 42       governed his conduct by the old adage  that  Learning is better than house and land   for  as his son s learning advanced  his houses and lands melted away  or at least would have done  had it not been for his mother s fortune  every shilling of which  with half the profits of his estate  he expended on Harry s education  who certainly wants only ten thousand pounds a year to be the most charming young fellow in the universe  Well  he must e en make the most of his perfections  and endeavour to marry a fortune  on which subject I have a kind of a glimpse of a design  and fancy my friend Harry has not quite so great a contempt of money as I imagined      You must know then   a pretty phrase that  but to proceed  you must know  that we accompanied Colonel Mandeville fifteen miles  and  after dining together at an inn  he took the road to his regiment           1 43       and we were returning pensive and silent to Belmont  when my Lord  to remove the tender melancholy we all caught from Harry  proposed a visit at Mr  Westbrook s  a
