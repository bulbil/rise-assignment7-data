 —   And how could you    said I    so basely  so ungratefully presume to write this letter    —   And how came you    replied he  with looks of unparallelled effrontery    so basely to presume to break open this letter  Don t you know  now  I could hang you all for this  All that I have to do  is to swear at the next justice s  that you have been guilty of breaking open the lock of my pocket book  and so hang you all up at his door    This piece of unexpected insolence raised me to such a pitch  that I could scare govern my passion    Ungrateful wretch  begone  and no longer pollute my dwelling with thy baseness  Begone  and never let me see thee again  go from my doors  and the only punishment I wish thee is an allarmed conscience  which will be a sufficient tormentor    Page  154  So saying  I threw him his pocket book  which he took up with a smile  and shutting the clasps with the utmost composure  left us  quite astonished at the serenity of his assurance  My wife was particularly enraged that nothing could make him angry  or make him seem ashamed of his villainies    My dear    cried I  willing to calm those passions that had been raised too high among us    we are not to be surprised that bad men want shame  they only blush at being detected in doing good  but glory in their vices         Guilt and shame  says the allegory  were at first companions  and in the beginning of their journey inseparably kept together  But their union was soon found to be disagreeable and inconvenient to both  guilt gave shame frequent uneasiness  and shame often betrayed the secret conspiracies of guilt  After long disagreement  therefore  they at length consented to part for ever   Page  155  Guilt boldly walked forward alone  to overtake fate  that went before in the shape of an executioner  but shame being naturally timorous  returned back to keep company with virtue  which  in the beginning of their journey  they had left behind  Thus  my children  after men have travelled through a few stages in vice  they no longer continue to have shame at doing evil  and shame attends only upon their virtues      Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XVI   The family use art  which is opposed with still greater   WHATEVER might have been Sophia s sensations  the rest of the family was easily consoled for Mr  Burchell s absence by the company of our landlord  whose visits now became more frequent and longer  Though he had been disappointed in procuring my daughters the amusements of the town  as he designed  he took every opportunity of supplying them with those little recreations which our retirement would admit of  He usually came in the morning  and while my son and I followed our occupations abroad  he sat with the family at home  and amused them by describing the town  with every part  Page  158  of which he was particularly acquainted  He could repeat all the observations that were retailed in the atmosphere of the play houses  and had all the good things of the high wits by rote long before they made way into the jest books  The intervals between coversation were employed in teaching my daughters piquet  or sometimes in setting my two little ones to box to make them sharp  as he called it  but the hopes of having him for a son in law  in some measure blinded us to all his defects  It must be owned that my wife laid a thousand schemes to entrap him  or  to speak it more tenderly  used every art to magnify the merit of her daughter  If the cakes at tea eat short and crisp  they were made by Olivia  if the gooseberry wine was well knit  the gooseberries were of her gathering  it was her fingers gave the pickles their peculiar green  and in the composition of a pudding  her judgment was infallible  Then the poor woman would sometimes tell the  Squire  that she thought him and Olivia  Page  159  extremely like each other  and would bid both stand up to see which was tallest  These instances of cunning  which she thought impenetrable  yet which every body saw through  were very pleasing to our benefactor  who gave every day some new proofs of his passion  which though they had not arisen to proposals of marriage  yet we thought fell but little short of it  and his slowness was attributed sometimes to native bashfulness  and sometimes to his fear of offending a rich uncle  An occurrence  however  which happened soon after  put it beyond a doubt that he designed to become one of the family  my wife even regarded it as an absolute promise   My wife and daughters happening to return a visit to neighbour Flamborough s  found that family had lately got their pictures drawn by a limner  who travelled the country  and did them for fifteen shillings a head  As this family and ours
