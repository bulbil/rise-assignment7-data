 Clarke should observe the motions of the trumpeter  whose province was to sound the charge to battle   Our knight agreed to these regulations  notwithstanding the earnest and pathetic remonstrances of the young lawyer  who  with tears in his eyes  conjured all the combatants  in their turns  to refrain from an action that might be attended with bloodshed and murder  and was contrary to the laws both of God and man  In vain he endeavoured to move them by tears and entreaties  by threatening them with prosecutions in this world  and pains and penalties in the next  They persisted in their resolution  and his uncle would have begun hostilities on his carcase  had he not been prevented by Sir Launcelot  who exhorted Clarke to retire from the field  that he might not be involved in the consequences of the combat  He relished this advice so well  that he had actually moved off to some distance  but his apprehensions and concern for his friends co operating with an insatiable curiosity  detained him in sight of the engagement   The two knights having fairly divided the ground  and the same precautions being taken by the seconds on another part of the field  Sycamore began to be invaded with some scruples  which were probably engendered by the martial appearance and well known character of his antagonist  The confidence which he derived from the reluctance of Sir Launcelot now vanished  because it plainly appeared  that the knight s backwardness was not owing to personal timidity  and he foresaw that the prosecution of this joke might be attended with very serious consequences to his own life and reputation  He therefore desired a parley  in which he observed his affection for Miss Darnel was of such a delicate nature  that  should the discomfiture of his rival contribute to make her unhappy  his victory must render him the most miserable wretch upon earth  He proposed  therefore  that her sentiments and choice should be ascertained before they proceeded to extremity   Sir Launcelot declared that he was much more afraid of combating Aurelia s inclination  than of opposing the knight of the Griffin in arms  and that if he had the least reason to think Mr  Sycamore  or any other person  was distinguished by her preference  he would instantly give up his suit as desperate  At the same time  he observed  that Sycamore had proceeded too far to retract  that he had insulted a gentleman  and not only challenged  but even pursued him  and blocked up his passage in the public highway  outrages which he  Sir Launcelot  would not suffer to pass unpunished  Accordingly  he insisted on the combat  on pain of treating Sycamore as a craven  and a recreant  This declaration was reinforced by Dawdle  who told him  that  should he now decline the engagement  all the world would look upon him as an infamous poltroon   These two observations gave a necessary fillip to the courage of the challenger  The parties took their stations  The trumpet sounded to charge  and the combatants began their career with great impetuosity â€” Whether the gleam of Sir Launcelot s arms affrighted Mr  Sycamore s steed  or some other object had an unlucky effect on his eyesight  certain it is he started at about midway  and gave his rider such a violent shake as discomposed his attitude  and disabled him from using his lance to the best advantage  Had our hero continued his career  with his lance couched  in all probability Sycamore s armour would have proved but a bad defence to his carcase  but Sir Launcelot perceiving his rival s spear unrested  had just time to throw up the point of his own  when the two horses closed with such a shock  that Sycamore  already wavering in the saddle  was overthrown  and his armour crashed around him as he fell   The victor  seeing him lie without motion  alighted immediately and began to unbuckle his helmet  in which office he was assisted by the trumpeter  When the headpiece was removed  the hapless knight of the Griffin appeared in the pale livery of death  though he was only in a swoon  from which he soon recovered by the effect of the fresh air  and the aspersion of cold water  brought from a small pool in the neighbourhood  When he recognised his conqueror doing the offices of humanity about his person  he closed his eyes from vexation  told Sir Launcelot that his was the fortune of the day  though he himself owed his mischance to the fault of his own horse  and observed  that this ridiculous affair would not have happened  but for the mischievous instigation of that scoundrel Dawdle  on whose ribs he threatened to revenge this mishap   Perhaps Captain Crowe might have saved him the trouble  had the wag honourably adhered to the institutions of chivalry  in his conflict with our novice  But on this occasion  his ingenuity was more commendable than his courage  He had provided at the inn a blown bladder  in which several smooth pebbles were enclosed  and this he slyly fixed on the head of his pole  when the captain obeyed the signal of battle  Instead of bearing the brunt of the encounter  he turned out of the straight line  so as to avoid the lance of his antagonist  and
