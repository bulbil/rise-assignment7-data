render it capable of perfect Happiness  is  in my Opinion  a Doctrine agreeable to metaphysical Philosophy  reconcileable to the Nature of Things  to the eternal Laws of God  and likewise vindicates him from the Charge of Vengeance or Partiality  as the whole Consequences seem to proceed from the original Formation of Things   From all which Reasoning  I shall venture to conclude against eternal Punishments  For  in the first Instance  at the Fall  even temporary ones are not threatened in futuro  and  in the second Instance  at Man s Redemption  if they became so then  how many wretched Souls would be Losers by the Bargain  and Christ Page  337 may be said to have overcome Death only  by his Sacrifice  but not to have conquered Sin   These few Thoughts occurring to me  when I sat down to write  have obliged me to defer my Promise in my last   till the next Post   Adieu   Henry   LETTER CCCXIX   My Dear FANNY   I AM now retired from the Grand Jury  to perform a Promise I have delayed for some Posts  and think an Assizes a proper Time to discourse about Judgment to come   When I first entered upon this Subject  I own I trembled  as Felix did  for fear of the Consequence of my Doctrine  therefore I canvassed the Matter a good deal in my own Mind  before I ventured to treat upon it even to you  tho  I was perfectly certain that the Notion of eternal Misery could not add any thing to the Strength of your Virtue  tho  it might  perhaps  take away somewhat of the Merit of it  The Reasons  then  which suffered me to proceed  were these   If I argued justly  which I endeavoured to do  I cannot apprehend any ill Consequence from Page  338 my Subject  Truth cannot injure Truth  and Error is not necessary to bring about the Ends or Designs of Providence   I do not say that the Propitiation of our Saviour was self sufficient to redeem us totally  but that it did not leave us in a worse State under the Gospel  than it found us under the Law   which  with regard to the many  it would have done  upon this Doctrine   and only enabled us to work out our own Salvation  but I do not think it has limited the Time   I think that the severe Divines endeavour to prove too much  For  as there is no proportional Justice in eternal Misery  Men may suspect the whole Scheme  from one Flaw  to be but a pious Fraud to deter from Vice  but  when Misery is taught to be the natural Consequence of Vice  Damnation may appear to be unavoidable  unless the Great  Immutable Being shall contradict his eternal Laws  which is absurd  and still less to be expected in Favour of a Sinner   The Terror of eternal Torments either drives Men to Despair  and so does more Harm than Good  or is balanced by the Hope of Mercy  in Proportion to it s Fear  and so is destroyed   A Man would certainly  with more Prudence  put himself into the Power of a provoked Enemy  than expose himself naked to an easterly Wind  Page  339 because  in one Case  something might be hoped from Generosity and Mercy  but  in the other  he must expect the natural Consequence of his Indiscretion and Folly   I think the Doctrine  as it stands in the Orthodoxy  savours too much of human Politics  and the mixing profane with sacred Things has often a dangerous Tendency   Some Divines argue very unfairly  and uncomfortably too  upon the Obligations of Man to Virtue  by attributing it to Hope and Fear  as if Rewards and Punishments were  as an Allay  necessary to make the too refined Idea of it permanent  and fit for Use  But surely the Love of Virtue is not Hope  nor is the Abhorrence of Vice  Fear  though these very distinct Ideas seem to be confounded by their Definition   I believe that any Man  who has observed the least upon the Motions of the human Mind  has  at several Times of his Life  perceived a certain Impulse to some Actions  and a Sort of Unwillingness to others  though both  in all human Appearance  indifferent in themselves  nay  sometimes these secret Intimations have moved us contrary to the most obvious Reason about such Things  but in a little Time perhaps the Genius of these intimate Directions has manifested itself in some remarkable Event Page  340 of our Lives  unforeseen  and improbable at that Time   Is it reasonable then to suppose that such Hints should be afforded us in Things merely relative to our Lives or Fortunes in this World  and that we should be left without some unerring Guide or Impulse with regard to Virtue  upon which our nobler Fortunes and immortal Lives depend  These inward Workings of the Spirit  this natural Consciousness  this Self evidence  which I have  at several Times  supposed in the Mind of Man  I am well convinced  have  in general  a stronger Effect toward the Influence of Virtue  than all the Art of Logic
