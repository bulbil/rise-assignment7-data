  will now come in from every part  so that we can never think of   keeping them up at their former prices          Can t you  so     answered the general    That shall be your   own fault  then  and your own loss  too  I can tell you  Let pro    visions come in as they will  no one shall sell an ounce here without   our permission  and that shall be on our own terms  you may be   assured  Our hands are not tied up by laws  Ours is a military   government  in which we can do what we please  without being   accountable to anyone  So you may go on as before          But  gentlemen    replied my master    you should consider that         328 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     the   vhole odium of this will fall upon me  as you do not appear in   it  so that I shall lose my character for ever          Your character   Ha   ha   ha     interrupted the general      a sutler s character   I shall never be able to bear the word again    Pray  my good friend  what character had a sutler ever to lose    that would not be a greater loss to the finder   Come  here s my   service to you  Go on with your business  and make money  and   never fear suffering by the loss of your character  It is time for   us to go and settle what taxes we shall lay upon the different kinds   of merchandise that shall be brought here  Our duties shall be   paid  as well as those of any king of them all  This is our reign    and if we do not make the most of it  we have no one to blame but   ourselves          And as rich as so many kings you will be    said my master      if you can carry off things in the manner you say          As to our being rich    returned the admiral    that depends   entirely upon our own management  Our principals  indeed  will   be rich enough  which is all they care for   not what becomes of us    whom they would have do their business for nothing  or next to it    But they shall find themselves mistaken  Everything must   go through our hands  and gold in handling will stick to the   fingers  as the song says  We shall feather our nests in spite   of them  They cannot do without us  and will hardly be fond   of calling us to too strict an account  for fear of our telling   tales  To be sure  the great harvest will be their s   but we will   take toll          I don t doubt but you will    said my master    twice over  for   fear of mistake  as the miller does  Why  you ll make such fortunes   that you won t know what to do with yourselves          Never fear that    answered the general    We shall not be at   a loss  Tor my part  I design to buy a borough  and push my   fortune in parliament  That s the genteelest business a gentleman   can follow now  and the readiest way of advancing in life and   making a family          Now  I think otherwise    said the admiral    and that it is the   most ungenteel way   such dirty jobs are required for everything a   man gets  that it is iDcneath a gentleman to do them  My scheme   is to buy an Irish peerage at once  and then live splendidly  without   troubling myself about anything  Or  if I should grow tired of   idleness  go into parliament there  and turn patriot  and make   speeches for the good of my country         Both your schemes may be very good    said my master    but   my ambition is not so high as either  at least as yet  I will try to   get a contract  and then I shall not fear making a fortune sufficient   to do what you propose  or more if I choose it  without being sneered   at for my folly  You may say what you will  but there is more    to be got by a contract than by every other way  and
