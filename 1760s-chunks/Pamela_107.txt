I could raise myself on my staggering feet  and away   limped I   What to do  but to throw myself into the pond  and so put a   period to all my griefs in this world   But  O  to find them infinitely   aggravated  had I not  by the divine grace  been withheld  in a   miserable eternity  As I have escaped this temptation   blessed be God   for it   I will tell you my conflicts on this dreadful occasion  that   the divine mercies may be magnified in my deliverance  that I am yet on   this side the dreadful gulf  from which there could have been no return       It was well for me  as I have since thought  that I was so maimed  as   made me the longer before I got to the water  for this gave me time to   consider  and abated the impetuousness of my passions  which possibly   might otherwise have hurried me  in my first transport of grief   on my   seeing no way to escape  and the hard usage I had reason to expect from   my dreadful keepers   to throw myself in  But my weakness of body   made me move so slowly  that it gave time  as I said  for a little   reflection  a ray of grace  to dart in upon my benighted mind  and so    when I came to the pond side  I sat myself down on the sloping bank  and   began to ponder my wretched condition  and thus I reasoned with myself       Pause here a little  Pamela  on what thou art about  before thou takest   the dreadful leap  and consider whether there be no way yet left  no   hope  if not to escape from this wicked house  yet from the mischiefs   threatened thee in it       I then considered  and  after I had cast about in my mind every thing   that could make me hope  and saw no probability  a wicked woman  devoid   of all compassion  a horrid helper  just arrived  in this dreadful   Colbrand  an angry and resenting master  who now hated me  and   threatened the most afflicting evils  and that I should  in all   probability  be deprived even of the opportunity  I now had before   me  to free myself from all their persecutions   What hast thou to do    distressed creature  said I to myself  but throw thyself upon a merciful   God   who knows how innocently I suffer   to avoid the merciless   wickedness of those who are determined on my ruin       And then  thought I   and oh  that thought was surely of the devil s   instigation  for it was very soothing  and powerful with me   these   wicked wretches  who now have no remorse  no pity on me  will then be   moved to lament their misdoings  and when they see the dead corpse of   the unhappy Pamela dragged out to these dewy banks  and lying breathless   at their feet  they will find that remorse to soften their obdurate   heart  which  now  has no place there   And my master  my angry master    will then forget his resentments  and say  O  this is the unhappy   Pamela  that I have so causelessly persecuted and destroyed  Now do   I see she preferred her honesty to her life  will he say  and is no   hypocrite  nor deceiver  but really was the innocent creature she   pretended to be  Then  thought I  will he  perhaps  shed a few tears   over the poor corpse of his persecuted servant  and though he may give   out  it was love and disappointment  and that  perhaps   in order to   hide his own guilt   for the unfortunate Mr  Williams  yet will he be   inwardly grieved  and order me a decent funeral  and save me  or rather   this part of me  from the dreadful stake  and the highway interment    and the young men and maidens all around my dear father s will pity poor   Pamela  But  O  I hope I shall not be the subject of their ballads and   elegies  but that my memory  for the sake of my dear father and mother    may quickly slide into oblivion       I was once rising  so indulgent was I to this sad way of thinking  to   throw myself in  But  again  my bruises made me slow  and I thought    What art thou about to do  wretched Pamela  How knowest thou  though the   prospect be all dark to thy short sighted eye  what God may do for thee    even when
