fortitude was borne down  and his hopes were   rooted up  no principles remained to regulate his conduct  but all was   phrensy  confusion  and despair  He rushed out of the cave with a   furious and distracted look  and went in haste towards the city  without   having formed any design  or considered any consequence that might   follow       The shadows of the mountains were now lengthened by the declining sun    and the approach of evening had invited OMAR to meditate in a grove    that was adjacent to the gardens of the palace  From this place he was   seen at some distance by HAMET  who came up to him with a hasty and   disordered pace  and OMAR drew back with a cold and distant reverence    which the power and the character of ALMORAN concurred to excite  HAMET    not reflecting upon the cause of this behaviour  was offended  and   reproached him with the want of that friendship he had so often   professed  the vehemence  of his expression and demeanor  suited well   with the appearance of ALMORAN  and OMAR  as the best proof of that   friendship which had been impeached  took this opportunity to repeat his   admonitions in the behalf of HAMET   What ever evil   said he   thou   canst bring upon HAMET  will be doubled to thyself  to his virtues  the   Power that fills infinitude is a friend  and he can be afflicted only   till they are perfect  but thy sufferings will be the punishment of   vice  and as long as thou are vicious they must increase       HAMET  who instantly recollected for whom he was mistaken  and the   anguish of whose mind was for a moment suspended by this testimony of   esteem and kindness  which could not possibly be feigned  and which was   paid him at the risque of life  when it could not be known that he   received it  ran forward to embrace the hoary sage  who had been the   guide of his youth  and cried out  in a voice that was broken by   contending passions   The face is the face of ALMORAN  but the heart is   the heart of HAMET        OMAR was struck dumb with astonishment  and HAMET  who was impatient to   be longer mistaken  related all the circumstances of his transformation    and reminded him of some particulars which could be known only to   themselves   Canst thou not yet believe   said he   that I am HAMET    when thou hast this day seen me banished from my kingdom  when thou hast   now met me a fugitive returning from the desert  and when I learnt from   thee  since the sun was risen which is not yet set  that more than   mortal powers were combined against me    I now believe   said OMAR     that thou  indeed  art HAMET    Stay me not then   said HAMET   but   come with me to revenge    Beware   said OMAR   lest thou endanger the   loss of more than empire and ALMEIDA    If not to revenge   said HAMET     I may at least be permitted to punish    Thy mind   says OMAR   is now   in such a state  that to punish the crimes by which thou hast been   wronged  will dip thee in the guilt of blood  Why else are we forbidden   to take vengeance for ourselves  and why is it reserved as the   prerogative of the Most High  In Him  and in Him alone  it is goodness   guided by wisdom  He approves the means  only as necessary to the end    He wounds only to heal  and destroys only to save  He has complacence    not in the evil  but in the good only which it is appointed to produce    Remember  therefore  that he  to whom the punishment of another is   sweet  though his act may be just with respect to others  with respect   to himself it is a deed of darkness  and abhorred by the Almighty     HAMET  who had stood abstracted in the contemplation of the new injury   he had suffered  while OMAR was persuading him not to revenge it    started from his posture in all the wildness of distraction  and   bursting away from OMAR  with an ardent and furious look hasted toward   the palace  and was soon out of sight                CHAP  XV          In the mean time  ALMORAN  after having effected the transformation  was   met  as he was going to the apartment of ALMEIDA  by Osmyn  Osmyn had
