 danced  cursed  blasphemed  and   29 acted to the life  the part of a frantick bedlamite  When the lieutenant thought himself sufficiently revenged  he took his leave of him in these words    Now  friend  you ll remember me the longest day you have to live—I have given you a lesson  that will let you know what flogging is  and teach you to have more sympathy for the future—shout  boys  shout  —  This ceremony was no sooner over  than my uncle proposed they should quit the school  and convoy their old comrade Rory to a public house  about a mile from the village  where he would treat them all —This offer being joyfully embraced  he addressed himself to Mr Syntax  and begged him to accompany us  which he refused with great disdain  telling my benefactor  that he was not the man he took him to be—   Well  well  old surly  replied my uncle  shaking his hand  thou art an honest fellow notwithstanding  and if ever I have the command of a ship  thou shalt be school master  i  faith    So saying  he dismissed the boys  and locking the door  left the two preceptors to console one another  while we moved forwards on our journey  attended by a numerous retinue  whom he treated according to his promise —We parted with many tears  and lay that night at an inn on the road  about ten miles short of the town where I was to remain  at which we arrived next day  and I found I had no cause to complain of the accommodations provided for me  being boarded at the house of an apothecary  who had married a distant relation of my mother  In a few days after  my uncle set out for his ship  after having settled the necessary funds for my maintenance and education       30  CHAP  VI   I make great progress in my studies—am caressed by every body—my female cousins take notice of me—I reject their invitation—they are incensed and conspire against me—I am left destitute by a misfortune that befals my uncle—Gawky s treachery—my revenge   AS I was now capable of reflection  I began to consider my precarious situation  that I was utterly abandoned by those whose duty it was to protect me  and that my sole dependance was on the generosity of one man  who was not only exposed by his profession  to continual dangers  which might one day deprive me of him for ever  but also  no doubt  subject to those vicissitudes of disposition  which a change of fortune usually creates  or  which a better acquaintance with the world might produce —for I always ascribed his benevolence to the dictates of a heart as yet undebauched by a commerce with mankind —Alarmed at these considerations  I resolved to apply myself with great care to my studies  and enjoy the opportunity in my power  This I did with such success  that in the space of three years  I understood Greek very well  was pretty far advanced in the mathematics  and no stranger to moral and natural philosophy  logick I made no account of  but above all things  I valued myself on my taste in the Belle Lettre   31 and a talent for poetry  which had already produced some morceaus  that brought me a great deal of reputation  These qualifications added to a good face and shape  acquired the esteem and acquaintance of the most considerable people in town  and I had the satisfaction to find myself in some degree of favour with the ladies  an intoxicating piece of good fortune  to one of my amorous complexion  which I obtained  or at least preserved  by gratifying their propensity to scandal  in lampooning their rivals —Two of my female cousins lived in this place  with their mother  after the death of their father  who left his whole fortune  which was considerable  equally divided between them  so that if they were not the most beautiful  they were at least the richest toasts in town  and received daily the addresses of all the beaux and cavaliers of the country —Although I had hitherto been looked upon by them with the most supercilious contempt  which I endeavoured to return by the most perfect neglect  my character now attracted their notice so much  that I was given to understand  I might be honoured with their acquaintance  if I pleased —The reader will easily perceive  that this condescension either flowed from the hope of making my poetical capacity subservient to their malice  or at least of screening themselves from the lash of my resentment  which they effectually provoked —I enjoyed this triumph with great rapture  and not only rejected their offer with disdain  but  in all my performances  whether satire or panegyric  industriously avoided mentioning their names  even while I celebrated those of their intimates  which mortified their pride exceedingly  and incensed them to such a degree    32 that they rendered themselves universally ridiculous in satisfying their resentment against me —The first stroke of their revenge consisted in their hiring a poor collegian to write verses against me  the subject of which was my own poverty  and the catastrophe of my unhappy parents  but besides the badness of the composition  of which they themselves were
