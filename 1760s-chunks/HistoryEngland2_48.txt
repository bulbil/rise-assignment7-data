 and pursuing them closely they led him to their main fleet  which  before noon  he perceived in line of battle  amounting  in all  to twenty seven sail  At sight of the English fleet  the Spanish fleet  though superior in numbers  attempted to sail away  as the English had  for some time  acquired such expertness in naval affairs  that no other nation would venture to face them  except with manifest advantage on their side  The Spaniards seemed distracted in their councils  and acted with extreme confusion  they made a running fight  but notwithstanding what they could do  all but three were taken  The admiral  during this engagement  acted with equal prudence and resolution  and the King wrote him a letter with his own hand  approving his conduct  This victory necessarily produced the resentment and complaints of the Spanish ministers at all the courts of Europe  which induced England to declare war with Spain  and the Regent of France joined England in a similar declaration  The Duke of Ormond now  once more  hoped  by the assistance of Cardinal Alberoni  the Spanish minister  to restore the pretender in England  He accordingly set sail with some troops  and proceeded as far as Cape Finisterre  where his fleet was dispersed  and disabled by a violent storm  which entirely frustrated the armament  and  from this time  the pretender seemed to lose all hopes of being received in England  This blow of fortune  together with the bad success of the Spanish arms in Sicily and elsewhere  once more induced them to wish for peace  and the King of Spain was at last contented to sign the quadruple alliance     129 King George having thus  with equal vigour and deliberation  surmounted all the obstacles he met with in his way to the throne  and used every precaution that sagacity could suggest  for securing himself in it  again returned to England  where the addresses from both houses were as loyal as he could expect  From addressing they turned to an object of the greatest importance  namely  that of securing the dependency of the Irish parliament upon that of Great Britain  Maurice Annesly had appealed to the house of Peers in England  from a decree of the house of Peers in Ireland  which was reversed  The British Peers ordered the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland  to put Mr  Annesly in possession of the lands he had lost by the decree in that kingdom  The Barons obeyed this order  and the Irish house of Peers passed a vote against them  as having attempted to diminish the just privileges of the parliament of Ireland  and  at the same time  ordered the Barons to be taken under the custody of the Black Rod  On the other hand  the house of Lords in England resolved  that the Barons of the Exchequer in Ireland had acted with courage and fidelity  and addressed the King to signify his approbation of their conduct  by some marks of his favour  To complete their intention  a bill was prepared  by which the Irish house of Lords was deprived of all rights of final jurisdiction  This was opposed in both houses  In the lower house Mr  Pitt asserted  that it would only increase the power of the English Peers  who already had too much  Mr  Hungerford demonstrated that the Irish Lords had always exerted their power of finally deciding causes  The Duke of Leeds produced fifteen reasons against the bill  but  notwithstanding all opposition  it was carried by a great majority  and received the royal assent  The kingdom of Ireland was not  at that time  so well acquainted with the nature of iberty  and its own constitution  as it is at present    130 Their house of Lords might then consist mostly of men bred up in luxury and ignorance  neither spirited enough to make opposition  nor skilful enough to conduct it   But this blow  which the Irish felt severely  was not so great as that which England now began to suffer from that spirit of avarice and chicanery which had infected almost all ranks of people  In the year 1720  John Law  a Scotchman  had erected a company in France under the name of the Missisippi  which  at first  promised the deluded people immense wealth  but too soon appeared an imposture  and left the greatest part of that nation in ruin and distress  The year following the people of England were deceived by just such another project  which is remembered by all by the name of the South Sea scheme  and  to this day  felt by thousands  To explain this as concisely as possible  it is to be observed  that ever since the revolution  the government  not having sufficient supplies granted by parliament  or  what was granted requiring time to be collected  they were obliged to borrow money from several different companies of merchants  and  among the rest  from that company which traded to the South Sea  In the year 1716  they were indebted to this company about nine millions and an half of money  for which they granted annually at the rate of six per cent  interest  As this company was not the only one  to which the government was debtor  and paid
