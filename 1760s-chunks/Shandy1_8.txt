was generally this  that his horse was either clapp d  or spavin d  or greaz d —or he was twitter bon d  or broken winded  or something  in short  or other had befallen him which would let him carry no flesh —so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get rid of —and a good horse to purchase in his stead   What the loss in such a balance might amount to  communibus annis  I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same traffic  to determine —but let it be what it would  the honest gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur  till at length  by repeated ill accidents of the kind  he found it necessary to take the thing under consideration  and upon weighing the whole  and summing it up  Page  44  in his mind  he found it not only disproportion d to his other expences  but withall so heavy an article in itself  as to disable him from any other act of generosity in his parish  Besides this he considered  that with half the sum thus galloped away  he could do ten times as much good —and what still weighed more with him than all other considerations put together  was this  that it confined all his charity into one particular channel  and where  as he fancied  it was the least wanted  namely  to the child bearing and child getting part of his parish  reserving nothing for the impotent —nothing for the aged —nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called forth to visit  where poverty  and sickness  and affliction dwelt together   Page  45  For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence  and there appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of it —and these were  either to make it an irrevocable law never more to lend his steed upon any application whatever —or else be content to ride the last poor devil  such as they had made him  with all his aches and infirmities  to the very end of the chapter   As he dreaded his own constancy in the first —he very chearfully betook himself to the second  and tho  he could very well have explain d it  as I said  to his honour —yet  for that very reason  he had a spirit above it  choosing rather to bear the contempt of his enemies  and the laughter of his friends  than undergo the pain of telling a story  which might seem a panegyric upon himself   Page  46  I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of this reverend gentleman  from this single stroke in his character  which I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight of La Mancha  whom  by the bye  with all his follies  I love more  and would actually have gone further to have paid a visit to  than the greatest hero of antiquity   But this is not the moral of my story  The thing I had in view was to shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair —For you must know  that so long as this explanation would have done the parson credit —the devil a soul could find it out —I suppose his enemies would not  and that his friends could not —But no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife  and pay the expences of  Page  47  the ordinary s licence to set her up —but the whole secret came out  every horse he had lost  and two horses more than ever he had lost  with all the circumstances of their destruction  were known and distinctly remembered —The story ran like wild fire — The parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him  and he was going to be well mounted once again in his life  and if it was so   twas plain as the sun at noon day  he would pocket the expence of the licence  ten times told the very first year —so that every body was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity    What were his views in this  and in every other action of his life —or rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains of other people concerning it   Page  48  was a thought which too much floated in his own  and too often broke in upon his rest  when he should have been sound asleep   About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made entirely easy upon that score —it being just so long since he left his parish —and the whole world at the same time behind him —and stands accountable to a judge of whom he will have no cause to complain   But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men  Order them as they will  they pass thro  a certain medium which so twists and refracts them from their true directions—that  with all the titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give  the doers of them are  Page  49  nevertheless forced to live and die without it   Of the truth of which this gentleman was a painful example —But to know by what means this came to pass —and to make that knowledge of
