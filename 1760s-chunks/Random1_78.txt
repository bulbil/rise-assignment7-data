to throw me into a swoon  out of which I was recovered by a tweak of the nose  administred by the tar who stood centinel over us  who at the same time regaled me with a draught of flip  and comforted me with the hopes of being put on board of the Thunder next day  where I would be freed from handcuffs  and cured of my wounds by the doctor —I no sooner heard him name the Thunder  than I asked  if he had belonged to that ship long  and he giving me to understand  he had belonged to her five years    221 I enquired if he knew lieutenant Bowling —   Know lieutenant Bowling  said he —odds my life  and that I do —and a good seaman he is  as ever stept upon forecastle —and a brave fellow as ever crackt bisket —none of your Guinea pigs —nor your fresh water  wishy washy  fair weather fowls —Many a taught gale of wind has honest Tom Bowling and I weathered together —Here s his health with all my heart  where ever he is  a loft or alow—in heaven or in hell—all s one for that—he needs not be ashamed to shew himself  —  I was so much affected with this elogium  that I could not refrain from telling him  I was lieutenant Bowling s kinsman  at which he expressed an inclination to serve me  and when he was relieved brought some cold boiled beef in a platter and biscuit  on which we supped plentifully  and afterwards drank another can of flip together  While we were thus engaged  he recounted a great many exploits of my uncle  who  I found  was very much beloved by the ship s company  and pitied for the misfortune that happened to him in Hispaniola  which I was very glad to be informed was not so great as I imagined  for captain Oakhum had recovered of his wounds  and actually at that time  commanded the ship  Having by accident  in my pocket my uncle s letter written from Port Louis  I gave it my benefactor  whose name was Jack Rattlin  for his perusal  but honest Jack told me frankly  he could not read  and desired to know the contents  which I immediately communicated  When he heard that part of it  in which  he says  he had wrote to his landlord in Deal  he cried    Body o  me  that was old   222 Ben  Block —he was dead before the letter came to hand —Ey  ey  had Ben been alive  lieutenant Bowling would have had no occasion to sculk so long —Honest Ben was the first man that taught him to hand  reef and steer —Well  well  we must all die  that s certain —we must all come to port sooner or later —at sea or on shore  we must be fast moored one day —death s like the best bower anchor  as the saying is  it will bring us all up  —  I could not but signify my approbation of the justness of Jack s reflections  and enquired into the occasion of the quarrel between captain Oakhum and my uncle  which he explained in this manner —   Captain Oakhum  to be sure  is a good man enough —besides  he s my commander —but what s that to me —I do my duty  and value no man s anger of a rope s end —Now the report goes  as how he is a lord s  or baron knight s brother  whereby  d ye see me  he carries a strait arm  and keeps a loof from his officers  thof  may hap  they may be as good men in the main as he  Now we lying at anchor in Tuberoon bay  lieutenant Bowling had the middle watch  and as he always kept a good look out  he made  d ye see  three lights in the offing  whereby he run down to the great cabbin for orders  and found the captain asleep —whereupon he waked him  which put him in a main high passion  and he swore woundily at the lieutenant  and called him lousy Scotch son of a whore   for I being then centinel in the steerage  heard all  and swab and swabbard  whereby the lieutenant returned the salute  and they jawed together fore and   223 aft a good spell  till at last the captain turned out  and laying hold of a rattan  came athwart Mr  Bowling s quarter  whereby he told the captain  that if he was not his commander  he would heave him over board  and demanded satisfaction a shore  whereby in the morning watch  the captain went ashore in the pinnace  and afterwards the lieutenant carried the cutter a shore  and so they  leaving the boats crews on their oars  went away together  and so  d ye see  in less than a quarter of an hour we heard firing  whereby we made for the place  and found the captain lying wounded on the beach  and so brought him on board to the doctor  who cured him in less than six weeks  But the lieutenant clapt on all the sail he could bear  and had got far enough a head before we knew any thing of the matter
