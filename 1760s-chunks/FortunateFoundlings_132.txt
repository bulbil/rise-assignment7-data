     You know  said she  that on the late death of my father  his estate   devolved on my brother  an officer in those troops in Italy commanded by   the prince of Conti   some wounds  which were looked upon as extremely   dangerous  obliged him  when the campaign was over  to continue in his   winter quarters   on which he sent to monsieur the count to take   possession in his name  this was done  but an intricate affair relating   to certain sums lodged in a person s hand  and to be brought before the   parliament of Paris  could not be decided without the presence either of   him or myself who had been witness of the transaction   I was extremely   loth to take so long a journey  being then in very ill health  and   hearing he was recovered  delayed it  as we then expected him in   person   I sent a special messenger  however  in order to hasten his   return   but instead of complying with my desires  I received a letter   from him  acquainting me that a business of more moment to him than any   thing in my power to guess at  required his presence in another place    and insisted  by all the tenderness which had ever been between us  that   I would take on myself the management of this affair   to enable me the   better to do it  he sent me a deed of trust to act as I should find it   most expedient       As he did not let me into the secret of what motives detained him at so   critical a juncture  I was at first very much surprized  but on asking   some questions of the messenger I had sent to him  I soon discovered   what it was  He told me that on his arrival  he found my brother had   left his quarters and was gone to Bolognia  on which he followed and   overtook him there   that he appeared in the utmost discontent  and was   just preparing to proceed to Leghorn  but did not mention to him any   more than he did in his letter to me  what inducement he had to this   journey   his servant  however  told him privately  that the mystery was   this   That being passionately in love with a young English lady  whom   he had placed in a monastery at Bolognia  and expected to find there at   his return  she had in his absence departed  without having acquainted   him with her design  and that supposing she was gone for England  and   unable to live without her  his intention was to take shipping for that   country  and make use of his utmost efforts to find her out       I must confess  pursued the beautiful countess  this piece of quixotism   very much veved me   I thought his friends in France deserved more from   him than to be neglected for one who fled from him  and who  as the man   said  he knew not whether he should be able ever to see again  I   resolved  however  to comply with his desires  and came immediately to   Paris  but heaven has shewed him how little it approves his giving me   this unnecessary trouble  for this morning I received a letter from him    that meeting with robbers in his way  they had taken from him all his   money and bills of exchange  besides wounding him in several places  so   that he cannot proceed on his journey till his hurts  which it seems are   not dangerous  are cured  and he has fresh remittances from hence       With what emotions the heart of Louisa was agitated during the latter   part of this little narrative  a sensible reader may easily conceive    from the first mention of Bolognia  where there was no other English   pensioner than herself  she knew it must be no other than her dear du   Plessis who was in search for her abroad  while she was vainly hoping to   find him at home   every circumstance rendered this belief more certain    and surprize and joy worked so strongly in her  that fearing the effects   would be visible  she rose up and withdrew to a window  Mademoiselle   Charlotta  who knew she could not be capable of such an act of   unpoliteness  without being compelled to it  asked if she were not   well   on which Louisa entreated pardon  but owned a sudden faintness   had come over her spirits  so that she was obliged to be rude in order   to prevent being troublesome       As mademoiselle Charlotta knew nothing of her story  she had no farther   thought about it than of some little qualm  which frequently happens   when young ladies are
