inquired where Don Annibal resided  then  promising that we should hear from him on the following day  he vanished without informing us what he meant to do  or even telling us whether he belonged to the Duke of Lerma s household  I was curious to know what this Pedrillo was  whose turn of mind appeared to be so brisk and active  He is a brave lad  said the captain  who waited on me some years ago  but finding me out at elbows  went away in search of a better service  There was no offence to me in all that  it is very natural to change when one cannot be worse off  The creature is pleasant enough  not deficient in parts  and happy in a spirit of intrigue which would wheedle with the devil  But notwithstanding all his fine pretence  I am not sanguine in my reckoning on the zeal he has just testified for me  Perhaps  said I  there may be some plausibility in his designs  Should he be a retainer  for example  to any of the duke s principal officers  it will be in his power to serve you  You have lived too long in the world not to know that in great houses everything is done by party and cabal  that the masters are governed by two or three upper servants about their persons  who  in their turn  are governed by that multitude of menials attendant upon them   On the next morning we saw Pedrillo at our breakfast table  Gentlemen  said he  if I did not explain myself yesterday as to my means of serving Captain Chinchilla  it was because we were not in a place where such a communication could be made with safety  Besides  I was disposed to ascertain whether the thing was feasible  before you were made parties in it  Understand  then  that I am the confidential servant of Signor Don Rodrigo de Calderona  the Duke of Lerma s first secretary  My master  who is much addicted to women  goes almost every evening to sup with a little Arragonian nightingale  whom he keeps in a cage near the purlieus of the court  She is quite a young girl from Albarazin  a most lovely creature  She has some wit as well as beauty  and sings enchantingly  they call her the Spanish Syren  I am the bearer of some tender inquiries every morning  and am just come from her  I have proposed to her to pass off Signor Don Annibal for her uncle  and the object of the forgery is to engage her lover in his interests  She is very willing to lend her aid in the business  Besides some little commission to which she looks forward on the profits  it will tickle her vanity to be taken for the niece of a military man   Signor de Chinchilla looked very grim at this suggestion  He declared his extreme abhorrence of becoming a party concerned in a mere swindling trick  and still more of adopting a female adventurer  no better than she should be  into his family  and thus casting a stain upon its immaculate purity  It was not only for himself that he felt all this soreness  there was a recoil of ignominy on his ancestors  which would lay their honours level with the dust  This morbid delicacy seemed out of season to Pedrillo  who could not help expressing his contempt of it thus  You must surely be out of your wits to take the matter up on that footing  A fine market you bring your morals to  you dictators from the plough  with your ridiculous squeamishness  Now you seem a good sensible man  appealing to me as he spoke these last words  Can you believe your ears when you hear such scruples advanced  Heaven defend us  At court  of all the places in the world  to look at morals through a microscope  Let fortune come under what haggard form she may  they hug her in their arms  and swear she is a beauty   My way of thinking was precisely with Pedrillo  and we dinned it so stoutly into both the captain s ear  as to make him the Spanish Syren s uncle against nature and inclination  When we had so far prevailed over his pride  we all three set about drawing up a new memorial for the minister  which was revised  with a copious interlacing of additions and corrections  I then wrote it out fair  and Pedrillo carried it to the Arragonian chauntress  who that very evening put it into the hands of Signor Don Rodrigo  telling her story so artlessly that the secretary  really supposing her the captain s niece  promised to take up his case  A few days afterwards we reaped the fruits of our little project  Pedrillo came back to our house with the lofty air of a benefactor  Good news  said he to Chinchilla  The king is going to make a new grant of officers  places  and pensions  nor will your name be forgotten in the list  But I am specially commissioned to inquire what present you purpose making to the Spanish Syren  for the piper must be paid  As to myself  I vow and protest that I will not take a farthing  the pleasure of having contributed to patch up my old master s broken fortunes  is more
