my hope  and representing my unhappy situation in the right point of view  In vain did I fly for refuge to the amusements of the place  and engage in the parties of Jackson  at cards  billiards  nine pins  and fives  a train of melancholy thoughts took possession of my soul  which even the conversation of Melopoyn could not divert —I ordered Strap to inquire every day at Banter s lodgings  in expectation of hearing again from my charmer  and my disappointment considerably augmented any chagrin —My affectionate valet was infected with my sorrow  and often sat with me whole hours without speaking  uttering sigh for sigh  and shedding tear for tear —This fellowship increased our distemper  he became incapable of business  and was discarded by his master  while I seeing my money melt away  without any certainty of deliverance  and in short  all my hopes frustrated  grew negligent of life  lost all appetite  and degenerated into such a sloven  that during the space of two months  I was neither washed  shifted nor shaved  so that my face rendered meagre with abstinence  was obscured with dirt  and overshadowed with hair  and my whole appearance squalid and even frightful  when  one day  Strap brought me notice  that there was a   305 man below who wanted to speak with me  Roused at this intelligence  and in full hope of receiving a letter from the dear object of my love  I run down stairs with the utmost precipitation  and found  to my infinite surprize  my generous uncle Mr  Bowling  Transported at the sight  I sprung forward to embrace him  Upon which he started aside with great agility  drew his hanger  and put himself upon his guard  crying     Avast  brother  avast  sheer off—Yo ho  you turnkey  why don t you keep a better look out  here s one of your crazy prisoners broke from his lashings  I do suppose  —  I could not help laughing heartily at his mistake  which I soon rectified by my voice  which he instantly recollected  and shook me by the hand with great affection  testifying his concern at seeing me in such a miserable condition     I conducted him to my apartment  where  in presence of Strap  whom I introduced to him as one of my best friends  he let me know  that he was just arrived from the coast of Guinea  after having made a pretty successful voyage  in which he had acted as mate  until the ship was attacked by a French privateer  that the captain being killed during the engagement  he had taken the command  and was so fortunate as to sink the enemy  after which he fell in with a merchant ship from Martinico  laden with sugar  indigo  and some silver  and by virtue of his letter of marque  attacked  took  and brought her safe into Kinsale in Ireland  where she was condemned as a lawful prize  by which means  he had not only got a pretty sum of money  but also acquired the favour of his owners  who had already conferred upon him the command of a large ship    306 mounted with twenty nine pounders  ready to sail upon a very advantageous voyage  which he was not at liberty to discover—And he assured me  that it was with the greatest difficulty he had found me  in consequence of a direction left for him at his lodgings in Wapping  I was rejoiced beyond measure  at this account of his good fortune  and  at his desire  recounted all the adventures that had happened to me since we parted —When he understood the particulars of Strap s attachment to me  he squeezed his hand very cordially  and promised to make a man of him  and giving me ten guineas for my present occasion  took a direction for the taylor who arrested me  and went away  in order to discharge the debt  telling me at parting  that he would soon fetch up all my lee way with a wet sail   I was utterly confounded at this sudden transition  which affected me more than any reverse I had formerly felt  and a crowd of incoherent ideas rushed so impetuously upon my imagination  that my reason could neither separate nor connect them  when Strap  whose joy had manifested itself in a thousand fooleries  came into my room with his shaving utensils  and without any previous intimation  began to lather my beard  whistling with great emotion all the while —I started from my reverie  and being too well acquainted with Strap  to trust myself in his hands while he was under such agitation  desired to be excused  sent for another barber  and suffered myself to be trimmed —Having performed the ceremony of ablution  I shifted  and dressing in my gayest apparel  waited for the return of my uncle  who was agreeably surprized at my sudden transformation     307 This beneficent kinsman had satisfied my creditor  and obtained an order for my discharge  so that I was no longer a prisoner  but as I had some reluctance to part with my friends and fellows in distress  I prevailed upon Mr  Bowling to favour us with his company  and invited Mr  Melopoyn and Jackson
