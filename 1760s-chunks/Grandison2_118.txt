some foreign Lady—  They had raised my hopes  and now  exciting my fears by so well grounded an apprehension  they were obliged for their pains to hold Lady L s salts to my nose  I could not help exposing myself  my heart having been weaken d too by their teazings before  My head dropt on the shoulder of Miss Grandison  Tears relieved me   I desired their pity  They assured me of their love  and called upon me  as I valued their friendship  to open my whole heart to them   I paused  I hesitated  For words did not immediately offer themselves  But at last  I said  Could I have thought myself intitled to your▪ excuse  Ladies  your Harriet  honoured  as she was  from the first  with the appellation of sister  would have had no reserve to her sisters  But a just consciousness of my wn unworthiness  overcame a temper that I will   295 say  is naturally frank and unreserved  Now  however—  There I stopt and held down my head   Lady L  Speak out  my dear —What Now—  Miss Gr  What Now  however—  Harriet  Thus called upon  thus encouraged—And I lifted up my head as boldly as I could  but it was not  I believe  very boldly  I will own  that the man  who by so signal an instance of his bravery and goodness engaged my gratitude  has possession of my whole heart   And then  almost unknowing what I did  I threw one of my arms  as I sat between them  round Lady L s neck  the other round Miss Grandison s  my glowing face seeking to hide itself in Lady L  s bosom   They both embraced me  and assured me of their united interest  They said  They knew I had also Dr  Bartlett s high regard  But that they had in vain sought to procure new lights from him  he constantly  in every thing that related to their brother  referring himself to him  And they assured me  that I had likewise the best wishes and Interest of Lord L  to the fullest extent   This  Lucy  is some—consolation—must I say —some ease to my pride  as to what the family think of me  But yet  how is that pride mortified  to be thus obliged to rejoice at this strengthening of hope to obtain an interest in the heart of a man  of whose engagements none of us know any thing  But if  at last  it shall prove  that that worthiest of hearts is disengaged  and if I can obtain an interest in it  be pride out of the question  The man  as my aunt wrote  is Sir Charles Grandison   I was very earnest to know  since my eyes had been such tell tales  if their brother had any suspicion of my regard for him   They could not  they said  either from his words or behaviour  gather that he had  He had not been so   296 much with me  as they had been  Nor would they wish that he should suspect me  The best of men  they said  loved to have difficulties to conquer  Their brother  generous as he was  was a man   Yet  Lucy  I thought at the time of what he said at Sir Hargrave Pollexfen s  as recited by the shorthand writer—That he would not marry the greatest princess on earth  if he were not assured  that she loved him above all the men in it   I fancy  my dear  that we women  when we love  and are doubtful  suffer a great deal in the apprehension  at one time  of disgusting the object of our passion  by too forward a Love  and  at another  of disobliging him by too great a reserve  Don t you think so   The Ladies said  They were extremely solicitous to see their brother married  They wished it were to me  rather than to any other woman  and kindly added  That I had their hearts  even at the time when Lady Anne  by a kind of previous engagement had their voices   And then they told me what their brother said of me  with the hint of which they began this alarming conversation   When my brother had let us know  said Miss Grandison  that it was not in his power to return a preferable esteem for a like esteem  if Lady Anne honoured him with it  I said—Had Lady Anne as many advantages to boast of  as Miss Byron has  could you then  brother  like Lady Anne   Miss Byron  replied he  is a charming woman   Lady L   slily enough  continued Miss Grandison  said  Miss Byron is one of the prettiest women I ever beheld  I never saw in any face  youth  and dignity  and sweetness of aspect  so happily blended   On this occasion  Lucy  my vanity may  I hope  revive  so long as I repeat only  and repeat justly      Forgive me  Lady L  replied my brother—But   297 as Alexander would be
