painful efforts  when a few paces only  remained to bring me to the entrance  nature could struggle no farther   my sight grew clouded  I fell  as in the arms of death  and fainted  under the severe oppression of fatigue and distress  Nor did my  miserable state escape the regards of charity  for when my languid eyes  again opened to the light  I found myself attended by one who seemed an  inhabitant  and from him learned that I lays before the portal of an  antient Abbey  where the brethren of the Cistertian order  employed  their peaceful hours in orisons to heaven  and acts of humanity to their  fellow creatures  The friendly door was laid open for my reception  the  arm which had raised me from the ground  with the same humane concern  supported my tottering steps  and led me through the winding isles  to a  retired chamber  where the charitable offices of my attendant were  busily employed to provide whatever might be needful for rest and  refreshment  whatever might recal the strength and comfort the afflicted  spirit of a wretched stranger     I felt the kind effects of his pious care  and though stili anxious and  oppressed  yet reiieved from the extremity of languor  and conscious of  returning strength  I requested to be conducted to the reverend Abbot   who in that instant prevented me  and entered  to enquire into the  occasion of my arrival  and to know what further offices might be  granted to a man  whose appearance and distress had by this time engaged  the attention of the whole fraternity  With the authority of a superior   he directed my conductor to withdraw  and for a while surveyed me with a  kind yet piercing eye  His aspect  from which the beams of piety and  charity seemed to break forth in a mild and cheering light  commanded  reverence and love  I made the due obeysance  and entreated his kind  protection for a man who had drunk deeply of affliction  who stood  before him a monument of the tremendous displeasure of heaven  torn   perhaps  for ever  from all that he held dear  cast on a foreign shore   without guide  friend  or refuge  yet  sometime  no stranger to happier  days   Son   replied the venerable father  these gates are never barred  against the afflicted  but far be all pollution from our walls  War hath  been thy occupation  but hath that sword been ever stained with the  blood of a friend or brother  Hath no great offence odious to religion  or humanity  cut thee off from society  and driven thee away a wretched  and abandoned wanderer  Impatient of suspicion  I fell upon my knees  before him  and instantly addressed myself to shrift  opened my whole  soul freely  as in the face of heaven  declared my country  my name and  quality  and distinctly recounted my late unhappy fortunes  The good  father heard me with exact attention  hesitating and  struggling with the rising passion  he uttered some words of comfort   while the big tear rolled down  nor did this mark of generous pity  disgrace his venerable aspect  although he laboured to conceal it  when  he was to urge the precepts of fortitude and patience    My son  said he   now resuming a look of ease and composed dignity   Nature obliges us to  feel  but Religion forbids us to repine  That power which deals out  misfortune to sinful mortals  will  in his own appointed time  accept of  their penitence  and wipe away their tears  Thou art the enemy of my  country  but thou art a man  This roof shall not reject thee  retire and  rest securely  the duties of my office call me  with tomorrow s rising  sun I will revisit thee   He departed  and deprived me of that  momentary comfort  which his looks and voice inspired     The couch now received me  but not to repose  My busy thoughts  too long  and too violently agitated to subside into serenity and quiet  revolved  the dreadful scenes in which I had been just now engaged  sometimes  were they fixed on the fate of my companions  now  on my own danger  and  ever and anon distracted me with the recollection of my country  my  family  and  O killing torment   my wife  But I was not long permitted  to indulge these sad reflections  A rude knocking at the gates echoed  through the arched isles  and roused me from my gloomy dreams  Suddenly  it ceased  Silence  still more alarming  and anxious expectation  succeeded  I started up  and grasped my sword as it were instinctively   I heard the seet of haste approaching my chamber  The door opened  and  there stood before me the Frenchman  whose life I had that day spared   and whom I now recognized rather by his voice  than by the glimmering  lamp depending from the cieling  Have I found my preserver   thus did
