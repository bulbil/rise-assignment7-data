of speaking to her  upon which that lady   advanced towards her  with these words   I am sorry  Madam   said she     as you are alone  that it is improper for me to ask you to join   us     I am very glad  Madam  you do not   replied Miss Betsy  very much   piqued   because I should be obliged to refuse you   She no sooner   uttered these words than she passed hastily on  and Miss Mabel returned   to her company  who waited for her at some paces distance       It must be acknowledged  that Miss Betsy had cause to be alarmed at a   speech of this nature  from a lady of Miss Mabel s politeness and good   humour  she thought there must be some powerful reasons  which had   obliged her to make it  and what those reasons could be  seemed at   present an impenetrable secret  She was too much disconcerted to be able   to pass the whole evening  as she had promised the lady she went to  she   would do  she therefore pretended a sudden indispostion  took her leave    and went home  in order to be at full liberty to ruminate on what had   passed in the Park       She had not been many minutes in her own apartment  before she was   interrupted in her meditations by the coming of her two brothers    Several bustos  pictures  pieces of old china  and other curiosities    belonging to a nobleman  lately deceased  being to be exposed to sale    the elder Mr  Thoughtless had an inclination to become a purchaser of   such of them as he should find agreeable to his fancy  but was willing   to have his sister s judgment in the matter  and it was to engage her to   go with him the next morning about twelve o clock  when the goods were   to be exhibited to publick view  that had occasioned him and Mr  Francis   to make her this visit  It is not to be doubted  but that she was   willing to oblige him in that point  she assured him she would be ready   against he came to call on her       When she was alone  she began to run over in her mind  all the   particulars of what had passed that evening in the Park  and found   something very extraordinary on the whole  It had seemed extremely odd   to her  that Mr  Trueworth and Sir Bazil did not join her and the two   Miss Airishes  but then she thought she could easily account for their   not doing so  and that Mr  Trueworth did not chuse to enter into any   conversation with her  because Sir Bazil had happened to see her at Miss   Forward s  and might possibly have entertained no favourable idea of her   on that score  she  therefore  with a great deal of readiness  excused   Mr  Trueworth for this omission  especially as she was possessed of the   fancy  that the compliment with which he returned her fan  and the look   he assumed during that action  seemed to tell her he wished for an   opportunity of adding something more tender  But when she came to   consider on the second meeting  she was indeed very much at a loss to   fathom the meaning of what she had seen  she knew a thousand accidents   might have occasioned an acquaintance between Miss Mabel and Sir Bazil    and also  that the little she had with Mr  Trueworth might have been   casually improved  but could not find the least shadow of reason why   that lady should tell her it was improper for to ask her to join company   with them  Though she had of late seen that lady less frequently than   usual  yet  whenever they did meet  it was with the greatest civility   and appearance of friendship  she had  in reality  a sincere regard for   her  and imagined the other looked upon her with the same  and therefore   could not but believe the shyness she put on in the Park  when speaking   to her  must have some very powerful motive to occasion it  Suspense   was  of all things  what Miss Betsy could least bear  she resolved to be   convinced  though at the expence of that pride she would not have   forfeited on any other account    In spite of the ill manners she has   treated me with   said she   I will go once more to her  satisfy my   curiosity as to the manner of her behaviour  and then never see her   more        To be more sure of finding her at home  she thought it best to make the   visit she intended in the morning  accordingly
