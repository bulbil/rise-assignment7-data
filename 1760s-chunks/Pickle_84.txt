the service of  Gam Pickle  he had been prevailed upon  by the solicitations of his  master and the Curate  to accompany them in their expedition  and  undertake the part which he had acted against the stranger  whom he  and his employers mistook for Peregrine  In consideration of this frank  acknowledgment  and a severe wound he had received in his right arm   they resolved to inflict no other punishment on this malefactor than to  detain him all night in the garrison  and next morning carry him before  a justice of the peace  to whom he repeated all he had said overnight   and with his own hand subscribed his confession  copies of which  were handed about the neighbourhood  to the unspeakable confusion and  disgrace of the curate and his promising pupil   Meanwhile Trunnion treated the young soldier with uncommon marks of  respect  being prepossessed in his favour by this adventure  which he  had so gallantly achieved  as well as by the encomiums that Peregrine  bestowed upon his valour and generosity  He liked his countenance  which  was bold and hardy  admired his Herculean limbs  and delighted in asking  questions concerning the service he had seen  The day after his arrival   while the conversation turned on this last subject  the commodore     6 22 15  3 45 PM   taking the pipe out of his month   I ll tell ye what  brother   said he    five and forty years ago  when I was third lieutenant of the Warwick  man of war  there was a very stout young fellow on board  a subaltern  officer of marines  his name was not unlike your own  d ye see  being  Guntlet  with a G  I remember he and I could not abide one another at  first  because  d ye see  I was a sailor and he a landsman  till we fell  in with a Frenchman  whom we engaged for eight glasses  and at length  boarded and took  I was the first man that stood on the enemy s deck   and should have come scurvily off  d ye see  if Guntlet had not jumped  to my assistance  but we soon cleared ship  and drove them to close  quarters  so that they were obliged to strike  and from that day Guntlet  and I were sworn brothers as long as he remained on board  He was  exchanged into a marching regiment  and what became of him afterwards   Lord in heaven knows  but this I ll say of him  whether he be dead or  alive  he feared no man that ever wore a head  and was  moreover  a very  hearty messmate    The stranger s breast glowed at this eulogium  which was no sooner  pronounced than he eagerly asked if the French ship was not the  Diligence  The commodore replied  with a stare   The very same  my  lad     Then   said Gauntlet   the person of whom you are pleased to  make such honourable mention was my own father     The devil he was    cried Trunnion  shaking him by the hand   I am rejoiced to see a son of  Ned Guntlet in my house    This discovery introduced a thousand questions  in the course of which  the old gentleman learned the situation of his friend s family  and  discharged innumerable execrations upon the ingratitude and injustice  of the ministry  which had failed to provide for the son of such a  brave soldier  Nor was his friendship confined to such ineffectual  expressions  he that same evening signified to Peregrine a desire of  doing something for his friend  This inclination was so much praised   encouraged  and promoted by his godson  and even supported by his  councilor Hatchway  that our hero was empowered to present him with a  sum of money sufficient to purchase a commission   Though nothing could be more agreeable to Pickle than this permission   he was afraid that Godfrey s scrupulous disposition would hinder him  from subjecting himself to any such obligation  and therefore proposed  that he should be decoyed into his own interest by a feigned story  in  consequence of which he would be prevailed upon to accept of the money   as a debt which the commodore had contracted of his father at sea   Trunnion made wry faces at this expedient  the necessity of which he  could not conceive  without calling in question the common sense of  Gauntlet  as he took it for granted that such offers as those were not  to be rejected on any consideration whatever  Besides  he could not  digest an artifice  by which he himself must own that he had lived so  many years without manifesting the least intention of doing justice to  his creditor  All these objections  however  were removed by the zeal  and rhetoric of Peregrine  who represented that it would be impossible  to befriend him on any other terms  that his silence hitherto would  be imputed to his want of information touching the circumstances and  condition of his friend  and that
