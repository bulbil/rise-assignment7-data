 and the uncertainty of the  lawsuit  which he still maintained for the recovery of his ten thousand  pounds  The lawyers  indeed  continued to drain his pocket of money   while they filled his brain with unsubstantial hope  and he was actually  obliged to borrow money from his bookseller  on the strength of the  translation  in order to satisfy the demands of those ravenous harpies   rather than lay the misanthrope under any difficulties  or have recourse  to his friend Hatchway  who lived at the garrison  entirely ignorant  of his distress  This was not at all alleviated by the arrival of the  Indiaman  in which he had ventured seven hundred pounds  as we have  already observed  for he was given to understand  that the borrower was  left dangerously ill at Bombay when the ship sailed  and that his chance  for retrieving his money was extremely slender   So situated  it is not to be supposed that he led a life of tranquility   though he made a shift to struggle with the remonstrances of misfortune   Yet such a gush of affliction would sometimes rush upon his thought  as  overwhelmed all the ideas of his hope  and sunk him to the very bottom  of despondence  Every equipage that passed him in the street  every  person of rank and fortune that occurred to his view  recalled the gay  images of his former life  with such mortifying reflection as stabbed  him to the very soul  He lived  therefore  incessantly exposed to all  the pangs of envy and disquiet  When I say envy  I do not mean that  sordid passion  in consequence of which a man repines at his neighbour s  success  howsoever deserved  but that self tormenting indignation which  is inspired by the prosperity of folly  ignorance  and vice  Without the  intervening gleams of enjoyment  which he felt in the conversation of a  few friends  he could not have supported his existence  or  at least   he must have suffered some violent discomposure of the brain  But one  is still finding some circumstance of alleviation  even in the worst of  conjunctures  and Pickle was so ingenious in these researches  that he    6 22 15  3 45 PM   maintained a good battle with disappointment  till the revolution of the  term at which he had received his pension of three hundred pounds   However  seeing the day elapse without touching his allowance   notwithstanding his significant method of presenting himself at the  minister s levee  when the year was expired  he wrote a letter to Sir  Steady  reminding him of his situation and promise  and giving him to  understand  that his occasions were such as compelled him to demand  his salary for the ensuing year  In the morning after this letter was  conveyed  the author went to his honour s house  in expectation of being  admitted by particular order  but was mistaken in his hope  the minister  not being visible  He then made his appearance at the levee  in hopes  of being closeted  but  though he took all opportunities of watching Sir  Steady s eyes  he could not obtain one glance  and had the pleasure of  seeing him retire  without being favoured with the least notice  These  circumstances of wilful neglect were not over and above agreeable to our  young hero  who  in the agonies of vexation and resentment  went  home  and composed a most acrimonious remonstrance to his honour  in  consequence of which he was not only deprived of all pretensions to a  private audience  but expressly denied admittance on a public day  by  Sir Steady s own order   This prohibition  which announced his total ruin  filled him with rage   horror  and despair  He insulted the porter who signified the minister s  command  threatening to chastise him upon the spot for his presumption   and vented the most virulent imprecations upon his master  to the  astonishment of those who chanced to enter during this conference   Having exhausted himself in these vain exclamations  he returned to his  lodgings in a most frantic condition  biting his lips so that the blood  ran from his mouth  dashing his head and fists against the sides of his  chimney  and weeping with the most bitter expressions of woe  Pipes   whose perception had been just sufficient to let him see that there was  some difference between the present and former situation of his master   overhearing his transports  essayed to enter his apartment  with a  view of administering consolation  and  finding the door locked on the  inside  desired admittance  protesting  that otherwise he would down  with the bulkhead in the turning of a handspike  Peregrine ordered him  to retire  on pain of his displeasure  and swore  that if he should  offer to break open the door  he would instantly shoot him through  the head  Tom  without paying the least regard to this injunction  set  himself at work immediately  His master  exasperated at his want of  reverence and respect  which in his present paroxysm
