over all their dependants  The clergy had  for some time  been at variance with the Pope  and this diffension contributed to strip the mask of sanctity from both  the division of the church was a most certain means of rendering it contemptible  since all its strength lay only in the influence it had over the minds of its votaries  But  there was another principle  which had been  for some time  operating  and which  in time  promised to be a certain means of diminishing the power of the barons and the clergy  I mean a diminution of personal service in war  In former times  every vassal was to appear  at the command of his lord  with horse attendants  and all the apparatus necessary for a campaign  If the nobility  or vassals of the crown  refused to march  the King was unable to compel them  In this manner a combination of the nobility had it ever in their power to give laws to the crown  because they were not only the deliberating power  but the acting power also  but  from the increase of the people  from the more extensive use of money instead of barter  and from the number of independant foreigners ready to accept pay  from these causes  I say  the Kings began to levy armies without the assistance of the nobility  Monarchs now only wanted money to be at the head of armies as numerous and powerful as they thought proper  wherever money   124 was  there lay power  and  the people  by traffic and industry  beginning to grow rich  they were necessarily admitted into some share in the legislature  Thus we see the nobility  the clergy  and the people  different from what they were two or three reigns before this  and the strength of the King did not suffer a less mutation  Former Monarchs might be considered only as the first and most powerful Baron of the land  a Baron was  in miniature  what the King was in the great  The Monarch had scarce any real power but what he derived from his own crown lands and vassals  when he was resolved to exert his strength  he could only command his own tenants  and those who held immediately under him  the barons were summoned  indeed  but  if they were displeased  they might refuse their assistance  and all their dependants were obliged to imitate their example  these acknowledged subjection  not to the King  but their own master  and nothing but a civil war with the refractory nobleman could bring him to justice  But the face of the old constitution was now beginning to be changed  every order in the state began to have a mutual dependence on each other  the power of the King to extend to the highest and the lowest of his subjects  and opposite interests to concur for the benefit of all   This change of government seemed to influence the manners of the nation  a spirit of gallantry prevailed  which  probably  took its first rise in those Eastern countries  which had long been famous for every luxurious refinement  Historians represent the kingdom as immersed in debauchery and licentiousness  that ladies  laying aside their modesty  seemed to glory in the loss of their virtue  Nothing  say they  was more common    125 than to see them riding in troops to the tournaments  dressed like cavaliers  with swords by their sides  their horses adorned with rich trappings  and behaving with more than masculine effrontery  Whatever Monks may observe upon this subject  this aukwardly gallant behaviour  in some measure  expressed a degree of growing elegance in the times  and that the people were emerging from primitive barbarity   Under Edward III  the constitution of our parliaments  and the whole frame of our government  became reduced into a better form  A spirit of liberty breathes in all his laws  yet  no King knew how to make himself more absolute  As the father lost his crown and his life  in the most miserable manner  by suffering himself to be governed by his ministers  and protecting them from the resentments of the people  so the son very early exerted his own authority  and freed himself from the guardianship  or rather subjection  of his mother the Queen  and her paramour  who had long oppressed the nation  and dishonoured him  by their scandalous conduct  Mortimer was dragged from the Queen s apartment  in the most ignominious manner  while she implored  all the while  that they would spare the gentle Mortimer  But the young King was deaf to her intreaties  the pity which she once refused her unhappy husband was now denied her  the parliament condemned Mortimer to die  without being permitted to plead  as he had served Spencer some time before  He fell by the hands of the hangman  and Isabella was confined to the castle of Risings  with a pension of three thousand pounds a year  Her confinement was severe  though she survived her disgrace twenty five years  and  abandoned to universal   126 contempt  wept in solitude rather her misfortunes than her vices   Edward III  well knew  that a conquering Monarch was fittest to please a warlike people  The Scotch had long triumphed with impunity  he therefore
