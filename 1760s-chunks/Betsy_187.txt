There passed no more between them  she went   directly up stairs to do as she had said  and Sir Bazil to pay his   mourning visit to Miss Mabel  as he usually did every day       The humours of these two worthy persons were extremely well adapted to   make each other happy  Sir Bazil was gay  but he was perfectly sincere    Miss Mabel had a great deal of softness in her nature  but it was   entirely under the direction of her prudence  she returned the passion   of her lover with equal tenderness  yet would not permit the   gratification of it till every thing that threatened an interruption of   their mutual ease should be removed  Sir Bazil made no secret of his   affairs to her  she knew very well that he desired no more at present of   her father than the six thousand pounds charged on his estate for Miss   Harriot s fortune  and as the old gentleman testified the highest esteem   for him  and satisfaction in the proposed match  she flattered herself   that he would at last consent to so reasonable a request  but  till he   did so  remained firm in her resolution of denying both her own and her   lover s wishes       The pleasure with which they always saw each other was now  however    greatly enhanced by his acquainting her with the almost assured hope he   had  that the difficulty which had so long kept them asunder would be   soon got over  and he should have the inexpressible satisfaction of   complying with the conditions her father had proposed  without the least   danger of incurring any inconvenience to himself       The clock striking two  he was obliged to leave her  and go home to   receive the company he expected  He behaved among his friends with his   accustomed vivacity  but casting his eyes frequently towards Miss   Harriot  he imagined he saw a certain gloom upon her countenance  which   made him fearful for the effects of Mrs  Wellair s solicitations  till    recollecting the agreement between him and that lady  he cried out   hastily to her   How do you do  sister   To which she answered  with a   smile   As well as can be expected  brother   and then  to prevent Miss   Harriot  or any one else  from wondering what she meant by so odd a   reply  added   after the ugly jolt I have had this morning over London   stones in a hackney coach        Sir Bazil easily understood  that by the words  As well as can be   expected   his sister meant as much as could be hoped for from the first   attack on a maid so young and innocent as Miss Harriot  and doubted not   but that so favourable a beginning would have as fortunate a conclusion       Those guests who had dined with him staid supper also  but that did not   hinder him from fulfilling his engagement with Mr  Trueworth  He begged   they would excuse a short excursion which  he said  he was obliged to   make on extraordinary business  and accordingly went at the time   appointed for the meeting that gentleman       Mr  Trueworth received the intelligence he brought with him with   transports befitting the sincerity of his passion  He thought he had   little to apprehend  since Mrs  Wellair vouchsafed to become his   advocate   It is certainly   said Sir Bazil   as greatly in her power to   forward the completion of your wishes  as it was to have obstructed   them  But  my dear friend   continued he   there is no time to be lost    the business that brought my sisters to town will soon be over  and Mrs    Wellair will then be on the wing to get home to her husband and family    You must dine with me to morrow  I shall be able by that time to learn   the particulars of Harriot s behaviour  on her first hearing an account   of the affection with which you honour her  and by that you may the   better judge how to proceed   This was the substance of all the   discourse they had together at that time  Sir Bazil went home  and Mr    Trueworth adjourned to a coffee house  where he met with something not   very pleasing to him  It was a letter from Miss Flora  containing these   lines             To Charles Trueworth  Esq            My dear Trueworth            For such you still are  and ever must be  to my fond doating heart         though I have too much cause
