 prentices  and the lower class of  tradesmen  who could not afford to purchase prescience at such a price   so that  after fruitless offers of shillings and half crowns  they  dropped off one by one  and left the field open for customers of a  higher rank   The first person of this species who appeared was dressed like the wife  of a substantial tradesman  but this disguise could not screen her from  the penetration of the conjurer  who at first sight knew her to be one  of the ladies of whose coming he had been apprised by Peregrine  on the  supposition that their curiosity was rather inflamed than allayed by  the intelligence they had received from his first client  This lady  approached the philosopher with that intrepidity of countenance so  conspicuous in matrons of her dignified sphere  and  in a soft voice   asked with a simper  of what complexion her next child would be  The  necromancer  who was perfectly well acquainted with her private history   forthwith delivered his response in the following question  written in  the usual form   How long has Pompey the black been dismissed from your  ladyship s service    Endued as she was with a great share of that fortitude which is  distinguished by the appellation of effrontery  her face exhibited  some signs of shame and confusion at the receipt of this oracular  interrogation  by which she was convinced of his extraordinary  intelligence  and  accosting him in a very serious tone   Doctor   said  she   I perceive you are a person of great abilities in the art you  profess  and therefore  without pretending to dissemble  I will own you    6 22 15  3 45 PM   have touched the true string of my apprehensions  I am persuaded I need  not be more particular in my inquiries  Here is a purse of money  take  it  and deliver me from a most alarming and uneasy suspense   So saying   she deposited her offering upon the table  and waited for his answer   with a face of fearful expectation  while he was employed in writing  this sentence for her perusal   Though I see into the womb of time   the prospect is not perfectly distinct  the seeds of future events lie  mingled and confused  So that I am under the necessity of assisting my  divination in some cases  by analogy and human intelligence  and cannot  possibly satisfy your present doubts  unless you will condescend to make  me privy to all those occurrences which you think might have interfered  with the cause of your apprehension    The lady having read the declaration  affected a small emotion of  shyness and repugnance  and  seating herself upon a settee  after having  cautiously informed herself of the privacy of the apartment  gave such a  detail of the succession of her lovers  as amazed  while it entertained   the necromancer  as well as his friend Pickle  who  from a closet  in which he had concealed himself  overheard every syllable of her  confession  Cadwallader listened to her story with a look of infinite  importance and sagacity  and  after a short pause  told her  that he  would not pretend to give a categorical answer  until he should have  deliberated maturely upon the various circumstances of the affair  but   if she would take the trouble of honouring him with another visit on  his next public day  he hoped he should be able to give her full  satisfaction  Conscious of the importance of her doubts  she could  not help commending his caution  and took her leave  with a promise of  returning at the appointed time  Then the conjurer being joined by his  associate  they gave a loose to their mirth  which having indulged  they  began to concert measures for inflicting some disgraceful punishment on  the shameless and insatiate termagant who had so impudently avowed her  own prostitution   They were interrupted  however  in their conference  by the arrival of  a new guest  who being announced by Hadgi  our hero retreated to his  lurking place  and Cadwallader resumed his mysterious appearance  This  new client  though she hid her face in a mask  could not conceal herself  from the knowledge of the conjurer  who  by her voice  recognised her  to be an unmarried lady of his own acquaintance  She had  within a small  compass of time  made herself remarkable for two adventures  which had  not at all succeeded to her expectation  Being very much addicted to  play  she had  at a certain rout  indulged that passion to such  excess  as not only got the better of her justice  but also of her  circumspection  so that she was unfortunately detected in her endeavours  to appropriate to herself what was not lawfully her due  This small slip  was attended with another indiscretion  which had likewise an unlucky  effect upon her reputation  She had been favoured with the addresses of  one of those hopeful heirs who swarm and swagger about town  under the  denomination of bucks
