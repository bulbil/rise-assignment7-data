 how do I detest and despise the vanities and follies of the   world   how hate myself for having been too much attached to them  and   so long been cold and negligent of my only happiness       The abbess  and  after her  all the nuns that were present  embraced   Louisa   praised to the skies this miraculous conversion  as they termed   it  and spared nothing to confirm the pious resolution she had taken       In fine  they consented to her pilgrimage with a satisfaction equal to   what she felt in undertaking it   they not in the least doubting but she   would return to them as soon as she had fulfilled her devotions  and   flattering themselves that the report of this miracle would do the   greatest honour to their convent that it could possibly receive  and   she  delighted with the thoughts of being at liberty to enquire after   her dear du Plessis  and being freed from a dissimulation so irksome to   her nature       Her pilgrim s habit  and a great crucifix to carry between her hands    with another at her girdle  and all the formalities of that garb being   prepared  she set forward with the prayers and benedictions of the whole   sisterhood  who told her  that they should be impatient till they saw   her again  and expected great things from her at her return  which  in   reality  they all did  except Leonora  who laughed heartily at the   deception she had put upon them  and whispered in her ear as she gave   her the last embrace  that she wished her a happy meeting with that   saint she went in search of       To prevent all suspicion of her intention she left her cloaths  and   every thing she had brought into the convent  under the care of the   abbess  saying  that  at her return  she would have them disposed of    and the money given to the poor  but  unknown to any one except Leonora    she quilted some pieces of gold and valuable trinkets into her   undergarment  as not doubting but she should have occasion for much more   than  in effect  she was mistress of       When on her journey  the pleasure she felt at seeing herself out of the   walls of the monastery  was very much abated by the uncertainty how she   should proceed  or where direct her way  and indeed  let any one figure   to themselves the condition she was in  and they will rather wonder she   had courage to go on  than that she was sometimes daunted even to   despair   A young creature of little more than eighteen years   old   wholly unacquainted with fatigue   delicate in her   frame   wandering alone on foot in the midst of a strange   country   ignorant of the road  or had she been acquainted with it  at a   loss where to go to get any intelligence of what she sought  and even   doubtful if the person she ran such risques to hear of  yet were in the   world or not  The letter Leonora had informed her of  gave no account    at least that she could learn  either where he was  or whether there   were any hopes of his recovery from that illness it mentioned  she had   therefore every thing to dread  and little  very little to hope  yet did   she not repent her having quitted the convent  and the desire of getting   still farther from it  made her prosecute her journey with greater   strength and vigour than could have been expected  her pilgrim s habit   was not only a defence against any insults from persons she met on the   road  but also attracted the respect  and engaged the civilities of   every one   As that country abounds with religious houses  she was not   only lodged and fed without any expence  but received a piece of money   at each of them she went to  so that her little stock  instead of being   diminished  was considerably increased when she came to Lorretto  for   thither  not to be false in every thing  she went  and being truly sorry   for the hypocrisy which a sad necessity alone could have made her guilty   of  paid her devotion with a sincere heart  tho  free from that   enthusiasm and bigotry which is too much practised in convents       From Lorretto she crossed the country to Florence  every one being ready   to direct a holy pilgrim on her way  and assist her with all things   necessary  As she went very easy journeys  never exceeding four or five   miles a day  she easily supported the fatigue  and had she been certain   at last of seeing
