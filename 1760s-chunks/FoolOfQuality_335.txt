of the darkness and dependence   of their creaturely nature  and of the distance and distinction   between themselves and their God  could they have known the   nature and extent of his attributes  with infinity of his love   could   they have known the dreadful consequences of falling off from   him  without seeing any example  or experiencing any consequences   of such a fall   could they have otherwise felt and found that every   act of creaturely will  and every attempt at creaturely power    was a forsaking of that eternal wisdom and strength in which they   stood   could all intelligent creatures have been continued in that   lowliness  that resignation  that gratitude of burning affection   which the slain will of the mortified sinner feels when called up   into the grace and enjoyment of his God   could those endearing   relations have subsisted in creation  which have since newly risen   between God and his lapsed creatures wholly subsequent thereto   those relations  I say  of redemption  of regeneration  of a power   of conversion  that extracts good out of evil  of a love that no   apostasy can quench  that no offences can conquer if these   eternal benefits could have been introduced  without their ground   or foundation in the admission of evil  no lapse or falling off would   ever have been      Here Mr  Clinton paused  and his auditors continued in a kind   of respectful musing  as attentive to what he might further offer    At length the earl exclaimed Never  never more  my brother    will I debate or question with you  further than asking your advice   or opinion  to which I shall instantly and implicity submit  as I   would to that of the highest seraph in heaven  Our dear Meekly   here  and I  had some former converse on a few of these deep   subjects  and I received much satisfaction and instruction from   him   but he was not quite so explicit and convincing as you   have been      Ah  my lord   cried Meekly  were I as intimate with the fountain   of all knowledge as your precious brother is  you would not then   have opposed me in the conversation we last held on those heads      On the following day  at breakfast  Mr  Meekly took out his   pocket book  and produced bank and stock bills to the amount of   something upward of five thousand pounds  He then presented   them to Mr  Clinton  and said Here  sir  is a little matter toward   repayment of the loan I had from you in Holland  I bless I bless   my God that he has enabled me thus far to approve myself an   honest man   but  above all  I bless him for giving me once more a   sight of the gracious countenance of my patron      But for you I had miserably perished in a dungeon   to you  sir    I owe my liberty  to you I owe my life  to you I owe the recovery   of the inheritance of my fathers  With respect to such obligations    I am indeed a beggared insolvent  But my heart is pleased with   the thought  that the connection between us  of creditor on your   part and of debtor on mine  should remain on record to all eternity      Here the worthy Meekly became oppressed under sensations of   grateful recollection  and  putting his handkerchief to his eyes    he sobbed out his passion      Bb         370 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      In the mean time  Mr  Clinton held the bills in his hand  and   carelessly casting his eye over them  perceived the amount  As   soon as he saw that his friend s emotion had partly subsided  You   have  Mr  Meekly  says he you have been quite a gospel steward    and have returned me my own with most unlooked for usury   and   I heartily pray God  in recompense of your integrity  to give you   the principality of many cities in the coming kingdom of his Son    But what shall I do with this money  my dear Meekly   My wealth   already overflows   it is my only trouble  my only encumbrance  It   claims my attention  indeed  as it is a trust for which I know I am   strictly accountable   but I heartily wish that Providence would   reclaim the whole to himself  and leave me as one of his mendi    cants  who daily wait on the hand that supplieth all who seek his   kingdom with necessary things  for my Harry has enough  and   more than enough now  in the abundance of his noble father  You
