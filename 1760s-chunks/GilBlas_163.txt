to give him my daughter  so there is an end of that   Oh  then it is quite another matter  said the alguazil  I only come to your house for the purpose of assuring you that this young man is no impostor  You have the authority of a parent over your child  and no one has any right to dictate to you how you are to marry her  and whether you will or no  Neither do I  on my part  interrupted Pedro  pretend to lay any force on the inclinations of Signor de Moyadas  but he will perhaps allow me to ask him why he has so suddenly changed his resolution  Has he any reason to be dissatisfied with me  Alas  let me at least understand  that in losing the sweet hope of becoming his son in  law  my promised bliss has not been wrested from me by any misconduct of my own  I have no complaint to make of you  answered the old man  nay  I will even tell you more  it is with sincere sorrow that I find myself under the necessity of breaking my word with you  and I heartily beseech you to forgive me for having done so  I am persuaded that you are too generous to bear me any ill will for having thrown the balance into the scale of a rival  who has saved my life  You see him here  pursued he  introducing my noble self  this is the illustrious personage who threw round me the shield of his protection in my great peril  and  the better still to apologize for my seemingly harsh treatment of yourself  you are to know that he is an Italian prince   At these last words  Pedro was dumb founded  and looked as if he could not help it  The two tradesmen opened their eyes as wide as they could stare  with surprise at finding themselves for the first time in princely society  But the alguazil  in the habit of looking at things with the cross eye of suspicion  divined most perspicuously that this marvellous adventure must be a complete humbug  and the verification of the prophecy was calculated to put money into the pocket of the prophet  He therefore conned over my countenance with a very inquisitive regard  but as my features  which were new to justice  threw him out most cruelly from hunting down the game he was in chase of  he had no alternative but to try his luck on my companion  Unfortunately for my highness of the inaccessible valleys  he knew again the hang dog features of Moralez  and recollecting to have seen him within the purlieus of a gaol  Ay  ay  exclaimed he  this is one of my established customers  This gentleman is a particular acquaintance of mine  and you may take his character from me for one of the rankest rascals within the kingdoms and principalities of Spain  Softly  look before you leap  most adventurous alguazil  said Jerome de Moyadas  this lad  of whom you draw so unfavourable a picture  is in the travelling retinue of a prince  So much the better  retorted the alguazil  a man would not desire clearer evidence on which to bring in his verdict  If we can but hang the servant  we shall soon send the master to the devil  The case is as undeniable as a feed counsel s plea  these pleasant sparks are a couple of fortune hunters  who have laid their heads together to take you in  I am an old hound upon this scent  so that  by way of proof presumptive that these merry vagabonds are within the contemplation of the law in that case provided  I shall lodge them where they will be well taken care of  They will have plenty of time for meditation under the chastising philosophy of a turnkey  or should confinement fail to mend their morals  we have a sort of tangible discipline  which insinuates reformation by the inlet of a smarting hide  Stop there  and bethink you in good time  master officer  rejoined the old gentleman  we must not draw the cord tighter than it will bear  You never make any bones  you hangers on of the law  about hurting the feelings of better men than yourselves  May not this servant be a common cheat  without his master being a swindler  Princes are persons of honour as a matter of course  yet the retainers to a court are inordinate rascals  it requires no conjurer to find that out  Are you playing into the hands of your deluders  with your princes  interrupted the alguazil  This new manufacturer of false pretences is a proficient  take my word for it  but I shall quench his zeal in the service  and gravel the ingenuity of his partner  with a whereas and a commitment in due form  The scouts of justice are all round the door  who will worry their game every inch of the chase  if they do not suffer themselves to be taken quietly on their form  So come along  may it please your serene highness  let us proceed to our destination   This upshot of the business was a death blow to me  as well as to Moralez  and our confusion did but infuse doubts into the mind of Jerome de Moyadas  or rather burned  sunk
