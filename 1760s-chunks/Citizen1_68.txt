the white mouse was entirely fictitious  and not the genuine complexion of his soul  he now saw that his earnestness after mice was an illiberal amusement  and much more becoming a ratcatcher than a Prince  All his meannesses now stared him in the face  he begged the discreet Princesses pardon an hundred times  The Princess very readily forgave him  and both returning to their palace in Bonbobbin  lived very happily together  and reigned many years with all that wisdom  which  by the story  they appear to have been possessed of  Perfectly convinced by their former adventures  that they who place their affections on trifles at first for amusement  will find those trifles at last become their most serious concern   Adieu   LETTER XLIX  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Acadamy at Pekin  in China   ASK an Englishman what nation in the world enjoys most freedom  and he immediately answers  his own  Ask him in what that freedom principally consists  and he is instantly silent  This happy pre eminence does not arise from the people s enjoying a larger share in legislation than   215 elsewhere  for in this particular  several states in Europe excell them  nor does it arise from a greater exemption from taxes  for few countries pay more  it does not proceed from their being restrained by fewer laws  for no people are burthened with so many  nor does it particularly consist in the security of their property  for property is pretty well secured in every polite state of Europe   How then are the English more free  for more free they certainly are  than the people of any other country  or under any other form of government whatever  Their freedom consists in their enjoying all the advantages of democracy with this superior prerogative borrowed from monarchy  that the severity of their laws may be relaxed without endangering the constitution   In a monarchical state  in which the constitution is strongest  the laws may be relaxed without danger  for though the people should be unanimous in the breach of any one in particular  yet still there is an effective power superior to the people  capable of enforcing obedience  whenever it may be proper to inculcate the law either towards the support or welfare of the community   But in all those governments  where laws derive their sanction from the people alone  transgressions cannot be overlooked without bringing the constitution into danger  They who transgress the law in such a case  are those who prescribe it  by which means it loses not only its influence but its sanction  In every republic the laws must be strong  because the constitution▪ is feeble  they   216 must resemble an Asiatic husband who is justly  jealous  because he knows himself impotent  Thus in Holland  Switzerland  and Genoa  new laws are not frequently enacted  but the old ones are observed with unremitting severity  In such republics therefore the people are slaves to laws of their own making  little less than in unmix d monarchies where they are slaves to the will of one subject to frailties like themselves   In England  from a variety of happy accidents  their constitution is just strong enough  or if you will  monarchical enough  to permit a relaxation of the severity of laws  and yet those laws still to remain sufficiently strong to govern the people  This is the most perfect state of civil liberty  of which we can form any idea  here we see a greater number of laws than in any other country  while the people at the same time obey only such as are immediately conducive to the interests of society  several are unnoticed  many unknown  some kept to be revived and enforced upon proper occasions  others left to grow obsolete  even without the necessity of abrogation   Scarce an Englishman who does not almost every day of his life  offend with impunity against some express law  and for which in a certain conjuncture of circumstances he would not receive punishment  Gaming houses  preaching at prohibited places  assembled crowds  nocturnal amusements  public shows  and an hundred other instances are forbid and frequented  These prohibitions are useful  though it be prudent in their magistrates  and happy for their people    217 that they are not enforced  and none but the venal or mercenary attempt to enforce them   The law in this case  like an indulgent parent  still keeps the rod  though the child is seldom corrected Were those pardoned offences to rise into enormity  were they likely to obstruct the happiness of society  or endanger the state  it is then that justice would resume her terrors  and punish those faults she had so often overlooked with indulgence  It is to this ductility of the laws that an Englishman owes the freedom he enjoys superior to others in a more popular government  every step therefore the constitution takes towards a Democratic form  every diminution of the legal authority is  in fact  a diminution of the subjects freedom  but every attempt to render the government more popular  not only impairs natural liberty  but even will at last  dissolve the political constitution   Every popular government seems calculated to last only for a time  it grows rigid with age  new laws are multiplying
