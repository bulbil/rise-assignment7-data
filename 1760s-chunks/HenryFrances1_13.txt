myself either your Lover or Friend   Henry   LETTER XVIII  FRANCES to HENRY   ROCHFAUCAULT says    that nothing ought to make us wonder  but that we should be still able to wonder at any Thing   But  among all the Things I have ever met with  to astonish me  nothing has equalled your Letter  I shall not say Favour  any more than you  In short  the Statue of Surprize  tho  done by Phidias  would but faintly represent my Figure  by the Time I had got to the End of your well penned Acrostick      And fall these Sayings from that gentle Tongue   Where civil Speech  and soft Persuasion hung   How could you possibly return me such an Answer to a Letter made up of Softness  Tenderness  and Fears  And where  for your Happiness  or Advantage  I generously offered to resign that   26 Love  which you flattered me with  and which   till I received the Rudeness of your Letter  I had Reason to think might have made the Happiness of my Life —But we are now quit  and your Generosity is equal to mine  in throwing off the Masque  which might have deceived me too far  and it was extremely kind to open my Eyes  before I was quite got to the Brink of a Precipice  You seem to understand that Maxim very well    That the Violence which we use to preserve Love  is worse than Infidelity     How should I imagine  that your Marrying that Lady was a Breach of Friendship  I rather thought that  whom you honoured with your Friendship  you honoured with your Alliance  and he would be unworthy your Attachment  who did not think so  And  as for my own Part  I endeavoured to represent what you said  or wrote to me  merely as the Effects  or Essay of a certain vague Gallantry  which Men of Wit and Spirit exercise upon every silly Woman who comes in their Way   If you do not credit me in this Justification  you may  at least  believe my Pride  which would scorn to harbour a base or mean Opinion of one  whom even that very Pride esteemed   I have thus condescended to make an Apology for the Letter  which has offended you  but more to vindicate myself  than to satisfy you  and I mention the Word  Condescension  from   27 no other Idea of Heighth  or Superiority  but what the Injured have over those  who wrong them  by having it in their Power to forgive  which  as it is a Thing you may almost plead a prescriptive Right to  I shall not be disappointed  if I receive no Thanks for   Frances   LETTER XIX  HENRY to FRANCES   See  how Amazement on me sits  O Praxiteles   WHY  my little Pet  and a spoiled Pet thou art  what Reason in the World had you to resent my Letter  except as Children do  being whipt  when they do Mischief   I must have been extremely unworthy your least Regard  if I had not resented being thought a Trifler  at least  which indeed was the smallest Part of your Charge against me  and I must have thought you unworthy mine  if I had not been highly piqued  at being thought so by you   You still carry on your Unkindness  by charging me with Rudeness in my Letter  which I remember not  at least I am very sure  I had no Sentiment of Ill breeding in my Mind about you  but  if the Roughness of my Manners has offended you  I ask your Pardon     28Then you tell me  I have thrown off the Masque   c   c  In short  I make such a paultry Figure  thro  the Course of your Anecdotes  that I should be ashamed to re offer you my Love and Friendship  if my Inclinations did not get the Better of my Modesty  to assure you  that they are both at your Service  when ever you think them worth your Acceptance   Henry   LETTER XX   My dearest HARRY   I RECEIVED your fond and elegant Letter  I mean of the 29th Date  for those Characteristicks could hardly distinguish which of your Letters I allude to   I am pleased to find  I am  at length  brought to such a steady Temper of Mind  as to be able to bear  without Emotion  those giddy Heighths  to which your Praise used to raise me  so that your Approbation now rather makes me emulous than vain  However  I owe this Strength  not to my own Sense  but to your Constancy  as Use prevents our being affected with elevated Situations   Whatever Sense  Accomplishment  or Merit  I have  were inspired from your Precept  Example  and Instruction  and  like Pygmalion  you   29 are become inamoured of the Works of your own Hands  How doubly kind is it in a Master  first to make his Pupil perfect in his Art  and then commend him for his Excellence in it  Farewel  my Guide and
