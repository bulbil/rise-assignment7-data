our guardian  as I then judged  had so far   betrayed his trust as to bind my brother apprentice to a trader    and thereby to deprive him of all title to gentility  I looked upon   him as a branch cut off from the family tree   and  as my thoughts   about him were accompanied by coldness or disgust  I forbore to   make any inquiry concerning him      I am apt to think  however  that he was not equally unnatural   on his part   but  hearing of the dissolute life I led on my return   from travel  he might justly deem me unworthy of his acquaintance   or notice      During the time of my intimacy with his late majesty  and the   ministers of his pleasures and policy  a servant brought me word   that a gentleman  attended by a number of the principal citizens    waited for me in my antechamber   whereupon I gave orders for   their immediate introduction  On their entrance  I was awfully   struck with the presence of their principal  with the elegance of   his figure  the nobleness of his aspect  and the ease of his address     and I felt myself drawn to him by a sudden kind of instinctive   attachment      My lord  says he  we come to wait upon you in the name of the   very respectable body of the citizens of London  some infringe    ments have been lately made on their city charter  and their first   application is to your lordship  as they wish  above all others  to   be obliged to you for their redress      They have been very discreet  said I  in their choice of an ad    vocate  Their demands must be exorbitant if they fail of success   while you are their solicitor      This paper  proceeded he  contains a clear detail of their rights    and encroachments that have been made thereon  They are sen    sible of your lordship s interest with his majesty and the ministry    and they humbly petition for your favour and happy influence in   their behalf      Without papers  I replied  or any inducement save that of your   own request  let me but know what I am to do  and I shall think   myself truly honoured and obliged by your commands      My lord  he rejoined  I do not wish to betray you into any mis    taken or unmerited complaisance  I am but a trader  a citizen   of the lower order      I now felt myself blush with shame and disappointment  1   resented my being deceived by the dignity of his appearance   and   I was more particularly piqued by the sarcastical kind of smile with   which he closed his declaration  All confused  I looked down  and   pretended to cast my eyes over the paper  in order to gain time   for recollection  Having  at intervals  muttered a few words  such         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  25     as charters  grants  privileges  immunities  and so forth I am not    said I  an enemy to the lower ranks of men   poor people must live    and their service  as well as subordination  is necessary to society     but I confess I was always fond of those sumptuary laws that con    fined the degrees of men to their respective departments  and pre    vented mechanics from confounding themselves with gentlemen      My lord  says he  with the most easy and provoking unconcern    when you shall be pleased to look down from the superiority of   your station  and to consider things and persons according to their   merits  you will not despise some merely for being of use to others    The wealth  prosperity  and importance of all this world are founded   and erected on three living pillars  the TILLER of the ground    the MANUFACTURER  and the MERCHANT  Of these  the tiller is   supposed to be the least respectable  as he requires the least of   genius  invention  or address   and yet the ploughman Triptolemus   was worshipped as a god  and the ploughman Cincinnatus is still   held in as high esteem as any peer of any realm  save that of   Great Britain      I have known  said I  a mob of such gods and dictators some    what dangerous at times  I must be free to tell you  mister  that   matters are much changed since princesses kept sheep  and the   sons of kings were cowherds      The ranks and orders of men are now appointed and known    and one department must not presume
