for your Virtues  or I an unhappy one for my Vices  you might indeed be said to be happy  and I miserable  but neither of us could be said to be rewarded or punished  without a Consciousness of our being the Persons  who  in the other Life  had merited or incurred these Judgments  It is Consciousness  which makes the Identity of a Person relative to himself  and  if Death destroys this  it in Effect creates another Spirit in our stead  and to reward or punish such a one for our Actions here  would be Partiality or Injustice  I should be ashamed to insist upon an Argument  which  by appearing so obvious to me  makes me conclude has been often urged before  but  as I really never met with any Thing on this Head  at least  deducted from this Reasoning  and that it is a Subject you know I am fond of  I should carry it a good deal farther  if I were writing to any one else  but your Apprehension saves me that Trouble  as it has often done before  Adieu   Page  296  LETTER CCCIII   I DID not receive my dear Harry s first Letter  till Saturday Evening  I was then at the Rock  and had no possible Means of sending an Answer to the Post office  therefore was obliged  for the first Time  to disobey your Commands   In answer to your Inquiry after mine and my Pet s Health  I must tell you  you have been very near losing both  since you left us  I attribute my Illness to the irregular Way we lived in  the four last Days you were in Town  I was seized on Monday Night with all the Symptoms of a violent Fever  I raved incessantly  and did not recover my Senses  till Tuesday  Polly sent an Express to Town  but no one came near us  till Wednesday  I went thro  all the necessary Operations  and am now  thank God  very well  I came to Town Yesterday  and shall return no more  Poor little Bab has had two Convulsion Fits  the last was very near carrying him off  They did not let me know of his Illness   till I came to Town  He is vastly altered  but I hope  and believe  he will recover  You may judge  by your own  the Anxiety I feel for him   I am vastly delighted with your Sentiments in regard to our future Consciousness  as they are  in my Mind  highly conformable to Reason and Religion  But I am still more charmed with Page  297 them  as they corroborate my darling Hope  that we shall see  know  and converse with each other in a future State  For certainly  if we retain a Consciousness of the Affections and Actions of this Life  we shall likewise retain the Idea of those Persons  who were the Cause of those Actions  for which we are to be punished or rewarded  The only Thing  I ever heard objected to this Opinion  is  that such Remembrances might lessen the Happiness of those blessed Spirits  who may  in this Life  be connected by natural or acquired Ties to Persons  who are to make up the Number of the Unhappy  in the next  To this I answer  from my own Belief and Hope  that no Soul will be doomed to everlasting Damnation  Or  if there should be such unhappy Beings  the Heinousness of those Crimes  which deserve everlasting Misery  would entirely erase the Affection or Regard we bore them  unknowing of their Guilt  and make us readily acknowledge  when purged from gross and selfish Passions  that their Doom is just  I cannot think  that  even in this Life  there ever did  or will subsist  a real Friendship  or sincere Affection between the Good and Bad  Virtue alone is the sure Basis  that can make those Unions firm and lasting  Without that only true Foundation  like Estcourt s Guests    Page  298  They part in Time —  Whoever hears this my instructive Song —  For  tho  such Friendships may be dear   They ne er continue long   I have not wrote these Lines right  but  tis no great Matter  I have only altered the Form  the Sense remains     I received two Letters from you Yesterday  The Compliment  you pay to my Understanding  is more justly due to you  than me  If I am sensible  or intelligent  it is you have made me so  The fond Desire of gaining your Approbation first rouzed me to exert the little Powers  which Nature lent me  Your Converse  your Letters have improved my Mind  and given my Thoughts a Turn superior to the Trifles  which employ the Generality of my Sex  Yet still I plead no Merit from this Boast  for such a Preceptor must have improved the dullest Pupil  It is you  my charming Guide  who have made me  as far as I am either  wise or good  You have illustrated your Theory by Practice  and  by your dear Example  shewn me what it is to be a Christian and
