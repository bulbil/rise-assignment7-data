was soon taken  and converted against her  but  though so unequally matched  captain Death maintained a furious engagement that cannot be paralleled in the annals of any country  The French commander and his second were killed  with two thirds of his company  but much more dreadful was the slaughter on board the Terrible  When the enemy boarded it  they only found one scene of slaughter  silence  and desolation  Of two hundred men only sixteen were found remaining  and the ship itself so shattered as scarcely to be kept above water     251 Such were the dear bought naval victories of France  and such was the obstinacy of the English  even when defeated  that the court of Versailles  at length  seemed to demand peace at any rate  To this request the English were ready to accede  and Plenipotentiaries were sent from either court to negociate so wished for a reconciliation  France sent to London Mr  Bussy  a man rather skilled in the arts of negotiation than the open integrity becoming the minister of a great nation  England sent over  in exchange  Mr  Stanley  to Paris   It seemed to be a fundamental principle in this treaty  which  however  proved ineffectual  that each country was to be considered as possessors of their respective conquests  and that if any such were to be given up on one side  it was to be only in exchange for such as had been made by the other  Upon these terms it is obvious  that the English were likely to be great gainers by a treaty  as they had taken several places and dominions from the French  and had lost only Minorca  Whether the French had a real desire to proceed upon such terms is uncertain  however  they soon gave the English ministry sufficient reasons to be dissatisfied with their proceedings  Mr  Pitt  who had for a long time been successful  actuated all the English measures  and guided their councils  had ever disdained that pedantry of political refinement  of which others so vainly boasted  he negociated therefore in a plain simple manner  his guide  sincerity  and his only object  his country s good  Several points were agreed upon between each nation  that gave great hopes that an accommodation might speedily be the result  The French agreed to give up all Canada  a fort upon the river Senegal in Africa  and to restore Minorca  The chief objects in debate were  the privilege they claimed of continuing to fish upon the Banks of Newfoundland  and of having the damages repaired which they   252 sustained by the taking of their shipping before a declaration of war  These two points were warmly negotiated on either side  not without hopes of speedy adjustment  when  unexpectedly  the whole treaty was  at once  set aside by the interposition of the Spanish minister  who desired to have the interests of Spain also included in the treaty  Mr  Pitt very justly considered  that as Spain had no part in the war  so it was impertinent in that power to intermeddle in a treaty of peace  and he regarded this interposition in its true light  namely  that of a confederacy between France and Spain mutually to support each other s interest  Confident therefore of his own integrity  and  perhaps  also too much elated by popular applause  he began to treat the French negotiator with a great share of haughtiness  of which he complained to his court at home  and he was soon recalled   This conduct of Mr  Pitt might have justly incurred reproach  had he had no private intimations of a secret alliance between France and Spain  The last named power had actually entered into a family compact with France  by which they engaged to carry on a war in conjunction  Of all this the English secretary had been previously apprized  and proposed in the privy council to anticipate the designs of Spain by an immediate declaration of war against her  Vigour  dispatch  and resolution  characterized all the plans of this minister  he found  however  in the privy council men who were willing to act with more deliberation  and who desired a certainty of offence before they demanded a reparation  Spain  they said  has yet given no certain proofs of their hostile intentions  and the English minister at the court of Madrid still continues to assure us of their pacific intentions  These remonstrances were answered by the secretary  but without producing the desired conviction  seeing himself therefore almost singular in his   253 opinion  he was resolved to leave an assembly wher he knew himself maligned  and he threw up the di¦rection of measures  which  to use his own expression  he was no longer allowed to guide  The council was  at that time  divided between two parties  who were both equally pleased at his resignation  One part consisted of those who were at the head of affairs during the preceding reign  the other such as had been taken into favour in this  neither were displeased at the removal of a man whose popularity threw them into the shade  and whose vehemence controlled their moderation  But this popular minister s being removed  did not restore unanimity to the council  The parts which were held together by his presence  now disunited
