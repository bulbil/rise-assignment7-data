followed them in their levity  I returned raillery for ridicule  and not always  as you know  unsuccessfully  but still they renewed the charge  and we had the same arguments one day to refute  that the preceding were given up  They could not convince me  nor I them   I quit therefore  yet not without regret  the society I cannot meet with pleasure  But let not my Jeronymo renounce me  In his opinion I had the honour to stand high  before I was prevailed upon to be introduced to them  we cultivated  with mutual pleasure  each other s acquaintance  independent of this association  Let us be to each other  what we were for the first month of our intimacy  You have noble qualities  but are diffident  and too often suffer yourself to be influenced by men of talents inferior to your own   The ridicule they have aimed at  has weakened  perhaps  the force of the arguments that I wished to   202 have a more than temporary effect on your heart  Permit me to remind you on paper  of some of them  and urge to you others  The end I have in view is your good  in hopes to confirm  by the efficacy they may have on you  my own principles  Nor think me too serious  The occasion  the call that true friendship makes upon you  is weighty   You have shewed me Letters from your noble father  from your mother  from the pious prelate your brother  and others from your uncle  and still  if possible  more admirable ones  from your sister—All filled with concern for your present and future welfare  How dearly is my Jeronymo beloved by his whole family  and by such a family  And how tenderly does he love them all—What ought to be the result  Jeronymo cannot be ungrateful  He knows so well what belongs to the character of a dutiful son  an affectionate brother  that I will not attempt to enforce their arguments upon him   By the endeavours of my friend to find excuses for some of the liberties in which he allows himself  I infer  that if he thought them criminal  he has too much honour to be guilty of them  He cannot say  with the mad Medea    —Video meliora proboque   Deteriora sequor —  No  His judgment must be misled  before he can allow himself in a deviation  But let him beware  for has not every saulty inclination something to plead in its own behalf —Excuses  my dear friend  are more than tacit confessions  And the health of the mind  as of the body  is impaired by almost imperceptible degrees     My Jeronymo has pleaded  and justly may he boast of  a disposition to benevolence  charity  generosity—What pity  that he cannot be still more perfect —that he resolves not against meditated injuries   203 to others of his fellow creatures  But remember my Lord  that true goodness is an uniform thing  and will alike influence every part of a man s conduct  and that true generosity will not be confined to obligations  either written or verbal   Besides  who  tho  in the least guilty instance  and where some false virtue may offer colours to palliate an excess  can promise himself to stop  when once he has thrown the reins on the neck of lawless appetite  And may I not add  that my Jeronymo is not in his own power  He suffers himself to be a led man —O that he would choose his company anew  and be a leader  Every virtue  then  that warms his heart  would have a sister virtue to encourage the noble flame  instead of a vice to damp it   Justly do you boast of the nobility of your descent  of the excellence of every branch of your family  Bear with my question  my Lord  Are you determined to sit down satisfied with the honour of your ancestors  Your progenitors  and every one of your family  have given you reason to applaud their worthiness  Will you not give them cause to boast of yours   In answer to the earnest entreaties of all your friends  that you will marry  you have said  that  were women angels  you would with joy enter into the state—But what ought the men to be  who form upon women such expectations   Can you  my dear Lord  despise matrimony  yet hold it to be a sacrament  Can you  defying the maxims of your family  and wishing to have the Sister I have heard you mention with such high delight and admiration  strengthen your family interest in the female line  determine against adding to its strength in the male   You have suffered yourself to speak with contempt of the generality of the Italian women  for their illiterateness  Let not their misfortune be imputed to them  my noble friend  as their fault  They have the   204 same natural genius s that used to distinguish the men and women of your happy climate  Let not the want of cultivation induce you  a learned man  to hold them cheap  The cause of virtue  and of the sex  can hardly be separated   But
