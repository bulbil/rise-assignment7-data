till noon  take a turn  and come back about that time   I departed  and walked about town all the morning  incessantly meditating on the reception my uncle would give me  I think  said I within myself  he will be overjoyed to see me  I measured his feelings by my own  and prepared myself for a very affecting discovery  I returned punctually to the appointed hour  You are just in time  said the servant  my master was going out  Wait here a moment  I will announce you  With these words  he left me in the ante chamber  He returned almost immediately  and showed me into his master s room  The face struck me all at once as a family likeness  To be sure he was the very image of my uncle Thomas  they might have been taken for twins  I bowed down to the ground  and introduced myself as the son of Master Nicholas de la Fuenta  the barber of Olm√©do  I likewise informed him  that I had been working at my father s trade in Madrid  for these three weeks  as a journeyman  and intended making the tour of Spain to complete my education  While I was speaking  my uncle was evidently in a brown study  He seemed to doubt whether he should disown me at once  or get rid of me with some little sacrifice to decency  The latter course he adopted  Affecting the affable  Well  my good kinsman  how are your father and your uncles  Do they get on in the world  I began thereupon by laying before him the family knack at propagation  All the children  male and female  called over by their names  with their godfathers and godmothers included in the list  He took no extravagant interest in the particulars of my tale  but leading to his own purposes  Diego  replied he  I am quite of your mind  You should go from place to place  and see a variety of practice  I would not have you tarry longer at Madrid  it is a very dangerous residence for youth  you may get into bad habits  my sweet fellow  Other towns will suit you better  the state of society in the provinces is more patriarchal and philosophical  Determine on emigration  and when your departure is fixed  come and take your leave  I will contribute a pistole to the tour of Spain  With this kind assurance  he handed me out of the room  and sent me packing   I had not worldly wisdom enough to find out that he wanted to get quit of me  I went back to our shop  and gave my master an account of the visit I had paid  He looked no deeper than myself into Signor Don Pedro s motives  and observed  I cannot help differing from your worthy uncle  so far from advising you to travel the provinces  the real thing would be  in my opinion  to give you a comfortable settlement in this city  He is hand in glove with the first people  it is an easy matter for him to establish you in a great family  and that is a for tune at once  Struck with this lucky discovery  which seemed to settle the point without difficulty  I called on my uncle again two days afterwards  and made a proposal to him for a situation about some leading character at court  But the hint was not taken kindly  A proud man  living at free quarters among the great  and dining with them in a family party  did not exactly wish that  while he was sitting at my lord s table  his nephew should be a guest in the servants  hall  Little Diego might bring a scandal on Signor Don Pedro  He had no hesitation  therefore  in fairly turning me out of doors  and that with a flea in my ear  What  you little rascal  said he in a fit of extravagance  do you mean to relinquish your calling  Begone  I consign you to the reptile whose pernicious counsels will be your ruin  Take your leave of these premises  and never set your foot on them again  or you shall have the reception you deserve  I was absolutely stunned at this language  and still more at the peremptory tone my uncle assumed  With tears in my eyes I withdrew  quite overcome by his severity  Yet  as I had always been lively and confident in my temper  I soon wiped away my tears  My grief was even turned into resentment  and I determined to take no further notice of this unnatural relative  whose kind offices I had hitherto been contented to want   My attention was henceforth directed to the cultivation of my professional talent  I was quite a plodding fellow at my trade  I scraped away all day  and in the evening  by way of relief to my scraping  I twanged the guitar  My master on that instrument was an old Senor Escudero whom I shaved  He taught me music in return  and he was an adept  To be sure he had formerly been a chorister in a cathedral  His name was Marcos de Obregon  He was a man of the world  with good natural parts and acquired knowledge  which jointly induced
