refuses any favour to me  and threatens to pistol me the moment he sees me  That s to be my reward   We were four at setting out from Paddington  but one of the servants was dispatch d to prepossess an old servant of Sir Hargrave s mother  at Colnebrooke  who keeps there a kind of haberdashery shop  and where he proposed to get some refreshment for the lady  if he could make her take any  For my part I wonder how she kept out of fits on the road  She had enow of them at Paddington   The two servants who staid about Sir Hargrave  are discharged with all the marks of indignation that a master incensed by such a disappointment could express  and  as I said before  he is resolved to pistol me the moment he sees me  Yet I too well served him for the peace of my conscience   A coach and four was ordered to carry the widow and her two daughters to Reading  to the New Inn there  where they were to reside for a week or so  till   246 all was blown over  and that they might be out of the way of answering questions  And my brother Awberry  as I call him  and hope to make him  for he is a very honest man  was to go to them there   And there  in all probability  had Sir Hargrave succeeded  and been as good as his word  should I have been the husband of as tender hearted a young woman as any in the parish she lives in   Here is a very long letter  may it please you  Sir  I have shortened it however as much as I could  But in hatred to myself  and the vile ways I have  by excess of good nature  and by meeting with wicked masters  been drawn into—For the clearing of my sister s character  who lives in credit among her neighbours  and of every other person who might otherwise have been suspected—In justice to Mrs  Awberry s  and her two daughters  and her son s characters—And in justice so far to Sir Hargrave s  as that he intended marriage  and had he not  he would have found no friends in his designs at Paddington  and so far as to clear him of having not offered the least incivility to my lady— Had he intended  or been provoked so to do  he was too well watch d by the widow  and her daughters  to have been permitted  and that by my own request  which was  that they should be ready to run in whenever they heard her cry out  and that they would not leave Sir Hargrave alone with my Lady for six minutes  till their hands were joined in wedlock —In justice I say to all these persons  I thought proper thus to give you  Sir  all that I knew relating to this wicked transaction  And if  may it please your honour  I were to be taken up  I could say no more before a magistrate  except this  which I had like to have forgot  which is  that had it not been for me  some mischief might have been done  between Sir Hargrave s servants and yours  if not to your honour s person   All that I most humbly beg  is  the pardon of so   247 sweet a lady  I have chosen  ever to be honoured Sir  to write to you  whose goodness is so generally talk d of  and who have so nobly redeemed and protected her  Mr  Reeves  I know  has suffered too much in his mind to forgive me  He is a worthy gentleman  I am sorry for the disturbance I have given him  I have hopes given me  that I shall get employment on the Keys  or as a tide waiter extraordinary   Please the Lord  I will never  never more  be the tool of wicked masters  All I wish for is  to be able to do justice to the love of an honest young woman  and I am resolved  whether so enabled or not  to starve  rather than to go any more  no  not for a single hour  into the service of the iniquitous gentlemen I have so often named in this long Letter   If I might be assured  that I may pursue unmolested  any honest calling  so as that I may not be tempted or driven into unhappy courses  my heart would be at rest   There might have been murder in this affair  That shocks me to think of  O Sir  good  excellent  brave  and the most worthy of gentlemen  you have given to me as great a deliverance  as you have to the lady  Yea  greater  for mine may be a deliverance  if I make a proper use of it  of soul as well as body  Which God grant  as also your honour s health and prosperity  to the prayers of  Your Honour s ever devoted Humble Servant  WILLIAM WILSON   I thought I had something else to say  Something it is of high importance  Your life is threatened  Sir  God preserve your precious life  Amen     248
