wherefore  Lord  Raymond is to wed the widow of the Earl  Why then this concealment   unless he purposes to destroy the young heir  I know the soul of Grey   and though he be my brother  our souls are not allied  I dread his  temper  Nature formed him stern and cruel  nor do I doubt but that he  may easily be wrought upon to act a deed of blood  But shall my humble  dwelling be made the scene of murder  of an infant s murder         —      His wife here began to chide his jealous fears  but they seemed to have  taken too deep root in his mind to be easily removed             What  tho  my house should not be made the place of execution         said this good man       What  though they should not proceed to the utmost pitch of cruelty   Their purpose cannot be honest  and I am made their accomplice by  concealing him         —I had heard enough  and now  I busily revolved this alarming discourse         It was evident that the son of my preserver was exposed to  danger—perhaps abandoned by his widow— pardon  me  Lord William  if my suspicion was rash and ungentle —certainly  concealed for some mysterious purpose  A stranger seemed to pity and to  fear for him  What then became a friend  What was the part of Les  Roches  Were his father still alive  Heaven hath now enabled me to  restore him to his arms  but  if he really hath perished  surely it must  be my care to protect and cherish this boy  to form the unhappy orphan  to honour and virtue  to make him worthy of his illustrious descent   and enable him  in due time  to assert his native rights         —Thus I reasoned  and       rising with the early dawn  summoned my followers  communicated this  important discovery  and desired their counsel and assistance  They  readily concurred in the design of rescuing the young Lord from his  present danger  By their advice I waited the appearance of our host  I  accosted him gently  and led him on to discourse of his situation  his  condition  his friends and his country  He answered me without reserve    till I at length mentioned the name of Earl William  and asked if he  could inform me of the fortunes of this Lord  and his noble house  He  started  and answered  hesitating and confused  I at once sternly told  him  I was no stranger to the designs formed against the young heir of  that house  that  as I had been a friend to the father  I resolved to be  a protector to the son  who  I knew  was concealed under this roof  If  he would consent to give him up peaceably into my hands  the service  should be duly rewarded  if not—I had force sufficient to rescue him  from danger  The man trembled  and  without delay  resigned his charge  into my hands —And now was my mind possessed with new fears and  scruples  Methought I had been too rash  A mother s tenderness   perhaps  hath concealed this Boy  and for a weighty cause  no doubt  How  then shall the news of this violent removal afflict her soul  What  terrors must she feel  Yet  still  upon mature reflection  I deemed it  the safest course to convey this  youth to Marlborough  where I hoped to gain such intelligence as might  direct my future conduct  Thither we bent our course  and  near this  place  did I receive those joyful tidings  which brought me to deliver  up my dear charge into his father s care          From my soul I thank thee   replied the Earl —        Yet hath thy tale renewed some doubts and suspicions —but let  suspicions sleep till to morrow         Then  starting up earnestly  he asked with a loud voice       Who of my brave followers will undertake the charge of repairing  instantly to Cornwall  bearing to the fair Jacqueline the chearing news  of her father s arrival  and conveying her to my castle         Fitzalan stood forth  and with five more who defied toil and fatigue   insisted that this pleasing charge should be intrusted to them  They  departed  each fresh and vigorous  as the sturdy hind that rises to his  morning labours  And now Lord William  turning kindly towards Les  Roches  attempted once more to speak his joy and gratitude  But suddenly  his voice failed  his cheeks grew pale  a cold dew issued from his  pores  his whole frame was disordered  and he sunk faintly down  The
