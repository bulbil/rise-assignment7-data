and fortune  idly with one another    During his residence in Holland  he had made himself acquainted with  the best authors in the French language  so that he was able to share  in their conversation  a circumstance from which he found great benefit     6 22 15  3 45 PM   for it not only improved him in his knowledge of that tongue  but also  tended to the enlargement of his acquaintance  in the course of which he  contracted intimacies in some families of good fashion  especially those  of the long robe  which would have enabled him to pass his time very  agreeably  had he been a little easier in point of fortune  But his  finances  notwithstanding the most rigid economy  being in a few months  reduced to a very low ebb  the prospect of indigence threw a damp upon  all his pleasures  though he never suffered himself to be thereby in any  degree dispirited  being in that respect of so happy a disposition  that  conscious poverty or abundance made very slight impressions upon his  mind  This consumption of his cash  however  involved him in some  perplexity  and he deliberated with himself  whether he should return to  General Collier  or repair to London  where he might possibly fall  into some business not unbecoming a gentleman  though he was very much  mortified to find himself incapable of gratifying an inordinate desire  which possessed him of making the grand tour  or  at least  of visiting  the southern parts of France    While he thus hesitated between different suggestions  he was one  morning visited by a gentleman who had sought and cultivated his  friendship  and for whom he had done a good office  in supporting him  with spirit against a brutal German  with whom he had an affair of  honour  This gentleman came to propose a party for a fortnight  to  Fontainebleau  where the court then was  and the proposal being declined  by M   with more than usual stiffness  his friend was very urgent to  know the reason of his refusal  and at length  with some confusion   said   Perhaps your finances are low   M   replied  that he had  wherewithal to defray the expense of his journey to London  where he  could be furnished with a fresh supply  and this answer was no sooner  made  than the other taking him by the hand   My dear friend   said he    I am not unacquainted with your affairs  and would have offered you my  credit long ago  if I had thought it would be acceptable  even now  I do  not pretend to give you money  but desire and insist upon it  that you  will accept of the loan of these two pieces of paper  to be repaid when  you marry a woman with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds  or obtain an  employment of a thousand a year   So saying  he presented him with two  actions of above two thousand livres each    M   was astonished at this unexpected instance of generosity  in a  stranger  and  with suitable acknowledgment  peremptorily refused to  incur such an obligation  but at length he was  by dint of importunity  and warm expostulation  prevailed upon to accept one of the actions  on  condition that the gentleman would take his note for the sum  and this  he absolutely rejected  until M   promised to draw upon him for double  the value or more  in case he should at any time want a further supply   This uncommon act of friendship and generosity  afterwards had an  opportunity to repay tenfold  though he could not help regretting the  occasion  on his friend s account  That worthy man having  by placing  too much confidence in a villainous lawyer  and a chain of other  misfortunes  involved himself and his amiable lady in a labyrinth of  difficulties  which threatened the total ruin of his family  M   felt  the inexpressible satisfaction of delivering his benefactor from the  snare    Being thus reinforced by the generosity of his friend  M   resolved to  execute his former plan of seeing the south of France  together with the  sea ports of Spain  as far as Cadiz  from whence he proposed to take a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   passage for London by sea  and  with this view  sent forward his trunks  by the diligence to Lyons  determined to ride post  in order to enjoy a  better view of the country  and for the conveniency of stopping at those  places where there was anything remarkable to be seen or inquired into   While he was employed in taking leave of his Parisian friends  who  furnished him with abundant recommendation  a gentleman of his own  country  who spoke little or no French  hearing of his intention   begged the favour of accompanying him in his expedition  With this new  companion  therefore  he set out for Lyons  where he was perfectly well
