thing I had ever conceived of the inhabitants in bliss  Her eyes   swam in glory  and her whole form seemed a condensing  or sub    stantiation   of harmony and light      While I gazed in silent astonishment  I heard another voice say   Don t you know us  my son  my dear Mr  Clinton   Don t you   remember your pupils  Don t you remember your blind  lame    and tawny Lewis   He is now turned into that passable girl there    whose honour and whose life you yesterday preserved  at the great   peril of your own      Here  seizing her hand  I pressed it to my lips and cried Am I   then so blessed  my honoured madam  as to have done some service   to the two dearest objects of my heart s fixed affections  Soft    says she   none of these transports   your surgeon tells us that   repose is necessary for you  Mean time  we will go and prepare   the best regimen that the place can afford for your nourishment    and after that I will send a despatch to my lord  and let him know   how far  how very deeply  he and we  and all his house  are in    debted to you      For that day  and the following week  as my fever grew some    thing high  I saw no more of the daughter   and the mother stayed   no longer than to administer something to me  or barely to inquire   how I was  At length I got a cool  and began to recover  when   the former vision descended upon my ravished senses   the vision   of that Louisa  the sight of whom never failed to bring cheer to the   eyes  and delight to the hearts  of all beholders      They sat down by my side  and my lady  taking my hand and   looking tenderly at me  What would you think  said she  smiling    ot my Louy for a wife   Ah  madam   I exclaimed  she would be   too much of bliss  too precious  too glorious  too overpowering for   the heart and senses of any mortal   Don t tell me  cries my lady     in my eyes  my Harry  you are full as amiable for a husband as   she can be for a wife  Beside  you have earned her  my son   she   is your own dear purchase by a service of infinite value  and at   the price of your precious blood  She has told me the story of   your first love  and the recollection of it never fails to bring tears   from my eyes  But I must  hereafter  hear the whole from your   own mouth  with all your other adventures   the smallest incident   will be very interesting to me  I assure you  O my dear  my   sweet fellow  you are to a hair the very man I wish for my   Louisa the brave  the tender  gentle  and generous heart   just the   thing I would have wished for myself when I was at the age of my   Louy      But  my dearest  my honoured madam  loved and honoured next   to heaven  you have not yet told me how your Louisa is inclined     Whereupon the bewitching creature  archly smiling and blushing          376 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      and reaching forth a polished hand of living alabaster Here  she   cried  I present you with this trifle in token that I do not hate   you very much      Mr  Clinton  said my lady  I have sent off my favourite servant   Gerard with my despatches to my lord  He is the only one that   remains of all my retinue  Your surgeon has dressed his wound    and pronounced it so slight as not to incommode him in his journey    I chose him more particularly for the carrier of my purposes as he   was the witness of your valour as he can testify to my lord with   what intrepidity you rushed foremost into the thick of the assassins    and with what unexampled bravery you defeated  in a short time    a body of four or five times your number  These things  I trust    will have their due weight   for  though my lord is of a lofty and   inflexible nature  he is yet alive to the feelings of honour and jus    tice  so that our affairs have a hopeful and auspicious aspect  But   you are a little flushed  my child  we will not encroach further   upon you till to morrow
