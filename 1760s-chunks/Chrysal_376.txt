  they never meant to give  when they began to bid  That great   bargains are often got at such places is true  but that is chiefly in   a particular branch of the business  the mystery of which will be   explained to you          CHAPTER XLIII     OHKYSAL s MASTBE is visited by a COmiOISSEtrB  TO WHOM HE   GIVES A SHOET KEOEIPT HOW TO MAKE HIS PICTUEES SELL  A2TD   MAKES SOME STEIKINO EEMAEKS ON THE DISEBGABD PEOPLE   SHOW POK THE FAMILIES  WHICH SENDS HIS VISITOE AWAY IN A   HtlTP     My master was interrupted in his pleasing meditations by the   entrance of a gentleman  the sight of whom promised him the great    est pleasure of carrying the subject of them into execution  After   some judicious remarks on the taste of the town  and the present   state of virtu  in the course of which  each liberally complimented   the other    Pray  sir    said the gentleman    how do pictures sell   this season           Never better  sir    answered my master    Pictures are every    body s money now  A good master brings anything   and what   is more  I am convinced they will rise still higher  so that buyers   have no time to lose  I have a sale next week  when you will see   such prizes as will astonish you  There are some things there    that I know you will have  let them cost what they will   they suit   your fine collection so exactly          Why  as to that    replied the gentleman    my mind is a good   deal changed  I have taken it into my head lately to part with my   pictures  and have therefore called upon you to desire that you   will come in the morning  and let me know what you think they are   worth          Worth  sir   they are worth a great deal of money   which there   is not the least danger but they will bring  if they are managed   properly  There is more  sir  in the management of a sale  much   more than most people dream of  I assure you         I am sensible of that  sir   and also of your abilities in such   management  which you will have the best encouragement to   exert on this occasion  as I propose selling the whole to you   together  if we can agree        This turn came so unexpected that it struck my master quite   down in the mouth  as he was sensible that he had overshot him    self  and spoiled his market by saying so much    It is very un    lucky  sir    answered he  changing his note directly    that I did   not know your intention sooner  I could then have divided them   properly among the several sales of the season   but it is now quite   too late   this here one next week is the last   and the catalogues   for that are all made out and dispersed  so that there is no possibility   of slipping in a single article  Besides  the buyers have laid out   all their money            ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 463       Slipping in  sir  I do not understand you  Do not you think   my pictures are sufficient  both in number and value  to make a   sale by themselves   I am sure I have more than once known you   make noise enough about collections in no respect equal to mine    There must be some mystery in this  which I cannot comprehend        Very true  sir  there are mysteries  as you observe  in all busi    nesses   and  perhaps  in none more than ours          I am not inquiring into your mysteries  All I desire to know   is  why  after just telling me that pictures never bore so high a price   as at this time  and that mine could not fail of bringing a great deal   of money  you should so soon change your opinion          Pardon me  sir  I have not changed my opinion in the least     and shall be very proud to serve you to the best of my abilities  in   the way of a sale   but there is a material reason why I must beg   to be excused in buying them  to stand the hazard of it myself
