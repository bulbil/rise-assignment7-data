but few Letters to put in it  the case is filled with bits and ends of ribbands  patterns  and so forth  of all manner of colours  faded and fresh  with intermingledoms of gold beaters skin  plaisters for a cut finger  for a chopt lip  a kibe  perhaps for corns  which she dispenses occasionally very bountifully  and values herself  as we see at such times by a double chin made triple  for being not unuseful in her generation  Chide me  if you will  the humour s upon me  hang me  if I care  You are only Harriet Byron  as yet  Change your name  and increase your consequence   I have written a long Letter already  and to what end  Only to expose myself  say you  True enough  But now  Harriet  to bribe you into passing a milder censure  let me tell you all I can pick up from the Doctor  relating to my brother s matters  Bribe shall I call this  or gratitude  for your free communications   Matters between the Mansfields and the Keelings are brought very forward  Hang particulars  Nobody s affairs lie near my heart  but yours  The two families have already begun to visit  When my brother returns  all the gentry in the neighbourhood are to be invited  to rejoice with the parties on the occasion   Be so kind  my dear  as to dismiss the good man  as soon as your punctilio will admit  We are contented  that while he lays himself out so much in the   169 service of others  he should do something for himself  You  my dear  we look upon as a high reward for his many great and good actions  But as he is a man who has a deep sense of favours granted  and values not the blessing the more  when it ought to be within his reach  because it is dear  as is the case of the sorry fellows in general  I would have you consider of it—that s all   The Doctor tells me  also  that the wicked Bolton s ward is dead  and that every thing is included  to Sir Charles s satisfaction  with him  and the Mansfields  reinstated in all their rights  are once more a happy family   Sir Hargrave is in a lamentable way  Dr  Bartlett has great compassion for him  Would you have me pity him  Harriet —You would  you say—Well  then  I ll try for it  As it was by his means you and we  and my brother  came acquainted  I think I may  He is to be brought to town   Poor Sir Harry Beauchamp  He is past recovery  Had the physicians given him over when they first undertook him  he might  they say  have had a chance for it   I told you  that Emily s mother was turned Methodist  She has converted her husband  A strange alteration  But it is natural for such sort of people to pass from one extreme to another  Emily every now and then visits them  They are ready to worship her for her duty and goodness  She is a lovely girl  She every day improves in her person  as well as in her mind  She is sometimes with me  sometimes with Lady L  sometimes with aunt Eleanor  sometimes with your Mrs  Reeves—We are ready to fight for her  But you will soon rob all of us  She is preparing for her journey to you  Poor girl  I pity her  Such a conflict in her mind  between her love of you  and tenderness for her guardian  Her Anne has confessed to me  that she weeps one half of the night    170 yet forces herself to be lively in company—After the example of Miss Byron  she says  when she visited you at Selby house  I hope  my dear  all will be right  But to go to live with a beloved object—I don t understand it  You  Harriet  may  I never was in Love  God help me   I am afraid the dear girl does too much for her mother  As they have so handsome an annuity  400 l  a year  so much beyond their expectation  I think she should not give  nor should they receive  any thing considerable of her  without her guardian s knowlege  She is laying out a great deal of money in new cloaths  to do you and her guardian credit—on your nuptials  poor thing  she says  with tears in her eyes—but whether of joy  or sensibility  it is hard to decide  but I believe of both   What makes me imagine she does more than she should  is  that a week ago she borrowed fifty guineas of me  and but yesterday came to me—I should do a very wrong thing  said she  blushing up to the ears  should I ask Lady L  to lend me a sum of money till my next quarter comes due  after I made myself your debtor so lately  But if you could lend me thirty or forty guineas more  you would do me a great favour   My dear  said I
