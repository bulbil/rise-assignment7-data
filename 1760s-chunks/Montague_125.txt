       Her heart was tender  but had never met an object which seemed worthy of it  her sentiments were disinterested  and romantic to excess        Her father was  at that time  in Holland  whither the death of a relation  who had left him a small estate  had called him  we were alone  unprotected  delivered up to the unhappy inexperience of youth  mistresses of our own conduct  myself  the eldest of the two  but just eighteen  when my Sophia s ill fate conducted Sir Charles Verville to the ball where she first saw him        He danced with her  and endeavored to recommend himself by all those little unmeaning  but flattering attentions  by which our credulous sex are so often misled  his manner was tender  yet timid  modest  respectful  his eyes were continually fixed on her  but when he met hers  artfully cast down  as if afraid of offending        He asked permission to enquire after her health the next day  he came  he was enchanting  polite  lively  soft  insinuating  adorned with every outward grace which could embellish virtue  or hide vice from view  to see and to love him was almost the same thing        He entreated leave to continue his visits  which he found no difficulty in obtaining  during two months  not a day passed without our seeing him  his behaviour was such as would scarce have alarmed the most suspicious heart  what then could be expected of us  young  sincere  totally ignorant of the world  and strongly prejudiced in favor of a man  whose conversation spoke his soul the abode of every virtue        Blushing I must own  nothing but the apparent preference he gave to my lovely friend  could have saved my heart from being a prey to the same tenderness which ruined her        He addressed her with all the specious arts which vice could invent to seduce innocence  his respect  his esteem  seemed equal to his passion  he talked of honor  of the delight of an union where the tender affections alone were consulted  wished for her father s return  to ask her of him in marriage  pretended to count impatiently the hours of his absence  which delayed his happiness  he even prevailed on her to write her father an account of his addresses        New to love  my Sophia s young heart too easily gave way to the soft impression  she loved  she idolized this most base of mankind  she would have thought it a kind of sacrilege to have had any will in opposition to his         After some months of unremitted assiduity  her father being expected in a few days  he dropped a hint  as if by accident  that he wished his fortune less  that he might be the more certain he was loved for himself alone  he blamed himself for this delicacy  but charged it on excess of love  vowed he would rather die than injure her  yet wished to be convinced her fondness was without reserve        Generous  disinterested  eager to prove the excess and sincerity of her passion  she fell into the snare  she agreed to go off with him  and live some time in a retirement where she was to see only himself  after which he engaged to marry her publicly        He pretended extasies at this proof of affection  yet hesitated to accept it  and  by piquing the generosity of her soul  which knew no guile  and therefore suspected none  led her to insist on devoting herself to wretchedness         In order  however  that this step might be as little known as possible  as he pretended the utmost concern for that honor he was contriving to destroy  it was agreed between them  that he should go immediately to London  and that she should follow him  under pretence of a visit to a relation at some distance  the greatest difficulty was  how to hide this design from me         She had never before concealed a thought from her beloved Fanny  nor could he now have prevailed on her to deceive me  had he not artfully perswaded her I was myself in love with him  and that  therefore  it would be cruel  as well as imprudent  to trust me with the secret        Nothing shews so strongly the power of love  in absorbing every faculty of the soul  as my dear Sophia s being prevailed on to use art with the friend most dear to her on earth        By an unworthy piece of deceit  I was sent to a relation for some weeks  and the next day Sophia followed her infamous lover  leaving letters for me and her father  calculated to perswade us  they were privately married        My distress  and that of the unhappy parent  may more easily be conceived than described  severe by nature  he cast her from his heart and fortune for ever  and settled his estate on a nephew  then at the university        As to me  grief and tenderness were the only sensations I felt
