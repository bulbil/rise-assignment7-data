I had got out of the elm walk  and   into the great road  I could hardly think but I was in a dream all the   time  A few hours before  in my master s arms almost  with twenty kind   things said to me  and a generous concern for the misfortunes he had   brought upon me  and only by one rash half word exasperated against   me  and turned out of doors  at an hour s warning  and all his kindness   changed to hate  And I now  from three o clock to five  several miles   off  But if I am going to you  all will be well again  I hope       Lack a day  what strange creatures are men  gentlemen  I should say    rather  For  my dear deserving good mother  though poverty be both your   lots  has had better hap  and you are  and have always been  blest in   one another   Yet this pleases me too  he was so good  he would not let   Mrs  Jewkes speak ill of me  and scorned to take her odious unwomanly   advice  O  what a black heart has this poor wretch  So I need not rail   against men so much  for my master  bad as I have thought him  is not   half so bad as this woman   To be sure she must be an atheist   Do you   think she is not       We could not reach further than this little poor place and sad alehouse    rather than inn  for it began to be dark  and Robin did not make so much   haste as he might have done  and he was forced to make hard shift for   his horses       Mr  Colbrand  and Robert too  are very civil  I see he has got my   portmanteau lashed behind the coach  I did not desire it  but I shall   not come quite empty       A thorough riddance of me  I see   Bag and baggage  as Mrs  Jewkes says    Well  my story surely would furnish out a surprising kind of novel  if   it was to be well told       Mr  Robert came up to me  just now  and begged me to eat something  I   thanked him  but said  I could not eat  I bid him ask Mr  Colbrand to   walk up  and he came  but neither of them would sit  nor put their hats   on  What mockado is this  to such a poor soul as I  I asked them  if   they were at liberty to tell me the truth of what they were to do with   me  If not  I would not desire it   They both said  Robin was ordered   to carry me to my father s  and Mr  Colbrand was to leave me within ten   miles  and then strike off for the other house  and wait till my master   arrived there  They both spoke so solemnly  that I could not but believe   them       But when Robin went down  the other said  he had a letter to give me   next day at noon  when we baited  as we were to do  at Mrs  Jewkes s   relation s   May I not  said I  beg the favour to see it to night  He   seemed so loath to deny me  that I have hopes I shall prevail on him by   and by       Well  my dear father and mother  I have got the letter  on great   promises of secrecy  and making no use of it  I will try if I can open   it without breaking the seal  and will take a copy of it by and by  for   Robin is in and out  there being hardly any room in this little house   for one to be long alone  Well  this is the letter           When these lines are delivered to you  you will be far on your way to   your father and mother  where you have so long desired to be  and  I   hope  I shall forbear thinking of you with the least shadow of that   fondness my foolish heart had entertained for you  I bear you  however    no ill will  but the end of my detaining you being over  I would not   that you should tarry with me an hour more than needed  after the   ungenerous preference you gave  at a time that I was inclined to pass   over all other considerations  for an honourable address to you  for   well I found the tables entirely turned upon me  and that I was in   far more danger from
