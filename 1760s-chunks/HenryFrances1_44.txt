Cure is painful  it is possible  According to your idle Definition of Love  it is plain  I never was possessed of your s  there is not any Thing nouvelle in this Discovery  that Point has long been clear to me  nor has it been in my Power  for a vast While past  tho  I took great Pains   to impose upon myself  with Regard to your Sentiments for me  For this Reason  I have ever been an earnest Advocate for your Friendship  and still continue to desire it  which I think the highest Compliment I can pay you  as it is the strongest Proof of mine     Capt  — is to be married this Night to Miss —  I hear they set out for — Tomorrow  if so  I suppose you ll be so much engaged  that I shall not see you  If it is inconvenient  I beg you will not stir one Step towards me  nor idly fancy  I shall take your Absence ill  as you may be perfectly assured that no Action  or Omission of your future Life  can either add to  or take from the calm settled Regard I have now  and ever shall retain  for your Happiness and Welfare  I am  while   148 you continue to desire I should be so  and much longer than you deserve    Your real Friend  and most obedient Servant  Frances   LETTER LXXXV   Dear FANNY   YOU may see by the Badness of my Paper  that I have not waited to get home  before I indulged myself in the Privilege  you have given me  of writing to you  I am now at —  where Parson — lately lived  and where your Friend s Brother is now beneficed  This Paper is good enough to write Sermons on  that  when they are applied to their most general Use  there may be but little Cost  and perhaps it is the fitter for me too  lest  should I send you better  the Messenger might be more worth than the Message  tho   by it  I  with all Sincerity  commend my Love to you  corrected  and amended from the Errors of the former Edition  the Impression still remaining the same  which  tho  the Type is small  I still retain  for the Fairness and Beauty of the Character     149The Gentleman  I am now with  is a Person  I contracted a Friendship with  several Years ago  upon a certain Sympathy I observed between us  in three remarkable Particulars  An Aversion to Matrimony  a splenetick Cast of Mind  and an unsociable Impatience at Fools  But  tho  the Effects are equally visible in us both  they are owing to very different Causes in each of us  The First proceeds  in him  from an habitual Disregard to Women   for I can never allow that to be natural to any Man   In me  it proceeds from an Apprehension of not meeting Success with a Woman of Merit and Fortune  and  to take off the Merit of such Humility  I make myself Amends by the Pride of not hazarding a Refusal  The Second he has from a strong saturnine Complexion  which was born with him  but I have contracted that  gloomy Habit of Soul  from the many Mortifications and Disappointments I have met with  almost ever since I was born  The Third proceeds  in him  as a Man of Sense  from a strong Antipathy he has naturally to such Animals  joined to a generous Concern  and honest Pride  that Providence  who could make such a Mn as him  should suffer such imperfect Essays of human Nature to slip unfinished thro  his Hands  but I am shocked at Fools  perhaps as a Person  deformed by Nature  or rendered o   150 by Disease  may be  at the Sight of his own Picture on Canvass  or in the Glass   You see how occasionally I am led into a Description of my own Character  which  as it was Part of your Injunction to me  you may perceive how strong an Impression your Commands make on my Mind  that I am naturally led to obey them  even when I don t particularly intend it  but  when I finish the Remainder of your Request  I must sit down on deliberate Purpose for it  as I despair of meeting any where  save in my own Heart  a Semblance  good enough  to draw your Likeness from   I now claim your Promise  my dear Fanny  of speaking with Freedom some Things  which you hesitated once or twice about  the few  and very short Times  I was in your Company  the last Time I was in Town  I shall be at home by the Return of the Post   I am   my dear agreeable Girl   sincerely and affectionately  Your s   LETTER LXXXVI   Dear FANNY   I AM glad to hear you are out of Danger  and wish you were as much out of Apprehension   151 too  You wrong me — I never was so ill bred  as to charge you with Strength of Body  or
