 on this first visit  I only wanted to see you  and to converse with you a little  that I might make report accordingly to my son  who  however  knows not that I should pay my compliments   79 to you  But the moment I saw you  your aspect confirmed all that I had heard said in your favour  and seeing you also so much caressed by two ladies of characters so establish d  and no less pleased with what I observed of Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  You are a family of good people   I was resolved to be as frank as you are  and as your aunt Selby has been—She is a good woman—  Indeed  madam  she is—  Accordingly  I have singled you out  in the face of every body present—You will have the discretion to caution them on this subject  till you have seen my son  I am sure there can be no doubt on his side —and till you know whether you shall approve of our proposals  or not  And  without hesitation  I bespeak your good opinion of me till then  I am sure  my dear  we shall be very happy in each other  If you and my Lord are happy  you and I must be so—But  when the knot is tied  I will be only your visitor  and that at your own invitation  I am thought to be a managing woman  Managing women are not generally the best to live with  You  I understand  are an excellent oeconomist  A glorious character in this age for a young woman —Persons of the highest quality ought not to think themselves above it   One person s methods may differ from another s  yet both may be equally good  and reach the same end  My son has found the benefit of my oeconomy  Nevertheless  his wife shall not have cause to think  that  where she means well  I will prefer my methods to hers  If ever I give advice  it shall be only when you ask it  And then  if you do not take it  I will not be angry  but allow  that  having weighed the matter well  you prefer your own judgment  on the best convictions  People who are to act for themselves  should be always left to judge for themselves  because they only are answerable for their own actions  You blush  my dear    80 I hope I don t oppress you  I would not oppress a modesty so happily blended with frankness   I was affected with her goodness  What an amiable frankness  O that all husbands mothers were like your Ladyship  said I—What numbers of happy daughters in law would there then be  that now are not so   Charming creature  said she  Proceed  I am glad I don t oppress you with my prate   Oppress me  madam —You delight me  Talk of a bad world —I ought  I am sure  to think it a good one —In every matronly Lady I have met with a mother  In many young Ladies  as those before us  sisters  In their brother  a protector  If your Ladyship has not heard on what occasion  I shall be ready to acquaint you with it   Sweet child  Charming frankness  I have seen  I have heard enough of you for my present purpose—We will return to company—Such company as I find you in  is not to be had at all times  I will restore you to them   But  madam  declining her leading hand—  But  what  my dear   Have you not  madam —But your Ladyship could not have received any letter from my aunt Selby—I wrote—  I have not  my dear  I could not  as you say  But I shall find a letter from her  perhaps  on my return  You approve  I hope  of the proposal  if you shall have no objection to my son   My aunt  madam  will let you know—  I will not have it otherwise than I wish it to be—Remember that I value you for the frankness you are praised for—A little female trifling to my son  if you will  in order to be assured of his value for you  and men love not all halcyon courtships  but none to me  my love  I ll assist you  and keep your counsel  in the first case  if it be necessary  He shall love you   81 above all the women on earth  and convince you that he does  or he shall not call you his—But no female trifling to his mother  child  We women should always understand one another   Because I would not be thought to be an insincere creature  a trifler  I think I ought to mention to your Ladyship  that it would be a great  a very great part of my happiness  to be deemed worthy of your friendship—without—  Without what —You do well perhaps to blush  Without what   Without the relation—if you please   I was confounded with her goodness  Lucy  Here  my dear  is another superior character—I fancy her maiden name was Grandison   But I don t please  So no
