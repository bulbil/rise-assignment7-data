how it was  though I tried several times  some accident or other still happened to defeat my intentions  Matters went on in this manner for some time  till the very generous part which you acted by farmer Jenkins  who had been thrown into goal for a considerable sum by his landlord  on account of resenting an unbecoming   143 liberty with his daughter  As I was really charmed with the action myself  I told it to every body  and first of all I believe to Louisa  when she heard that you were totally uninterested in the affair  that Jenkins was an honest worthy poor man  that he had a large family  and was cruelly oppressed  when she heard that you not only paid all his debts  but even portioned out his daughter  and all this without being ever seen by any individual of the poor fellow s family  Louisa could not withstand her emotion—She breathed short  shifted from one side of her seat to the other  and  at last  exclaiming that there was no possibility of bearing any more  she burst into a flood of tears  Thus totally uninfluenced by passion or prejudice  and entirely actuated by real principle and genuine benignity  her very goodness of heart became a material source of her misfortunes  and laid the   144 original foundation of all her present dishonour and distress  The contracted eye of a narrow minded libertinism cannot  however  distinguish between those indiscretions which result from an excess of tenderness  and an excess of levity  attentive to one little object it always sees a woman s actions on the least favourable side  and  conscious of its own unworthiness  supposes that nothing but an equal unworthiness can ever honour it so far as to commit a capital mistake   But  of all the paltry contrivances which were ever designed to break off a match  surely your mode of parting with Miss Mildmay was the most ridiculously contemptible—And so you thought it perfectly sufficient to say you were ready to marry her  at the same time that by the insolence and cruelty of your artificial humility and concern  you forced her to the absolute necessity of   145 rejecting you  As a man of honour you thought it requisite to declare a willingness to fulfil your former engagements  yet what honourable compunction did you feel  when  in the basest opposition to your professions  you worked the unhappy young lady up to the cuting alternative  either of refusing you  or of meriting to be refused herself  What signifies the plausibility of the most solemn profession  when our actions give the lye to our words  or what signifies the deepest air of tenderness and veneration  if we secretly carry a dagger to stab the object of all this tenderness and veneration to the heart  In fact  our hypocrisy  so far from alleviating the guilt  serves only to encrease its infamy  and indicates nothing more than our fear  or our shame  to perpetrate those crimes from which we are are neither detered by the voice of honour nor the sense of humanity  but what has a   146 modern fine gentleman to do with honour or humanity  the mere outsides of either are sufficient for his purpose  and  so he observes a formal  frigid sort of deference for his word  he becomes equally dead to the suggestions of his reason and the feelings of his heart   Yet if I am astonished at the pitiful contrivance by which you obtained your honourable discharge from Louisa  what must I think of that barbarous mortification which you express at finding she could bear the loss of a worthless libertine  with such an exalted share of fortitude  And so your pride was wounded because the unhappy young lady did not discover a greater share of wretchedness  and manifest a much keener sensibility of distress —O  Bob  Bob  how unmanly  how inhuman is this declaration  But why am I surprized at partial unmanlinesses  or particular inhumanities  where   147 the whole conduct has been uniformly destitute of manhood and humanity  Your behaviour  Sir  is entirely of a piece  and my contempt is as much excited by your pride as my detestation is raised by your barbarity   I suppose  Sir  it would have yielded a most delicious feast to your vanity  had Miss Mildmay fallen at your feet  and  in an agony of despair  implored you to change your cruel resolution  I suppose you would have felt the most exquisite gratification to see the unhappy young lady deluged in her own tears  and tearing her fine face in all the extravagance of united grief and distraction—Thank God  you were disappointed—Thank God  there is one woman who can spurn a worthless lover from her presence  even while she acknowledges his possession of her heart  What you may think of the behaviour I know not    148 but  for my own part  her conduct since her first indiscretion has actually raised her in my opinion  and the generous sensibility which she has shewn in consequence of her error  gives her a preference to millions who have never erred at all   Pride  insensibility  and want of solicitation  have given a negative degree of excellence to  and preserved the purity of numbers  who were neither protected by principle nor reason  but a woman  who  on the eve
