indeed  I should be the basest of men  from any resentment of my own  to attempt putting asunder those who wish for an union  No  villain as he is  I could then wish him married  to prevent the consequences of his future debaucheries  But should I not now be the most cruel of all fathers  to sign an Instrument which must send my child to the grave  merely to avoid a prison myself  and thus to escape one pang  break my child s heart with a thousand    He acquiesced in the justice of this answer  but could not avoid observing  that he feared my daughter s life was already too much wasted to keep me long a prisoner      However  continued he  though you refuse to submit to the nephew  I hope you have no objections to laying your case before the uncle  who has the first character in the kingdom for every thing that is just and good  I  Page  130  would advise you to send him a letter by the post  intimating all his nephew s ill usage  and my life for it that in three days you shall have an answer    I thank d him for the hint  and instantly fet about complying  but I wanted paper  and unluckily all our money had been laid out that morning in provisions  however he supplied me   For the three ensuing days I was in a state of anxiety  to know what reception my letter might meet with  but in the mean time was frequently solicited by my wife to submit to any conditions rather than remain here  and every hour received repeated accounts of the decline of my daughter s health  The third day and the fourth arrived  but I received no answer to my letter  the complaints of a stranger against a favourite nephew  were no way likely to succeed  so that these hopes soon vanished like all my former  My mind   Page  131  however  still supported itself though confinement and bad air began to make a visible alteration in my health  and my arm that had suffered in the fire  grew worse  But my children still sate by me  and while I was stretched on my straw  read to me by turns  or listened and wept at my instructions  But my daughter s health declined faster than mine  every message from her contributed to encrease my apprehensions and pain  The fifth morning after I had written the letter which was sent to sir William Thornhill  I was alarmed with an account that she was speechless  Now it was  that confinement was truly painful to me  my soul was bursting from its prison to be near the pillow of my child  to comfort  to strengthen her  to receive her last wishes  and teach her soul the way to heaven  Another account came  She was expiring  and yet I was debarred the small comfort of weeping  Page  132  by her  My fellow prisoner  some time after  came with the last account  He bade me be patient  She was dead â€”The next morning he returned  and found me with my two little ones  now my only companions  who were using all their innocent efforts to comfort me  They entreated to read to me  and bid me not to cry  for I was now too old to weep      And is not my sister an angel  now  pappa    cried the eldest    and why then are you sorry for her  I wish I were an angel out of this frightful place  if my pappa were with me    Yes    added my youngest darling    Heaven  where my sister is  is a finer place than this  and there are none but good people there  and the people here are very bad    Mr  Jenkinson interupted their harmless prattle  by observing that now my daughter was no more  I should seriously think of the rest of my family  and attempt to  Page  133  save my own life  which was every day declining  for want of necessaries and wholesome air  He added  that it was now incumbent on me to sacrifice any pride or resentment of my own  to the welfare of those who depended on me for support  and that I was now  both by reason and justice  obliged to try to reconcile my landlord      Heaven be praised    replied I    there is no pride left me now  I should detest my own heart if I saw either pride or resentment lurking there  On the contrary  as my oppressor has been once my parishioner  I hope one day to present him up an unpolluted soul at the eternal tribunal  No  sir  I have no resentment now  and though he has taken from me what I held dearer than all his treasures  though he has wrung my heart  for I am sick almost to fainting  very sick  my fellow prisoner  yet that  Page  134  shall never inspire me with vengeance  I am now willing to approve his marriage  and if this submission can do him any pleasure
