resided with him in the castle  though a dull animal  had cunning and wickedness enough to affect a thorough conviction of the princess s imposture  and to repeat it continually to her brother  Tipponi told him a variety of stories which he had heard over his cups  and Rodomontado blustered and swore  that the whole matter was as clear as the sun in the firmament —Blow out my brains   Page  11  most mighty prince  would he say  and toss me from the tower of Toledo  if ever a more arrant cheat was attempted since the day that Noah went into his Ark   The unfortunate ← Dorando → believed the barbarous tale  He did not imagine that any man alive could have dared to tell the prince of← Dorando →   that his sister was an abandoned and infamous woman  had it not been true beyond a possibility of doubt  He felt the deepest anguish  but his spirit was roused with indignation  and he resolved never again to see his sister  and to show her every mark of his displeasure   Having brought him to this state of mind  the adherents had no difficulty to accomplish their designs  The gentlest hints were sufficient  so that the prince of ← Dorando → settled his  Page  12  opulent domains on the house of Arvidoso  and sunk a family which had been illustrious for ages   The princess Maria immediately returned to Spain with her husband and children  Her brother had withdrawn from her even the appointments which he had assigned for maintaining her court  and had it not been for the generosity of some of the neighbouring princes  the lady Maria ← Dorando →must have been reduced to actual want   All who lived under her brother lamented her situation  They crouded to see the children  and it was universally agreed  that Don Ferdinand  the eldest  had a strong resemblance to the prince his uncle  and that Don Philip  the youngest  was the very picture of his mother  The honest peasants kissed the hands of  Page  13  the young princes with the sincerest marks of joy and affection  wishing that the prince could only see his nephews  as that would be sufficient to convince him how false were the suspicions against them   But the prince had received too strong impressions  and was too closely watched  Often did the lady Maria write to him in the most moving terms  but all in vain  She at last resolved to make a desperate effort  and went to the gate of his castle with her two children  And there did the princess← Dorando → and her sons stand like the lowest supplicants  till the prince should return an answer to a pathetic letter which she sent up to him —The prince began to relent  He walked through his castle musing with much agitation  while the big tear ran down his  Page  14  cheek  But Stocaccio  like a hellhound  dogged him from room to room  and with a villainous appearance of concern  bid him be firm  nor weakly yield to the whining of a woman  who had forfeited every claim to his regard  The prince overcome with a tumult of contending passions  retired to his closet  and Stocaccio desired the servants to tell the lady Maria  that she could have no admittance there   Treatment so harsh and severe from him who had formerly been a fond brother  was beyond measure distressing to the princess  but she behaved with calmness and moderation  for her hope was fixed on heaven   Soon after this her youngest son died  She was in the deepest affliction  and the bitterness of her sorrow so affected her spirits that she never  Page  15  recovered  When she felt the approach of death  she received the holy sacrament with much devotion  She called to her bed side the prince Ferdinand her first born  and now only child  and  after leaving with him many pious lessons  she raised herself a little  as if animated with extraordinary life    My son  said she  be not cast down  God bless you  God make you a good and an honest man  for riches I despise  Take a sword in your hand  and you may one day be as great a hero as some of your predecessors    Having thus spoke  she reclined her head with peace and complacency  while Don Ferdinand stood by her like   the young eaglet of a valiant nest     in an attitude as if already facing all the dangers of the field  and at the same  Page  16  time touched with the deepest concern for his dying mother  who expired a few minutes after     Don Spiritoso  whose liberality of disposition far exceeded his fortune  was unable to support his son  but a princess of great worth  the friend of lady Maria  took under her protection the young Don Ferdinand  and gave him an education suitable to his real birth  And in whatever way it is  that the qualities of nobility are transmitted  it is certain  that this prince by his sentiments  his manners  and his air  could not but be acknowledged as of superiour rank  His uncle however remained inexorable  and Don Ferdinand never flattered himself with any expectation of happier days
