I thought        would be taken notice of  and might offend you  but darkness freed        me from these apprehensions  and gave me the consolation of        breathing in the same air with you  Soon as I thought all watchful        eyes were closed  I flew to the place  which  wherever my body is         contains my heart and all it s faculties  I pleased myself with        looking on the roof that covers you  and invoked every star to        present me to you in your sleep  in a form more agreeable than I        can hope I ever appeared in to your waking fancy  Thus I have        passed each night  and when the morning dawned  unwillingly retired        to take that rest which nature more especially demands  when heavy        melancholy oppresses the heart  I slept  but how  Distracting        images swam in my tormented brain  and waked me with horrors        inconceivable  Equally lost to business  as to all social commerce         I fly mankind  and  like some discontented ghost  seek out the most        solitary walks  and lonely shades  to pour forth my complaints  O        Miss Betsy  I cannot live  if longer denied the sight of you  In        pity to my sufferings  permit me yet once more to speak to you         even though it be to take a last farewel  I have made a little kind        of interest with the woman at the habit shop in Covent Garden         where I know you sometimes go  I dread to intreat you would call        there to morrow  yet  if you are so divinely good  be assured I        shall entertain no presuming hopes on the condescension you shall        be pleased to make me  but acknowledge it as the mere effect of        that compassion which is inherent to a generous mind  Alas  I must        be much more worthy than I can yet pretend to be  before I dare        flatter myself with owing any thing to a more soft emotion  than        that I have mentioned  Accuse me not  therefore  of too much        boldness in this petition  but grant to my despair what you would        deny to the love of your most faithful  and everlasting slave            H  SAVING            P  S  The favour of one line  to let me know whether I may expect        the blessing I implore  will add to the bounty of it  The same hand        that brings you this  will also deliver your commands to yours as        above        Miss Betsy read this letter several times  and  the oftener she did so    the more she saw into the soul of him that sent it  How wide the   difference between this and that she received from Gayland   Tis true    they both desired a meeting  each made the same request  but the manner   in which the former was asked  and the end proposed by the grant of it    she easily perceived were as distant as heaven and hell  She called to   mind the great respect he had always treated her with  she was convinced   both of his honour and sincerity  and thought something was due from her   on that account  In fine  after deliberating a little within herself    she resolved to write to him in these terms              Sir            Though it is my fixed determination to encourage the addresses of        no man whatever  without the approbation of my guardians  yet I        think myself too much obliged to the affection you have expressed        for me  to refuse you a favour of so trifling a nature as that you        have taken the pains to ask  I will be at the place you mention        to morrow  some time in the forenoon  but desire
