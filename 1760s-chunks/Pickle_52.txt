to make that the chief object of his care   and very sagaciously conveyed it between the stocking and the sole of  his foot  where he thought it would be perfectly secure from all injury  or accident  Here it remained until he arrived at the inn where he had  formerly lodged  when  after having refreshed himself with a draught of  beer  he pulled off his stocking  and found the poor billet sullied  with dust  and torn in a thousand tatters by the motion of his foot  in walking the last two miles of his journey  Thunderstruck at  this phenomenon  he uttered it loud whew  which was succeeded by an  exclamation of  D   my old shoes  a bite by G     then he rested his  elbows on the table  and his forehead upon his two fists  and in that  attitude deliberated with himself upon the means of remedying this  misfortune   As he was not distracted by a vast number of ideas he soon concluded  that his best expedient would be to employ the clerk of the parish  who  he knew was a great scholar  to write another epistle according to  the directions he should give him  and never dreaming that the mangled  original would in the least facilitate this scheme  he very wisely  committed it to the flames  that it might never rise up in judgment  against him   Having taken this wise step  he went in quest of the scribe  to whom  he communicated his business  and promised a full pot by way of  gratification  The clerk  who was also schoolmaster  proud of an  opportunity to distinguish his talents  readily undertook the task  and  repairing with his employer to the inn  in less than a quarter of an  hour produced a morsel of eloquence so much to the satisfaction of  Pipes  that he squeezed his hand by way of acknowledgment  and doubled  his allowance of beer  This being discussed  our courier betook himself    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to the house of Mrs  Gauntlet with the haunch of venison and this  succedaneous letter  and delivered his message to the mother  who  received it with great respect  and many kind inquiries about the health  and welfare of his master  attempting to tip the messenger a crown   which he absolutely refused to accept  in consequence of Mr  Pickle s  repeated caution  While the old gentlewoman turned to a servant in order  to give directions about the disposal of the present  Pipes looked upon  this as a favourable occasion to transact his business with Emilia  and  therefore shutting one eye  with a jerk of his thumb towards his left  shoulder  and a most significant twist of his countenance he beckoned  the young lady into another room as if he had been fraught with  something of consequence  which he wanted to impart  She understood the  hint  howsoever strangely communicated  and  by stepping to one side of  the room gave him an opportunity of slipping the epistle into her hand   which he gently squeezed at the same time in token of regard  then  throwing a side glance at the mother  whose back was turned  clapped  his finger on the side of his nose  thereby recommending secrecy and  discretion   Emilia  conveying the letter into her bosom  could not help smiling at  Tom s politeness and dexterity  but lest her mamma should detect him in  the execution of his pantomime  she broke off this intercourse of signs   by asking aloud when he proposed to set out on his return to Winchester   When he answered   To morrow morning   Miss Gauntlet recommended him  to the hospitality of her own footman  desiring him to make much of  Mr  Pipes below  where he was kept to supper  and very cordially  entertained  Our young heroine  impatient to read her lover s billet   which made her heart throb with rapturous expectation  retired to her  chamber as soon as possible  with a view of perusing the contents  which  were these          Divine Empress Of My Soul   If the refulgent flames of your      beauty had not evaporated the particles of my transported      brain  and scorched my intellects into a cinder of stolidity       perhaps the resplendency of my passion might shine illustrious      through the sable curtain of my ink  and in sublimity transcend      the galaxy itself  though wafted on the pinions of a gray goose      quill  But  ah  celestial enchantress  the necromancy of thy      tyrannical charms hath fettered my faculties with adamantine      chains  which  unless thy compassion shall melt I must eternally      remain in the Tartarean gulf of dismal despair  Vouchsafe       therefore  O thou brightest luminary of this terrestrial sphere       to warm  as well as shine  and let the genial rays
