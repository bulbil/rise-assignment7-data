can hardly speak  to give necessary Directions about myself  and you know what a helpless Family I am in  Oh  haste thee quickly to my Aid  and bring Hygea with thee  more welcome  as alone enjoyed in thy loved Presence  and admired Converse—at least  oh  send me a Ray of Divinity in your next Letter  by telling me you are recovered   You call my last Letter unreasonable and unkind  and say you are preparing the Willow  If to esteem you with unwearied Constancy  and to preserve the strongest Friendship for you  even tho  you do not merit it  can be called unkind  tho  I acknowledge it to be unreasonable  I shall then own your Charge is just  Yet  notwithstanding all this Weakness in my easy Nature  I am determined not to see you  but for the Time I proposed  and I hope to have Courage enough to keep a Resolution  upon which  perhaps  the Happiness of my Life depends     38My Head is so bad  that I am hardly able to hold it down any longer  tho  I have ten thousand Things to say  but  if I am able  I will write again by next Post   I beg you will let me know  when you intend to be in Town  for I have a Question to ask you  which is of some Consequence to my Repose   And oh  what anxious Minutes count they e er   Who doat  yet doubt  suspect  yet fondly love   Do not ask me what it is  for I will not tell you  till we meet   Farewel  Farewel   Frances   LETTER XXVII   My dear FANNY   I AM very sorry for the Account you give of yourself  and is it not  at the same Time  an extraordinary Thing  that I should wish it were all true  For I would rather you had real  than imaginary Ills  as one is much easier cured  than the other  and I have often had Reason to suspect you of Spleen and Vapours before now     39I am quite recovered  and design going to London in ten Days  but think it needless to carry Hygea with me   Nec Deus intersit   c   for you possess her already  and bear her about as  Jupiter did of old  for Hygea is but one of the Names of Minerva   As soon as I get to Town  I shall wait upon you  to talk over your extraordinary and cruel Scheme of banishing me from your Presence for ever  and  as to the Question you mean to ask me  I will lay open my Heart and Mind as freely to you in any Particular you have a Curiosity to inquire into  as I would to Heaven   from whom no Secrets are hidden   for  indeed  I know nothing  merely relative to myself  which I need  or would chuse to conceal from you  and  for what concerns other People  you can have no Reason to be anxious   I am   my dearest  best loved Girl   Your constant and best loving Lover   LETTER XXVIII   I AM extremely pleased to find that my dear Harry has neither forgot his Promise  nor his Fanny  You see my Pulse keeps equal Time   40 with your s  I wish I could say  they made as healthful Musick  However  you may be assured  your Letter has been the most efficacious Medicine I could possibly have met with —As the Mind has often an Effect upon the Body to its Detriment  which you hint to be my Case  it is but fair it should also have the same towards its Good  and as there has been a Sympathy between us  in Sickness  it would be a provokeing Circumstance  if it did not continue in Health   Forgive me if I am laconick To night  for I write in a Room  where there are as many different Tongues  as the Apostles were inspired with  tho  I think the Allusion would have been juster  if I had mentioned the Building of Babel   I thank you for your refined Compliment  which  tho  I have not Vanity enough to give Credit to  I am however pleased at  as I am with any Thing which gives you an Opportunity of shewing that lively Wit  which is elegant even in Trifles  and perhaps that Passage in your Letter was designed as a Supplement to the  Moriae Encomium of Erasmus   A Well bred young Man threatens to read my Letter  so I will close it  to save you from the Scandal of having so stupid a Correspondent     41  LETTER XXIX  HENRY to FRANCES   I HAVE been abroad about Business  these two Days  tho  not very well able to go  and am just returned to Belvidere  which I call coming to myself again  and the first Thing which occurs to me  of Course  must be the applying myself to you   Your Letter was  as you say  laconick  but I should have thought so  if it contained a Quire of Paper  However
