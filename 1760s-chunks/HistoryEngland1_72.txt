out a general pardon to all such as chose to accept it  but those lords  who had been the favourites of the last reign  and long used to turbulence  refused his proffered tenderness  and flew to arms  Lord Lovel  Humphrey and Thomas Stafford  placed themselves at the head of this insurrection  Henry sent the Duke of Bedford to oppose the insurgents  with orders to try what might be the effects of a proffered pardon  previous to his attempts to reduce them  The Duke punctually obeyed his instructions  but the rebels seemed to listen to no accommodation  but  contrary to all expectation  Lord Lovel  apprehensive of being deserted by his followers  first shewed them the example  and fled away to Flanders  The rebel army  now without a leader  submitted to the mercy of the King  which they received  The Staffords  who were in the mean time besieging   211 Worcester  hearing of the surrender of their confederates  attempted to take sanctuary in a church which had no privilege to protect them  being taken from thence  the eldest of the brothers was executed  the other received a pardon   But the people were become so turbulent and factious  by a long course of civil war  that no governor could rule them  nor any King please  One rebellion seemed extinguished only to give rise to another  the King kept  at that time  a son of the Duke of Clarence  who had been formerly drowned in the butt of wine  as has been mentioned  a prisoner in the Tower  This poor youth  who was styled the Earl of Warwick  had long been a stranger to liberty  he was unacquainted with men and things  and so little conversant with common life  from his long and early confinement  that he knew not the difference  to use the words of the historian  between a duck and an hen  This unhappy boy  harmless as he was  was made an instrument of to deceive the people  a priest  of Oxford  had trained up one Lambert Simnel  a baker s son  to counterfeit the person of this Earl  and he instructed him to talk upon some facts and occurrences relative to the court of King Edward  Thus  having prepared him for his purpose  he set out for Ireland  judging that the properest theatre to open the scene  the plot unfolded to his wish  Simnel was received and proclaimed King of Ireland  and he was conducted  by the people and judges  with great pomp to the castle  where he was treated conformably to his pretended birth and distinction   The King could not avoid being troubled at this imposture  because he saw his mother in law at the bottom of it  he was resolved  therefore  to   212 take the advice of his council upon this occasion  who  after due deliberation  determined upon confining the old Queen to a monastery  but  to wipe off the aspersion of treason  from one to whom he was so nearly allied  he gave out that she was thus punished for having formerly delivered up the Princess  her daughter  to King Richard  The people  as usual  murmured upon this occasion  but the King  unmindful of their idle clamours  persisted in his resolution  and she remained in confinement till she died  which did not happen till some years after  The next resolution of the King s council was to shew the Earl of Warwick  who was still confined in the Tower  publicly to the people  in consequence of this  he was led through the principal streets of London  and conducted  in a solemn procession  to St  Paul s  where great numbers were assembled to see him  Still  however  they proceeded at Dublin to honour their pretended Monarch  and he was crowned  with great solemnity  in presence of the Earl of Kildare  the Chancellor  and other officers of state  Such impofitions upon the people were very frequent  at that time  in several parts of Europe  Lorrain  Naples  and Portugal  had their impostors  who continued  for a long time  to deceive without detection  In fact  the inhabitants of every county were so much confined to the limits of their own peculiar place of abode  and knew so little of what was passing in the rest of the world around them  that nothing was more easy than to deceive  King Simnel  being now joined by Lord Lovel  and one or two lords more of the discontented party  resolved to pass over into England  and accordingly landed in Lancashire  from thence he marched to York    213 expecting the country would rise and join him as he passed along  But in this he was deceived  and he soon had the mortification to find that the King himself was coming up with a superior force to give him battle  the event of the contest was such as might have been expected  the Earl of Lincoln  who commanded for Simnel  was overthrown and slain in battle  and the impostor himself taken prisoner  Henry had now an opportunity of shewing the humanity and the greatness of his mind  Simnel was pardoned  and given a mean employment in the King s kitchen  and afterwards
