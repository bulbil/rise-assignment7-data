had happened below  Upon  which I told him he had nothing to answer for  and ordered him to keep  the door fast shut against all opposition  though I was so much affected  with this unexpected assault  that Lord    said he was never more  surprised and shocked in his life  than at the horror which appeared in  my countenance  when I saw the coach stop at my door     6 22 15  3 45 PM    My little hero being refused admittance  went away  threatening to  return speedily with a reinforcement  and during this interval  I  provided myself with a soldier  whom I placed sentinel at the door   within side  to guard me from the danger of such assaults for the  future  My lord  true to his promise  marched back with his auxiliaries   reinforced with a constable  and repeated his demand of being admitted   and my soldier opening the sash  in order to answer him  according to my  directions  he no sooner perceived the red coat  than he was seized with  such a panic  that he instantly fled with great precipitation  and  when  he recounted the adventure  like Falstaff in the play  multiplied my  guard into a whole file of musqueteers  He also made a shift to discover  the gentleman who had been so kind as to lend me one of his company  and  complained of him to the duke of N    in hopes of seeing him broke for  his misdemeanour  but in that expectation he was luckily disappointed    Perceiving that in England I should never enjoy peace  but be  continually subject to those alarms and disquiets which had already  impaired my health and spirits  I resolved to repair again to France   my best refuge and sure retreat from the persecution of my tyrant  Yet   before I took this step  I endeavoured  by the advice of my friends  to  conceal myself near Windsor  but was in a little time discovered by my  lord  and hunted out of my lurking place accordingly  I then removed  to Chelsea  where I suffered inconceivable uneasiness and agitation  of mind  from the nature of my situation  my tranquility being thus  incessantly invaded by a man who could not be satisfied with me  and yet  could not live without me  So that  though I was very much indisposed   I set out for France  by way of the Hague  as the war had shut up all  other communication  having no other attendant but my woman S    who   though she dreaded the sea  and was upon the brink of matrimony  would  not quit me in such a calamitous condition  until I was joined by my  footman and another maid  whom I ordered to follow me with the baggage   But  before my departure  I sent a message to Lord     demanding my  clothes  which he had seized in Essex  and  he refusing to deliver them   I was obliged to equip myself anew  upon credit    I was supplied with money for my journey by my good friend L    and   after a short and pleasant passage  arrived at the Hague  where I  stayed two months  and parted with S    on whom I settled an annuity  of five and twenty pounds  payable out of the provision which I had or  might obtain from my husband  The same allowance had I prevailed upon  Lord B   to grant to another maid  who attended me while I lived in his  house    I did not much relish the people in Holland  because they seemed  entirely devoted to self interest  without any taste for pleasure or  politeness  a species of disposition that could not be very agreeable  to me  who always despised money  had an unbounded benevolence of  heart  and loved pleasure beyond every other consideration  When I  say pleasure  I would not be understood to mean sensuality  which  constitutes the supreme happiness of those only who are void of  sentiment and imagination  Nevertheless  I received some civilities in  this place  and  among the rest  the reputation of having for my lover  the king of P   s minister  who was young and airy  and visited me  often  circumstances that were sufficient to lay me under the imputation  of an amour  which I frequently incurred without having given the least  cause of suspicion     6 22 15  3 45 PM    Having taken leave of my Dutch friends  I departed from the Hague  in  company with an English woman  whom I had chosen for that purpose  and  arrived at Antwerp with much difficulty and danger  the highway being  infested with robbers  After having reposed myself a few days in this  city  I hired a coach for myself  and set out with my companion for  Brussels  but  before we reached Mechlin  our vehicle was attacked by  two hussars  who  with their sabres drawn
