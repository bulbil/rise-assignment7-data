to discuss this knotty point  retired downstairs in hope of meeting with his charmer  whom accordingly he found in the kitchen just risen  and wrapped in a loose dishabille   The noise of Crabshaw s cries had awakened and aroused his master  who  rising suddenly in the dark  snatched up his sword that lay by his bedside  and hastened to the scene of tumult  where all their mouths were opened at once  to explain the cause of the disturbance  and make an apology for breaking his honour s rest  He said nothing  but taking the candle in his hand  beckoned his squire to follow him into his apartment  resolving to arm and take horse immediately  Crabshaw understood his meaning  and while he shuffled on his clothes  yawning hideously all the while  wished the lawyer at the devil for having visited him so unseasonably  and even cursed himself for the noise he had made  in consequence of which he foresaw he should now be obliged to forfeit his night s rest  and travel in the dark  exposed to the inclemencies of the weather   Pox rot thee  Tom Clarke  for a wicked lawyer   said he to himself   hadst thou been hanged at Bartlemy tide  I should this night have slept in peace  that I should—an I would there was a blister on this plaguy tongue of mine for making such a hollo ballo  that I do—five gallons of cold water has my poor belly been drenched with since night fell  so as my reins and my liver are all one as if they were turned into ice  and my whole harslet shakes and shivers like a vial of quicksilver  I have been dragged  half drowned like a rotten ewe  from the bottom of a river  and who knows but I may be next dragged quite dead from the bottom of a coal pit—if so be as I am  I shall go to hell to be sure  for being consarned like in my own moorder  that I will  so I will  for  a plague on it  I had no business with the vagaries of this crazy peated measter of mine  a pox on him  say I    He had just finished this soliloquy as he entered the apartment of his master  who desired to know what was become of his armour  Timothy  understanding that it had been left in the room when the knight undressed  began to scratch his head in great perplexity  and at last declared it as his opinion  that it must have been carried off by witchcraft  Then he related his adventure with Tom Clarke  who he said was conveyed to his bedside he knew not how  and concluded with affirming they were no better than Papishes who did not believe in witchcraft  Sir Launcelot could not help smiling at his simplicity  but assuming a peremptory air  he commanded him to fetch the armour without delay  that he might afterwards saddle the horses  in order to prosecute their journey   Timothy retired in great tribulation to the kitchen  where  finding the misanthrope  whom the noise had also disturbed  and  still impressed with the notion of his being a conjurer  he offered him a shilling if he would cast a figure  and let him know what was become of his master s armour   Ferret  in hope of producing more mischief  informed him without hesitation  that one of the company had conveyed it into the chancel of the church  where he would now find it deposited  at the same time presenting him with the key  which Mr  Fillet had left in his custody   The squire  who was none of those who set hobgoblins at defiance  being afraid to enter the church alone at these hours  bargained with the ostler to accompany and light him with a lantern  Thus attended  he advanced to the place where the armour lay in a heap  and loaded it upon the back of his attendant without molestation  the lance being shouldered over the whole  In this equipage they were just going to retire  when the ostler  hearing a noise at some distance  wheeled about with such velocity  that one end of the spear saluting Crabshaw s pate  the poor squire measured his length on the ground  and  crushing the lantern in his fall  the light was extinguished  The other  terrified at these effects of his own sudden motion  threw down his burden  and would have betaken himself to flight  had not Crabshaw laid fast hold on his leg  that he himself might not be deserted  The sound of the pieces clattering on the pavement roused Captain Crowe from a trance or slumber  in which he had lain since the apparition vanished  and he hallooed  or rather bellowed  with vast vociferation  Timothy and his friend were so intimidated by this terrific strain  that they thought no more of the armour  but ran home arm in arm  and appeared in the kitchen with all the marks of horror and consternation   When Sir Launcelot came forth wrapped in his cloak  and demanded his arms  Crabshaw declared that the devil had them in possession  and this assertion was confirmed by the ostler  who pretended to know the devil by his roar  Ferret sat in his corner  maintaining the
