 and all my subsequent adventures upon quitting China  were calculated to encrease the sphere of my happiness  not my curiosity  Let European travellers cross seas and deserts merely to measure the height of a mountain  to describe the cataract of a river  or tell the commodities which every country may produce  merchants or geographers  perhaps  may find profit by such discoveries  but what advantage can accrue to a philosopher from such accounts  who is desirous of understanding the human heart  who seeks to know the men of every country  who desires to discover those differences which result from climate  religion  education  prejudice  and partiality   I should think my time very ill bestowed  were the only fruits of my adventures to consist in being able to tell  that a tradesman of London lives in an house three times as high as that of our great Emperor  That the ladies wear longer cloaths than the men  that the priests are dressed in colours which we are taught to detest  and that their soldiers wear scarlet  which is with us the symbol of peace and innocence  How many travellers are   24 there  who confine their relations to such minute and useless particulars  for one who enters into the genius of those nations with whom he has conversed  who discloses their morals  their opinions  the ideas which they entertain of religious worship  the intrigues of their ministers  and their skill in sciences  There are twenty  who only mention some idle particulars  which can be of no real use to a true philosopher  All their remarks tend  neither to make themselves nor others more happy  they no way contribute to control their passions  to bear adversity  to inspire true virtue  or raise a detestation of vice   Men may be very learned  and yet very miserable  it is easy to be a deep geometrician  or a sublime astronomer  but very difficult to be a good man  I esteem  therefore  the traveller who instructs the heart  but despise him who only indulges the imagination  a man who leaves home to mend himself and others is a philosopher  but he who goes from country to country  guided by the blind impulse of curiosity  is only a vagabond  From Zerdusht down to him of Tyanea  I honour all those great names who endeavoured to unite the world by their travels  such men grew wiser as well as better  the farther they departed from home  and seemed like rivers  whose streams are not only encreased  but refined  as they travel from their source   For my own part  my greatest glory is  that travelling has not more steeled my constitution against all the vicissitudes of climate  and all the depressions of fatigue  than it has my mind against the accidents of fortune  or the accesses of despair  Farewell     25  LETTER VIII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   HOW insupportable  oh thou possessor of heavenly wisdom  would be this separation  this immeasurable distance from my friends  were I not able thus to delineate my heart upon paper  and to send thee daily a map of my mind   I am every day better reconciled to the people among whom I reside  and begin to fancy that in time I shall find them more opulent  more charitable  and more hospitable than I at first imagined  I begin to learn somewhat of their manners and customs  and to see reasons for several deviations which they make from us  from whom all other nations derive their politeness as well as their original   In spite of taste  in spite of prejudice  I now begin to think their women tolerable  I can now look on a languishing blue eye without disgust  and pardon a set of teeth  even though whiter than ivory  I now begin to fancy there is no universal standard for beauty  The truth is  the manners of the ladies in this city are so very open  and so vastly engaging  that I am inclined to pass over the more glaring defects of their persons  since compensated by the more solid  yet latent beauties of the mind  what tho  they want black teeth  or are deprived of the allurements of feet no bigger than their thumbs  yet still they have souls  my friend  such souls  so free  so pressing  so hospitable  and so engaging—I have received   26 more invitations in the streets of London from the sex in one night  than I have met with at Pekin in twelve revolutions of the moon   Every evening as I return home from my usual solitary excursions  I am met by several of those well disposed daughters of hospitality  at different times and in different streets  richly dressed  and with minds not less noble than their appearance  You know that nature has indulged me with a person by no means agreeable  yet are they too generous to object to my homely appearance  they feel no repugnance at my broad face and flat nose  they perceive me to be a stranger  and that alone is a sufficient recommendation  They even seem to think it their duty to do the honours of the country by every
