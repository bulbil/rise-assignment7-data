of lordly man  I inquired what youth  blessed as the immortal gods  had the exquisite happiness of bringing himself to beggary for so sweet a girl  She is under no avowed protection  said he  and scandal has not coupled her name with private licence  but Lucretia must take care of herself  for she is under the wing of her aunt Estella  and there is not an actress in the company so warmly fledged for hatching the tender passions into life   At the name of Estella  I inquired with some eagerness who she was  One of our best performers  said my informant  She does not play to night  to our great loss  for her cast is that of abigails  and she humours them to perfection  A little too broad  perhaps  but that is a fault on the right side  From the features of the description  there could be no doubt but this must be Laura  that lady so notorious in these memoirs  whom I left at Grenada   To make assurance doubly sure  I went behind the scenes after the play  There she was  in the green room  flirting with some men of fashion  who probably endured the aunt for the sake of the niece  I came up to pay my devotions  but whim  or perhaps revenge for my cutting and running from Grenada  determined her to put on the stranger  and receive my compliments with so discouraging a coldness  as to throw me into some little confusion  Instead of laughing it off  I was fool enough to be angry  and withdrew in a choleric determination to return next day  Laura shall smart for this  said I  her niece shall not appear at court  I will tell the minister that she dances like a she bear  has formed her bravura between the scream of a pea hen and the cackle of a goose  acts like a puppet  and comprehends like an idiot   Such was my scheme of revenge  but it proved abortive  Just as I was going out of town  a footboy brought me the following note   Forget and forgive  and follow the bearer   I obeyed  and found Laura at her dressing table in very elegant apartments near the theatre   She rose to welcome me  saying  Signor Gil Blas  you have every reason to be offended at your reception behind the scenes  which was out of character between such old friends  but I really was most abominably disconcerted  Just as you came up  one of our gentlemen had brought me some scandalous stories about my niece  whose honour has always been dearer to me than my own  On coming to myself  I immediately sent my servant to find you out  with the intention of making you amends to day  You have done so already  my dear Laura  said I  let us therefore talk over old times  You may remember that I left you in a very ticklish predicament  when conscience and the fear of punishment drove me so precipitately from Grenada  How did you get off with your Portuguese lover  Easily enough  answered Laura  do not you know that in those cases men are mere fools  and acquit us women without even calling for our defence   I faced the Marquis of Marialva out  that you were my very brother  and drew upon my impudence for the support of my credit  Do you not see  said I to my Portuguese dupe  that this is all the contrivance of jealousy and rage  My rival  Narcissa  infuriated at my possession of a heart which she had vainly attempted to gain  has bribed the candle snuffer to assert that he has seen me as Arsenia s waiting woman at Madrid  It is an abominable falsehood  the widow of Don Antonio Coello has always been too high in her notions  to be the hanger on of a theatrical mistress  Besides  what completely disproves the whole allegation  is my brother s precipitate retreat  if he were here  it would be a subject of evidence  but Narcissa must have devised some stratagem to get him out of the way   These reasons  continued Laura  were not the most convincing in the world  but they did very well for the marquis  and that good  easy nobleman continued his confidence till his return to Portugal  This happened soon after your departure  and Zapata s wife had the pleasure of seeing me lose what she could not win  After this  I stayed some years longer at Grenada  till the company was broken up in consequence of some squabbles  which will take place in mimic as well as in real life  some went to Seville  others to Cordova  and I came to Toledo  where I have been for these ten years with my niece Lucretia  whose performance you must have seen last night  This was too much to be taken gravely  Laura inquired why I laughed  Can that be a question  said I  You have neither brother nor sister  one or other of which is a necessary ingredient in an aunt  Besides  when I calculate in my mind the lapse of time since our last separation  and compare that period with the age of your niece  it is more than possible that your
