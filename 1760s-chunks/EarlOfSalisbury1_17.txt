appeared violently moved at my disorder  His tears  for he  could command tears  flowed  freely  his sighs were deep and frequent  and his voice broken and  interrupted  at length  as if recollecting some share of reason and calm  reflection   Unhappy Lord  said he  too truly have I declared thy  situation  But what hath moved Les Roches to this  or for what fortunes  Earl William is reserved  alas  is yet a secret to D Aumont  Too true it  is that some extraordinary event hath called away the Lord of this  place  Perhaps he hath found it necessary to deliver thee back into the  power of Mal leon  perhaps he hath rescued thee from the rage of that  proud Count  that he may have the glory of displaying to his countrymen  an illustrious captive won by himself  But I fear his virtue most  Yes  it must be so  He hath indeed preserved thee from the treacherous  attempts of base envy  but his duty to his Prince and to his country  forbids him to restore to England the champion that hath fought her  battles against France  O rigid sense of duty  that thus tears asunder  the bands of nature and friendship  Happy D Aumont  whose soul aspires  not to such high unfeeling virtue  who cannot resist the tender  sollicitations of pity  Let me ever indulge the kind emotion   uncontrouled by rigorous scruples  or splendid notions of duty  too  severe and too exalted for humanity     These suggestions exactly answered to his purpose  My soul was too much  disordered to examine them by the rules of calm deliberate reason  and  the emotion which he assumed  increased my inward tumult  and gave him  entire possession of my heart  In this fatal moment  the tenderness  the  zeal  the sollicitude  the sufferings of Les Roches all vanished from  my thoughts  I had even forgotten the confusion which appeared in his  castle on our arrival  and his own surprize and concern  I had forgotten  that some unexpected event must have torn him from me  I imputed his  absence to no other cause but the shame of encountering the looks and  reproaches of a man whom he had betrayed  and all confused and  distracted as I was  resigned myself entirely to the influence of  this new friend  whose power was like that of those infernal imps who   they say  command the winds to roar or to be still  and the waves to  swell or to subside  as their wicked purposes require  As he depressed  or roused me  I melted into grief  or raged in all the violence of vain  and impotent indignation  I now considered myself as an helpless prey   doomed to inevitable destruction  surrounded on all sides by my hunters   and fatally lured to their toils  Nor was D Aumont at all sollicitious  to dispel my fears  He expatiated on the horrors of a dungeon  on the  wretchedness of captivity  the cruel tyranny of exasperated enemies and  rivals  the loss of friends and honours  years of bondage spent in  gloomy solitude  in useless inaction  the gazing curiosity of the base  and ignoble  the insolence and triumphant scorn of the coward  who had  perhaps trembled at my sword  and fled from my arm in battle  then  as  if afraid to dwell upon the terrible idea  he just hinted at the tears  of my friends  and the sorrow of an helpless widowed wife     Hast thou never heard that the enemy of mankind oftentimes presents  shocking and frightful phantoms before the eyes of the holy hermit  in  order to distract his thoughts and to confound his purposes  Such were  the arts by which this Frenchman practised upon my soul  I started up  in a sudden fit of fury and extravagance  I cursed my own blindness and  folly  that had betrayed me into the power of my enemies  and when I had  once escaped  had seduced me into France  instead of steering directly  for the shore of England  Then madly seizing D  Aumont  I thundered out  terrible execrations on his head  and wild menaces of vengeance  as an  accomplice in cursed treachery  He trembled  and with silent looks and  tears seemed kindly to reproach my unjust suspicions  then in broken and  imperfect words  appeared to struggle with his passions  and complained  of the wrong done to his friendship  I instantly melted into all the  tenderness of grief and affection  and ardently embracing the Frenchman   I  acknowledged my error  and requested his assistance and counsel  in this  my dangerous situation   Alas  said he  if I am true to Salisbury  I  must betray Les Roches  Hard situation for the soldier  who owes exact  obedience to the dictates of duty and honour  But too well I feel that  my heart is not secured against the assaults of pity  Yes I am thine   and wholly thine  Here he clasped me in his arms  and thus proceeded  I  must deliver thee  and one
