starving  She takes pleasure in being surrounded with duns  observing  that by such people a person of fashion is to be distinguished  She writes circular letters to her former friends and acquaintance  and by this method has raised pretty considerable contributions  for she writes in a most elegant and irresistible style  About a fortnight ago she received a supply of twenty guineas  when  instead of paying her little jail debts  or withdrawing any part of her apparel from pawn  she laid out the whole sum in a fashionable suit and laces  and next day borrowed of me a shilling to purchase a neck of mutton for her dinner  She seems to think her rank in life entitles her to this kind of assistance  She talks very pompously of her family and connexions  by whom however she has been long renounced  She has no sympathy nor compassion for the distresses of her fellow creatures  but she is perfectly well bred  she bears a repulse the best of any woman I ever knew  and her temper has never been once ruffled since her arrival at the King s Bench  She now entreated me to lend her half a guinea  for which she said she had the most pressing occasion  and promised upon her honour it should be repaid to morrow  but I lent a deaf ear to her request  and told her in plain terms that her honour was already bankrupt    Sir Launcelot  thrusting his hand mechanically into his pocket  pulled out a couple of guineas  and desired Felton to accommodate her with that trifle in his own name  but he declined the proposal  and refused to touch the money   God forbid   said he   that I should attempt to thwart your charitable intention  but this  my good sir  is no objectâ€”she has many resources  Neither should we number the clamorous beggar among those who really feel distress  he is generally gorged with bounty misapplied  The liberal hand of charity should be extended to modest want that pines in silence  encountering cold  nakedness  and hunger  and every species of distress  Here you may find the wretch of keen sensations blasted by accident in the blossom of his fortune  shivering in the solitary recess of indigence  disdaining to beg  and even ashamed to let his misery be known  Here you may see the parent who has known happier times  surrounded by his tender offspring  naked and forlorn  demanding food  which his circumstances cannot afford    That man of decent appearance and melancholy aspect  who lifted his hat as you passed him in the yard  is a person of unblemished character  He was a reputable tradesman in the city  and failed through inevitable losses  A commission of bankruptcy was taken out against him by his sole creditor  a quaker  who refused to sign his certificate  He has lived three years in prison  with a wife and five small children  In a little time after his commitment  he had friends who offered to pay ten shillings in the pound of what he owed  and to give security for paying the remainder in three years by instalments  The honest quaker did not charge the bankrupt with any dishonest practices  but he rejected the proposal with the most mortifying indifference  declaring that he did not want his money  The mother repaired to his house  and kneeling before him with her five lovely children  implored mercy with tears and exclamations  He stood this scene unmoved  and even seemed to enjoy the prospect  wearing the looks of complacency  while his heart was steeled with rancour   Woman   said he   these be hopeful babes  if they were duly nurtured  Go thy ways in peace  I have taken my resolution   Her friends maintained the family for some time  but it is not in human charity to persevere  some of them died  some of them grew unfortunate  some of them fell off  and now the poor man is reduced to the extremity of indigence  from whence he has no prospect of being retrieved  The fourth part of what you would have bestowed upon the lady would make this poor man and his family sing with joy    He had scarce pronounced these words  when our hero desired the man might be called  and in a few minutes he entered the apartment with a low obeisance   Mr  Coleby   said the knight   I have heard how cruelly you have been used by your creditor  and beg you will accept this trifling present  if it can be of any service to you in your distress   So saying  he put five guineas into his hand  The poor man was so confounded at such an unlooked for acquisition  that he stood motionless and silent  unable to thank the donor  and Mr  Felton conveyed him to the door  observing that his heart was too full for utterance  But in a little time his wife bursting into the room with her five children  looked around  and going up to Sir Launcelot without any direction  exclaimed   This is the angel sent by Providence to succour me and my poor innocents   Then falling at his feet  she pressed his hand and bathed it with her tears  He raised her up with that
