and ALMORAN   immediately quitted her apartment  that he might reassume his own   figure  take advantage of the disposition which  under the appearance   of HAMET  he had produced in favour of himself  But Osmyn  who supposing   him to be HAMET  had intercepted and detained him as he was going to   ALMEIDA  now intercepted him a second time at his return  having placed   himself near the door of the apartment for that purpose       Osmyn was by no means satisfied with the issue of their last interview    he had perceived a perturbation in the mind of ALMORAN  for which    imagining him to be HAMET  he could not account  and which seemed more   extraordinary upon a review  than when it happened  he  therefore  again   entered into conversation with him  in which he farther disclosed his   sentiments and designs  ALMORAN  notwithstanding the impatience natural   to his temper and situation  was thus long detained listening to Osmyn    by the united influence of his curiosity and his fears  his enquiries   still alarmed him with new terrors  by discovering new objects of   distrust  and new instances of disaffection  still  however  he   resolved  not yet to remove Osmyn from his post  that he might give no   alarm by any appearance of suspicion  and consequently learn with more   ease  and detect with more certainty  any project that might be formed   against him                CHAP  XVI          ALMEIDA  as soon as she was left alone  began to review the scene that   had just past  and was every moment affected with new wonder  grief  and   resentment  She now deplored her own misfortune  and now conceived a   design to punish the author of it  from whose face she supposed the hand   of adversity had torn the mask under which he had deceived her  it   appeared to her very easy  to take a severe revenge upon HAMET for the   indignity which she supposed he had offered her  by complaining of it   to ALMORAN  and telling him  that he had gained admittance to her by   bribing the eunuch who kept the door  The thought of thus giving him up    was one moment rejected  as arising from a vindictive spirit  and the   next indulged  as an act of justice to ALMORAN  and a punishment due to   the hypocrisy of HAMET  to the first she inclined  when her grief  which   was still mingled with a tender remembrance of the man she loved  was   predominant  and to the last  when her grief gave way to indignation       Thus are we inclined to consider the same action  either as a virtue  or   a vice  by the influence of different passions  which prompt us either   to perform or to avoid it  ALMEIDA  from deliberating whether she   should accuse HAMET to ALMORAN  or conceal his fault  was led to   consider what punishment he would either incur or escape in consequence   of her determination  and the images that rushed into her mind  the   moment this became the object of her thoughts  at once determined her to   be silent   Could I bear to see   said she   that hand  which has so   often trembled with delight when it enfolded mine  convulsed and black    those eyes  that as often as they gazed upon me were dissolved in tears   of tenderness and love  start from the sockets  and those lips that   breathed the softest sighs of elegant desire  distorted and gasping in   the convulsions of death        From this image  her mind recoiled in an agony of terror and pity  her   heart sunk within her  her limbs trembled she sunk down upon the sofa    and burst into tears       By this time  HAMET  on whose form the likeness of ALMORAN was still   impressed  had reached the palace  He went instantly towards the   apartment of the women  Instead of that chearful alacrity  that mixture   of zeal and reverence and affection  which his eye had been used to find   where ever it was turned  he now observed confusion  anxiety and terror    whoever he met  made haste to prostrate themselves before him  and   feared to look up till he was past  He went on  however  with a hasty   pace  and coming up to the eunuch s guard  he said with an impatient   tone   To ALMEIDA   The slave immediately made way before him  and   conducted him to the door of the apartment  which he would not otherwise   have been able to find  and for which he could not directly enquire
