loss of all that is lovely in woman  by the sordid prospect of acquiring  by an interested marriage  a little more of that wealth of which he has already much more than he can either enjoy or become  By what wretched motives are half mankind influenced in the most important action of their lives       The vulgar of every rank expect happiness where it is not to be found  in the ideal advantages of splendor and dissipation  those who dare to think  those minds who partake of the celestial fire  seek it in the real solid pleasures of nature and soft affection       I have seen my lovely Emily since I wrote to you  I shall not see her again of some days  I do not intend at present to make my visits to Silleri so frequent as I have done lately  lest the world  ever studious to blame  should misconstrue her conduct on this very delicate occasion  I am even afraid to shew my usual attention to her when present  lest she herself should think I presume on the politeness she has ever shewn me  and see her breaking with Sir George in a false light  the greater I think her obliging partiality to me  the more guarded I ought to be in my behaviour to her  her situation has some resemblance to widowhood  and she has equal decorums to observe       I cannot however help encouraging a pleasing hope that I am not absolutely indifferent to her  her lovely eyes have a softness when they meet mine  to which words cannot do justice  she talks less to me than to others  but it is in a tone of voice which penetrates my soul  and when I speak  her attention is most flattering  though of a nature not to be seen by common observers  without seeming to distinguish me from the crowd who strive to engage her esteem and friendship  she has a manner of addressing me which the heart alone can feel  she contrives to prevent my appearing to give her any preference to the rest of her sex  yet I have seen her blush at my civility to another       She has at least a friendship for me  which alone would make the happiness of my life  and which I would prefer to the love of the most charming woman imagination could form  sensible as I am to the sweetest of all passions  this friendship  however  time and assiduity may ripen into love  at least I should be most unhappy if I did not think so       I love her with a tenderness of which few of my sex are capable  you have often told me  and you were right  that my heart has all the sensibility of woman       A mail is arrived  by which I hope to hear from you  I must hurry to the post office  you shall hear again in a few days       Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER LXVII   67   To Colonel RIVERS  at Quebec   London  Dec  1   YOU need be in no pain  my dear brother  on Mr  Temple s account  my heart is in no danger from a man of his present character  his person and manner are certainly extremely pleasing  his understanding  and I believe his principles  are worthy of your friendship  an encomium which  let me observe  is from me a very high one  he will be admired every where  but to be beloved  he wants  or at least appears to me to want  the most endearing of all qualities  that genuine tenderness of soul  that almost feminine sensibility  which  with all your firmness of mind and spirit  you possess beyond any man I ever yet met with       If your friend wishes to please me  which I almost fancy he does  he must endeavor to resemble you   tis rather hard upon me  I think  that the only man I perfectly approve  and whose disposition is formed to make me happy  should be my brother  I beg you will find out somebody very like yourself for your sister  for you have really made me saucy       I pity you heartily  and wish above all things to hear of your Emily s marriage  for your present situation must be extremely unpleasant       But  my dear brother  as you were so very wise about Temple  allow me to ask you whether it is quite consistent with prudence to throw yourself in the way of a woman so formed to inspire you with tenderness  and whom it is so impossible you can ever hope to possess  is not this acting a little like a foolish girl  who plays round the flame which she knows will consume her       My mother is well  but will never be happy till you return to England  I often find her in tears over your letters  I will say no more on a subject which I know will give you pain  I hope  however  to hear you have given up all thoughts of settling in America  it would be a better plan to turn farmer in Rutland  we could double the estate by living upon it  and I am sure I should
