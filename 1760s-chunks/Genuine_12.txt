her   She was now brought to the most perplexing dilemma  she not only wanted money  but cloaths  the most necessary appendage of her profession  nor could she   55 take one step to her advantage in her present garb   In this situation  M—y not being able to assist her  her only resource was to apply to one of those ladies called tally women  in order to procure  at a most exorbitant premium  the loan of part of her tawdry wardrobe  accordingly  she borrowed of Mrs  LAMB a complete dress in the newest taste  for which she was to pay no more than a guinea per night   Thus equipped  she promised herself much success  but as she was not a new face upon the town  she was much disappointed in her expectations  for at the close of the first adventure  she could not muster half the amount of her clothes hire  Hoping that the ensuing week would prove more fortunate  she continued her contract with Mrs  LAMB  and was elegantly equipped every night  but that proved very little better than the former  insomuch that she became indebted to this conscientious lady upwards of nine guineas     56According to the general custom of these people  a note of hand was immediately demanded as a security for the debt  and the period she had fixed for the payment expiring before she was able to fulfil her promise  Mrs  Lamb  without giving any previous notice after the first demand  caused Miss ELLIOT to be arrested  and conducted to the Marshalsea   Here a new scene opened to her view  a scene which demonstrated the fatal effects of vice and folly  here were several she had known before in the beau monde  some of whom were said to be dead  others retired into the country  and others gone abroad   In this forlorn situation  she found herself under a necessity of making an acquaintance with some of the inhabitants of this immured mansion  As to the female inmates  they were for the most part  like herself  ladies of pleasure  who having in general lost their credit  were thrown there in hopes some kind gentleman  with more money than wit  would   57 pity and release them from their confinement  by discharging their debts   The morning after her arrival she was waited on by a celebrated miss  who  from bring a common prostitute  had been extolled for her wit and reading  because she had acquired a smattering of common place quibbles  and a few sentences of Latin  which she frequently introduced without regard either to decency or propriety  This false reputation procured her a number of wealthy admirers  amongst whom was an old dotard  who was so enraptured with her that he administered to her most exhorbitant demands  and settled on her a very considerable annuity   Notwithstanding this extraordinary fondness and generosity  she so rarely requited his favours  that at length  disgusted with her behaviour  he estranged himself from her embraces and her company  Her extravagance and debauchery  though her annuity was regularly paid  compelled her to dispose of it shortly after their separation  and she soon expended the money arising from it     58Some of her creditors  being acquainted with the situation of her affairs  were induced to take possession of such effects as were in her power  and with that view brought an execution into the house  This step being made public  those of her creditors who had received no satisfaction from her goods  resolved to seize on her person  which they accordingly did  and deposited it in this convenient receptacle   Miss ELLIOT was not ignorant of so remarkable a character  and therefore  after a short interview  dismissed her  with many acknowledgments of her kindness  and promised  on the first leisure  to return the visit   Our heroine had not been many days confined before she met with an old acquaintance  under the same circumstances with herself  this was Mr  N—rth  who  thinking himself i•l used by the impertinent demands of his creditors  had determined to punish their insolence  by taking the benefit of the act of grace     59Here was a plain proof of the meanness of soul of this pretended gentleman  who could condescend to such low subterfuges to evade the payment of his just debts  and submit to the loss of his reputation  and the publication of his name to all the world as a common cheat  in order to open a way for a renewal of his villainies in some part where he was less known   Thus  remote from the gayer scenes of life  she had time to reflect on the miseries  attending her profession  and from which she had now no possible view of being delivered  Being destitute of money  and every thing that could procure it  and Mr  M—y  who had introduced her to the stage  being unable to afford her the assistance she required  she sent for Mrs  Lamb  remonstrated with her on the folly of depriving her of all possibility of making her any compensation  and told her  that if she would release her from confinement  she would resign herself wholly to her disposal  and submit to any terms she should please to propose
