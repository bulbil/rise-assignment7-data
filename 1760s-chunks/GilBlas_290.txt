of my ready money  and you may stay at Madrid  where fortune puts on her kindest smiles to those who woo her lustily   What then  replied my secretary  a little affected by these words  can you suspect me of any unwillingness to follow you into your retreat  The very idea is an injury to my zeal and my attachment         What  Scipio  that faithful appendage  who would willingly have passed the remnant of his days with you in the tower of Segovia  rather than abandon you to your wretched fate  can he feel sorrowful at the prospect of an abode  where a thousand rural delights are waiting to smile on his arrival  No  no  I have not a wish to turn you aside from your resolution  Nor can I refrain from owning my malicious drift  when I advised you to shew your face at the Duke of Lerma s audience  it was for the purpose of ascertaining whether any seedlings of ambition were scattered among the fallows of your philosophy  Since that point is settled  and you are mortified to all the pomps and vanities of the world  let us make the best of our way from court  to go and suck in with Zephyrus and Flora the innocent  delicious pleasures so luxuriant in the nursery of our imaginations   In fact  we soon afterwards took our departure together  in a chaise drawn by two good mules  driven by a postilion whom I had added to my establishment  We stopped the first day at Alcala de Henarès  and the second at Segovia  whence  without stopping to see our generous warden  Tordesillas  we went forward to Penáfiel on the Duero  and the next day to Valladolid  At sight of this large town  I could not help fetching a deep sigh  My companion  surprised at that conscientious ventilation  inquired the reason of it  My good fellow  said I  it is because I practised medicine here for a long time  It gives me the horrors  even now  to think of my unexpiated murders  The whole list of killed and wounded are mustered in battle array yonder  the tomb and the hospital yawn with their disgorged inhabitants  who are rushing on to tear me piece meal  and exact the vengeance due to the drenched crew  What a dreadful fancy  said my secretary  In truth  Signor de Santillane  your nature is too tender  Why should you be shocked at the common course of exchange in your branch of trade  Look at all the oldest physicians  their withers are unwrung  What can exceed the self complacency with which they view the exits of patients  and the entrances of diseases  Natural constitution bears the brunt of all their failures  and medical infallibility takes the credit of lucky accidents   It is very true  replied I  that Doctor Sangrado  on whose practice I formed myself  was like the rest of the old physicians in point of self complacency  It was to little purpose that twenty people in a day yielded to his prowess  he was so persuaded that bleeding in the arm and copious libations of warm water were specifics for every case  that instead of doubting whether the death of his patients might not possibly invalidate the efficacy of his prescriptions  he ascribed the result to a vacillating compliance with his system  By all the powers  cried Scipio with a burst of laughter  you open to me an incomparable character  If you have any curiosity to be better acquainted with him  said I  it may be gratified to morrow  should Sangrado be still living  and resident at Valladolid  but it is highly improbable  for he had one foot in the grave when I left him several years ago   Our first care  on putting up at the inn  was to inquire after this doctor  We were told that he was not dead  but being incapacitated by age from paying visits or any other vigorous exertions  he had been superseded by three or four other doctors who had risen into repute by a new practice  accomplishing the same end by different means  We determined on lying by for a day at Valladolid  as well to rest our mules  as to call on Signor Sangrado  About ten o clock next morning we knocked at his door  and found him sitting in his elbow chair  with a book in his hand  He rose on our entrance  advanced to meet us with a firm step for a man of seventy  and begged to know our business  My worthy and approved good master  said I  have you lost all recollection of an old pupil  There was formerly one Gil Blas  as you may remember  a boarder in your house  and for some time your deputy  What  is it you  Santillane  answered he  with a cordial embrace  I should not have known you again  It  however  gives me great pleasure to see you once more  What have you been doing since we parted  Doubtless you have made medicine your profession  It was very strongly my inclination so to do  replied I  but imperious circumstances made me reluctantly abandon so illustrious a calling   So much the worse  rejoined Sangrado  with the principles you sucked
