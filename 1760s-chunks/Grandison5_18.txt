the Ladies around you  nor the Gentlemen neither  hear this grace supposed to be my brother s  Nobody about us shall for me  I would not have my brother made the jest of one Sex  and the aversion of the other  and be thought so singular a young man   Beauchamp says nothing to any body of his regard to Emily  But he lays himself out in so many unaffected assiduities to her  that one cannot but see it  She likes his company and his conversation  But why  because he is always launching out in the praises of his and her beloved friend  He says  there is not  he believes  such another innocent and undesigning heart in the world  except one in Northamptonshire—There s for you  Harriet —So he praises not mine  That is the wickedest thing of these felons of men  Poverty compels them tho —Poverty of genius —They cannot praise one woman  but by robbing the rest  Different  however  from all men  is my brother  I will engage he could find attributes for fifty different women  yet do justice to them all  Because  tho  he sees every one with favour  he is above flattering any   Well  but  Harriet  I expected Letters six times as long as these you sent me  Upon my word  if you are so very heavenly minded  as you appear to be in the first  for the second is hardly a Letter  I will have you to town  and nun you up with aunt Nell  The Doctor is one of the most pious men in England  But she will tire him with praying  and expounding  as she calls it  Do you know that the good creature was a Methodist in Yorkshire  These overdoers  my dear  are wicked wretches  What do they  but make religion look unlovely  and put underdoers out of heart  My brother is The man  You know I must always bring in my brother  tho  I am Page  46 a little out of humour with him  at present  And am I not justified by the many  Since it is always the way of those who intend not to mend  to set their hearts against their correctors—My brother professes not the one half of what he practises  He uses the fashion  without abusing it  or himself  by following it  Some such words in a sacred book rumble in my mad head  but I know I have not them right   It is impossible  say what you will  Harriet  to be long upon terms with this man—Lord G  I mean  He was once half in the right  to be sure  but you should not have reproached me with that  The bride was shewn  the jewels were shewn  the whole family paraded it together  and Emily wrote you all how and about it  But never fear for your poor friend  The honest man will put himself in the wrong next  to save her credit  He has been long careless  and now he is  at times  imperious  as well as careless  Very true  Nay it was but yesterday  that he attempted to hum a tune of contempt  upon my warbling an Italian air  An opera couple  we  Is it not charming to sing at  I cannot say to  each other  when we have a mind to be spiteful  But he has a miserable voice  He cannot sing so fine a song as I can  He should not attempt it  Besides  I can play to my song  that cannot be  Such a foe to melody  that he hates the very fight of my harpsichord  He flies out of the room  if I but move towards it   He has every body of his side  Lord and Lady L   Emily  nay  Dr  Bartlett and aunt Nell  This sets him up  No such thing as managing one s own husband  when so many wise heads join together  to uphold him  Ut terly ruined for a husband  is Lord G   I once bad some hopes of him  But now  every good natur d jest is turned into earnest by these mediators and mediatrices   A few days ago  in a fond fit  I would have stroked his cheek  tho  he was not in a very good humour Page  47 neither—So  then  So  then  said I  as I had seen Beauchamp do an hour before by his prancing nag  and it was construed as a contempt  and his bristles got up upon it  Bless me  thought I  this man is not so sensible of a favour as Beauchamp s horse  and yet I have known the time  when he has thought it an honour to be admitted to press the same fair hand with his lips  on one knee   Hark  He is now  at this very instant  complaining to aunt Nell  Little do they think  that I am in her closet  She hears all he has to say  with greedy ears—These antiquated souls are happy  when they can find reasons from the disagreement of honest people in matrimony  to make a virtue of necossity     Thank
