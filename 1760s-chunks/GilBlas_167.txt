in most outlandish Castilian  or prepare for instant death  At the same time the men who accompanied him levelled their pieces at us  and our ribs would have been well lined with the contents  if we had resisted in the least  Slavery seemed the better alternative than death  so that we delivered our swords to the pirate  He ordered us to be handcuffed and carried on board his vessel  which was moored not far off  then  setting sail  he steered with a fair wind towards Algiers   Thus were we punished for having neglected the warning given us by the officer of the garrison  The first thing the corsair did was to put his hand into our pockets and make free with our money  No bad windfall for him  The two hundred pistoles from the greenhorns at Placentia  the hundred which Moralez had received from Jerome de Moyadas  and which  as ill luck would have it  were in my custody  all this was swept away without a single qualm of conscience  My companions too had their purses well lined  and it was all fish that came to the net  The pirate seemed to chuckle at so successful a drag  and the scoundrel  not contented with chousing us of our cash  insulted us with his infernal Moorish witticisms  but the edge of his satire was not half so keen as the dire necessity which made us the subject of it  After a thousand clumsy sarcasms  he called for the bottles which we had set to cool in the fountain  those irreligious Mahometans not having scrupled to load their consciences with the conveyance of the unholy fermentation  The master and his man pledged one another in many a Christian bumper  and drank to our better acquaintance with a most provoking mockery   While this farce was acting  my comrades wore a hanging look  which testified how pleasantly their thoughts were employed  They were so much the more out of conceit with their captivity  as they thought they had drawn a prize in the lottery of human life  The island of Majorca  with all its luxuries and delights  was a melancholy contrast with their present situation  For my part  I had the good sense to take things as I found them  Less put out of my way by my misfortune than the rest  I joined in conversation with this transmarine joker  and shewed him that wit was the common language of Africa and of Europe  He was pleased with my accommodating spirit  Young man  said he  instead of groaning and sighing  you do well to arm yourself with patience  and to fall in with the current of your destiny  Play us a little air  continued he  observing that I had a guitar by my side  let us have a specimen of your skill  I complied with his command  as soon as my arms were loosened from their confinement  and began to thrum away in a style that drew down the applauses of my discerning audience  It is true that I had been taught by the best master in Madrid  and that I played very tolerably for an amateur upon that instrument  A song was then called for  and my voice gave equal satisfaction  All the Turks on board testified by gestures of admiration the delight with which my performance inspired them  from which circumstance it was but modest to conclude  that vocal music had made no very extraordinary progress in their part of the world  The pirate whispered in my ear  that my slavery should be no disadvantage to me  and that with my talents I might reckon upon an employment  by which my lot would be rendered not only supportable  but happy   I felt somewhat encouraged by these assurances  but flattering as they were  I was not without my uneasiness as to the employment  which the corsair held out as a nameless  but invaluable boon  When we arrived in the port of Algiers  a great number of persons were collected to receive us  and we had not yet disembarked  when they uttered a thousand shouts of joy  Add to this  that the air re echoed with a confused sound of trumpets  of Moorish flutes  and of other instruments  the fashion of that country  forming a symphony of deafening clangour  but very doubtful harmony  The occasion of these rejoicings proceeded from a false report  which had been current about the town  It had been the general talk that the renegado Mahomet  meaning our amiable pirate  had lost his life in the attack of a large Genoese vessel  so that all his friends  informed of his return  were eager to hail him with these thundering demonstrations of attachment   We had no sooner set foot on shore  than my companions and myself were conducted to the palace of the bashaw Soliman  where a Christian secretary  questioning us individually one after another  inquired into our names  our ages  our country  our religion  and our qualifications  Then Mahomet  presenting me to the bashaw  paid my voice more compliments than it deserved  and told him that I played on the guitar with a most ravishing expression  This was enough to influence Soliman in his choice of me for his own immediate service  I took up my abode therefore in his seraglio  The other captives were led
