and truth   The petitioner being dismissed with this promise  the defendant was  in  his turn  brought before the judge  whose prepossession in his favour  was in a great measure weakened by what his antagonist had said to the  prejudice of his birth and reputation   CHAPTER LXI    Peregrine is released  Jolter confounded at his mysterious Conduct  A  Contest happens between the Poet and Painter  who are reconciled by the  Mediation of their Fellow Travellers   Our hero  understanding from some expressions which escaped the prince   that he was considered in the light of a sharper and assassin  begged  that he might have the liberty of sending for some vouchers  that would  probably vindicate his character from the malicious aspersions of his  adversary  This permission being granted  he wrote a letter to  his governor  desiring that he would bring to him the letters of  recommendation which he had received from the British ambassador at  Paris  and such other papers as he thought conducive to evince the  importance of his situation   The billet was given in charge to one of the subaltern officers on  duty  who carried it to the inn  and demanded to speak with Mr  Jolter   Pallet  who happened to be at the door when this messenger arrived   and heard him inquire for the tutor  ran directly to that gentleman s  apartment  and in manifest disorder  told him that a huge fellow of  a soldier  with a monstrous pair of whiskers  and fur cap as big as a  bushel  was asking for him at the door  The poor governor began to shake  at this intimation  though he was not conscious of having committed  anything that could attract the attention of the state  When the officer  appeared at his chamber door  his confusion increased to such a degree     6 22 15  3 45 PM   that his perception seemed to vanish  and the subaltern repeated the  purport of his errand three times  before he could comprehend his  meaning  or venture to receive the letter which he presented  At length  he summoned all his fortitude  and having perused the epistle  his  terror sank into anxiety  His ingenuous fear immediately suggested  that  Peregrine was confined in a dungeon  for some outrage he had committed   He ran with great agitation to a trunk  and  taking out a bundle of  papers  followed his conductor  being attended by the painter  to whom  he had hinted his apprehension   When they passed through the guard  which was under arms  the hearts of  both died within them  and when they came into the presence  there was  such an expression of awful horror on the countenance of Jolter  that  the prince  observing his dismay  was pleased to encourage him with an  assurance that he had nothing to fear  Thus comforted  he recollected  himself so well as to understand his pupil  when he desired him to  produce the ambassador s letters  some of which being open  were  immediately read by his highness  who was personally acquainted with the  writer  and knew several of the noblemen to whom they were addressed   These recommendations were so warm  and represented the young gentleman  in such an advantageous light  that the prince  convinced of the  injustice his character had suffered by the misrepresentation of  Hornbeck  took our hero by the hand  asked pardon for the doubts he had  entertained of his honour  declared him from that moment at liberty   ordered his domestics to be enlarged  and offered him his countenance  and protection as long as he should remain in the Austrian Netherlands   At the same time  he cautioned him against indiscretion in the course  of his gallantries  and took his word of honour  that he should drop  all measures of resentment against the person of Hornbeck during his  residence in that place   The delinquent  thus honourably acquitted  thanked the prince in the  most respectful manner for his generosity and candour  and retired with  his two friends  who were amazed and bewildered in their thoughts  at what they had seen and heard  the whole adventure still remaining  without the sphere of their comprehension  which was not at all  enlarged by the unaccountable appearance of Pipes  who  with the  valet de chambre  joined them at the castle gate  Had Jolter been a man  of a luxuriant imagination  his brain would undoubtedly have suffered in  the investigation of his pupil s mysterious conduct  which he strove in  vain to unravel  but his intellects were too solid to be affected by the  miscarriage of his invention  and  as Peregrine did not think proper  to make him acquainted with the cause of his being apprehended  he  contented himself with supposing that there was a lady in the case   The painter  whose imagination was of a more flimsy texture  formed a  thousand chimerical conjectures  which he communicated to Pickle   in imperfect insinuations  hoping  by his answers and behaviour  to  discover the truth  but the youth  in order to
