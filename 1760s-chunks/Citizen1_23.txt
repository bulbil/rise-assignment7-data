the ladies will pity him  and all that his warmest friends can say in his favour  will be  that the poor good soul has never had any harm in him  I want patience  interrupted I  what  are there no private chastisements for the wife  no schools of penitence to shew her her folly  no rods for such delinquents  Psha  man  replied he smiling  if every delinquent among us were to be treated in your manner  one half of the kingdom would flog the other   I must confess  my dear Fum  that if I were an English husband  of all things I would take care not to be jealous  nor busily pry into these secrets my wife was pleased to keep from me  Should I detect her infidelity  what is the consequence  If I calmly pocket the abuse  I am laughed at by her and her gallant  if I talk my griefs aloud like a tragedy heroe  I am laughed at by the whole world  The course then I d take would be  whenever I went out  to tell my wife where I was going  lest I should unexpectedly meet her abroad in company with some dear deceiver  Whenever I returned  I would use a peculiar rap at the door  and give four loud hems as I walked deliberately up the stair case  I would never inquisitively peep under her bed  or look behind the curtains  And even though I knew the captain was there  I would calmly take a dish of my wife s cool tea  and talk of the army with reverence   Of all nations  the Russians seem to me to behave most wisely in such circumstances  The wife promises her husband never to let him see her transgressions of this nature  and he as punctually promises    71 whenever she is so detected  without the least anger  to beat her without mercy  so they both know what each has to expect  the lady transgresses  is beaten  taken again into favour  and all goes on as before   When a Russian young lady  therefore  is to be married  her father  with a cudgel in his hand  asks the bridegroom  whether he chuses this virgin for his bride  to which the other replies in the affirmative  Upon this  the father turning the lady three times round  and giving her three strokes with his cudgel on the back  my dear  cries he  these are the last blows you are ever to receive from your tend•r father  I resign my authority  and my cudgel to your husband  he knows better than me the use of either  The bridegroom knows decorums too well to accept of the cudgel abruptly  he assures the father that the lady will never want it  and that he would not for the world make any use of it  But the father  who knows what the lady may want better than he  insists upon his acceptance  Upon this  there follows a scene of Russian politeness  while one refuses  and the other offers the cudgel  The whole  however  ends with the bridegroom s taking it  upon which the lady drops a courtesy in token of obedience  and the ceremony proceeds as usual   There is something excessively fair and open in this method of courtship  By this  both sides are prepared for all the matrimonial adventures that are to follow  Marriage has been compared to a game of skill for life  it is generous thus in both parties to declare they are sharpers in the beginning  In England  I am told both sides use every   72 art to conceal their defects from each other before marriage  and the rest of their lives may be regarded as doing penance for their former dissimulation  Farewell   LETTER XX  From the same   THE republic of letters is a very common expression among the Europeans  and yet when applied to the learned of Europe  is the most absurd that can be imagined  since nothing is more unlike a republic than the society which goes by that name  From this expression one would be apt to imagine  that the learned were united into a single body  joining their interests  and concurring in the same design  From this one might be apt to compare them to our literary societies in China  where each acknowledges a just subordination  and all contribute to build the temple of science  without attempting from ignorance or envy to obstruct each other   But very different is the state of learning here  every member of this fancied republic is desirous of governing  and none willing to obey  each looks upon his fellow as a rival  not an assistant in the same pursuit  They calumniate  they injure  they despise  they ridicule each other  if one man writes a book that pleases  others shall write books to shew that he might have given still greater pleasure  or should not have pleased  If one happens to hit upon something new  there are numbers ready to assure the publick that all this was no novelty   73 to them or the learned  that Cardanus or Brunus  or some other author too dull to be generally read  had anticipated the discovery  Thus  instead of uniting like the members of a
