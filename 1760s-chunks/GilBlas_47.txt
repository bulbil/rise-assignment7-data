picture  such a captain will never do for me  My sprightliness made Arias smile  and he went on with his catalogue thus  Donna Manuela de Sandoval  a superannuated dowager  peevish and fantastical  is in want at this very time  she keeps but one  and him never for four and  twenty hours  There has been a livery in the house for these ten years  which fits every new corner  whether tall or short  They only just try it on  so that it is as good as new though it has had two thousand owners  Doctor Alvar Fanez wants a journeyman  an eminent member of the faculty  He boards his family very handsomely  has everything comfortable about him  and gives very high wages  but he is a little too fond of experiments  When he gets a parcel of bad drugs  which happens very often  there is a pretty quick succession of new servants   Oh  I do not in the least doubt it  interrupted Fabricio with a horse laugh  Upon my word  you give me a fine character of your customers  Patience  said Arias de Londona  we have not yet got to the end  there is variety enough  Thereupon he continued to read on  Donna Alfonsa de Solis  an old devotee  who lives two  thirds of her time at church  and always keeps her servant at her apron string  has been in want for these three weeks  The Licentiate Sédillo  an old prebendary of the chapter here  turned away his servant yesterday evening Halt there  Signor Arias de Londona  cried Fabricio at that passage  we will stick to the church  The Licentiate Sédillo is one of my master s friends  and I am very well acquainted with him  I know he has for his housekeeper an old hypocrite  called Dame Jacintha  who is complete mistress of the family  It is one of the best houses in Valladolid  A very idle life  and plenty of excellent meat and drink  Besides  his reverence is an old  gouty  infirm man  likely soon to make his will  there is a legacy to be looked after  That is a delightful prospect for one of our cloth  Gil Blas  added he  turning round to me  let us lose no time  my friend  but go immediately to the licentiate s house  I will introduce you myself  and give you a character  At these words  for fear of missing such an opportunity  we took a hasty leave of Signor Arias  who assured me  for my money  that if I failed here  he would do something as good for me elsewhere       BOOK THE SECOND       CH  I     Fabricio introduces Gil Blas to the Licentiate Sédillo  and procures him a reception  The domestic economy of that clergyman  Picture of his housekeeper   WE were so dreadfully afraid of offending against the regular hours of the old licentiate  that we made but a hop  skip  and jump  from the street with one outlet  to the prebendal residence  The gates were barred  but we ventured to announce our arrival  A girl of ten years old  the housekeeper s professed niece  and slander could not gainsay the relationship  opened the door to us  As we asked to speak with his reverence  Dame Jacintha made her appearance  She was a lady of ripe person and parts  but by no means past her prime  and I was particularly attracted by the clearness of her complexion  She wore a long woollen gown of the most ordinary quality  with a large leathern girdle  whence hung suspended a bunch of keys on one side  and on the other a tremendous string of beads  As soon as we got a glimpse of her  we made our obeisances with all possible reverence  She returned our salutation with similar good breeding  but with an air of modesty  and eyes communing with the ground   I have been told  said my fellow servant  that the reverend the Licentiate Sédillo wants an honest lad  and I have one at his service with whom he will be well satisfied  The superintendent of the household turned up her eyes at these words with a significant side glance at me  and  finding it difficult to reconcile my laced jacket with Fabricio s exordium  asked if it was this fine gentleman who was come after the place  Yes  said the son of Nunez  it is this interesting and engaging youth  Just as you see him  the ups and downs of this transitory life have compelled him to wear an epaulette  but fate will have made him ample amends  added he with an affected languish  if he is so happy as to be an inmate here  and to profit by the society of the virtuous Jacintha  The patriarch of the Indies might have sighed for the virtuous Jacintha at the head of his establishment  At these words  this withered branch of piety withdrew her penetrating regards from me  to contemplate this courteous spokesman  Struck with certain lines which were not new to her  in his face  I have some floating idea of having seen you before  said she  but my memory wants a
