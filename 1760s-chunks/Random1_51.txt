smoaked tye wig that did not boast one crooked hair  and a sloutched hat over it  which would have very well become a chimney sweeper or a dust man —his neck was adorned with a black crape  the ends of which he had twisted  and   139 fixed in the button hole of a shabby great coat that wrapped up his whole body  his white silk stockings were converted into black worsted hose  and his countenance was rendered venerable by wrinkles  and a beard of his own painting —When I expressed my surprize at this metamorphosis  he laughed  and told me  it was done by the advice and assistance of a friend who lived over the way  and would certainly produce something very much to his advantage  for it gave him the appearance of age  which never fails of attracting respect  I applauded his sagacity  and waited with impatience  for the effects of it  At length he was called in  but whether the odness of his appearance excited a curiosity more than usual in the board  or his behaviour was not suitable to his figure  I know not  he was discovered to be an impostor  and put into the hands of the beadle  in order to be sent to Bridewell  So that instead of seeing him come out with a chearful countenance  and a surgeon s qualification in his hand  I perceived him led through the outward hall as a prisoner  and was very much alarmed and anxious to know the occasion  when he called with a lamentable voice and piteous aspect  to me  and some others who knew him    For God s sake  gentlemen  bear witness that I am the same individual John Jackson  who served as surgeon s second mate on board the Elizabeth  or else I shall go to Bridewell  —  It would have been impossible for the most austere hermit that ever lived  to have refrained from laughing at his appearance and address  we therefore indulged ourselves a good while at his expence  and afterwards pleaded his cause so effectually with the beadle  who was   140 gratified with half a crown  that the prisoner was dismissed  and in a few moments resumed his former gaiety —swearing  since the board had refused his money  he would spend it every shilling before he went to bed in treating his friends  at the same time inviting us all to favour him with our company —It was now ten o  clock at night  and as I had a great way to walk in a town where I was a stranger  I was prevailed upon to be of their party  in hopes he would afterwards accompany me to my lodgings  which he faithfully promised —He carried us to his friend s house  who kept a tavern over the way  where we remained drinking punch  until the liquor mounted up to our heads  and made us all extremely frolicksome  I  in particular was so much elevated  that nothing would serve me but a wench  at which Jackson expressed much joy  and assured me I should have my desire before we parted —Accordingly  when he had paid the reckoning we sallied out  roaring and singing  and were conducted by our leader to a place of nocturnal entertainment  where I immediately attached myself to a fair one  with whom I proposed to spend the remaining part of the night  but she not relishing my appearance  refused to grant my request before I had made her an acknowledgment  which not suiting my circumstances we broke off our correspondence  to my no small mortification and resentment  because I thought the mercenary creature had not done justice to my merit —In the mean time  Mr  Jackson s dress had attracted the inclinations and assiduities of two or three nymphs  who loaded him with caresses  in return for the arrack punch with which he treated them  till at length  notwithstanding   141 the sprightly sallies of these charmers  sleep began to exert his power over us all  and our conductor called    To pay    When the bill was brought  which amounted to twelve shillings  he put his hand in his pocket  but might have saved himself the trouble  for his purse was gone —This accident disconcerted him a good deal at first  but after some recollection he seized the two Dulcineas  who sat by him  one in each hand  and swore if they did not immediately restore his money  he would charge a constable with them —The good lady at the bar seeing what passed  whispered something to the drawer  who went out  and then with great composure  asked what was the matter —Jackson told her he was robbed  and if she refused him satisfaction  he would have her and her whores committed to Bridewell —   Robbed  cried she  robbed  in my house  gentlemen and ladies I take you all to witness  this person has scandalized my reputation  —  At that instant  seeing the constable and watch enter  she went on    What  you must not only endeavour by your false aspersions to ruin my character  but even commit an assault against my family  Mr  Constable  I charge you with this uncivil person  who has been guilty of a riot here  I shall take care and bring
