face  or render disgusting even symmetry of figure   The progress of vice being thus rapid and fatal  it is presumed  that the attempt in this work  to direct the rising generation   119 into those paths of conduct  which  pursued  will certainly enable them to shun the rocks on which others have split and arrive at the haven of domestic happiness  will not prove entirely fruitless   It is a maxim  true as common  that example affects more than precept  because the latter offends our pride  while the former interests our passions  This remark suggested the hint of writing these sheets   But to return to Miss ELLIOT s intrigues  She was now in keeping by the duke de N—nois  who spared no cost or pains to render himself agreeable to her  and in short  indulged her in every thing she could desire  He took her to all public places to enjoy the pleasures in vogue among the beau monde   One evening as they were at supper  he said to her  Give me leave  madam  to lay aside my character  and let us talk together with the freedom of equals  my quality sets me at a distance from you  and makes you ceremonious  your beauty exalts you to more than an equality  I must   120 then treat you as lovers do their mistresses  but I cannot speak the language  it is enough to tell you how agreeable you are to me  how I am surprised at your beauty  and resolve to make you happy  and to be happy with you   As N—nois loved Miss ELLIOT to distraction  so he rewarded her with a princely munificence  for first he sent her a toilet  with the appurtenances of silver  even so much as the frame of the table  as also a side board of plate  with all things belonging to it  of massy silver  so that  in short  there was nothing she could either wish for or desqire which she did not possess   Miss ELLIOT  whose motive for keeping company with the duke was principally gain  resolved to get as much out of him as she possibly could  and therefore was always contriving some way to cause him to make her some handsome present  Clothes and jewels she had in abundance  and her coffer was full of money  she might be said to possess  by this time  near ten thousand pounds  for as she had been pretty successful in her intrigues with the   121 D— of C—  and the Count de Guerchy  so she had lived with proper frugality on the favours they had bestowed on her  During the time she lived with this nobleman  she had one child  as beautiful as herself  who  by her own desire  was sent over to France  where it now is  without knowing who are its parents  and a proper settlement is appointed for it   I am now coming to the last adventure Miss ELLIOT ever engaged in  before death put a period to her life  Being one day in the park  a servant in livery  after accosting her very respectfully  put a letter into her hand  and without waiting for an answer retired  She seated herself on a bench  and opening the letter  found it was written by the lord H—h  requesting the honour of a visit from her at his own house  Filled with joy at this happy event  she immediately went home  and sat down to write a suitable answer to it  In the afternoon she dressed herself in the finest clothes she had  and went to his lordship s house  where he received her with open arms  and told her he was dying for love of her  that his life depended on her   122 smiles only  and proceeded to make overtures to her of becoming his mistress  She told him that she was already engaged  but nevertheless had no objection to accept of his generous offer  provided their intrigue could be carried on without the duke s knowledge  In order therefore to conceal their amour the better  they agreed to meet as often as convenient at his lordship s house  which they did  and for about half a year together  without any one taking the least notice of it  or suspecting in the least the intercourse that passed between them  At the expiration of this time  his lordship  who was already married  received a letter from his lady  who had been at the German Spa to drink the waters  intimating that she was on her return to England  This thunderstruck his lordship  who was sensible  that on her ladyship s coming home  his new mistress must decamp  He shewed our heroine the letter  who having read it  bid him not be at all uneasy  for that she would order mattters so that the most vigilant eye should never be able to discover their intrigue     123Miss Elliot was however mistaken in this  for her ladyship had not been in town above a month before the whole plot was revealed to her in the following manner   This noble lord went one afternoon to Miss ELLIOT s lodgings  where  as they were toying together  a servant maid belonging to the house brought up a letter for him
