length when the carnage was pretty well over  Catharina was found hid in an oven   She had been hitherto poor  but still was free  she was now to conform to her hard fate  and learn what it was to be a slave  in this situation  however  she behaved with piety and humility  and though misfortunes had abated her vivacity  yet she was chearful  The fame of her merit and resignation reached even Prince Menzikoff  the Russian General  he desired to see her  was struck with her beauty  bought her from the soldier  her master  and placed her under the direction of his own sister  Here she was treated with all the respect which her merit deserved  while her beauty every day improved with her good fortune   She had not been long in this situation  when Peter the Great paying the Prince a visit  Catherina happened to come in with some dry fruits  which she served round with peculiar modesty  The mighty Monarch saw  and was struck with her beauty  He returned the next day  called for the beautiful slave  asked her several questions  and found her understanding even more perfect than her person     275He had been forced when young to marry from motives of interest  he was now resolved to marry pursuant to his own inclinations  He immediately enquired the history of the fair Livonian  who was not yet eighteen  He traced her through the vale of obscurity  through all the vicissitudes of her fortune  and found her truly great in them all  The meanness of her birth was no obstruction to his design  their nuptials were solemnized in private  the Prince assuring his courtiers  that virtue alone was the properest ladder to a throne   We now see Catharina  from the low mud walled cottage  Empress of the greatest kingdom upon earth  The poor solitary wanderer is now surrounded by thousands  who find happiness in her smile  She  who formerly wanted a meal  is now capable of diffusing plenty upon whole nations  To her fortune she owed a part of this preheminence  but to her virtues more   She ever after retained those great qualities which first placed her on a throne  and while the extraordinary Prince  her husband  laboured for the reformation of his male subjects  she studied in her turn the improvement of her own sex  She altered their dresses  introduced mixed assemblies  instituted an order of female knighthood  and  at length  when she had greatly filled all the stations of Empress  friend  wife  and mother  bravely died without regret  regretted by all   Adieu     276  LETTER LX  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   IN every letter I expect accounts of some new revolutions in China  some strange occurrence in the state  or disaster among my private acquaintance  I open every pacquet with tremulous expectation  and am agreeably disappointed when I find my friends and my country continuing in felicity  I wander  but they are at rest  they suffer few changes but what pass in my own restless imagination  it is only the rapidity of my own motion gives an imaginary swiftness to objects which are in some measure immoveable   Yet believe me  my friend  that even China itself is imperceptibly degenerating from her antient greatness  her laws are now more venal  and her merchants are more deceitful than formerly  the very arts and sciences have run to decay  Observe the carvings on our antient bridges  figures that add grace even to nature  There is not an artist now in all the empire that can imitate their beauty  Our manufactures in porcelaine too are inferior to what we once were famous for  and even Europe now begins to excel us  There was a time when China was the receptacle of strangers  when all were welcome who either came to improve the state  or admire its greatness  now the empire is shut up from every foreign improvement  and the very inhabitants discourage each other from prosecuting their own internal advantages     277Whence this degeneracy in a state so little subject to external revolutions  how happens it that China  which is now more powerful than ever  which is less subject to foreign invasions  and even assisted in some discoveries by her connexions with Europe  whence comes it  I say  that the empire is thus declining so fast into barbarity   This decay is surely from nature  and not the result of voluntary degeneracy  In a period of two or three thousand years she seems at proper intervals to produce great minds  with an effort resembling that which introduces the vicissitudes of seasons  They rise up at once  continue for an age  enlighten the world  fall like ripened corn  and mankind again gradually relapse into pristine barbarity  We little ones look around  are amazed at the decline  seek after the causes of this invisible decay  attribute to want of encouragement what really proceeds from want of power  are astonished to find every art and every science in the decline  not considering that autumn is over  and fatigued nature again begins to repose for some succeeding effort   Some periods have been remarkable for the production of men
