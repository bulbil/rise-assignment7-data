 so that they must   have a crown  where the others were satisfied  with a shilling          And how can it be otherwise    returned the other    while the    principals set them snoh an example of extravagance  and enforce    obedience to it in the manner they do  for though their o wn   exorbitant salaries enable them to live with the luxury of aldermen   at home  and make the appearance of courtiers abroad  how can   they think that their hackney underlings shall be able to change   their dress  with the court  and appear with all the precise foppery   of pretty fellows  if they have not clandestine ways of getting    money   and that this is the case  I can give you an instance not   to be contradicted       Perhaps you may remember a little boy that ran about the    house here  when you were in town last  His mother was servant   to my first wife   you cannot forget black eyed Nan   who was the   father is nothing to my story  but I took care of the boy  When   he grew up I thought the best thing I could do for him was to    get him iato one of the public offices  for he was too soft for my   own business  and this I imagined would sharpen him  and fifty   pounds a year keep him from being an expense to me  Accordingly    I got him admitted as an additional clerk  in this busy time   and    that his appearance should not shame my recommendation  I   added a London made suit to his country wardrobe  which I   thought good enough for him to wear every day        Well  thus equipped  to the office he went  as good looking a    lad as ever came from a Yorkshire academy  which had  been the   height of his education  But I soon found that I had been out of   my reckoning   for  going with him to introduce him to the head   clerk  whom I had before spoken properly to in his behalf  I found   the whole office in deep mourning  which  as it had been ordered   only for the court  and was to hold but for a fortnight longer  I   had never thought of dressing him in   but I soon found that I   had not a proper opinion of the consequence of the place  For   the head clerk gave me a friendly hint   that it was expected   that all the clerks in His Majesty s offices should show the decent         ADVENTVREa OF A GUINEA 33     respect of conforming to the dress of the court on these solemn   occasions          I could not help exclaiming  I believe a little too shortly    What    sir  upon a salary of fifty pounds a year          Sir   replied he   nobody is forced to take that salary  and   they who do not like the rules of the office are at liberty to leave   it     and then turned oS upon his heel          I beg your pardon  sir   said I  seeing my error    it was an   oversight of mine  but it shall be amended           The sooner the better  sir    answered he    for his lordship will   be in the office to morrow  and he must not see anything so   irregular   and pray  sir    turniiig to the lad    get that fleece on   your head shorn a Uttle   â€”  his hair flowed down in modest ringlets on   his shoulders â€”   and strive to appear something like a gerUleman          I saw it was in vain to say anything  and so took the boy away   with me   and had him equipped next day  in all the fashionable   trappings of woe  with his hair shorn indeed  and tied up in a bag    by a French barber  for I would not stand for a trifle when my   hand was in  and then went with him myself   being desirous to see   how he woidd be received in his new appearance   but alas   I had   forgot that indispensable article of a gentleman s dress  a sword    which I was therefore obUged to send out for directly  In a fort    night s time  the order for the court s going into second mourning   put me to the same expense over again   for the rules of
