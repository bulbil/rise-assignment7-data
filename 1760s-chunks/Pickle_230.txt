so that the whole company  amounted to twenty four  We were regaled with a most elegant dinner  in  an apartment which was altogether superb  and served by gentlemen  only  no livery servant being permitted to come within the door  In the  afternoon we embarked in two splendid barges  being attended by a band  of music in a third  and enjoyed a delightful evening upon the river  till the twilight  when we returned and began the ball  which was  conducted with such order and taste  that mirth and good humour  prevailed  No dissatisfaction appeared  except in the countenance of one  old maid  since married to a son of the duke of     who though she would  not refuse to partake of such an agreeable entertainment  was displeased  that I should have the honour of inviting her  O baleful Envy  thou  self tormenting fiend  how dost thou predominate in all assemblies  from  the grand gala of a court  to the meeting of simple peasants at their  harvest home  Nor is the prevalence of this sordid passion to be  wondered at  if we consider the weakness  pride  and vanity of our sex   The presence of one favourite man shall poison the enjoyment of a whole  company  and produce the most rancorous enmity betwixt the closest  friends    I danced with the master of the ball  who employed all the artillery of  his eloquence in making love  yet I did not listen to his addresses  for  he was not to my taste  though he possessed an agreeable person  and a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   good acquired understanding  but he was utterly ignorant of that gentle  prevailing art which I afterwards experienced in Mr  S     and which was  the only method he could have successfully practised in seducing a young  woman like me  born with sentiments of honour  and trained up in the  paths of religion and virtue  This young gentleman was indeed absolutely  master of those insinuating qualifications which few women of passion  and sensibility can resist  and had a person every way adapted for  profiting by these insidious talents  He was well acquainted with the  human heart  conscious of his own power and capacity  and exercised  these endowments with unwearied perseverance  He was tall and thin  of a  shape and size perfectly agreeable to my taste  with large blue eloquent  eyes  good teeth  and a long head turned to gallantry  His behaviour was  the standard of politeness  and all his advances were conducted with the  most profound respect  which is the most effectual expedient a man can  use against us  if he can find means to persuade us that it proceeds  from the excess and delicacy of his passion  It is no other than  a silent compliment  by which our accomplishments are continually  flattered and pleases in proportion to the supposed understanding of  him who pays it    By these arts and advantages this consummate politician in love  began by degrees to sap the foundation of my conjugal faith  he stole  imperceptibly into my affection  and by dint of opportunity  which he  well knew how to improve  triumphed at last over all his rivals    Nor was he the only person that disputed my heart with Earl C    That  nobleman was also rivalled by Lord C  H    a Scotchman  who had been an  intimate and relation of my former husband  Him I would have preferred  to most of his competitors  and actually coquetted with him for some  time  but the amour was interrupted by his going to Ireland  upon which  occasion  understanding that he was but indifferently provided with  money  I made him a present of a gold snuff box  in which was enclosed  a bank note  a trifling mark of my esteem  which he afterwards justified  by the most grateful  friendly  and genteel behaviour  and as we  corresponded by letters  I frankly told him  that Mr  S    had stepped  in  and won the palm from all the rest of my admirers    This new favourite s mother and sister  who lived in the neighbourhood   were my constant companions  and  in consequence of this intimacy  he  never let a day pass without paying his respects to me in person  nay   so ingenious was he in contriving the means of promoting his suit  that  whether I rode or walked  went abroad or stayed at home  he was always  of course one of the party  so that his design seemed to engross his  whole vigilance and attention  Thus he studied my disposition  and  established himself in my good opinion at the same time  He found my  heart was susceptible of every tender impression  and saw that I was not  free from the vanity of youth  he had already acquired my friendship  and esteem  from which he knew there was a short and easy transition to  love  By his penetration choosing proper seasons for the theme  he urged  it with
