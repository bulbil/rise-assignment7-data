as I  the wicked Pamela in  this morning  and   this brother of mine just risen from her       True  said he  you both saw it  and it is my pride that you could see   it   Tis my bridal bed  and  tis abominable that the happiness I knew   before you came hither  should be so barbarously interrupted       Swear to me but  thou bold wretch  said she  swear to me  that Pamela   Andrews is really and truly thy lawful wife  without sham  without   deceit  without double meaning  and I know what I have to say       I ll humour you for once  said he  and then swore a solemn oath that I   was  And  said he  did I not tell you so at first       I cannot yet believe you  said she  because  in this particular  I had   rather have called you knave than fool   Provoke me not too much  said   he  for  if I should as much forget myself as you have done  you d have   no more of a brother in me  than I have a sister in you       Who married you  said she  tell me that  Was it not a broken attorney   in a parson s habit  Tell me truly  in the wench s hearing  When she s   undeceived  she ll know how to behave herself better  Thank God  thought   I  it is not so       No  said he  and I ll tell you  that I bless God  I abhorred that   project  before it was brought to bear  and Mr  Williams married   us   Nay then  said she  but answer me another question or two  I   beseech you  Who gave her away  Parson Peters  said he  Where was the   ceremony performed  In my little chapel  which you may see  as it was   put in order on purpose       Now  said she  I begin to fear there is something in it  But who was   present  said she  Methinks  replied he  I look like a fine puppy  to   suffer myself to be thus interrogated by an insolent sister  but  if   you must know  Mrs  Jewkes was present  O the procuress  said she  But   nobody else  Yes  said he  all my heart and soul       Wretch  said she  and what would thy father and mother have said    had they lived to this day  Their consents  replied he  I should have   thought it my duty to ask  but not yours  madam       Suppose  said she  I had married my father s groom  what would you have   said to that   I could not have behaved worse  replied he  than you have   done  And would you not have thought  said she  I had deserved it       Said he  Does your pride let you see no difference in the case you put    None at all  said she  Where can the difference be between a beggar s   son married by a lady  or a beggar s daughter made a gentleman s wife       Then I ll tell you  replied he  the difference is  a man ennobles the   woman he takes  be she who she will  and adopts her into his own rank    be it what it will  but a woman  though ever so nobly born  debases   herself by a mean marriage  and descends from her own rank to his she   stoops to       When the royal family of Stuart allied itself into the low family of   Hyde   comparatively low  I mean   did any body scruple to call the   lady  Royal Highness  and Duchess of York  And did any body think her   daughters  the late Queen Mary and Queen Anne  less royal for that       When the broken fortuned peer goes into the city to marry a rich   tradesman s daughter  be he duke or earl  does not his consort   immediately become ennobled by his choice  and who scruples to call her   lady  duchess  or countess       But when a duchess or countess dowager descends to mingle with a person   of obscure birth  does she not then degrade herself  and is she not   effectually degraded  And will any duchess or countess rank with her       Now  Lady Davers  do you not see a difference between my marrying my   dear mother s beloved and deserving waiting maid  with a million of   excellencies about her
