in a much shorter space of time  for the communication of which I think myself extremely obliged to you  Whether the poor soul thought him serious  as my mother did  I cannot tell  he made him a bow  however  for the compliment  but was so lowered  that he did not say a word more of Rome or Paris for the rest of the day  and in this we had a double advantage  for as he had nothing else to talk of  his mouth was effectually stopped  except when Mr Faulkland  out of compassion  asked him  as he often did  such questions as he thought he could answer  without exposing his ignorance  for he was contented to have enjoyed it in their tête à tête  and was far from wishing the company to be witnesses of it   I think such a bagatelle may give you some idea of this man’s turn     I told it to Sir George  he laughed heartily  and said it was so like him  My brother loves even his faults  though he will not allow me to call them by that name   July 4  You are unkind  Cecilia  and do not do justice to my sincerity  when you say  you are sure I am in love with Mr Faulkland  If I were  can you conceive it possible that I would deny it to you  Ah  my sister  must I suspect you of wanting candour by your making a charge of disingenuity against your friend  Indeed  Cecilia  if I am in love with him  I do not yet know it myself  I will repeat it to you  I think him the most amiable of men  and should certainly give him the preference  if I were left to a free choice  over all the rest of his sex  at least all that I have ever yet seen  though possibly there may be handsomer  wiser  better men  but they have not fallen within my observation  I am not however so prepossessed in his favour  as to suppose him a phoenix  and if any unforeseen event were to prevent my being his  I am sure I should bear it  and behave very handsomely   And yet perhaps this may be only bragging like a coward  because I think a very short time will put it out of the power of fortune to divide us  Yet certain as the event of our marriage appears to me at present  I still endeavour to keep a sort of guard over my wishes  and will not  give my heart leave to center all its happiness in him  and therefore I cannot rank myself amongst the first rate lovers  who have neither eyes  nor ears  nor sensations  but for one object  This  Mr Faulkland says  is his case  in regard to me  But I think we women should not love at such a rate  till duty makes the passion a virtue  and till that becomes my case  I am so much a philosopher in love that I am determined not to let it absorbe any of the other cordial affections  which I owe to my relations and my friends   I think we ought always to form some laws to ourselves for the regulation of our conduct  without this  what an impertinent dream must the life be of almost every young person of our sex  You  my dear  though with an uncommon understanding of your own  have always been intirely conducted by your wise parents  and in this I make it my boast to have followed your example  I have been accustomed from my infancy to pay an implicit obedience to the best of mothers  the conforming to this never yet cost me an uneasy minute  and I am sure never will     July 5  A little incident happened to day  which pleased my mother wonderfully  She had been at morning prayers  as you know is her daily custom   when returning home in her chair  one of the men happened to flip his foot  and fell down just before Mr Faulkland’s house  He was so much hurt  that he could go no farther  and the footman immediately opening the chair  told her she had better step into Mr Faulkland’s  till he called another  or got a man to assist in carrying her home  One of Mr Faulkland’s servants happened to be standing at the door  so that  without any previous notice  she was immediately conducted into a parlour  where Mr Faulkland was sitting at breakfast  She found with him two pretty little children at his knee  to one of whom he had given some cake  and the elder of the two  a boy of about five years old  he was gravely lecturing  though with great gentleness  for having told a lye  My mother asked him  with some surprise  whose children those were  He smiled  and told her they were his coachman’s  and then ordered the footman to carry them down  bidding the little boy be sure to remember what he had said to him   My mother enquired  if he permitted them to be in the house  He said  he did  and had been induced to do it from the distress he had seen
