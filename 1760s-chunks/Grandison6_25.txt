many persons present  I thought it was free in Sir Grandison  Yet perhaps he could   62 not well quit it  as I did not withdraw it  so that the fault might be rather in my passiveness  than in his forwardness   However  I asked my aunt afterwards  If his looks were not those of a man assured of success  as indeed he might be from my grandmother s Letter  and my silence to his  She said  there was a manly freedom in his address to me  but that it had such a mixture of tenderness in it  that never  in her eyes  was freedom so becoming  While he was restrained by his situation  added she  no wonder that he treated you with respect only  as a Friend  but now he finds himself at liberty to address you  his behaviour ought  as a Lover  to have just been what it was   Sir Charles led me into talk  by mentioning you and Lady L  your two Lords  and my Emily   My uncle and aunt withdrew  and had some little canvassings  it seems   All their canvassings are those of assured Lovers  about the propriety of my uncle s invitation to Sir Charles to take up his residence  while he was in these parts  at Selby house  My uncle  at coming in  had directed Sir Charles s servants to put up their horses  But they  not having their master s orders to do so  held themselves in readiness to attend him  as they knew that Sir Charles had given directions to his gentleman  Richard Saunders  who brought the billet to my uncle  to go back to Northhampton  and provide apartments for him at the George inn there   My aunt  who you know is a perfect judge of points of decorum  pleaded to my uncle  that it was too well known among our select friends  by Mr  Greville s means  that Sir Charles had never before made his addresses to me  and that therefore  tho  he was to be treated as a man whose alliance is considered as an honour to us  yet that some measures were to be kept  as to the look of the thing  and that the world might not conclude that I was to be won at his very   63 first appearance  and the rather  as Mr  Greville s violence  as well as virulence  was so well known   My uncle was petulant  I  said he  am always in the wrong  You women  never  He ran into all those peculiarities of words  for which you have so often raillied him—His adsheart  his female scrupulosities  his What a pize  his hatred of shilly shally s and fiddle faddles  and the rest of our female nonsenses  as he calls them  He hoped to salute his niece  as Lady Grandison  in a fortnight  What a duce was the matter it could not be so  both sides now of a mind —He warned my aunt  and bid her warn me  against affectation  now the crisis was at hand  Sir Charles  he said  would think meanly of us  if we were silly  And then came in another of his odd words  Sir Charles  he said  had been so much already bamboozled  that he would not have patience with us  and therefore  and for all these reasons  as he called them  he desired that Sir Charles might not be suffered to go out of the house  and to an inn  and this as well for the propriety of the thing  as for the credit of his own invitation to him   My aunt replied  that Sir Charles himself would expect delicacy from us  It was evident  that he expected not  no doubt for the sake of the world s eye  to reside in the house with me on his first visit  by his having ordered his servant who brought the billet  to take apartments for him at Northampton  even not designing to visit us over night  had he not been met by Mr  Deane and himself  and persuaded to come  In short  my dear  said my aunt  I am as much concerned about Sir Charles s own opinion of our conduct  as for that of the world  Yet you know  that every genteel family around us expected examples from us  and Harriet  If Sir Charles is not with us  the oftener he visits us  the more respectful it will be construed  I hope he will live with us all day  and every day  But indeed it must be as a visiter  not as an inmate     64 Why then bring me off some how  that I may not seem the blunderer you are always making me by your documents—Will you do that   When my uncle and aunt came in  they found Sir Charles  and Dr  Deane  and me  talking  Our subject was  the happiness of Lord and Lady W  and the whole Mansfield family  with whom Mr  Deane  who began the discourse  is well acquainted  Sir Charles arose  at their entrance  The night draws on  said he—I will do myself the honour
