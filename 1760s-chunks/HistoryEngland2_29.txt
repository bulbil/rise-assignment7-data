seizing the crown  James now  therefore  issued orders for prosecuting all those clergymen who had forborne to read his declaration  He placed one Gifford  a Doctor of the Sorbonne  at the head of Magdalen College  and likewise nominated him to the see of Oxford  lately become vacant  Every member of the Church of England now saw their danger  and Whigs and Tories united their efforts to oppose it   William  Prince of Orange  had married Mary the daughter of King James  This Prince had been early immersed in danger  calamities  and politics  the designs of France  and the turbulence of Holland  had served to sharpen his talents  and given him a propensity for intrigue  This great politician and soldier concealed beneath a phlegmatic appearance  a most violent and boundless ambition  all his actions were levelled at power  while his discourse never betrayed the wishes of his heart  His temper was cold and severe  his genius active and piercing  he was valiant without ostentation  and politic without address  disdaining the pleasures  or the elegancies of life  yet eager after the phantom of pre eminence  He was no stranger to the murmurs of the English  and was resolved to turn them to his interest  He   77 therefore accepted the invitations of the nobility and others  and still more willingly embarked in the cause  as he found the malecontents had concerted their measures with prudence and secrecy   A fleet was equipped sufficient to transport fifteen thousand troops  and it was at first given out that this armament was designed against France  James  at length  began to see his own errors and the discontents of the people  he would now have retracted his measures in favour of Popery  but it was too late  the fleet of the Prince was already sailed  and had landed thirteen thousand troops at the village of Broxholme in Torbay   The expectations of the Prince of Orange seemed  at first  to be frustrated  very few Englishmen offered him their services  though the people were  in general  well affected to his design  Slight repulses were not sufficient to intimidate a general who had  from early youth  encountered adversity  he continued ten days in expectation of being joined by the malecontents without success  but  just when he began to deliberate about reimbarking his forces  he was joined by several persons of consequence  and the country people came flocking to his standard  From this day his numbers began to increase  the nobility  which had composed the court and council of King James  now left their old Master to solicit protection from the new   Lewis XIV  had long foreseen this defection  and had formerly offered the King thirty thousand men for his security  This was then refused by James  by the advice of Sunderland  his favourite  who was secretly in the interests of the Prince of Orange  James  however  now requested assistance from France  when it was too late for his service  he wrote in vain to Leopold  Emperor of Germany  who only returned for answer  that what he had foreseen had happened  He had some dependence on his fleet    78 but they were entirely disaffected  In a word  his interests were deserted by all  for he had long deserted them himself  He was at the head of an army of twenty thousand men  and it is possible that  had he led them to the combat without granting them time for deliberation  they might have fought in his favour  but he was involved in a maze of fears and suspicions  the defection of those he most confided in took away his power of deliberation  and his perplexity was increased  when told that the Prince of Denmark and Anne  his favourite daughter  had gone over to the Prince of Orange  In this exigence he could not repress his tears  but in the agony of his heart was heard to exclaim    God help me  my own children have forsaken me     He now hung over the precipice of destruction  invaded by one son in law  abandoned by another  hated by his subjects  and detested by those who had suffered beneath his cruelty  He assembled the few noblemen who still adhered to his interests  and demanded their advice and assistance  Addressing himself to the Earl of Bedford  father to Lord Russel  who was beheaded by James s intrigues in the preceding reign    My Lord  said he  you are an honest man  have great credit  and can do me signal service    Ah  Sir  replied the Earl  I am old and feeble  I can do you but little service  but I once had a son that could have assisted you  but he is no more    James was so struck with this reply  that he could not speak for some minutes     The King was naturally timid  and some counsellors about him  either sharing his fears  or bribed by the Prince  contributed to increase his apprehensions  They reminded him of the fate of Charles I  and aggravated the turbulence of the people  He was  at length  persuaded to think of flying from a nation he could no longer govern  and
