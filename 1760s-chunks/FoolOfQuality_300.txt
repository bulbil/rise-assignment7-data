heap of dirt and rubbish that the   working of their own purblind and floundering reason hath cast   about them      Sacred depths and stupendous mysteries belong to this matter    and  when you are able to bear them  they shall be clearly and   fully unfolded to you  my Harry   in the mean space  a few simple   observations will suffice to re establish the peace of your sweet and   pious heart      As Christianity was instituted for the salvation of the vulgar  the   principal truths thereof are very obvious and plain  and want no   learning  no letters  to inculcate or teach them  They speak the   language of nature  and all nature is expressive of the sense and   the sound thereof  Whatever is within you  whatever is without   you  cries aloud for a Saviour  For sin hath been as the Mezentius    of whom you read in Virgil  who bound the bodies of the dead to   the persons of the living  Thus it is that the sin of fallen angels    and of fallen men  hath bound change and corruption  distempera    ture and death  to the elements  to the vegetables  to animals  and   even to the immortal image of God himself in the humanity   so   that all things cry out with the apostle St  Paul  Who shall   deliver me from the body of this death     so that all things cry   out with the apostle St  Peter   Save  Lord  or I perish         These are inevitable truths  my Harry  which all men  at some   time  must feel throughout their existence  whether they read them   or not  And he alone  who never experienced  nor never shall ex    perience  frailty  error  or sickness  pain  anguish  or dissolution    is exempt from our solar system of salvation from sin      But what sort of a Saviour is it for whom all things cry so   loudly  Is it a dry moralist  a legislator of bare and external   precepts  such as your Mole philosopher required our Christ to be     No  my darling  no   The influence and existence of the Kedeemer   of nature must  at least  be as extensive as nature herself      Things are defiled and corrupted throughout   they are distem    pered and devoted to death from the inmost essence of their being     and nothing under him  in whom they live  and move  and have   their being  can redeem them  can restore them      O  sir   exclaimed Harry his countenance brightening up why   could I not think of this   I should then have been able to foil my   malignant adversary even at his own weapons      Our Jesus himself  continued Mr  Fenton  appeals to the truth I   have told you  where he says to the sick of the palsy   Son  be of good   cheer  thy sins are forgiven thee   But when the Pharisees there    upon concluded that he blasphemed  he demonstrated his influence         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  327     in and over the soul  by the sensible evidence of his operation   and influence in and over the body   What reason ye in your   hearts     said Jesus     Whether is it easier to say    Thy sins be   forgiven thee     or to say    Kise up and walk       Then said he to   the sick of the palsy    Arise and take up thy couch  and go to   thine house   And immediately he rose up before them  and took   up that whereon he had been carried  and departed to his own   house  glorifying God      Here it was  necessary  for the performance of this wonderful   and instantaneous cure  that Jesus should instantly operate in   and through every member  nerve  and fibre of the sick of the   palsy  And it was equally necessary  for that purpose  that the   sick of the palsy should have lived  and have had his being  in Jesus    In like manner  also  his sins must have been pardoned by an   inward salvation  by imparting to the will of the sinner a new and   rectified will  and by informing his spirit with a detestation of evil    and a love of goodness and virtue      But pray  sir  if it is not too profound a mystery for me  be   pleased to inform me how God could be made man   For this was
