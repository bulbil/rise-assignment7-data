provide for him  and in the mean time to accommodate him with a few cloaths  by which   137 his appearance would be much mended  and himself enabled to renew his solicitations in person   As we walked along  conversing socially together  we were met by a file of Musqueteers  and Strap at their head  who no sooner approached  than with a frantick look  he cried     Seize them —in the name of God  seize them —  We were accordingly surrounded  and I put in arrest by the corporal  who was commanding officer  but captain Oregan disengaged himself  and run with such speed towards Tottenham court road  that he was out of sight in a moment  When my arms were delivered up  and myself secured  Strap became a little more composed  and asked pardon for the liberty he had taken  which he hoped I would excuse  as it proceeded from his affection  He then told me that  suspecting the letter  which by the bye was brought by the author himself  contained something extraordinary  he had peeped through the key hole  and seen me load my pistols  upon which he run down to Whitehall  and applied to the officer on guard  for a party to put me in arrest  but before he returned  I was gone in a coach  that he had enquired which way I went  and having often heard  that duels were commonly fought at the back of Montague house  he conducted the guard to this place  where he thanked God for having found me safe and sound  I let him know  that I forgave his officious concern for once  but cautioned him in pretty severe terms  from making me the subject of idle conversation for the future  then  turning to the corporal  I thanked him for his care  and gave hime a crown to drink with his men  assuring him that the rencontre was over long before he   138 came up  and every thing compromised  as he might have observed by our behaviour  as a farther proof of which  he would find upon examination  that one of my pistols had been discharged —but this civil person  without giving himself or me any further trouble  received the bounty with a thousand bows and acknowledgments  and returning the pistols  released me immediately     He was not gone an hundred yards  when my friend Oregan came up  in order to rescue me  with two Tatterdemalions whom he had engaged for that purpose  about the purlieus of St  Giles s  One of them was armed with a musket that wanted a lock  and another with a rusty broadsword  but their dress surpassed all description —When he understood I was already free  he made an apology for his abrupt departure  and introduced me to his two companions  First  to counsellor Fitz clabber  who  he told me  was then employed in compiling a history of the kings of Munster  from Irish manuscripts  and then to his friend Mr  Gaghagan  who was a profound philosopher and politician  and had projected many excellent schemes for the good of his country —But it seems these literati had been very ill rewarded for their ingenious labours  for between them both  there was but one shirt and half a pair of breeches —I thanked them very kindly for their readiness to assist me  and having offered my service in my turn  wished them a good morrow  desiring Oregan to accompany me to my lodgings  where he was fitted with decent cloaths from my wardrobe  so much to his satisfaction  that he swore eternal gratitude and friendship   139 to me  and at my request  recounted all the adventures of his life   In the afternoon  I waited on Melinda  who received me with great kindness and familiarity  and laughed excessively at my adventure with the Irishman  to whose wishes she was no stranger  having more than a dozen letters in her possession  which he had wrote to her on the subject of love  and which  for my entertainment  she submitted to my perusal —Having made ourselves merry at the expence of this poor admirer  I seized the opportunity of her mother s going out of the room  and introduced my own passion  which I recommended to her with all the ardour and eloquence I was master of —I flattered  sighed  swore  intreated  and acted a thousand extravagancies  in hopes of making some impression on her heart  but she heard every thing I said without discovering the least emotion  and other company came in  before she would vouchsafe one serious reply —After tea  the cards were brought in according to custom  and it was my good fortune to have Melinda for my partner  by which means  instead of losing  I came off with five guineas clear gain   I soon became acquainted with a good many people of fashion  and spent my time in the modish diversions of the town  such as plays  operas  masquerades  drums  assemblies and puppetshews  chiefly in company with Melinda  whom I cultivated with all the eagerness and address that my prospect could inspire  and my education afford  I spared neither my person nor my purse  to gratify her vanity and pride  my
