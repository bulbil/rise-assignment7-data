hints you give  that some accidents  not        altogether pleasing  had occasioned it  I long to hear what has        happened to you since last we saw each other  and will not fail to        wait on you this afternoon  I know nothing of the part of the town        you are in  but suppose a hackney coach will be able to find it s        way  I will detain your messenger no longer than to tell you that I        am  with the most perfect amity  dear Miss Forward  your very        affectionate friend  and humble servant            E  THOUGHTLESS        Miss Flora had not been present when the maid delivered the letter to   Miss Betsy  but coming into the chamber just as she had finished  and   was sealing up the answer to it   So   said she   have I catched you    Pray what new lover have you been writing to this morning   It was in   vain that Miss Betsy told her she never had yet seen the man she thought   worthy of a letter from her on the score of love  the other persisted in   her asseverations  and Miss Betsy  to silence her raillery  was obliged   to shew her some part of the letter she had received from Miss Forward       It being near breakfast time they went down together into the parlour    and as they were drinking their coffee   Well  pretty lady   said Mr    Goodman to Miss Betsy  with a smile   how did you like the gentleman   that dined here yesterday   This question so much surprized her that she   could not help blushing   Like him  Sir   replied she   I did not take   any notice of him  I remember a stranger was here  and staid a good   while  and that is all  for I neither observed any thing he said or did    or thought on him since     The agreeable confusion   cried Mr  Goodman    gaily   you are in at my mentioning him  makes me believe you remarked   him more than you are willing to acknowledge  and I am very glad of it    you do him but justice  I assure you  for he is very much in love with   you         Lord  Sir   said Miss Betsy  blushing still more   I cannot imagine   what makes you talk so  I don t suppose the man thinks of me any more   than I do of him     That may be   rejoined he  laughing outright  Lady   Mellasin then took up the word  and told her husband he was very merry   this morning   Aye   said he   the hurry of spirits I have put poor Miss   Betsy in has made me so  for I can assure you the thing is very serious    but   continued he   you shall know the whole of it        He then proceeded to inform them  that the person he had been speaking   of was the son of one who had formerly been a merchant  but who  having   acquired a large fortune by his industry  had for several years past   left off business  and lived mostly in the country  that the young   gentleman had seen Miss Betsy at St  Paul s Rehearsal  when they were   all there to hear the musick  that the next day after  he had come to   him at a coffee house  which it was known he frequented  and after   asking many questions concerning Miss Betsy  and hearing she was not   engaged  declared he was very much charmed with her  and entreated his   permission  as being her guardian  to make his addresses to her  Mr    Goodman remembered the affront he had received from Alderman Saving on a   like occasion  and was determined not to lay himself open to the same   from Mr  Staple   for so he was called  and plainly told the young lover   that he would encourage nothing of that sort without the approbation of   his father  that after this he had a meeting with the old gentleman  who   being fully satisfied by him of Miss Betsy s family  fortune  and   character  had no objections to make against his son s inclination     Having this sanction   continued Mr  Goodman   and believing it may be   a very proper match for both of you  I brought him home with me to   dinner yesterday  and should be glad to know
