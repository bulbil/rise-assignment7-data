Sir George’s return  in order to deliver Master Faulkland into his hands  and that she then meant to retire into the country  with her two children  and Patty  the faithful companion and partner of her grief   Lady Sarah Bidulph  who would gladly have gone with Sir George to Holland  had been persuaded by him to stay behind  in order to bear his sister company in her affliction  and Mrs Arnold said  she had dedicated much of her time to that friendly purpose   Her Ladyship came to pay her a visit whilst I was there  I had never seen Lady Sarah before  and we were introduced to each other   I took my leave of Mrs Arnold  and promised to see her again the next day   In the morning  as I was preparing to go to her  I received a note from Lady Sarah Bidulph  earnestly requesting the favour of seeing me  at her house  in St James’s Square  before I went to Mrs Arnold   I obeyed this unexpected summons  and immediately waited on her   I took the liberty  Madam  said she  of desiring to see you here this morning  at Sir George’s request  he arrived late last night  and brings most melancholy news from Holland   Sir George entered the room while she spoke  After the first greeting of friends long parted were over  I am afraid to ask  Sir George  said I  yet am impatient to learn something of Mr Faulkland  your lady has terribly alarmed me  Mr Faulkland is not returned  I dare not enquire the reason  Tears instantly sprung into Sir George’s eyes  He returns no more  said he  his remains are soon to be conveyed to England to be laid with his ancestors   Ah  Sir  cried I  what will poor Mrs Arnold say to this fresh misfortune   It was on that account Madam  he replied  that we are now requested to speak with you  before you saw my sister  You  who are her bosom friend  can more tenderly disclose this melancholy event than any one  I have not the courage to see her  We must beg of you  dear Madam  to prepare the unhappy Sidney for the news   I asked him the manner of Mr Faulkland’s death  I cannot positively say  answered Sir George  but much I fear he precipitated his own fate   Mr Warner  or I  constantly staid with him from the time we disclosed the fatal account we brought concerning Mrs Faulkland  Knowing as we did the violence of his temper  we were apprehensive    of sudden and dreadful consequences  but he deceived us both  for after the first starts of passion were over  which though they shocked  did not alarm us  as we expected them  he assumed a calm resignation to his fate  and talked with such a rational composure of the strange circumstances of this incident  that we began to entertain hopes  that the efforts of his reason  joined to our constant endeavours to sooth and console him  would in time so far succeed  and though we never expected to see him restored to a tranquil state of mind  we yet flattered ourselves he would submit to life upon such terms as Providence thought fit to impose on him   I was with him  proceeded Sir George  when he received a letter from my sister  His hands shook so on perceiving by the superscription that it came from her  that he let the letter drop  Read it for me  Bidulph  said he  and tell me how it fares with Mrs Arnold   I instantly complied with his request  I found by the date of the letter that it had been delayed much longer than it ought to have been  which I immediately observed to him  as he had often expressed his uneasiness at not hearing from my sister   Mrs Arnold is well  said I  giving him the letter  read what it says  and let her teach you fortitude   He withdrew to a window to peruse it  After he had read it  I admire your sister’s stoicism  said he  stepping back to his chair  This is true philosophy  laying his finger on the letter which he still held in his hand  Her heroic soul is still unmoved  and above the reach of adversity  Happy Mrs Arnold—What a vain fool was I to think that such a mind as hers could be subdued  He paused and seemed for a while buried in thought  Then putting the letter up in his pocket  he began to discourse on some other topic   We passed the evening together  continued Sir George  and though Faulkland was far from being chearful  I thought he appeared more tranquil than he had done since my arrival   I talked to him of his returning to England with me  He said with a smile  I think I ought to go if it were for no other reason but that I may have my dust mingled with that of my forefathers  and this office  Bidulph  I expect from you  if you should outlive me   I laughed at him  and said I thought he had a much more material reason that pressed his return
