being detained close by the field of this  contention  Pipes could not bear to see the laws of boxing so  scandalously transgressed  and  leaping from his station  pulled the  offender from his antagonist  whom he raised up  and in the English  language encouraged to a second essay  instructing him at the same time  by clenching his fists according to art  and putting himself in a proper  attitude  Thus confirmed  the enraged carman sprang upon his foe  and  in all appearance would have effectually revenged the injury he had  sustained  if he had not been prevented by the interposition of a  lacquey belonging to a nobleman  whose coach was obliged to halt in  consequence of the dispute  This footman  who was distinguished by  a cane  descending from his post  without the least ceremony or  expostulation  began to employ his weapon upon the head and shoulders  of the peasant who had been patronized by Pipes  upon which  Thomas   resenting such ungenerous behaviour  bestowed such a stomacher upon  the officious intermeddler  as discomposed the whole economy of his  entrails  and obliged him to discharge the interjection Ah  with  demonstrations of great anguish and amazement  The other two footmen  who stood behind the coach  seeing their fellow servant so insolently  assaulted  flew to his assistance  and rallied a most disagreeable  shower upon the head of his aggressor  who had no means of diversion or  defence   Peregrine  though he did not approve of Tom s conduct  could not bear  to see him so roughly handled  especially as he thought his own honour  concerned in the fray  and therefore  quitting his machine  came to the  rescue of his attendant  and charged his adversaries sword in hand   Two of them no sooner perceived this reinforcement  than they betook  themselves to flight  and Pipes  having twisted the cane out of the  hands of the third  belaboured him so unmercifully  that our hero  thought proper to interpose his authority in his behalf  The common  people stood aghast at this unprecedented boldness of Pickle  who  understanding that the person whose servants he had disciplined was a  general and prince of the blood  went up to the coach  and asked pardon  for what he had done  imputing his own behaviour to his ignorance of  the other s quality  The old nobleman accepted of his apology with great  politeness  thanking him for the trouble he had taken to reform the  manners of his domestics  and guessing from our youth s appearance that  he was some stranger of condition  very courteously invited him into the  coach  on the supposition that they were both going to the opera  Pickle  gladly embraced this opportunity of becoming acquainted with a person  of such rank  and  ordering his own chariot to follow  accompanied  the count to his loge  where he conversed with him during the whole  entertainment   He soon perceived that Peregrine was not deficient in spirit or sense   and seemed particularly pleased with his engaging manner and easy  deportment  qualifications for which the English nation is by no means  remarkable in France  and therefore the more conspicuous and agreeable    6 22 15  3 45 PM   in the character of our hero  whom the nobleman carried home that same  evening  and introduced to his lady and several persons of fashion who  supped at his house  Peregrine was quite captivated by their affable  behaviour and the vivacity of their discourse  and  after having been  honoured with particular marks of consideration  took his leave  fully  determined to cultivate such a valuable acquaintance   His vanity suggested  that now the time was come when he should profit  by his talents among the fair sex  on whom he resolved to employ his  utmost art and address  With this view he assiduously engaged in all  parties to which he had access by means of his noble friend  who let  slip no opportunity of gratifying his ambition  He for some time shared  in all his amusements  and was entertained in many of the best families  of France  but he did not long enjoy that elevation of hope  which had  flattered his imagination  He soon perceived that it would be impossible  to maintain the honourable connections he had made  without engaging  every day at quadrille  or  in other words  losing his money  for every  person of rank  whether male or female  was a professed gamester  who  knew and practised all the finesse of the art  of which he was entirely  ignorant  Besides  he began to find himself a mere novice in French  gallantry  which is supported by an amazing volubility of tongue  and  obsequious and incredible attention to trifles  a surprising faculty  of laughing out of pure complaisance  and a nothingness of conversation  which he could never attain  In short  our hero  who among his own  countrymen would have passed for a sprightly  entertaining fellow  was  considered in the brilliant assemblies of France as a youth of a very  phlegmatic disposition  No wonder  then  that
