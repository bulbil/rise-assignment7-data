Good sense to be sure is requisite  said my mother  but as for beauty it is but a fading flower at best  and in a man not at all necessary—A man is not the worse for it  however  cried my brother—No—my mother answered  provided it does not make him vain  and too fond of the admiration of giddy girls—That I will be sworn is not the case of my friend  answered Sir George  I believe no body with such a person as his  if there can be such another  would be so little vain of it  nay  I have heard him declare  that even in a woman he would give the preference to sense and virtue   Good young man  cried my mother  I should like to be acquainted with him   So should I  whispered I to my own heart    Well brother  said I  you have drawn a good picture  but to make it complete  you must throw in generosity  valour  sweetness of temper  and a great deal of money—Fie my dear  said my good literal parent  a great deal is not necessary  a very moderate fortune with such a man is sufficient   The good qualities you require in the finishing of my piece  answered my brother  he possesses in an eminent degree—will that satisfy you  As for his fortune    mdash there perhaps a difficulty may step in—What estate madam  to my mother  do you think my sister’s fortune may intitle her to   Dear brother  I cried  pray do not speak in that bargaining way   My mother answered him very gravely  Your father you know left her but four thousand pounds  it is in my power to add a little to it  if she marries to please me  Great matters we have no right to expect  but a very good girl  as my daughter is  I think  deserves something more than a bare equivalent  The equality  said my brother   with a demure look  I fear is out of all proportion here  for the gentleman I speak of has but—six thousand pounds a year   He burst out a laughing  it was not good natured  and I was vexed at his joke  My poor mother dropped her countenance  I looked silly  as if I had been disappointed  but I said nothing   Then he is above our reach  Sidney  answered my mother   I made no reply—Have a good heart Sid  cried my brother  if my nonpareil likes you  when he sees you   I felt myself hurt  and grow red  and without a compliment sister  seeing me look mortified  I think he will  fortune will be no objection  I have already told him the utmost extent of your expectations  he would hardly let me mention the subject  he has a mind for my sister  and if he finds her personal accomplishments answer a brother’s  perhaps partial  description  it will be your own fault if you have not the prettiest fellow in England for your husband   My mother reassumed her pleased countenance  Where is he  let us see him  I forced a smile  though I did not feel myself quite satisfied—We parted on the road  my brother answered  he is gone to Bath  for a few weeks  he has sent his servants and his baggage to town before him  and has commissioned me to take a house for him in St  James’s Square  or some of the adjacent streets  so that we shall have him in our neighbourhood   My mother enquired on what account he went to Bath  Sir George said  he complained of a weakness in one of his wrists  which was the consequence of a fever that had seized him on his journey  in their return to England  It seems he had finished his travels  on which he had been absent near five years  when my brother and he met in Germany  The liking he took to Sir George protracted his stay  and he resolved not to quit him while his health obliged him to continue abroad  they took a trip to Paris together  and returned home by Holland   The name of this piece of perfection is Faulkland  Orlando Faulkland  What a pretty name Orlando is  My mother says it is    romantic  and wonders how sober people can give their children such names   Now am I dying with curiosity to see this man  A few weeks at Bath—what business he had to go to Bath till he had first settled his household at London  His wrist might have grown well without the pump  I am afraid he is gone to Bath only to shew himself  and that he will be snapped up before he comes to town  I wish Sir George had kept the account of him to himself  till he returned to London again   April 7  We have settled Sir George’s oeconomy within doors  my mother has been very busy all day in fixing trunks  portmanteaus  and boxes  in their proper places  and in appropriating the rooms for his men  which she has taken care shall be as remote from those of our servants as the house will admit  She says  she knows
