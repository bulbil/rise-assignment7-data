suddenly flew off at a tangent  and retreated growling to his den  from whence he could by no means be lugged again by the Cuboy  until Taycho  exalting his voice  uttered these words —   But I will exalt your authority more than ever it was debased—I will extol your wisdom  and expatiate on your generosity  I will glorify the White Horse  and sacrifice all the treasures of Japan  if needful  for the protection of the farm of Yesso    By these cabalistical sounds the wrath of Got hama baba was intirely appeased  He now returned with an air of gaiety  strutting  sideling  circling  fluttering  and cobbling like a turkey cock in his pride  when he displays his seathers to the sun  Taycho hailed the omen  and turning his face from the emperor  received such a salutation on the os sacrum  that the parts continued vibrating and singling for several days        125 An indenture tripartite was now drawn up and executed  Fika kaka was continued treasurer  with his levees  his Bonzas  and his places  and orator Taycho undertook  in the character of chief scribe  to protect the farm of Yesso  as well as to bridle and manage the blatant beast whose name was Legion  That a person of his kidney should have the presumption to undertake such an affair  is not at all surprising  the wonder is  that his performance should even exceed his promise  The truth is  he promised more than he could have performed  had not certain unforeseen incidents  in which he had no concern  contributed towards the infatuation of the people   The first trial to which he brought his ascendency over the mob  was his procuring from them a free gift  to enable the Dairo to arm his own private tenants in Yesso  together with some ragamuffin Tartars in the    126 neighbourhood  for the defence of the farm  They winked so hard upon this first over act of his apostacy  that he was fully persuaded they had resigned up all their senses to his direction  and resolved to shew them to all Europe  as a surprising instance of his art in monster taming  This furious beast not only suffered itself to be bridled and saddled  but frisked and fawned  and purred and yelped  and crouched before the orator  licking his feet  and presenting its back to the burthens which he was pleased to impose  Immediately after this first essay  Qamba cun dono the Fatzman was sent over to assemble and command a body of light horse in Yesso  in order to keep an eye on the motions of the enemy  and indeed this vigilant and sagacious commander conducted himself with such activity and discretion  that he soon brought the war in those parts to a point of termination      127 Mean while  Brut an tiffi continuing to hover on the skirts of the farm  at the head of his myrmidons  and demanding of the Dairo a categorical answer to the hints he had given  Got hama baba underwent several successive fits of impatience and distraction  The Cuboy  instigated by his own partizans  and in particular by Mura clami  who hoped to see Taycho take some desperate step that would ruin his popularity  I say the Cuboy  thus stimulated  began to ply the orator with such pressing intreaties as he could no longer resist  and now he exhibited such a specimen of his own power and the people s insanity  as transcends the flight of ordinary faith  Without taking the trouble to scratch their long ears  tickle their noses  drench them with mandragora or geneva  or make the least apology for his own turning tail to the principles which he had all his life so    128 strenuously inculcated  he crammed down their throats an obligation to pay a yearly tribute to Brut antiffi  in consideration of his forbearing to seize the Dairo s farm  a tribute which amounted to seven times the value of the lands  for the defence of which it was payed  When I said crammed  I ought to have used another phrase  The beast  far from shewing any signs of loathing  closed its eyes  opened its hideous jaws  and as it swallowed the inglorious bond  wagged its tail in token of intire satisfaction   No fritter on Shrove Tuesday was ever more dexterously turned  than were the hydra s brains by this mountebank in patriotism  this juggler in politicks  this cat in pan  or cake in pan  or 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 in principle  Some people gave out that he dealt with a conjurer  and others scrupled not to insinuate that he had sold himself to the evil spirit  But there was    129 no occasion for a conjurer to deceive those whom the daemon of folly had previously confounded  and as to selling  he sold nothing but the interest of his country  and of that he made a very bad bargain  Be that as it may  the Japonese now viewed Brut an tiffi either through a new perspective  or else surveyed him with organs intirely metamorphosed  Yesterday they detested him as a profligate ruffian lost to all sense of honesty and shame  addicted to all manner of vice  a scoffer at religion  particularly that of Fakkubasi  the
