said I  but I used half another for a cover  you   know  and see how I have scribbled the other half  and so I shewed her   a parcel of broken scraps of verses  which I had tried to recollect  and   had written purposely that she might see  and think me usually employed   to such idle purposes  Ay  said she  so you have  well  I ll give you   two sheets more  but let me see how you dispose of them  either written   or blank  Well  thought I  I hope still  Argus  to be too hard for thee    Now Argus  the poets say  had a hundred eyes  and was set to watch with   them all  as she does       She brought me the paper  and said  Now  madam  let me see you write   something  I will  said I  and took the pen and wrote   I wish Mrs    Jewkes would be so good to me  as I would be to her  if I had it in my   power    That s pretty now  said she  well  I hope I am  but what then     Why then  wrote I  she would do me the favour to let me know  what I   have done to be made her prisoner  and what she thinks is to become   of me   Well  and what then  said she   Why then  of consequence     scribbled I   she would let me see her instructions  that I may know   how far to blame  or to acquit her        Thus I fooled on  to shew her my fondness for scribbling  for I had no   expectation of any good from her  that so she might suppose I employed   myself  as I said  to no better purpose at other times  for she will   have it  that I am upon some plot  I am so silent  and love so much to   be by myself   She would have made me write on a little further  No    said I  you have not answered me  Why  said she  what can you doubt    when my master himself assures you of his honour  Ay  said I  but lay   your hand to your heart  Mrs  Jewkes  and tell me  if you yourself   believe him  Yes  said she  to be sure I do  But  said I  what do you   call honour  Why  said she  what does he call honour  think you   Ruin    shame  disgrace  said I  I fear   Pho  pho  said she  if you have any   doubt about it  he can best explain his own meaning   I ll send him word   to come and satisfy you  if you will   Horrid creature  said I  all in a   fright  Can st thou not stab me to the heart  I d rather thou would st    than say such another word   But I hope there is no such thought of his   coming       She had the wickedness to say  No  no  he don t intend to come  as   I know of  But if I was he  I would not be long away  What means the   woman  said I   Mean  said she   turning it off   why I mean  I would   come  if I was he  and put an end to all your fears  by making you as   happy as you wish  It is out of his power  said I  to make me happy    great and rich as he is  but by leaving me innocent  and giving me   liberty to go to my dear father and mother       She went away soon after  and I ended my letter  in hopes to have an   opportunity to lay it in the appointed place  So I went to her  and   said  I suppose  as it is not dark  I may take another turn in the   garden  It is too late  said she  but if you will go  don t stay  and    Nan  see and attend madam  as she called me       So I went towards the pond  the maid following me  and dropt purposely   my hussy  and when I came near the tiles  I said  Mrs  Anne  I have   dropt my hussy  be so kind as to look for it  I had it by the pond   side  She went back to look  and I slipt the note between the tiles    and covered them as quick as I could with the light mould  quite
