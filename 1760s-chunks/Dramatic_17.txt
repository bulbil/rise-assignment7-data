Some people say  those two lines are rather false grammar  and it should be  that Pegasus bore  but I say  whatever bad grammer they may be  they are good rhimes  and as Mr  Skeggs and Mr  Massy both observed  that is the most materialest thing in a song  because there are very few singers now a days  who will let you know whether they sing sense or nonsense  So for that reason I never troubled my head with what I published in that respect     H  H   Page  48  Phoebus and Apollo   Phoebus signifies the sun  according to the dictionary  and Apollo is said to be the God of physic and poetry  So a person said last night  that was the reason why rhime writings were generally called drugs  and also  why a great deal of poetry was used in physical operations     Philadelphia   That word was put in  because the lady was born in the West Indies     STANZA I     She is not—yes  she is compleat   Her alablaster  iv ry teeth so neat   Her eyes like starry suns all hearts illume   And Zephyrus whistling sighs  her lips perfume   Where is her marrow know ye   Her cheeks are cochineel d  her breasts  Are Cupid s kettle drums  and love s birds nests   That Venus builds for Chloe   NOTES to the second Verse   She is not   The word not is a pun upon Corporal Knott s name  Your critics  that know no better  will call out about false spelling  but I never mind that  I can write songs for all them  or that either     Page  49  Alablaster and Ivory   These words are two similes  to describe whitnesses  and clearnesses     Like Starry Suns   Poets may do what they will with nature  make stars suns  and suns stars  because we have the poetica licentious for it     Her Marrow   That is a Yorkshire word  and signifies an equal  or a person upon the same footing as yourself  introducing such obsolete words  gives the poem a true pastoral turn  and as it is intended to be sung in an evening in the music loft  among the lamps and trees  it ought to have some out of town allusions in it     Her Cheeks Cochineel d   One of the best lines  the thought is mine  but it s wrong spelt  it should be scutchineel d  because scutchineel is a better red than vermilion  and takes its name from the herald painters  first using it in painting scutcheons     The simile of scutchineel also signifies  that as those insects are never used but after their death  so her cheeks would not lose her colour until after she is dead     Cupid s Kettle drums   That s a double ontender  and love s birds nests another  and without such things  a song  Page  50  won t fell  I told the author  I would etch him a head piece to this song about the bird s nest  because  what sells so well as smutty pictures now  especially with a dash of politics in them  and politics is easy brought in any how—truly Mr  George said  he would not offend decency  then people are damnably deceived in you  thought I  but  as I told him  why George  says I  is there not a great many tradesmen  freemen of the city of London  men well to pass  and masters of families  who are not ashamed  to have their sash windows filled with bawdy  blackguard prints  and why should you then trouble your head about it  I ll answer  we could get money by it  and as long as a man can but do that  and not go to Newgate  why it does not signify what he does  and as to decency  I despise it  for I have always got a good living  thank God  without it  However  George woud nt consent  so I set him down obstinate     STROPHE encore     Tempests I ll tear up by the root   Earthquakes I ll undermine to boot   With the galaxy of the milky way   Upon Jove s threshold I ll at marbles play   And stake my fair so showy   I ll dare the synagogue of gods   And play or pay  I ll lay the odds   That nothing ne er beats Chloe   Page  51  NOTES to the third Verse   Tear up Tempests by the Root   This is a figure in poety  signifying  that the earth shall pull her hair about her ears  in a passion  Trees are often said to be  in song writing  the locks of hair of the world s head     To BOOT   There s a fine word for a pun  and fine punc have been made about it  and now I don t care who knows it  but I have done
