—it was the concern of the officers appointed by the trading company there settled  and as to the advantages obtained at sea  they naturally resulted from the disposition of cruises  made and regulated by the board of Sey seo gun sealty  with which no minister ever interfered  He might  indeed  have recalled the chiefs and officers whom he found already appointed when he took the reins of administration  and filled their places with others of   55 his own choosing  How far he was qualified to make such a choice  and plan new expeditions  appears from the adventures of the generals he did appoint  Moria tanti  who was deterred from landing by a perspective view of whiskers  Hylib bib  who left his rear in the lurch  and Hob nob  who made such a masterly retreat from the supposed Bonzas of Thin quo —These three were literally commanders of his own creation  employed in executing schemes of his own projecting  and these three were the only generals he made  and the only military plans he projected  if we except the grand scheme of subsidizing Brut an tiffi  and forming an army of one hundred thousand men in Tartary  for the defence of the farm of Yesso —Things being so circumstanced  it may be easily conceived that the Orator could ask nothing which the Mobile would venture to   56 refuse  and indeed he tried his influence to the utmost stretch  he milked the dugs of the monster till the blood came  For the service of the ensuing year  he squeezed from them near twelve millions of obans  amounting to near twenty four millions sterling  about four times as much as had ever been raised by the empire of Japan in any former war  But  by this time  Taycho was become not only a convert to the system of Tartary  which he had formerly persecuted  but also an enthusiast in love and admiration of Brut an tiffi  who had lately sent him his poetical works in a present  This  however  would have been of no use  as he could not read them  had not he discovered they were printed on a very fine  soft  smooth Chinese paper made of silk  which he happily converted to another fundamental purpose  In return for this compliment  the Orator   57 sent him a bullock s horn bound with brass  value fifteen pence  which had long served him as a pitch pipe when he made harangues to the Mobile —it was the same kind of instrument which Horace describes  Tibia vincta orichalco  and pray take notice  Peacock  this was the only present Taycho ever bestowed on any man  woman  or child  through the whole course of his life  I mean out of his own pocket  for he was extremely liberal of the public money  in his subsidies to the Tartar chiefs  and in the prosecution of the war upon that continent  The Orator was a genius self taught without the help of human institution  He affected to undervalue all men of literary talents  and the only book he ever read with any degree of pleasure  was a collection of rhapsodies preached by one Ab ren thi  an obscure fanatic Bonza  a native of the   58 island Xicoco  Certain it is  Nature seemed to have produced him for the sole purpose of fascinating the mob  and endued him with faculties accordingly     Notwithstanding all his efforts in behalf of the Tartarian scheme  the Chinese still lingered on the frontiers of Yesso  The views of the court of Pekin exactly coincided with the interest of Bron xi tic  the mercenary general of Japan  The Chinese  confounded at the unheard of success of the Japonese in Fatsisio and other parts of the globe  and extremely mortified at the destruction of their fleets and the ruin of their commerce  saw no other way of distressing the enemy  but that of prolonging the war on the continent of Tartary  which they could support for little more than their ordinary expence  whereas Japan could not maintain it without contracting yearly immense   59 loads of debt  which must have crushed it at the long run  It was the business of the Chinese  therefore  not to finish the war in Tartary by taking the farm of Yesso  because  in that case  the annual expence of it would have been saved to Japan  but to keep it alive by forced marches  praedatory excursions  and undecisive actions  and this was precisely the interest of general Bron xi tic  who in the continuance of the war enjoyed the continuance of all his emoluments  All that he had to do  then  was to furnish Taycho from time to time with a cask of human blood  for the entertainment of the blatant beast  and to send over a few horse tails  as trophies of pretended victories  to be waved before the monster in its holiday processions  He and the Chinese general seemed to act in concert  They advanced and retreated in their turns betwixt   60 two given lines  and the campaign always ended on the same spot where it began  The only difference between them was in the motives of their conduct  the Chinese commander acted for the benefit of his sovereign  and Bron xi tic acted for his own   The continual danger to which the farm of
