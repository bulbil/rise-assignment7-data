imagination  madam  with numberless prospects of future felicity  and preparing my heart for nothing but happiness and you—When  alas  the golden scene is instantly ravished from my eyes  and the whole void as instantly filled up with disappointment and despair     74When I consider this unaccountable step of Louisa s  I am lost in perplexity and doubt—Mrs  Darnel s letter acquaints us that she went away of her own accord  that she was not carried off by force  but that she absolutely eloped  and the maid even describes the gentleman with whom she went  as a tall handsome man  drest in brown  richly laced with gold  she says also  that he was a very fair man  and wore a bob wig  All this is mighty odd—I have known her from her infancy up  have shared every secret of her heart  and never conceived that she entertained the least affection for any body but Sir Robert Harold—Him it cannot be  as by Mr  Melmoth s account he set out for Holland the moment after the unhappy duel between him and the colonel  and besides  he has a complexion remarkably black  and wears his own hair  When I put all these   75 things together  my dear mama  I am astonished—Louisa would hardly go off with a man for whom she felt no affection  and the whole tenor of her life has been so generously frank  and open  and so repugnant to every thing like hypocrisy or artifice  that I could stake my existence Sir Robert is the only man for whom she cherished a favourable sentiment—Besides  madam  if you were to see the letter which she sent her mother  you would be satisfied  that  notwithstanding her unhappy lapse with that gentleman  she is infinitely above the appearance of dissimulation—Her error is there acknowleged in such forcible terms  and lamented with such a sense of unextenuating penitence  that her faults almost render her amiable  and the only emotions which we feel are those of pity and admiration     76For these reasons  I am positive my amiable friend can be no way depraved in her principles  yet  on the other hand  Mrs  Darnel is a woman of known sobriety and character  is received among people of the first distinction  in consequence of her good behaviour  and she mentions Louisa s elopement with so positive a degree of certainty  that there can be no possibility of disputing the fact—God grant that this contradiction may be happily reconciled  My own soul is not dearer in my estimation than the happiness of Miss Mildmay  and I don t know that I could be able to survive any instance of her premediated unworthiness—Premeditated unworthiness  No  my ever amiable Louisa  you are incapable of a deliberate guilt  and the bare supposition was a blasphemy against the purity of our mutual affection—The heart which can question the virtue of a friend till it   77 argues upon absolute conviction  is a traitor to the cause of amity  the most alarming appearance should never shake the confidence of our friendship  and though  in every thing else  a nice combination of accidents may justify a doubt  yet here we ought never to hesitate upon circumstances  nor to lessen in our regards till conjecture is evidently lost  in certainty   These arguments  my dear mama  I have repeatedly urged in the present state of things to the good Mrs  Mildmay—But she shakes her head when I want her to reduce the precept into practice  and  while the large drops course one another down her venerable cheeks  she tells me the sentiment sounds prettily enough upon the ear  but is little calculated to convince the understanding  I wish  my dear mama  you could come over to us  there never was a    unnumbered  greater necessity for your supporting presence than now—Mrs  Mildmay seems in a very declining way  and her situation alarms me the more strongly  as she does every thing in her power to put on an air of the utmost composure and serenity   As you  my dear mama  are one of those excellent women who bring up a daughter rather in a state of respectful familiarity with you  than endeavour to establish an authority by keeping her in a distant degree of abject subjection—As you are generous enough to receive those instances of confidence as a favour which you can command as a right  and can blend all the tenderness of the parent with all the freedom of the friend  I am enabled to talk to you on a subject which few young women ever care to mention to a mother  though a mother s   79 ear is the properest by much for a business of such importance   You have often  my dear madam  kindly hinted your apprehension  that the merits of colonel Mildmay were making too deep an impression on my heart  and that I should by all means resist every impulse of a tender nature  in his favour  as there was but too much reason to apprehend that the disparity of our fortunes would be a material bar to our union  notwithstanding the harmony subsisting so long between our two families  Your advice  my ever honoured mama  I was convinced was perfectly just  nevertheless—but why should I think of concealing any thing from my best friend—from the only person in the world
