of war  Of the allies about five thousand men were killed  and eight thousand wounded or taken   The loss of the battle is imputed to two capital errors committed by Marshal Tallard  first weakening the center by detaching such a number of troops to the village of Blenheim  and then suffering the confederates to pass the rivulet  and form unmolested  The next day  when the Duke of Marlborough visited his prisoner  the Marshal paid him the compliment of having overcome the best troops in the world    I hope  Sir  replied the Duke  you will except those by whom they were conquered      A country of an hundred leagues extent fell  by this defeat  into the hands of the victor   Having thus succeeded beyond his hopes  the Duke once more returned to England  where he found the people in a transport of joy  he was welcomed as an   96 hero  who had retrieved the glory of the nation  and the Queen  the parliament  and the people were ready to second him in all his designs  The manor of Woodstock was conferred upon him for his services  and the Lord keeper  in the name of the Peers  honoured him with that praise he so well deserved   The success of the last campaign induced the English to increase their supplies for the next  and the Duke had fixed upon the Moselle for the scene of action  but being disappointed by Prince Lewis  who promised his assistance  he returned to the Netherlands to oppose Villeroy  who  in his absence  undertook the siege of Liege  Villeroy  having received advice of the Duke s approach  abandoned his enterprize  and retreated within his lines  Marlborough was resolved to force them  He led his troops to the charge  after a warm but short engagement the enemy s horse were defeated with great slaughter  The infantry  being abandoned  retreated in great disorder to an advantageous post  where they again drew up in order of battle  Had the Duke been permitted to take advantage of their consternation  as he proposed  it is possible he might have gained a complete victory  but he was opposed by the Dutch officers  who represented it in such a light to the Deputies of the States  that they refused to consent to its execution  This timidity was highly resented in England  and laid the first foundation of suspecting the Dutch fidelity  they were secretly accused of a desire to protract the war  by which they alone of all the powers of Europe were gainers   While the arms of England were crowned with success in the Netherlands  they were not less fortunate in Spain  where efforts were made to fix Charles  Duke of Austria  upon the throne  The greatest part of that kingdom had declared in favour of Philip IV  grandson to Lewis XIV  who had   97 been nominated successor by the late King of Spain s will  We have already seen  that  by a former treaty among the powers of Europe  Charles of Austria was appointed heir to that crown  and this treaty had been guarantied by France herself  who now intended to reverse it in favour of a descendant of the house of Bourbon  Charles  therefore entered Spain  assisted by the arms of England  and invited by the Catalonians  who had declared in his favour  He was furnished with two hundred transports  thirty ships of war  nine thousand men  and the Earl of Peterborough  a man of even romantic bravery  was placed at their head   One of the first exploits of these forces was to take Gibraltar  which had hitherto been deemed impregnable  A ledge of lofty rocks defended it almost on every side by land  and an open and stormy bay took away all security for shipping by sea  A few troops were therefore capable of defending it against the most numerous armies  The security of the garrison proved their ruin  A detachment of eighteen hundred marines were landed upon that neck of level ground which joins it to the continent  These were incapable of attempting any thing effectual  and even destitute of hopes of succeeding  A body of sailors  in boats  were ordered to attack an half ruined mole  they took possession of the platform  unterrified by a mine that blew up an hundred men in the air  with the utmost intrepidity they kept their ground  and  being soon joined by other seamen  took a redoubt  between the mole and the town  by storm  The governor was now obliged to capitulate  and the Prince of Hesse entered the town  amazed at the success of so desperate an enterprize  This was a glorious and an useful acquisition to the British dominions  their trade to the Mediterranean was thus secured  and they had here a repository capable of containing all   98 things necessary for the repairing of fleets  or the equipment of armies   Soon after the taking this important garrison  the English fleet  now mistress of the seas  attacked the French Admiral  who commanded fifty two ships of war  After an obstinate contest the English became victorious  the French fleet sailed away  nor could it be brought again to the engagement  though the losses on either side were equal  This may
