man groping his way out  whereupon  I retir d to one side to let him pass  and saw him go down stairs as expeditiously as he could —It was an easy matter to divine that this   163 was the captain  who having over slept himself  had got up at last to keep his assignation  and finding my door open  had enter d into my apartment instead of that of his mistress  where I supplied his place —But finding his mistake  by falling over my chair  was afraid the noise might alarm the family  and for that reason made off  delaying the gratification of his desire till another opportunity —By this time  I was satisfied  and instead of returning to the place from whence I came  retreated to my own castle  which I fortified by bolting the door  and in the congratulation of my own happiness fell asleep —But the truth of this adventure could not be long conceal d from my young mistress  who next day came to an eclaircisement with the captain  upon his lamenting his last night s disappointment  and begging pardon for the noise he had made —Their mutual chagrin  when they came to the knowledge of what had happen d  may be easily conjectur d  though each had a peculiar grief unfelt by the other  for she was conscious of having not only betray d to me the secrets of her commerce with him  but also  of having incensed me by the freedoms she had taken with my name  beyond a hope of reconciliation —On the other hand  his jealousy suggested  that her sorrow was all artifice  and that I had supplied his place with her own privity and consent —That such was the situation of their thoughts  will appear in the sequel—for that very day she came into the shop where I was alone  and fixing her eyes  swimming in tears  upon me  sigh d most piteously  But I was proof against her distress  by recollecting the epithets with which she had honour d me the night before  and believing that the good reception I enjoy d   164 was destin d for another  I therefore took no notice of her affliction  and she had the mortification to find her disdain return d four fold —However  from thenceforward she thought proper to use me with more complaisance than usual  knowing that it was in my power at any time to publish her shame —By these means my life became much more agreeable  though I never could prevail upon myself to repeat my nocturnal visit  and as I every day improv d in my knowledge of the town  I shook off my aukward air by degrees  and acquir d the character of a polite journeyman apothecary     CHAP  XX   I am assaulted and dangerously wounded—I suspect Odonnell  and am confirmed in my opinion—I concert a scheme of revenge  and put it in execution—Odonnell robs his own servant  and dissappears—I make my addresses to a lady  and am miraculously deliver d from her snare   ONE night about twelve a clock  as I return d from visiting a patient at Chelsea  I receiv d a blow on my head from an unseen hand  that stretch d me senseless on the ground  and was left for dead  with three stabs of a sword in my body —The groans I utter d when I recover d the use of my reason  alarm d the people of a solitary ale house  that stood near the spot where I lay  and they were humane enough to take me   165 in  and send for a surgeon who dressed my wounds  and assur d me they were not mortal  One of them penetrated through the skin and muscles of one side of my belly  in such a manner  that  doubtless  the assassin imagin d he had run me through the entrails —The second slanted along one of my ribs  and the last  which was intended for the Coup de Grace  being directed to my heart  the sword snapt upon my breast bone  and the point remain d sticking in the skin —When I reflected upon this event  I could not persuade myself  that I had been assaulted by a common footpad  because it is not usual for such people to murder those they rob  especially when they meet with no resistance  and I found my money and every thing else about me  but my carcase  safe  I concluded therefore  that I must either have been mistaken for another  or oblig d to the private resentment of some secret enemy for what had happened  and as I could remember no body who had the least cause of complaint against me  except captain Odonnell and my master s daughter  my suspicion settled upon them  though I took care to conceal it  that I might the sooner arrive at confirmation —With this view  I went home in a chair about ten a clock in the morning  and as the chairmen supported me into the house  met the captain in the passage  who no sooner saw me  than he started back  and gave evident signs of guilty confusion  which he would have accounted for from the surprize occasion d by seeing me in such a condition —My master having heard my story  condoled me with a good deal of sympathy  and when he understood
