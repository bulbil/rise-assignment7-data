of commerce or concern with booksellers or printers for   at least a century to come   but  fearing to be suspected as a party   concerned  I affected an air as easy as possible  and  observing some   females who were busy in stitching pamphlets  I asked him if they   contained any thing new or entertaining      Sir  said Wellcot  this is an elaborate performance of the most   eminent of our patriot writers   I pay him  at the lowest  five   guineas weekly   and could any man write with double his spirit   and genius  I could better afford to give that author a hundred    for good writings are like diamonds  that are valued according to   their carats   do but double their weight  and they immediately   become of twenty times the estimation      This pamphlet consisted of a sheet  sewed in blue paper  I   instantly paid my twopence  and sat down to peruse it  I found   that it contained several very free remonstrances against his   majesty and the ministers for joining with France in the war   against Holland in opposition to the civil and religious interests of   England  together with a few collateral digressions in assertion   of Magna Charta  of the freedom of man in general  and of Britons   hi particular  I perceived that it was written with much more   judgment than genius  And what  said I to Wellcot  will you give   to that man who shall  confessedly  excel this your most eminent of   patriot writers upon his own subject  and in his own way  Give    sir   cried the bookseller   many thanks  and a proportionable in    crease of the profits  Enough  sir  I answered   you shall soon   hear from me again I wish you a good morrow      On my return I called at Mr  Goodville s  but he had sailed for   France about a fortnight before  I then went about to a number   of pamphlet shops  and bought up all the political papers that had   any reference to the matter in hand      I sat down to my work like a hungry man to his victuals  and   I grudged my heart those short indulgences which it enjoyed in   the society of  the two objects of its fondest affections      Having finished my first paper in about a fortnight  I entitled   it the Weekly Monitor  and took it directly to Wellcot s  Here    sir  said I  is my friend s first venture  But has your friend  de          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  81     manded  Wellcot in a discouraging accent  sent the usual indemnity   for the first impression of a young author  That shall not be   wanting  I answered  if you require it  Mr  Wellcot  Why  said   he  I do not take upon me to be a judge in these matters   and   yet custom has given me a shrewd sort of a guess  Come  sir  I   have a few minutes to throw away  and they are at your service      He then sat down  and having read about a dozen lines Ay  ay    said he  they don t always do thus at Newmarket  your friend  I   find  has set out at the top of his speed      Going on something further  he cried Well supported  by Ju    piter   And then  proceeding to the third page This  says he  must   have been stolen from one of the ancients  because there is no   modern who could write like it  Well  sir  you need not give   yourself further trouble for the present   I will print this first   paper at my own suit  Desire your friend to be careful about the   second  Call on me in a week  and I think I shall be able to tell   you something that will please you      How diligent is expectation how elevated is hope   I returned   with the feathers of Mercury at my heels  I set about my second   paper with double genius and application  My ideas were more   expanded my spirits more sublimed  All the persuasives of   Cicero   all the thunder of Demosthenes   all that I had read on   the topic of liberty  in popular governments or commonwealths    occurred to my remembrance      I finished my second essay within the week  I went with it to   Wellcot  and he presented me at sight with twenty guineas  It   is more  said he  than hitherto comes to your share   but I love   to encourage  and I trust
