wretched are those who are like me  denied even the last resource of misery  their tears  Adieu   LETTER XXXVI  From the same   I Begin to have doubts whether wisdom be alone sufficient to make us happy  Whether every step we make in refinement is not an inlet into new disquietudes  A mind too vigorous and active  serves only to consume the body to which it is joined  as the richest jewels are soonest found to wear their settings   When we rise in knowledge as the prospect widens  the objects of our regard become more obscure  and the unlettered peasant  whose views are only directed to the narrow sphere around him  beholds nature with a finer relish  and tastes her blessings with a keener appetite than   153 the philosopher  whose mind attempts to grasp an universal system   As I was some days ago pursuing this subject among a circle of my fellow slaves  an ancient Guebre of the number  equally remarkable for his piety and wisdom  seemed touched with my conversation  and desired to illustrate what I had been saying with an allegory taken from the Zendavesta of Zoroaster  by this we shall be taught  says he  that they who travel in pursuit of wisdom  walk only in a circle  and after all their labour  at last return to their pristine ignorance  and in this also we shall see that enthusiastic confidence  or unsatisfying doubts terminate all our enquiries   In early times  before myriads of nations covered the earth  the whole human race lived together in one valley  The simple inhabitants  surrounded on every side by lofty mountains  knew no other world but the little spot to which they were confined  They fancied the heavens bent down to meet the mountain tops  and formed an impenetrable wall to surround them  None had ever yet ventured to climb the steepy cliff  in order to explore those regions that lay beyond it  they knew the nature of the skies only from a tradition  which mentioned their being made of adamant  traditions make up the reasonings of the simple  and serve to silence every enquiry   In this sequestered vale  bless d with all the spontaneous productions of nature  the honey d blossom  the refreshing breeze  the gliding brook  and golden fruitage  the simple inhabitants seemed happy in themselves  in each other  they desired   154 no greater pleasures  for they knew of none greater  ambition  pride and envy  were vices unknown among them  and from this peculiar simplicity of its possessors  the country was called the valley of ignorance   At length  however  an unhappy youth more aspiring than the rest undertook to climb the mountain s side  and examine the summits which were hitherto deemed inaccessible  The inhabitants from below  gazed with wonder at his intrepidity  some applauded his courage  others censured his folly  still however he proceeded towards the place where the earth and heavens seemed to unite  and at length arrived at the wish d for height with extreme labour and assiduity   His first surprize was to find the skies  not as he expected within his reach  but still as far off as before  his amazement encreased when he saw a wide extended region lying on the opposite side of the mountain  but it rose to astonishment when he beheld a country at a distance more beautiful and alluring than even that he had just left behind   As he continued to gaze with wonder  a genius  with a look of infinite modesty  approaching  offered to be his guide and instructor  The distant country which you so much admire  says the Angelic being  is called the Land of Certainty  in that charming retreat  sentiment contributes to refine every sensual banquet  the inhabitants are blessed with every solid enjoyment  and still more blessed in a perfect consciousness of their own felicity  ignorance in that country is wholly unknown    155 all there is satisfaction without allay  for every pleasure first undergoes the examination of reason  As for me I am called the genius of Demonstration  and am stationed here in order to conduct every adventurer to that land of happiness thro  those intervening regions you see over hung with fogs and darkness  and horrid with forests  cataracts  caverns  and various other shapes of danger  But follow me  and in time I may lead you to that distant desirable land of tranquillity   The intrepid traveller immediately put himself under the direction of the genius  and both journeying on together with a slow but agreeable pace  deceived the tediousness of the way by conversation  The beginning of the journey seemed to promise true satisfaction  but as they proceeded forward  the skies became more gloomy and the way more intricate  they often inadvertently approached the brow of some frightful precipice  or the brink of a torrent  and were obliged to measure back their former way  the gloom encreasing as they proceeded  their pace became more slow  they paused at every step  frequently stumbled  and their distrust and timidity encreased  The genius of Demonstration  now  therefore advised his pupil to grope upon hands and feet  as a method though more slow  yet less liable to error   In this manner they attempted to pursue their journey for some time
