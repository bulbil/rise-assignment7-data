thoughts of appearing any more on the stage  for which she still entertained a very great inclination  though four years were now elapsed since she had quitted the theatre  He hired a very fine house for her in Greek Street  near Soho Square  and furnished it in the most magnificent manner  and made a settlement on her of fifteen hundred pounds per annum  and  in short  treated her with so much affection  that she   95 had reason to congratulate herself on the unexpected happiness she now enjoyed   Our heroine exerted all her powers to please and amuse her lover  They passed their time in the enjoyment of the most rational amusements  and she was careful to employ every art she was mistress of to increase his love for her  She read to him the beauties of the English classics  and particularly Milton  so emphatically as gave him the highest satisfaction  She pointed out the most striking passages with so much nicety of judgment  as raised his wonder  that a woman should be able to discover these beauties which had eluded the most diligent researches of the ablest writers  she engaged in his hunting parties  and entered into the spirit of all the amusements her swain admired  and which he was pleased to find his mistress approved  Nay  so great was her skill in horsemanship  that one who had more wit than good nature observed  that    she leaped over the five barred gates with as little ceremony as she had formely vaulted over the mounds of virtue and discretion       96Miss ELLIOT s lover grew so fond of her as not to be able to refuse her any thing that she asked of him  while he was lost in the sweet elysium of bliss  and she did not forget to avail herself of the facility of his temper  by amassing such amazing quantities of rich clothes and trinkets  as were altogether astonishing  Thus she lived in one continued round of pleasure  without once desiring to wake from the golden dream   She had lived in this agreeable manner about a year and a half  when her happiness was interrupted by her lover s being obliged to quit her soft embraces for a time  and go on an expedition to the Mediterranean  for which a fleet was sitting out  to sail in a short time  This reverse of fortune she used her utmost endeavours to bear with all the philosophy she was mistress of  She resolved to try the force of his affection for her  by drawing him in to make her some present  which should amply make up for the loss she should sustain by his absence  and which also would be a sort of provision   97 for her in case he either never returned  or  being tired of her  should fix his heart on some other lady  In order to effect her scheme  one evening  when he was merrier than usual  she proposed to him that he should subscribe his name to a paper she had prepared  intitling her to an annuity of a thousand pounds in case any accident should befall him  She did not however succeed in this attempt  He treated the paper with the contempt it merited  and told his mistress  she must devise some other method to excite his generosity  than that of making her own terms  when she ought to leave that entirely to him  He said he had already determined on the sum he intended to give  and ordered her never more to urge him on that head   He then presented her with three bank notes of a thousand pounds each  promising her  at the same time  that if she continued faithful to him during his absence  he would  at his return  reward her constancy in a manner far beyond her expectation  He farther assured her  that nothing should ever make him forget her    98 and that while they both lived  he was firmly resolved not to take any other woman to his arms as long as her behaviour continued to be such as it ought to be   Our heroine  who perceived the wrong step she had taken  and which  if the D— had not been so passionately fond of her  might have proved fatal  excused herself in the best manner she could  and he re assumed his former good humour  From this time  till he embarked on ship board  he was very seldom absent  At length  the hour of his departure arrived  and he left his dear mistress  who pretended to be inconsolable on account of their separation   I shall only mention one or two of her intrigues while the D— was absent  because  although she received visits from several others  yet none of her adventures with them are so interesting as to deserve a place in this history   The first gentleman who had any connections with her after the D— left England  was a captain of a man of war   99 named R—n  Although he expressed great fondness for her  yet he was very far from exciting her affection in so high a degree  as her last lover  He was a man  who  when his passion was once gratified  sensibly grew cooler in his love  and he became at last so indifferent  and visited her so seldom
