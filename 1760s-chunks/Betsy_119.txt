 down stairs  On stepping into the coach  Miss Betsy directed the man   where to drive  but the gentleman  unheard by her  ordered him to go to   the bagnio in Orange Street  They were no sooner seated  and the windows   drawn up to keep out the cold  than Miss Betsy was alarmed with a   treatment which her want of consideration made her little expect  Since   the gentleman commoner  no man had ever attempted to take the liberties   which her present companion now did  she struggled  she repelled with   all her might  the insolent pressures of his lips and hands   Is this     cried she   the honour I was to depend upon  Is it thus you prove   yourself incapable of an ungenerous action     Accuse me not   said he     till you have reason  I have been bit once  and have made a vow never   to settle upon any woman while I live again  but you shall fare never   the worse for that  I will make you a handsome present before we part    and  if you can be constant  will allow you six guineas a week        She was so confounded at the first mention of this impudent proposal    that she had not the power of interrupting him  but  recovering herself   as well as she was able   Heavens   cried she   what means all this    What do you take me for     Take you for   answered he  laughing     pr ythee  dear girl  no more of these airs  I take you for a pretty   kind  obliging creature  and such I hope to find you  as soon as we come   into a proper place  In the mean time   continued he  stopping her mouth   with kisses   none of this affected coyness        The fright she was in  aided by disdain and rage  now inspired her with   an unusual strength  she broke from him  thrust down the window  and   with one breath called him  Monster  Villain   with the next screamed   out to the coachman to stop  and  finding he regarded not her cries    would have thrown herself out  if not forcibly witheld by the   gentleman  who began now to be a little startled at her resolute   behaviour   What is all this for   said he   would you break your neck    or venture being crushed to pieces by the wheels     Any thing   cried   she  bursting into tears   I will venture  suffer any thing  rather than   be subjected to insults  such as you have dared to treat me with        Though the person by whom Miss Betsy was thus dangerously attacked was a   libertine  or  according to the more genteel and modish phrase  a man of   pleasure  yet he wanted neither honour  nor good sense  he had looked on   Miss Betsy as a woman of the town  by seeing her with one who was so    and her too great freedom in conversation gave him no cause to alter his   opinion  but the manner in which she had endeavoured to rebuff his more   near approaches  greatly staggered him  He knew not what to think  but   remained in silent cogitation for some minutes  and  though he held her   fast clasped round the waist  it was only to prevent her from attempting   the violence she had threatened  not to offer any towards her   Is it   possible   said he  after this pause   that you are virtuous     I call   Heaven to witness   answered she  with a voice faltering through the   excess of terror and indignation   that I never have entertained one   thought that was not strictly so  that I detest and scorn those wretched   creatures of the number of whom you imagine me to be one  and that I   would sooner die the worst of deaths  than live with infamy  Yes  Sir    be assured   continued she  gathering more courage   that whatever   appearances may be this fatal night against me  I am of a family of some   consideration in the world  and am blessed with a fortune  which sets me   above the low temptations of designing men        As she had ended these words  they came to the bagnio  and  the coach   immediately stopping  two or three waiters came running to open the   door  on which Miss Betsy  more terrified than ever  shrieked in a most   piteous manner   O God   cried she   What s here  Where am I  What will   become
