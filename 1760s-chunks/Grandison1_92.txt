great God of Heaven  it shall   I wept  I could not then speak   Can t you go into fits again  Can t you  said the barbarian  with an air of a piece with his words  and using other words of the lowest reproach   God deliver me  prayed I to myself  from the hands of this madman   I arose  and as the candle stood near the glass▪ I saw in it my vile figure  in this abominable habit    226 to which  till then  I had paid little attention  O how I scorned myself   Pray  Sir Hargrave  said I  let me beg that you will not terrify me further  I will forgive you for all you have hitherto done  and place it to my own account  as a proper punishment for consenting to be thus marked for a vain and foolish creature  Your abuse  Sir  give me leave to say  is low and unmanly  But in the light of a punishment I will own it to be all deserved  And let here my punishment end  and I will thank you and forgive you with my whole heart   Your fate is determined  Miss Byron   Just then came in a servant maid with a capuchin  who whispered something to him  To which he answered  That s well—  He took the capuchin  the maid withdrew  and approached me with it  I started  trembled  and was ready to saint  I caught hold of the back of the elbow chair   Your fate is determined  madam  repeated the savage—Here  put this on—Now sall into fits again—Put this on   Pray  Sir Hargrave—  And pray  Miss Byron  What has not been completed here  shall be completed in a safer place  and that in my own way—Put this on  I tell you  Your compliance may yet befriend you   Where are the gentlewomen —Where are—  Gene to rest  madam —John  Frank  called he out   In came two men servants   Pray  Sir Hargrave—Lord protect me—Pray  Sir Hargrave—Where are the gentlewomen —Lord protect me   Then running to the door  against which one of the men stood—Man  stand out of the way  said I  But he did not  He only bowed   I cried out Mrs —I forget your name  Miss—   227 And t other Miss—I forget your names—If you a e good creatures  as I hoped you were—  I called as loud as my fears would let me   At last came in the elder sister—O madam  good young gentlewoman  I am glad you are come  said I   And so am I  said the wicked man —Pray  Miss Sally  put on this Lady s capuchin   Lord bless me  for why  for what  I have no capuchin   I would not permit her to put it on  as she would have done   The savage then wrapt his arms about mine  and made me so very sensible by his force  of the pain I had had by the squeeze of the door  that I could not help crying out  The young woman put on the capuchin whether I would or not   Now  Miss Byron  said he  make yourself easy▪ or command a fit  it is all one  My end will be better served by the latter—Miss Sally  give orders   She ran out with the candle  Frank  give me the cloak  said Sir Hargrave   The fellow had a red cloak on his arm  His barbarous master took it from him  To your posts  said he   The two men withdrew in haste  Now  my dearest life  said he  with an air of insult  as I thought  you command your fate  if you are easy   He threw the cloak about me   I begged  prayed  would have kneeled to him  But all was in vain  The tyger hearted man  as Mr  Greville had truly called him  muffled me up in it  and by force carried me thro  a long entry to the foredoor  There was ready a chariot and six  and that Sally was at the door with a lighted candle   I called out to her  I called out for her mother  for the other sister  I besought him to let me say but six words to the widow     228 But no widow was to appear  no younger sister  She was perhaps more tender hearted than the elder  And in spite of all my struggles  prayers  resistance  he lifted me into the chariot   Men on horseback were about it  I thought that Wilson was one of them  and so it proved  Sir Hargrave said to that fellow  You know what tale to tell  if you meet with impertinents  And in  he came himself   I scream d  Scream on  my dear  upbraidingly said he  and barbarously mocked me  imitating  low wretch  the bleating of a sheep  Could you not have killed him for this  my Lucy   Then rearing himself up  Now am I Lord of Miss Byron
