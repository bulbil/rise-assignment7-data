and just    Then drop a tear upon his dust      Of the two best portraits of Brooke one is repro    duced here  a small monochrome water colour bearing   the inscription    From a picture in possession of W    Walker  8 Gray s Inn Square  Engraved and published    1821  Engraving  first edition  Fool of Quality   Henry   Brooke  after Brooke by Thurston   This was chosen by   Charlotte Brooke as the portrait to illustrate her father s   works  which would probably mean it was the better of   the two best known portraits  An engraving of it was   published in London by E    S  Harding  on July 16    1793   From the original picture in the collection of   Mr  Harding  Pall Mall  Brooke pinxt   Clamp sculpt     The other portrait alluded to is the large oil painting   called The Farmer  now in Mr  Henry Brooke s posses    sion  It was painted by T  Lewis  a London painter    and scene decorator to Thomas Sheridan  who  on a visit   to Dr  Thomas Sheridan at Quilca  painted Sheridan s     Painted Parlour   This large oil painting was engraved in   Ireland by Andrew Miller  in 1756  with the title of   The Farmer  and was reproduced again in J  C  Smith s   British Mezzotint Engravers  1884  The Dublin Univer    sity Magazine for 1852 has a delicate etching  full length    from this painting  and Kingsley s edition of The Fool of   Quality  1859  has a half length engraving  by J   C    Armytage  from the same portrait  An admirable word    portrait of Brooke is preserved in Brookiana  It is   contained in a letter describing a visit to Longfield    To   tell you the truth  I was charmed with the manner in which   he received me  I was scarce half an hour in conversation   with him  when I found I could trace him in all his   writings  He was dressed in a long blue cloak  with a wig   that fell down his shoulders  a little man  as neat as wax    work  with an oval face  ruddy complexion  and large eyes    full of fire  In short  he is like a picture mellowed by time    Mrs  Brooke is in a very ill state of health   she is quite   emaciated  and so feeble that she can scarcely walk across   the room  I never saw so affectionate a husband  and so   tender a father  in my life  Out of two and twenty children   there are only two alive  a son and a daughter  Arthur and   Charlotte  I did not see the son   the daughter inherits a         INTRODUCTION xxv     considerable portion of the countenance of her father   but   she is as pale as a primrose  and almost as thin as her   mother  Our conversation at dinner turned chiefly on the   customs and manners of the inhabitants in the neighbour    hood  You would really think that Mr  Brooke was talking   of his own children  they were all so dear to him   he prayed   for them and blessed them over and over again  with tears   in his eyes      In the evening we walked into the garden     his favourite flowers were those that were planted by the   hands of his wife and daughter  I was astonished at his   skill in botany   he dwelt for some moments on the virtues   of the meanest weeds  and then launched out into such a   panegyric on vegetable diet  that he almost made me a   Pythagorean       Of his twenty two children only two survived him   Arthur  a brave soldier  who served in Canada  and after    wards in India  where he died  after attaining the rank of   captain  and Charlotte  the Irish scholar  She was an   early pioneer of the Celtic movement  anticipating the   labours of Lady Gregory and Miss Hull by a hundred   years  though her work has not had the permanence that   may be anticipated for theirs  She made the mistake of   translating the old Irish legends into verse  a form for   which they are naturally unfitted  But she has the credit   of being a pioneer  and of calling attention to this mass of   forgotten literature  though her appeal fell for the time being   upon deaf ears  Kingsley gives some account of Brooke s   relatives  A cousin and namesake  Henry Brooke  was   high in the H E I
