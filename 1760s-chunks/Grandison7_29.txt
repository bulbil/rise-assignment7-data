sullen BUT  O Lucy  thought I  you are a woman  my dear   As to what you write  said she  of his desire of being related to you  who would not —If that be not his principal motive—Very well  Lucy  thought I   I know  said she  that my grandmamma Selby has often wished Mr  Greville would make his addresses to her grand daughter —So  So  So  Lucy  thought I   His Libertinism indeed is an objection—But I have not heard lately of any enormities—  Go on  Lucy  thought I  Hitherto appears not any reason for Mr  Greville to despair   He may have seen his folly   No doubt but he has  thought I  He saw it all the time he was committing it  But  perhaps  he is the more determined bad man for that  Is not purity of heart  thought I  as well as of manners  an eligible thing   If a woman is not to marry till she meet with a strictly virtuous man—    73 You have too often pleaded that argument  Lucy  to me—I am sorry—I stopt  willing to hear her quite out  for she held before her what I had written   How came he  you ask  said she  by his new lights  I have nothing to do with how he came by them  I should rather indeed he had them from proper convictions—But if he has them  that s enough   Is it  my dear  let him have been what he will   I am for judging charitably—  Charming  thought I—judging charitably  So I have lost a virtue  and you  Lucy  have found it▪  Mr  Greville is nothing to me  Nor ever will be   Not quite so sure of that  thought I to myself   You say  Harriet  you have no notion of a good young woman  trusting her principles to the arbitrary will of a man who has been a free Liver—Must the man be arbitrary —Were a husband a free Liver  must a wife s own principles be endangered   These questions from my Lucy  thought I   A scoffer  you say  Harriet —The man s a fool for that —But what a poor soul must she be that could not silence a scoffer   Silence a scoffer  Ah Lucy  said I  And would you marry a man with a hope to be able to silence him  Mr  Greville is a conceited man  My Lucy has six times his sense  but he will not be convinced of that  You will have the less influence upon him  if he is jealous of the superiority of your understanding  Mr  Greville is obstinate as well as conceited  Few men  I believe  will own conviction from a wife s arguments   To be sure the man is not a Sir Charles Grandison  Who is —Let him  as my aunt Selby says  apply to me  I shall give him his answer   You would wish he should  Lucy   I don t say so   I fancy  Lucy  you would not be very cruel if he did   You fancy I would not—But I can  as you always   74 did  treat the man who professes to love me  with civility  yet not throw myself into his arms at the first word—  First word  Lucy  No  The second  or third  or fourth  is time enough  so the man is not mean time rendered quite hopeless   Very well  Lady Grandison  But let me go on with what you have written—Good natured man —I do think he is not an ill natured man   So much the better for himself  and his future wife  Lucy   That will not be I  Lady Grandison   Perhaps not  Lucy   —Humour  I do think he is a humorous good natured man  A little too vehement perhaps in his mirth  a little too frolic  But who is faultless   Proceed  my Lucy   —Generous    Not a generous man — Qualities that look like generous ones    —You are a nice distinguisher  Harriet  you always were—But here you tell your grandmamma  that you had rather I should have Mr  Fowler than Mr  Greville—    Well  my dear  and what say you to that   Why  I say  I think you are not so nice for me  in this case  as you are in others   How so   How so  Why is there not a difference between the actual proposals made by Mr  Greville to Mrs  Shirley  and Sir Rowland s undertaking to try to prevail upon Mr  Fowler to make his addresses to me   Granted  my dear —I have not a word more to say in behalf of Mr  Fowler  Mr  Greville  Lucy—  Is a man I never will have—  No rash resolutions  my dear  And yet I believe a woman has seen the same man in a very different light  when he has offered himself to her acceptance  from what she did before     75 I believe
