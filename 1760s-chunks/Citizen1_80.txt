 seemed to diffuse new chearfulness upon every face  so that I now expected the philosophical conversation to begin  as they improved in good humour  The principal priest  however  opened his mouth  with only observing  that the venison had not been kept enough  though   252 he had given strict orders for having it killed ten days before  I fear  continued he  it will be found to want the true heathy flavour  you will find no hing of the original wildness in it  A priest  who sate next him  having smelt it and wiped his nose   Ah  my good lord  cries he  you are too modest  it is perfectly fine  every body knows that no body understands keeping venison with your Lordship    Ay  and partridges too  interrupted another  I never find them right any where else   His Lordship was going to reply  when a third took off the attention of the company  by recommending the pig as inimitable   I fancy  my Lord  continues he  it has been smothered in its own blood    If it has been smothered in its blood  cried a facetious member  helping himself  we ll now smother it in egg sauce   This poignant piece of humour produced a long loud laugh  which the facetious brother observing  and now that he was in luck  willing to second his blow  assured the company he would tell them a good story about that   As good a story  cries he  bursting into a violent fit of laughter himself  as ever you heard in your lives  there was a farmer of my parish  who used to sup upon wild ducks and flummery  so this farmer—Doctor Marrowfat  cries his Lordship  interrupting him  give me leave to drink your health—so being fond of wild ducks and flummery —Doctor  adds a gentleman who sate next him  let me advise you to a wing of this turkey —so this farmer being fond—Hob nob  Doctor  which do you chuse  white or red —So being fond of wild ducks and flummery —take care of your band  Sir  it may dip in the grov• The Doctor  now looking round  found not a single eye disposed to listen  wherefore   253 calling for a glass of wine  he gulped down the disappointment and the tale in a bumper   The conversation now began to be little more than a rhapsody of exclamations  as each had pretty well satisfied his own appetite  he now found sufficient time to press others  Excellent  the very thing  let me recommend the pig  do but taste the bacon  never eat a better thing in my life  exquisite  delicious  This edifying discourse continued thro  three courses  which lasted as many hours  till every one of the company were unable to swallow or utter any thing more   It is very natural for men who are abridged in one excess  to break into some other  The clergy here  particularly those who are advanced in years  think if they are abstemious with regard to women and wine  they may indulge their other appetites without censure  Thus some are found to rise in the morning only to a consultation with their cook about dinner  and when that has been swallowed  make no other use of their faculties  if they have any  but to ruminate on the succeeding meal   A debauch in wine is even more pardonable than this  since one glass insensibly leads on to another  and instead of sateing whets the appetite  The progressive steps to it are chearful and seducing  the grave are animated  the melancholy relieved  and there is even classic authority to countenance the excess  But in eating after nature is once satisfied every additional morsel brings stupidity and distempers with it  and as one of their own poets expresses it      254  The soul subsides  and wickedly inclines   To seem but mortal  even in sound divines     Let me suppose  after such a meal as this I have been describing  while all the company are fitting in lethargic silence round the table  grunting under a load of soup  pig  pork  and bacon  let me suppose  I say  some hungry beggar  with looks of want  peeping through one of the windows  and thus addressing the assembly  Prithee  pluck those napkins from your chins  after nature is satisfied all that you eat extraordinary is my property  and I claim it as mine  It was given you in order to relieve me  and not to oppress your selves  How can they comfort or instruct others who can scarce feel their own existence  except from the unsavoury returns of an ill digested meal  But though neither you nor the cushions you sit upon will hear me  yet the world regards the excesses of its teachers with a prying eye  and notes their conduct with double severity  I know no other answer any one of the company could make to such an expostulation  but this     Friend  you talk of our losing a character  and being disliked by the world  well  and supposing all this to be true  what then  who cares for the world  We ll
