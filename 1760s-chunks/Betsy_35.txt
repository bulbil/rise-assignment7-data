 The receipt of this letter gave an infinity of contentment to Miss   Betsy  she had made the offer of going to take her leave of him  chiefly   with the view of keeping him from suspecting she wanted natural   affection  and was no less pleased with his refusing the request she   made him on that account  than she was with his so readily agreeing to   her returning to London  Miss Flora was equally delighted  they sent   their footman that instant to take places in the stagecoach  and early   the next morning set out from a place  which  on their entering into it    they did not imagine they should quit either so soon  or with so little   regret                CHAPTER XI       Lays a foundation for many events to be produced by time  and waited   for with patience          Miss Betsy and Miss Flora  on their coming home  were in some perplexity   how to relate the story of their Oxford adventure to Lady Mellasin and   Mr  Goodman  and it is very likely they would have thought it proper to   have kept it a secret  if the unlucky duel between Mr  Francis and the   gentleman commoner  which they were sensible would be a known thing  had   not rendered the concealment of the whole utterly impracticable       As there was no remedy  Miss Flora took it upon her to lay open the   matter to her mamma  which she did with so much artifice  that if that   lady had been as austere  as she was really the reverse  she could not   have found much to condemn  either in the conduct of her daughter or   Miss Betsy  as to Mr  Goodman  he left the whole management of the young   ladies  in these particulars  entirely to his wife  so said little to   them on the score of the adventure  but was extremely concerned for the   part Mr  Francis had in it  as he supposed it was chiefly owing to that   unlucky incident  that he had taken a resolution to leave the college    and he very well knew  that a certain nobleman  who was a distant   relation of his family  and godfather to Mr  Francis  had always   promised to bestow a large benefice in his gift upon him  as soon as he   should have compleated his studies       This honest guardian thought he should be wanting in the duty of the   trust reposed in him  to suffer his charge to throw away that fine   prospect in his view  if by any means he could prevent him from taking   so rash and inconsiderate a step  and as to his being expelled  he   doubted not  but between him and Sir Ralph  interest might be made to   the heads of the university  to get the affair of the duel passed over    The greatest difficulty he had to apprehend  in compassing this point    was from the young gentleman himself  who he had observed was of a   temper somewhat obstinate  and tenacious of his own opinion  resolving    however  to try all means possible  he wrote immediately to him    representing to him  in the strongest and most pathetick terms he was   master of  the vast advantages the clergy enjoyed  the respect they had   from all degrees of people  and endeavoured to convince him that there   was no avocation whatever  by which a younger brother might so easily   advance his fortune  and do honour to his family       He also sent a letter to Sir Ralph Trusty  acquainting him with the   whole story  and earnestly requesting that he would write to Mr    Francis  and omit nothing that might engage him to desist from doing a   thing so contrary to his interest  and the intention of his deceased   father  as what he now had thoughts of doing was manifestly so  These   efforts  by both the guardians  were often repeated  but without the   least success  the young gentleman found arguments to oppose against   theirs  which neither of them could deny to have weight  particularly   that of his having no call to take upon him holy orders  During these   debates  in which Miss Betsy gave herself no manner of concern  she   received a letter from her brother  containing these lines             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            My dear sister            Though I flatter myself all my letters afford you some sort of        satisfaction  yet by what little judgment I have been able to form
