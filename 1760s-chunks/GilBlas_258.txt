three of my thrusts took place  and I threw him to the ground  like a dead dog despised   Don Huberto  feeling his wound to be mortal  fixed his last looks upon me  and declared that he met his death at my hands as a just punishment for his treason against my mother s honour  He owned that in revenge for the pangs of despised love he had resolved on her ruin  Thus did he breathe his last  imploring pardon from heaven  from Don Anastasio  from Estephania  and from myself  I deemed it imprudent to return home and acquaint my mother of the issue  fame was sure to perform that office for me I passed the mountains  and repaired to Malaga  where I embarked on board a privateer  My outside not altogether indicating cowardice  the captain consented at once to enrol me among his crew   We were not long before we went into action  Near the island of Alboutan  a corsair of Millila fell in with us  on his return towards the African coast with a Spanish vessel richly laden  taken off Carthagena  We attacked the African briskly  and made ourselves masters of both ships  with eighty Christians on board  going as slaves to Barbary  Afterwards  availing ourselves of a wind direct for the coast of Grenada  we shortly arrived at Punta de Helena   While we were inquiring into the birth place and condition of our rescued captives  a man about fifty  of prepossessing aspect  fell under my examination  He stated himself  with a sigh  to belong to Antequera  My heart palpitated  without my knowing why  and my emotion  too strong to pass unnoticed  excited a visible sympathy in him  I avowed myself his townsman  and asked his family name  Alas  answered he  your curiosity makes my sorrow flow afresh  Eighteen years ago did I leave my home  where my remembrance is coupled with scenes of blood and horror  You must yourself have heard but too much of my story  My name is Don Anastasio de Rada  Merciful heaven  exclaimed I  may I believe my senses  And can this be Don Anastasio  Father  What is it you say  young man  exclaimed he in his turn  with surprise and agitation equal to my own  Are you that ill fated infant  still in its mother s womb  when I sacrificed her to my fury  Yes  said I  none other did the virtuous Estephania bring into the world  after the fatal night when you left her weltering in her own blood   Don Anastasio stifled my words in his embraces  For a quarter of an hour we could only mingle our inarticulate sighs and exclamations  After exhausting our tender recollections  and indulging in the wild expression of our feelings  my father lifted his eyes to heaven  in gratitude for Estephania saved  but the next moment  as if doubtful of his bliss  he demanded by what evidence his wife s innocence had been cleared  Sir  answered I  none but yourself ever doubted it  Her conduct has been uniformly spotless  You must be undeceived  Know that Don Huberto was a traitor  In proof of this I unfolded all his perfidy  the vengeance I had taken  and his own confession before he expired   My father was less delighted at his liberty restored than at these happy tidings  In the forgetfulness of ecstacy  he repeated all his former transports  His approbation of me was ardent and entire  Come  my son  said he  let us set out for Antequera  I burn with impatience to throw myself at the feet of a wife whom I have treated so unworthily  Since you have brought me acquainted with my own injustice  my heart has been torn by remorse   I was too eager to bring together a couple so near and dear to me  not to expedite our journey as much as possible  I quitted the privateer  and with my share of prize money bought two mules at Adra  my father not choosing again to incur the hazard of a voyage  He found leisure on the road to relate his adventures  which I inclined to hear as seriously as did the Prince of Ithaca the various recitals of the king his father  At length  after several days  we halted at the foot of a mountain near Antequera  Wishing to reach home privately  we went not into the town till midnight   You may guess my mother s astonishment at beholding a husband whom she had thought for ever lost  and the almost miraculous circumstances of his restoration were a second source of wonder  He entreated forgiveness for his barbarity with marks of repentance so lively  that she could not but be moved  Instead of looking on him as a murderer  she only saw the man to whose will high heaven had subjected her  such religion is there in the name of husband to a virtuous wife  Estephania had been so alarmed about me  that my return filled her with rapture  But her joy on this account was not without alleviation  A sister of Hordales had instituted a criminal prosecution against her brother s antagonist  The search for me was hot  so that my mother  considering home as insecure  was painfully anxious about me  It
