ashamed  they did not find their account in endeavouring to reproach me with those misfortunes  which they and their relations had intailed upon me  and which consequently  reflected much more dishonour on themselves  than on me  who was the innocent victim of their barbarity and avarice —Finding this plan miscarry  they found means to irritate a young gentleman against me  by telling him I had lampooned his mistress  and so effectually succeeded in the quality of incendiaries  that this enraged lover determined to seize me next night  as I returned to my lodgings from a friend s house that I frequented  with this view  he waited in the street  attended by two of his companions  to whom he had imparted his design of carrying me down to the river  in which he proposed to have me heartily ducked  notwithstanding the severity of the weather  it being then about the middle of December —But this stratagem did not succeed  for  being apprised of their ambush  I got home another way  and by the help of my landlord s apprentice  emptied a close stool out of the garret window  which did great execution upon them  and next day  occasioned so much mirth at their expence  that they found themselves under a necessity of leaving the town  until the adventure should be entirely forgotten —My cousins  though twice baffled in their expectation    33 did not however  desist from persecuting me  who had now enraged them beyond a possibility of forgiveness  by detecting their malice  and preventing its effects  neither would I have found them more humane  had I patiently submitted to their rancour  and bore without murmuring the rigour of their unreasonable hate  for  I have found by experience  that though small favours may be acknowledged  and slight injuries atoned  there is no wretch so ungrateful as he  whom you have most generously obliged  and no enemy so implacable  as those who have done you most wrong —These good natured creatures  therefore  had recourse to a scheme which conspired with a piece of bad news I soon after received  to give them all the satisfaction they desired  this plan was to debauch the faith of my companion and confident  and prevail on him to betray the trust I reposed in him  by imparting to them the particulars of my small amours  which they published with such exaggerations  that I suffered very much in the opinion of every body  and was utterly discarded  by the dear creatures whose names had been called in question —While I was busied in tracing out the author of this treachery  that I might not only be revenged on him  but also vindicate my character to my friends  I one day  perceived the looks of my landlady so altered  when I went home to dinner  that upon enquiring into the cause  she screwed up her mouth  and fixing her eyes on the ground  told me her husband had received a letter from Mr  Bowling  with one inclosed for me—she was very sorry for what had happened  both for my sake  and his own—People should be more cautious of their cnoduct—she   34 was always afraid his brutal behaviour would bring him into some misfortune or other —As for her part  she would be very ready to befriend me  but she had a small family of her own to maintain —The world would do nothing for her if she should come to want—charity begins at home —She wished I had been bound to some substantial handicraft  such as a weaver or shoemaker  rather than loiter away my time in learning foolish nonsense that would never bring me in a penny—but some folks are wise  and some are otherwise—I was listening to this mysterious discourse  with great amazement  when her husband entered  and without speaking a syllable  put both the letters into my hand —I received them trembling  and read what follows   To ROGER POTION   SIR   THIS is to let you know that I have quitted the Thunder man of war  being obliged to sheer off  for killing my captain  which I did fairly on the beach  at Cape Tiberoon  in the island of Hispaniola  having received his fire  and returned it  which went through his body —and I would serve the best man so that ever stept between stem and stern  if so be that he struck me  as captain Oakhum  did  I am  thank God  safe among the French  who are very civil  thof I don t understand their lingo —and I hope to be restored in a little time  for all the great friends and parliamentary interest of the captain  for I have sent home to my landlord in Deal  an account   35 of the whole affair  with our bearings and distances while we were engaged  whereby I have desired him to lay it before his majesty  who  G—d bless him  will not suffer an honest tar to be wronged —My love to your spouse  and am  Your loving friend  and servant to command  while Thomas Bowling   To RODERICK RANDOM   Dear RORY   DON T be grieved at my misfortune—but mind your book  my lad  I have got no money to send you  but what of that —Mr  Potion will take care of you
