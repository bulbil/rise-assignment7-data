as I gave it him  for fear lest his curiosity should clash with my continuance at his house  For six reals a day one could live like a gentleman at this inn  where there was generally a considerable concourse of company  About a dozen people sat down at supper  It was whimsical enough  but the whole party plied their knives and forks without speaking a word  except one man  who talked incessantly  right or wrong  and made up for the silence of the rest by his eternal babble  He affected to be a wit  to tell a good story  and took great pains to make the good folks merry by his puns  and accordingly they did laugh most inextinguishably  but it was at him  not with him   For my part  I paid so little attention to the talk of this rattle  that I should have got up from table without knowing what it was all about  if he had not brought it home to my business and my bosom  Gentlemen  cried he  just as supper was over  I have kept my best story for the last  a very droll thing happened within these few days at the archbishop of Seville s palace  I had it from a young fellow of my acquaintance  who assures me that he was present at the time  These words made my heart jump up into my throat  for I had no doubt of this being my exploit    and so it turned out This pleasant gentle man related the facts as they actually happened  and even carried the adventure to its conclusion  of which I was as yet ignorant  but now you shall be made as wise as myself   No sooner had I absconded  than the Moors  who were  according to the progress of the fable and the rising of the interest  to lay violent hands on me  appeared upon the stage  for the fell purpose of surprising me on my bed of turf  where the author had given them reason to expect me fast asleep  but when they thought they were just going to capot the King of Leon  they found  to their surprise  that both the king and the knave made a trick against them  Here was a hole in the ballad  The actors all lost their cue  some of them called me by name  others ran to look for me  here is a fellow bawling as though his bellows would burst  there stands another  muttering to himself about the devil  just as if that reptile could stand upright in such a presence  The archbishop  perceiving trouble and confusion to lord it behind the scenes  asked what was the matter  At the sound of the prelate s voice  a page  who was the fiddle of the piece  came to the front and spoke thus  My lord archbishop  ladies  and gentlemen  We are extremely sorry to inform you  as players  but extremely glad  as men and Christians  that the King of Leon is at present in no danger whatever of being taken prisoner by the Moors  he has adopted effectual measures for the security of his royal person  and to the royal person  as liberty avails little without property  he has irrevocably attached the crown  insignia  and robes  And a happy deliverance for himself and Christendom  exclaimed the archbishop  He has done perfectly right to escape from the enemies of our religion  and to burst from the bonds in which their malice would have laid him  By this time  probably  he has reached the confines of his kingdom  or may have entered the capital  May no unlucky accident have retarded him on his journey  And that the sin of none such may lie heavy on my conscience  I beg leave very positively to make my pleasure known  that he may proceed unmolested by any interruption from this quarter  I should be highly mortified indeed  if his majesty s pious endeavours were to be frustrated by the slightest indignity from the ministers of that religion in whose cause he labours and suffers  The prelate  having thus declared his acquiescence in the motives of my flight  ordered my part to be read  and the play to be resumed       CH  XI     Continuation of Scipio s story   As long as I had money in my purse  my landlord was cap in hand  but the moment he began to suspect that the funds were low  he became high and mighty  picked a German quarrel with me  and one morning  before breakfast  begged it as a favour of me to march out of his house  I followed his counsel as proudly as you please  and betook me to a church belonging to the fathers of St Dominic  where  while mass was performing  an old beggar accosted me on the usual topic of alms  I dropped some small change into his hat  which was truly the orphan s mite  saying at the same time  My friend  remember in your prayers to mention a situation for me  if your petition is heard with favour  it shall be all the better for you  hearty thanks  and a handsome poundage   At these words  the beggar surveyed me up and down from head
