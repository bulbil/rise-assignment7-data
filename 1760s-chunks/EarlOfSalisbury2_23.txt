herself  that some intelligence must have been  received  equally favourable to her  and confounding to her oppressor   She expected every moment to hear of the vigorous and effectual  interposition of some friends to affert the rights  and to redeem her  from her present captivity  yet  did she frequently lament to her faithful attendant  that her rescue was  so long delayed  Whatever consolation Elinor could give  was now  dissembled and constrained  for Oswald had been enabled to convey to his  sister an account of the seizing of young William  and his own return  and confinement  She was but too well acquainted with the violence of  Ela  too much alarmed with the dread of her relapsing into her former  malady  to entrust this fatal intelligence to her ear  With a heart  oppressed with grief and terror  she assumed the aspect of ease and  serenity  When the Countess expressed her fears  a sigh sometimes  escaped from the attendant  but it seemed the sigh of friendly sympathy   and in her moments of pleasing thoughts  and expectations  Elinor had  ever at command some general expressions of comfort  some effussions of  pious confidence in the great protector of innocence  to brighten the  dawn of hope which arose within her gentle mistress  But she was soon to  be undeceived  too soon was her heart to be pierced with the most  dreadful didings         End of BOOK V                           BOOK VI              SECT  I     THE two brothers who had proved such zealous agents in oppression and  cruelty  were once again to aggravate the distresses of the Countess   The discontent and envy which Grey had conceived towards Reginhald since  his last arrival  which he was not studious to conceal  together with  the insolence and presumption of this Monk  founded on the opinion of  his great services  produced mutual coldness and contempt in their  wicked hearts  and threatened to dissolve their iniquitous union  A new  and unexpected incident now served to light up their animosity     Some enormities of Reginhald had lately been discovered in the  monastery  too great to be concealed or palliated  A country maiden had  been seduced to a compliance with his sensual desires  He had for some  time consorted with her  until by degrees his brutal passion grew sated   and required some new object  He fixed his lascivious eyes upon the  concubine of one of his associates in revelling  and made some attempts  to possess her  which had provoked her paramour to utter the most  violent menaces against the Monk  To appease his resentment  Reginhald  basely proposed to give him up the unhappy victim of his own lewdness   The man was not yet so abandoned to all sense of virtue  as not to feel  the utmost abhorrence at this instance of transcendent villany  Less  scrupulous to acknowledge his own shame  as he was not of the clerical  order  and too violently provoked against the Monk to admit any thought  of reconciliation  he only waited to procure such  proofs as might confirm his information  then seized the moment of  Reginhald s absence  produced the wretched woman he had corrupted  as  well as her he had attempted  and wounded the ears of the reverend  fraternity with a full detection of their wicked brother  the whole  cloister was instantly filled with sorrow and indignation  Every  instance of outrage and irreverence which he had committed was now  recalled to mind  and repeated by every tongue  How often he had  disturbed or disgraced their religious house  was now freely told  how  often his inoffensive brethren had been exposed to his insolence or  malice  how often his beastly revels had been prolonged  until  roused  by the matin bell  he had mixed his debauchery with their early  devotions  It was at length resolved to send a deputation to the castle  of Salisbury to demand that Reginhald should be sent back to the  monastery  there to here his accusers  and to suffer the punishment due  to his accumulated baseness     The persons entrusted with this commission were now arrived  The Monk  was made acquainted with the purpose of their coming  and affected to  treat them with defiance and contempt  although he was too conscious of  his guilt not to feel the most violent secret emotions of terror  He  sought his brother  and demanded his advice and assistance in this  emergency  They chose for their private conference a garden belonging  to the castle  in which the Countess had chiefly delighted in her  happier days  and which she now sometimes visited  to refresh her  harassed mind  Grey listened to the story of his brother s danger  with  a provoking coldness and insensibility  Reginhald rudely vaunted his  important services to Hubert and Raymond  and seemed to expect  as his  just right  their full protection in this his present difficulty  Grey  at length
