to meet him directly at a   neighbouring tavern        Ay    said he  adjusting his wig at the glass  and putting on his   cloak    this is the thing  There is some difierence between treating   with a good substantial citizen  who will mind what a  man says    and your people of fashion  who fly into a rage  forsooth  if they   can t have their own way in everything  No people part with their   money so freely as merchants  They don t stand higgling  and   criticising like the others  All they require is  to be asked a good   price  and then they think a thing must be good  of course  Many   a time have I got five times more from a merchant than I dared to   have asked from a duke  I suppose he wants to show his taste   next week at the sale   and has sent for me  to tell him which are   the best pieces  and how much he may bid for them  He is not the   first citizen whom my instructions have made pass for a man of   taste and judgment  I love such pupils  they pay so well for their   learning   and that more ways than one  for they buy what nobody   else would bid for   it is only slipping a puffer or two of quality   at them  enough of whom come sharking to every sale for that   purpose only  and they may be raised to any price  No people   part with their money like merchants        When he came to the tavern  he found the merchant waiting for   him  After the compliments common upon such occasions were         ADVENTUBES OF A GUINEA 455     politely interchanged    I desired to see you    said the merchant    proceeding to business  though not  without evident confusion    on an affair that will convince you of my confidence in your abilities   and honour  Trade  as you know  has been so dead for some time   past that there is no getting in a penny of money without tearing   people to pieces  Now  as I had rather suffer something myself    than oppress any honest man till he can bring his affairs about    I should be glad to dispose of some parcels of goods even under   their value  to raise money for present occasions   that is  provided   it can be done in such a manner as not to be known  as such a thing   might injure a man s credit          Dear sir    answered my master  whose heart leaped with joy   at the mention of such an affair    never fear that   I U engage to   manage it so  that if everyone who knows you were to watch  they d   never even suspect the least of the matter  There is nothing easier    nor more common in the way of business   and it luckily happens   that I have the first opportimity at this very time  that ever I had   in my life  I have a large sale under a commission  the very week   after next  into which I can hedge a thousand or two  with the   greatest ease and safety  Assignees never take notice of such things    We understand one another better than that  Many a worthy man   have I enabled to hold his head above water for years  by thi   method  To be sure  it must have an end some time   but then   a man stands in fortune s way for a lucky hit  you know   and not   only that  but also makes sure of so much good living in the mean    time  and can be no worse at the last   and then  when all comes to   all  and there must be a blow up  it gives him an opportunity of   securing something against a rainy day  as the saying is  As for   its being discovered  there are ways enough to prevent that  It   is but entering them as sold   and I ll find a buyer that shall never   be heard more of  Lord  sir  if it were not for things of this kind    our business would be nothing to what it is  Half the sales you   see every day in the papers are made up in this manner          Well  sir    replied the merchant  who had listened to him with   attention  and seemed greatly affected at some part of what he said      I presume you understand your business  and as I have no doubt of   your honour
