an end between us  Besides I          1 90       know  by my own feelings  that age wants the comforts of life  a plentiful table  generous wines  chearful converse  and the notice of those they have been accustomed to revere  renews in some degree the fire of youth  gives a spring to declining nature  and perhaps prolongs as well as enlivens the evening of their days  Nor is it a small addition to my satisfaction  to see the respect paid them by the young of their own rank  from the observation of their being thus distinguished by me  as an old man  I have a kind of interest in making age an object of reverence  but  were I ever so young  I would continue a custom which appears to me not less just than humane      Adieu  my esteemed  my amiable friend  how I envy you your larks and nightingales     Your faithful Belmont           1 91         To Colonel Bellville   Thursday      Positively  Bellville  I can answer for nothing  these sylvan scenes are so very bewitching  the vernal grove  and balmy Zephyr  are so favourable to a lover s prayer  that if Fondville was any thing but a pretty man about town  my situation would be extremely critical        This wicked Harry too has certainly some evil design  he forms nothing but enchanting rural parties  either à quarrée  or with others of the young and gay  not a maiden aunt has appeared at Belmont since his reign commenced  He suffers no ideas to enter our imaginations but those of youth  beauty  love  and the seducing          1 92       pleasures of the golden age  We dance on the green  dine at the hermitage  and wander in the woods by moonlight  listening to the song of the nightingale  or the sweeter notes of that little syren Lady Julia  whose impassioned sounds would soften the marble heart of a virgin of eighty  five      I really tremble for my fair friend  young  artless  full of sensibility  exposed hourly to the charms of the prettiest fellow upon earth  with a manner so soft  so tender  so much in her own romantic way          A rap at my door    Fondville is sent for away    company at his house    sets out immediately    I must bid the dear creature adieu          I am returned  pity me  Bellville            1 93          The streams  the groves  the rocks remain    But damon still I seek in vain       Yes  the dear man is gone  Harry is retired to write letters  and Lady Julia and I are going to take a walk  Tete à Tete in the wood  Jesu Maria  a female Tete à Tete     I shall never go through the operation    if we were en confidence indeed  it might be bearable  but the little innocent fool has not even a secret        Adio     Yours  A  Wilmot           1 94         To George Mordaunt  Esq      OH  Mordaunt  I am indeed undone  I was too confident of my own strength  I depended on the power of gratitude and honor over my heart  but find them too weak to defend me against such inexpressible loveliness  I could have resisted her beauty only  but the mind which irradiates those speaking eyes    the melting music of those gentle accents   soft as the fleeces of descending snows     the delicacy  yet lively tenderness of her sentiments    that angel innocence    that winning sweetness    the absence of her parents  and Lady Anne s coquetry with Lord Fondville  have given me opportunities of conversing with her  which have for ever destroyed my peace    I must tear myself from her    I will leave Belmont the moment my Lord returns    I am for ever lost    doomed to wretchedness    but          1 95       I will be wretched alone    I tremble lest my eyes should have discovered    lest pity should involve her in my misery      Great heavens  was I not sufficiently unhappy  to stab me to the heart  I have just received the following letter from Lord Belmont       To Henry Mandeville  Esq   June 22d      THE present member of parliament for being in a state of health which renders his life extremely uncertain
