gave to my very naughty boy     and for the difference which you taught him to make for the   future  between the sauciness of a lord and the sentiments of a   gentleman      Harry felt himself at once disconcerted  abased  and wholly cut   down  by this compliment from his lordship  At length recovering   himself he answered You mean  to be sure  sir  to reprove me the   more by what you have said   but  if you are in earnest  I am sure   it is a very bad lesson which you teach me  sir  when you praise me         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  171     for my faults  and so encourage me in them  Faults   my dear    cried the earl  I heard of none such   what do you mean by your   faults   I mean  sir  that when I told your son as much as that he   was not a gentleman  it showed that I was still less of the gentle    man myself   and I very well deserved the blow which he gave me   for such an affront   and I am ready to ask his pardon whenever   you please  my lord  No  no  my man  cried Lord Mansfield  you   shall never disgrace yourself so much as to make any submissions to   my naughty boy  I shall think it no disgrace  quick and affect    ingly replied Harry  to make submissions to any one who is son to   such a gentleman as my Lord Mansfield      My lord for some time looked with astonishment at the child     when  eagerly catching and pressing him to his bosom  he cried out   On my honour you are the sweetest as well as the noblest fellow   I was ever acquainted with   and  sir  I shall think it an honour to   be admitted among your friends  and that s what I would not say to   many in Old England  Mr  Fenton  continued the earl  if you will   give yourself the trouble to inquire out my little lodge on the hill   you will oblige me   though I envy your character  I shall be glad   of your acquaintance  So saying  Lord Mansfield got up after his   blunt manner  and precipitately withdrew      On the following evening Mr  Fenton took Harry and Mr    Clement into his study   and taking from his pocket book a number   of bank bills Mr  Clement  says he  I here make my Harry a   present of fifteen hundred pounds  reserving only to myself the   privilege of advising how it may be laid out and secured for him to   the best advantage      To morrow morning you and he are to set out on foot for London    and there to take lodgings as near to the Fleet prison as you can   conveniently be accommodated  You are then to apply to the keeper    and to give him a gratuity for making out a written list of all the   prisoners under his custody  with their quality and condition   annexed  as also the sums respectively due  and the terms during   which they have been in confinement      You are then to inquire from him the several characters  dis    tresses  and merits of all the prisoners of note  and to make an   entry thereof in a separate paper   but then you are not to depend   altogether on his report  You are to go from room to room  to   converse with the prisoners apart  and to inquire from each the   characters  fortunes  and disasters of the others      This inquisition  in all likelihood  will take you up above a fort    night  But  above all  remember that those among them who are   most affected by the distresses of their fellows  ought to be the   principal objects of your own charity and relief      Let five hundred pounds of this money be appropriated to the   enlargement of such prisoners as are under duresse for sums not   amounting to ten pounds  You will thereby free the captive   give   means of bread to the hungry   and restore to your country many   members that are worse than useless  that are also a dead weight   and encumbrance upon her  Let the remaining thousand pounds   be applied to the enfranchisement or relief of those prisoners of   note  whose cases and calamities call for singular compassion  And         172 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      be sure to keep an account where your money may fall short of   such valuable purposes   and  as far as five hundred pounds more   will
