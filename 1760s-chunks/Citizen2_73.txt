by power  endeavour to guide themselves by reason  instead of appealing to the pleasure of the prince  appeal to the original rights of mankind  What one rank of men assert is denied by others  as the reasons on opposite sides happen to come home with greater   228 or less conviction  The people of Asia are directed by precedent  which never alters  the English by reason  which is ever changing its appearance   The disadvantages of an Asiatic government acting in this manner by precedent are evident  original errors are thus continued  without hopes of redress  and all marks of genius are levelled down to one standard  since no superiority of thinking can be allowed its exertion in mending obvious defects  But to recompence those defects  their governments undergo no new alterations  they have no new evils to fear  nor no fermentations in the constitution that continue  the struggle for power is soon over  and all becomes tranquil as before  they are habituated to subordination  and men are taught to form no other desires  than those which they are allowed to satisfy   The disadvantages of a government acting from the immediate influence of reason  like that of England  are not less than those of the former  It is extremely difficult to induce a number of free beings to co operate for their mutual benefit  every possible advantage will necessarily be sought  and every attempt to procure it must be attended with a new fermentation  various reasons will lead different ways  and equity and advantage will often be out ballanced by a combination of clamour and prejudice  But though such a people may be thus in the wrong  they have been influenced by an happy delusion  their errors are seldom seen till they are felt  each man is himself the tyrant he has obeyed  and such a master he can easily forgive  The disadvantages he feels   229 may in reality be equal to what is felt in the most despotic government  but man will bear every calamity with patience  when he knows himself to be the author of his own misfortunes  Adieu   LETTER CXVIII  From the same   MY long residence here begins to fatigue me  as every object ceases to be new  it no longer continues to be pleasing  some minds are so fond of variety that pleasure it self  if permanent  would be insupportable  and we are thus obliged to solicit new happiness even by courting distress  I only therefore wait the arrival of my son to vary this trifling scene  and borrow new pleasure from danger and fatigue  A life  I own  thus spent in wandring from place to place  is at best but empty dissipation  But to pursue trifles is the lot of humanity  and whether we bustle in a pantomime  or strut at a coronation  whether we shout at a bonefire  or harrangue in a senate house  whatever object we follow  it will at last surely conduct us to futility and disappointment  The wise bustle and laugh as they walk in the ant  but fools bustle and are important  and this probably is all the difference between them   This may be an apology for the levity of my former correspondence  I talked of trifles  and I knew that they were trifles  to make the things of this life ridiculous  it was only sufficient to call them by their names     230In other respects  I have omitted several striking circumstances in the description of this country  as supposing them either already known to you  or as not being thoroughly known to myself  But there is one omission for which I expect no forgiveness  namely  my being totally silent upon their buildings  roads  rivers  and mountains  This is a branch of science on which all other travellers are so very prolix  that my deficiency will appear the more glaring  With what pleasure  for instance  do some read of a traveller in Egypt  measuring a fallen column with his cane  and finding it exactly five feet nine inches long  of his creeping through the mouth of a catacomb  and coming out by a different hole from that he entered  of his stealing the finger of an antique statue  in spite of the janizary that watch d him  or his adding a new conjecture to the hundred and fourteen conjectures already published  upon the names of Osu is and Isis   Methinks I hear some of my friends in China demanding a similar account of London and the adjacent villages  and if I remain here much longer  it is probable I may gratify their curiosity  I intend  when run dry on other topics  to take a serious survey of the City wall  to describe that beautiful building the Mansion House  I will enumerate the magnificent squares  in which the nobility chiefly reside  and the Royal Palaces appointed for the reception of the English Monarch  nor will I forget the beauties of Shoe Lane  in which I my self have resided since my arrival  You shall find me no way inferior to many of my brother travellers in the arts of description  At present    231 however as a specimen of this way of writing  I send you a few hasty remarks  collected in a late journey I made to Kentish Town  and this in
