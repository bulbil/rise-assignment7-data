his own plan    and preserved his attention  cool and ready to take any advantage   that might offer      Accordingly  that morning  upon notice of some motions of the   enemy that indicated a design of attacking him  he ordered a small   but select body of forces  almost all of them English  to advance   towards them  and receive their charge  while he should make a   proper disposition of the rest of his army to give the enemy battle    or make a secure retreat  as he should see expedient  But the un    exampled behaviour of those few brave troops soon changed the   face of the affair  for  not satisfied with repelling the attack of the   main body of the enemy s army  they intrepidly advanced to charge   them in their turn  which they did with such irresistible valour    that the French were thrown into confusion  and obliged to abandon   the field of battle      1 have said before that the transactions in a battle are so com    plicated and so confounded with each other that it is impossible   to reduce them into the regularity of a satisfactory description    I shall  therefore  enter no farther into the account of this  than just   as it concerns the conduct of the English general  which I had a   sufficient opportunity of observing  my master having placed   himself near his person  in company with his friend      The moment the commander in chief received an account of the   unexpected effects of the valour of the troops which he had ordered   to march towards the enemy  he sent to the English general   who     1 The battle of Minden  1759   in which the French under Broglie   and Contades were defeated by the allies under Ferdinand of Brunswick      2 Lord George Sacfcville  1716 85   afterwards Viscount Saokville    sou of the Duke of Dorset  He was commander of the British contingent   at Minden  and his nervousness or jealousy  as related  saved the French   army from complete destruction  He was found guilty of disobedience    declared unfit to serve the Crown in any military capacity  and in spite   of great family influence was thoroughly disgraced  One of the griev    ances against Bute in the following reign was the cordial reception given   at court to his friend Sackville          256 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     commanded all the horse in that wing to advance and sustain them    It is impossible to describe his situation when a messenger from the   general informed him that a part of the army was engaged in the   plain that lay before him  and ordered him to march the cavalry   under his command to their assistance  Surprise and resentment   at such a measure s being taken  without his having the least pre    vious notice of it  almost deprived him of his reason   but he re    covered himself in a moment  and drawing his sword with an air of   indignation and discontent  was just preparing to obey the orders   he had received  when another messenger arrived  and delivered   them  but with some variation  This the general instantly perceived    and resolved to take advantage of  to justify his obeying neither    in hopes  by that means  to accomplish his scheme of defeating the   measures of his commander  without any regard to the consequences   that must attend such a conduct  Accordingly  instead of advanc    ing  as he had before prepared to do  he entered into a debate with   the messengers about this difference in their orders  and  finding   each positive in those he delivered  he coolly determined to go   himself to the general for an explanation of them   by trifling away   the critical moment in which manner he expected that the part of the   allied army which was engaged would be beaten for want of proper   and timely support  when he might have the glory of covering their   retreat  and saving the whole army from a defeat  and the pleasure   of effectually ruining the character of the general  by attributing   the whole misfortune to his not taking the advice of his council    or even commxmicating his designs to them in proper time      Such a scheme was but too likely to succeed  had not the un    paralleled bravery of the troops  whom he thus designed to have   sacrificed to his ambition and resentment  disappointed it beyond   all human probability  as I have observed before  and actually   beaten the whole army of the enemy  though ten times their number    out of the field  while he was taking advantage of a pretext to   abandon them to ruin
