true Christianity  and that he was possessed of   virtues and feelings which shone forth to the last moment of his   life  unimpaired by the distractions of pain  and unshaken amid the   ruins of genius       So says the biographer of 1787  in the ambitious style of those   days   but doubtless with perfect truth  Yet neither he  nor any   other biographer with whom I am acquainted  give any details of   the real character  the inner life  of the man  One longs  but   longs almost in vain  for any scrap of diary  private meditation    even familiar letter  from one who had seen  read  and above all   suffered  so much and so variously  But with the exception of   half a dozen letters  nothing of the kind seems to exist  His inner   life can only be guessed at   and all that is known of his outer life   has been compressed into one short article in the Dublin University   Magazine for February  1852  full of good writing and of good     a2         PREFACE      feeling  Ite author is a descendant of Henry Brooke   and to him   I am bound to offer my thanks for the assistance which he has   given me toward this preface      One would be glad  too   if physiognomy be  as some hold  a key   to character   of some trustworthy description or portrait of his   outward man  to have known even the colour of his eyes and   hair   but this  too  is not to be had  Some Irish friend describes   him in terms general enough  as  when young   fresh looking    slenderly formed  and exceedingly graceful  He had an oval face    ruddy complexion  and large soft eyes  full of fire  He was of   great personal courage  but never known to offend any man  He   was an excellent swordsman  and could dance with much grace     There are certainly notes here of that heroical temperament    softened withal by delicate sensibility  which shows forth in   every line of his writings  And there is another sketch of him    in 1775  which gives the same notion   He was drest in a   long blue cloak  with a wig that fell down his shoulders   a little   man  as neat as wax work  with an oval face  ruddy complexion    large eyes  full of fire  In short  he is like a picture mellowed   by time   There is a drawing of him which seems to be the   same as that prefixed to his poems  If this  and the still finer   head on the title page of Brookiana  be trustworthy  the face must   have been one of a very delicate and regular beauty  The large   soft eye  the globular under eyelid  the finely arched eyebrow  all   notes of a sweet and rich  yet over sensitive nature   are very   remarkable  There is a certain grace and alertness  too  about the   figure  which agrees with the story of his having been a good   dancer and swordsman  But on the type of brain  and even of the   masque  it is very difficult to pronounce  Portraits of the eight    eenth century  not very trustworthy in any detail  are especially   careless in these  There seems no reason to suppose that English   faces were more sensual or more same a hundred years ago than   they are now   yet who  in looking round a family portrait gallery    has not remarked the difference between the heads of the seven    teenth and those of the eighteenth century   The former are of   the same type as our own  and with the same strong and varied   personality   the latter painfully like  both to each other and to an   oil flask   the jaw round  weak  and sensual   the forehead narrow   and retreating  Had the race really degenerated for a while  or   was the lower type adopted intentionally  out of compliment to   some great personage   Be that as it may  Henry Brooke s portrait   is too like dozens of that day to be much trusted  Even if we   accept the lower part of the face  round and weak  though not   coarse   as the mark of that want of perseverance which was in   worldly matters his worst defect  yet we cannot accept the length          PREFACE      between the nose and mouth  which does not appear in the head   in Brookiana    nor  airain  the narrowing forehead  however lofty  as
