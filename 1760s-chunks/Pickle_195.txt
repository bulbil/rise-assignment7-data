the Grand Monarque  that next morning I was sent to the  Bastille  by virtue of a lettre de cachet  There I remained for  some months  deprived of all intercourse with rational creatures   a circumstance for which I was not sorry  as I had the more time to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   project schemes of revenge against the tyrant who confined me  and the  wretch who had betrayed my private conversation  But tired  at length   with these fruitless suggestions  I was fain to unbend the severity of  my thoughts by a correspondence with some industrious spiders  who had  hung my dungeon with their ingenious labours    I considered their work with such attention that I soon became an adept  in the mystery of weaving  and furnished myself with as many useful  observations and reflections on that art  as will compose a very curious  treatise  which I intend to bequeath to the Royal Society  for the  benefit of our woollen manufacture  and this with a view to perpetuate  my own name  rather than befriend my country  for  thank Heaven  I am  weaned from all attachments of that kind  and look upon myself as one  very little obliged to any society whatsoever  Although I presided  with absolute power over this long legged community  and distributed  punishments and rewards to each  according to his deserts  I grew  impatient of my situation  and my natural disposition one day  prevailing  like a fire which had long been smothered  I wreaked the  fury of my indignation upon my innocent subjects  and in a twinkling  destroyed the whole race  While I was employed in this general massacre   the turnkey  who brought me food  opened the door  and perceiving my  transport  shrugged up his shoulders  and leaving my allowance  went  out  pronouncing  Le pauvre diable  la tete lui tourne  My passion no  sooner subsided than I resolved to profit by this opinion of the jailor   and from that day counterfeited lunacy with such success  that in less  than three months I was delivered from the Bastille  and sent to the  galleys  in which they thought my bodily vigour might be of service   although the faculties of my mind were decayed  Before I was chained  to the oar  I received three hundred stripes by way of welcome  that I  might thereby be rendered more tractable  notwithstanding I used all the  arguments in my power to persuade them I was only mad north north west   and  when the wind was southerly  knew a hawk from a handsaw    In our second cruise we had the good fortune to be overtaken by  a tempest  during which the slaves were unbound  that they might  contribute the more to the preservation of the galley  and have a chance  for their lives  in case of shipwreck  We were no sooner at liberty   than  making ourselves masters of the vessel  we robbed the officers   and ran her on shore among rocks on the coast of Portugal  from whence  I hastened to Lisbon  with a view of obtaining my passage in some ship  bound for England  where  by this time  I hoped my affair was forgotten    But  before this scheme could be accomplished  my evil genius led me  into company  and  being intoxicated  I began to broach doctrines on  the subject of religion  at which some of the party were scandalized and  incensed  and I was next day dragged out of bed by the officers of the  Inquisition  and conveyed to a cell in the prison belonging to that  tribunal    At my first examination  my resentment was strong enough to support me  under the torture  which I endured without flinching  but my resolution  abated  and my zeal immediately cooled  when I understood from a  fellow prisoner  who groaned on the other side of the partition  that  in a short time there would be an auto da fe  in consequence of which  I should  in all probability  be doomed to the flames  if I would not  renounce my heretical errors  and submit to such penance as the church  should think fit to prescribe  This miserable wretch was convicted of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Judaism  which he had privately practised by connivance for many years   until he had amassed a fortune sufficient to attract the regard of the  church  To this he fell a sacrifice  and accordingly prepared himself  for the stake  while I  not at all ambitious of the crown of martyrdom   resolved to temporize  so that  when I was brought to the question the  second time  I made a solemn recantation  As I had no worldly fortune to  obstruct my salvation  I was received into the bosom of the church  and   by way of penance  enjoined to walk barefoot to Rome in the habit of a  pilgrim    During my peregrination through Spain  I was detained as a spy  until  I could procure
