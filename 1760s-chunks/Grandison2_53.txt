that magnificence in which he delighted to live in the country  she declined going up  And having by this time her three children  she found it was   131 as agreeable to Sir Thomas  as to herself  that she should turn her thoughts wholly to the domestic duties  Lady Grandison  when she found that she could not bring Sir Thomas to lessen his great expences supposed it to be wisdom to endeavour  to the utmost of her power  to enable him to support them without discredit to himself  or visible hurt to his family  The children were young  and were not likely to make demands upon him for many years to come   Here was a mother  my dear  Who will say  that mothers may not be the most useful persons in the family  when they do their duty  and their husbands are defective in theirs  Sir Thomas Grandison s delights centred in himself  Lady Grandison s in her husband and children  What a superiority  what an inferiority   Yet had this Lady  with the best oeconomy  no narrowness in her heart  She was beloved for her generosity and benevolence  Her poor neighbours adored her  Her table was plenteous  She was hospitable  as well from the largeness of her own heart  as to give credit to her busband  and so far to accommodate herself to his taste  as that too great a difference might not be seen between his absence and presence  As occasions offer d  she would confer benefits in the name of an husband  whom  perhaps  she had not seen of months  and knew not whether she might see for months to come  She was satisfied  tho  hers was the first merit  with the second merit reflected from that she gave him     I am but Sir Thomas s almoner  I know I shall please Sir Thomas by doing this  Sir Thomas would have done thus  Perhaps he would have been more bountiful had he been present      He had been once absent from this admirable wife six whole months  when he left her but for one  He designed only an excursion to Paris when he set out  but  when in company as gay as himself  while he was there  he extended his tour  and  what was still more   132 inexcusable  he let his Lady hear from him by secondhand only  He never wrote one line to her with his own  yet  on his return  affected to surprise her by a sudden appearance  when she knew not that he was in England   Was not this intollerably vain in him  The moment he appeared  so secure was he of his Lady s unmerited Love  that he supposed the joy she would break out into  would banish from her thoughts all memory of his past unkindness   He ask d her  however  after the first emotions  for she received him with real joy  If she could easily forgive him —Forgive you  Sir —Yes  if you can forgive yourself   This he called severe  Well he might  for it was just  Lady Grandison s goodness was founded in principle  not in tameness or servility   Be not serious  Sir Thomas  said my Lady  and flung her arms about him  You know  by your question  you were unkind  Not one line from your own hand neither—But the seeing you now safe and well  compensates me for all the anxieties you have given me in the past six tedious months—Can I say they were not anxious ones  But I pity you  Sir  for the pleasure you have lost by so long an absence  Let me lead you to the nursery  or let the dear prattlers come down to receive their father s blessing  How delightful is their dawning reason  Their improvements exceed my hopes  Of what pleasure do you deprive yourself by these long absences   My dear Miss Grandison  let me write on  I am upon a sweet subject  Why will you tear me from it  Who  Lucy  would not almost wish to be the wife  the half slighted wife  of a gay Sir Thomas  to be a Lady Grandison   One reflexion  my dear Miss Grandison  let me make  before I attend you  left I should lose it  What man who now  at one view  takes in the whole gay    133 fluttering life of Sir Thomas Grandison  tho  young  gay  and flutterring  himself  can propose to be more happy than Sir Thomas thought himself  What woman  who  in like manner  can take in the whole  useful  prudent  serene  benevolent  life of Lady Grandison  whatever turn to pleasure  less solid  and more airy  she may have  sees not  from this imperfect sketch  all that they should wish to be  and the transitory vanity of the one  and the solid happiness that must attend the other  as well here as hereafter   Dear Lady —had you not hurried me so  how much better should I have expressed myself   I come  I come   LETTER XII  Miss BYRON  In continuation   MISS Grandison has been making me
