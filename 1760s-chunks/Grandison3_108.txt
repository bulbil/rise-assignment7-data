to   268 be thus indicated  I respectfully bowed  I recommended myself to the favour of the two brothers  and thro  them to that of the three truly respectable persons they had named  and withdrew to my lodgings with a heart sorely distressed   I was unable to stir out for the remainder of the day  The same chair into which I threw myself  upon my first coming in  held me for hours   In the evening Camilla  in disguise  made me a visit  On my servant s withdrawing  revealing herself  O Sir  said she  what a distracted family have I left  They know not of my coming hither  but I could not forbear this officiousness  I cannot stay  But let me just tell you how unhappy we are  and your own generosity will suggest to you  what is best to be done   As soon as you were gone  my Lord Bishop acquainted my Lady Marchioness with what had passed between you  O Sir  you have an affectionate friend in Signor Jeronymo  He endeavoured to soften every thing  My Lady Marchioness acquainted my Lord with the Bishop s report  I never saw that good nobleman in such a passion  It is not necessary to tell you what he said—  In a passion with me  Camilla   Yes  He thought the whole family dishonoured  Sir   The Marquis della Porretta is the worthiest of men  Camilla  said I  I honour him —But proceed   The Marchioness  in the tenderest manner  broke the matter to my young Lady  I was present  She apprehended  that there might be occasion for my attendance  and commanded me to stay   Before she could speak all she had to say  my young Lady threw herself on her knees to her mamma  and blessing her for her goodness to her  begged her to spare the rest  I see  said she  that I  a daughter of the Porretta family  your daughter  madam  am refused    269 Palliate not  I beseech you  the indignity  You need not  It is enough  that I am refused  Surely  madam  your Clementina is not so base in spirit  as to need your maternal consolation on such a contempt as this  I feel for my papa  for you  madam  and for my brothers  I feel the indignity  Blessings follow the man where ever he goes  It would be mean to be angry with him  He is his own master  and now he has made me my own mistress  Never fear  madam  but this affair now will sit as light upon me  as it ought  His humility will allow him to be satisfied with a meaner wife  You  madam  my papa  my brothers  shall not find me mean   The Marchioness embraced  with tears of joy  her beloved daughter  She brought my Lord to her  and reported what her daughter had said  He also tenderly embraced the dear young Lady  and rejoyced in her assurances  that now the cure was effected   But  unseasonably  as the event shewed  Father Marescotti  being talked with  was earnest to be allowed to visit her  Then  he said  was the proper time  the very crisis  to urge her to accept of the Count of Belvedere   I was bid to tell her  that his Reverence desired to attend her   O let me go  said she  to Florence  to my dear Mrs  Beaumont —To morrow morning let me go  and not see Father Marescotti  till I can see him as I wish to see him   But the good Father prevailed  He meant the best   He was with her half an hour  He left her in a melancholy way  When her mamma went to her  she sound her spiritless  her eyes fixed  and as gloomy as ever  She was silent to two or three of her mother s questions  and when she did speak  it was with wildness  but declaring  without being solicited in the Count of Belvedere s favour  against marrying him  or any man in the world     270 Her mother told her  she should go to Florence  as soon as she pleased  But then the humour was off  Would to Heaven she had gone before she saw his Reverence  So they all now wish   Camilla  said she to me  when we were alone  Was it necessary to load the Chevalier Grandison  Was it necessary to inveigh against him  It was ungenerous to do so  Was the man obliged to have the creature whose forwardness had rendered her contemptible in his eyes  I could not bear to hear him inveighed against  But never  never  let me hear his named mentioned  But  Camilla  I cannot bear being despised  neither   She arose from her seat  and from that moment her humour took a different turn  She now talks  She raves  She starts  She neither sits nor stands with quietness—She walks up and down her room  at other times  with passion and hurry  yet weeps not  tho  she makes every body else weep
