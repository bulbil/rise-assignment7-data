not hang us up with it for life         But can t you stay a few moments   I want to know how you   came in that condition           It was only a scrape about a wench  I ll tell you the particulars   another time  My girl would not forgive me  if she knew I was   so long in town without going to her          But will you certainly come to morrow   1 am afraid you will   disappoint me now you have got what you wanted          Never fear  I have not got what I wanted while you have a   shilling left in the world        Saying which  he walked away  without deigning to take any   further leave  But his behaviour was not so cavalier where he    was going  The moment he entered his mistress s room  she flew   at him  not with the fondness of a dove    So    said she    what   bawdy house have you been breaking up now   You do well to   come to me in such a jiickle   but I ll see you damned before I ll   take the trouble of nursing you          Don t be in a passion  my love    said he  taking her in his arms     and giving her a kiss    It is no such thing  I fell among a gang of   foot pads  who abused me in this manner because I made resistance          A very likely story truly  invented  I suppose  to excuse your   not bringing me money   but if that is the case  you may go to the   devil from whence you came  I ll not be troubled with your company        No  my dear  I never come to you empty handed  let me do as I   will elsewhere    With which words  he pulled out one of the bank    notes he had just got from the other  and giving it to her  put her   at length in good humour      I see your indignation at a man s acting in such a manner   but   j ou could expect no other  The same baseness of temper which   could treat the other woman with insult naturally submitted to b    insulted by this  You imagine that his mistress must have uncom    mon attractions  to give her such power over him  You judge   right â€” her s were uncommon indeed   She had lost her hair   and teeth in a salivation  and was allowed to be the most pro    fligate of her profession â€” charms sufficient to attach a man of his   taste       My master having thus happily made his peace  the loving couple   sat down to their bottle  as usual  over which happening to mention his   intended marriage the next day  her delicacy took such offence  that   she positively refused to consent to it  till he promised not only that   she should be present  but also to return and spend liis wedding night   with her  to prove her triumph over the happy bride  Accordingly    he took her with him the next evening  and introducing her to the   expecting fair one    I have brought my girl    said he    to grace our         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 509     nuptials  The dear creature iasistsd upon it  and you know I   can t refuse her anything    The bride elect was go enraptured   at the thought of her approaching happiness  that she had no sense   of the insult  but received her with politeness  perhaps not without   a mixture of pride  on the occasion      There are some scenes  th   extravagance of which beggars de    scription  I shall  therefore  only say that the behaviour of the   company was in character during the ceremony and entertainment    at the end of which the bridegroom  alleging his promise to go back   â  with his mistress  the convenient bride not only consented   but   also proposed preparing an apartment for her in her own house  to   save him that trouble for the future  and procure for herself the   pleasure of his company â€” a scheme that was actually carried into   execution while she had a house to receive her   which was not very   long  a continuance of the same extravagance that had dissipated   his own fortune  soon dissipating hers also  It may be imagined   that T did not remain
