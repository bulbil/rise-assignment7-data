calling to the girl  I ordered her in all haste to warm the   bed  and I assisted my wife to undress      As soon as she lay down and was somewhat composed  I stepped   to my friend s apartment  I found him leaning on a table with his   eyes downcast  like the figure of discomfort stooping over a monu    ment  What is the matter   I said   what ails my dear Longfield     I hope I have not offended him past forgiveness  Indeed I am   not well  says he  I beseech you to leave me to my own thoughts   till morning  I understand you  Mr  Longfield  I cried   I confess   myself no longer worthy of your friendship  and I shall no more   demand it of you till you condescend to make the tender   and  so   saying  I suddenly quitted his chamber          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  Ill     All night my Arabella was cold and hot by turns  and her sleep   was discomposed by starts and meanings  In the morning I   observed that her breath was short and feverish  and I got up in   haste and went for a physician  As soon as he had written his   prescription  I went eagerly to wish Mr  Longfield a good morning    and to apologize for the abruptness of last night s behaviour   but   Mr  Longfield had taken a long adieu  and this letter was all   that I had left to console me for his loss         To MB  H  CLEMENT       I leave you  dearest of friends  and I leave you for ever    Wretch that I am   to have brought affliction on the only two for   whom I would have lived  for whom I would have died  Heavens    what a fate is mine   I voluntarily depart  and I go where I must   be miserable  since I leave those whose sight and converse made   the whole of my enjoyment  That which doubles my unhappiness   is  partly to suspect that I have been guilty        Your Arabella  my Hammy   I begin to fear that I loved your   Arabella  Alas   I feel that I still love her  and that I must love   her during life       Ah  fond and foolish passion  that could neither hope  nor   wish  nor even accept of any kind of gratification  save the sight   and society of the object of its ardour  No  most amiable of   men  were it possible for your Arabella to stray but in thought   from her truth  from her duty  from her tenderness for you  I could   have loved her no longer        I am jealous for you  my friend I am jealous of myself in your   dearer behalf   and I will amply avenge you on the injurious and   hapless Longfield       Ah  let no man henceforth confide in his own strength  I   daily beheld your Arabella   I daily conversed with  but I saw not   my danger  The gracefulness of her motions  the sound of her   voice  and the loveliness of her aspect  hourly sunk into my soul   with an intoxicating delight   and I wished  and was solicitous to   become pleasing in her eyes  at the time that I would have taken   the life of any man who had attempted to deprive you of your full   right in her affections        My confession reaches the utmost of my faults   but from what   a dream of delight has it suddenly awaked me   Enchanting sen    sations   you are departed for ever   and all the future portion that   you leave me is bitterness        P S  In the drawer of my table  on the left hand  you will find   another paper  carefully sealed and addressed to you  It contains   a poor legacy  though all that could be bequeathed by your de    parted      EDWAKD LONGFIELD       I wept as I read this pathetic epistle  My breast heaved  and I   was agitated by emotions of self reproach  and with a tide of re    turning tenderness to poor Longfield      Ah  unjust though most generous of men   I exclaimed  I alone   am guilty  and thou assumest to thyself a burden that thy virtues         112 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      disclaim  Would to heaven that men and angels might love my   Arabella with a purity like thine
