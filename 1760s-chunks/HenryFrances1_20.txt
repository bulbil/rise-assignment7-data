insupportable Stupidity of Half the World would not have been so irksome to me  for nothing is good or bad  but by Comparison  You will oblige me extremely  if you will send me a Dissertation upon Fools  why there should be such Difference between Men of the same Family  and same Education  as may frequently be observed  and  at the same Time  explain to me the Cause  for Reason there can be none  why Women are generally so fond of them  You must know that a Lady in Queen s Square  whom you sometimes have heard me make whimsical Mention of  has  in one of her Flights  taken a most unfortunate Passion for me  and  as Love is importunate  she has not let me rest an Hour in Peace  since that unlucky Aera  tho  what I suffer from her  is not the worst Part of the Adventure  for the Oddness of her Character is   54 not unentertaining  but she is generally surrounded by a Groupe of miserable young Men  of Wit and Humour about Town   who  by the Way of being sprightly  talk Nonsense by the Hour  then  by Way of Gallantry  cram us into Hacks  and away to —  where I have supped with the same Set  twice this Week  and    Woe is me   To have seen what I have seen  seeing what I see     But  now I think of it  why did you not write last Post  I confess indeed that your sprightly Letter had more fine Things in it  than I should be able to pay you back  in a thousand Years  but  to some the Gods have given Fortitude   c  and  since Writing is not my Talent  I think you would be more unreasonable than the Aegyptian Task masters  if you expected a Return from me  but  to play back the Pertness of your own Expression in one of your Letters    You may be assured that my Heart  at least  keeps equal Time with your s  tho  you may have more Wit  as well as Love at your Fingers Ends   And tho  I cannot pay you off  in your own Coin  you may see by the Length of this Letter  that I make you the only Tender I have in my Power  and  like a compounding Creditor  you must accept of Quantity for Quality       55We have dreadful Weather here  long  tedious  wet Winter days  and short Nights  which hardly give us Time to warm ourselves in Bed  before the Ghost of Phoebus returns  to haunt us with another uncomfortable Day  The Streets are not much above Ancle deep  which is an entertaining Circumstance to those who have no Equis  In short  I am almost ruined with the Expence of Chair hire   I wish you could prevail on yourself to write oftener than once a Week  for  if I am reduced  I vow  I will print your Letters—I think they will keep me in Tea  clean Linnen  and Plays  which  you know  is all my Food  my Apparel  or my Amusement   Adieu  and think often of Your affectionate Pauper   LETTER XXXVII   My dear PAUPER   I RECEIVED your pretty lively Letter  and am now set down to consider of the Question you started in Natural Philosophy  relating to Fools   As Nature is said  to have made nothing in vain  what Apology then for Fools  This Difficulty  which has so long puzzled the Learned    56 I will offer you two Solutions to answer  one by denying  and the other  by admitting the Fact   First then I deny that Nature ever made a Fool  but as she makes any other Monster  not by Design  but thro  some accidental Imperfection in the Organs of Conception  or casual Event  happening afterwards to the Infant in the Cradle   Next  I admit Fools to have been made by Design  and  no Offence to you  shall take the Liberty to offer you this Hypothesis of the Matter   Providence made Man  and  seeing it not good  that Man should be alone  made Woman  then  seeing it not good that Women should be alone  he made a Fool  before which Time  it is said she amused herself with the Devil  From which Time Knaves and Fools have divided the Favours of the Fair   Let me now attempt a Metaphysical Account of this extraordinary Matter  which has so much surprized natural Philosophers  That two Men  who have had the same Education  and  upon Dissection  have been found anatomically the same  have yet so greatly differed in their Understanding  For this  see the Metempsichosis  on Transmigration of Souls  according to Virgil s Account of it  He says  in the sixth Aeneid  that the Souls of those who die  return to this   57 World again to animate other human Bodies  except such as  having compleatly acquitted themselves on Earth  remain in Elysium for ever  Now  since as many  or more  are born  as die  therefore
