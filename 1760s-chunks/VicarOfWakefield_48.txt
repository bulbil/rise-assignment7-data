shrugs  which had been on the  Page  33  stage  and only on the stage  these hundred years  I could never pretend to please  The next difficulty was in fitting me with parts  as almost every character was in keeping  I was driven for some time from one character to another  till at last Horatio was fixed upon  which the presence of the present company happily hindered me from acting      Page   unnumbered   CHAP  II     The short continuance of friendship amongst the vicious  which is coeval only with mutual satisfaction     MY son s account was too long to be delivered at once  the first part of it was begun that night  and he was concluding the rest after dinner the next day  when the appearance of Mr  Thornhill s equipage at the door seemed to make a pause in the general satisfaction  The butler  who was now become my friend in the family  informed me with a whisper  that the  Squire had already made some overtures to Miss Wilmot  and that her aunt and uncle seemed highly to approve the  Page  36  match  Upon Mr  Thornhill s entering  he seemed  at seeing my son and me  to start back  but I readily imputed that to surprize  and not displeasure  However  upon our advancing to salute him  he returned our greeting with the most apparent candour  and after a short time  his presence seemed only to encrease the general good humour     After tea he called me aside  to enquire after my daughter  but upon my informing him that my enquiry was unsuccessful  he seemed greatly surprised  adding  that he had been since frequently at my house  in order to comfort the rest of my family  whom he left perfectly well  He then asked if I had communicated her misfortune to Miss Wilmot  or my son  and upon my replying that I had not told them as yet  he greatly approved my prudence and precaution  desiring me by all means to keep it a secret      For at best    cried he    it is but divulging one s own infamy   Page  37  and perhaps Miss Livy may not be so guilty as we all imagine    We were here interrupted by a servant  who came to ask the  Squire in  to stand up at country dances  so that he left me quite pleased with the interest he seemed to take in my concerns  His addresses  however  to Miss Wilmot  were too obvious to be mistaken  and yet she seemed not perfectly pleased  but bore them rather in compliance to the will of her aunt  than from real inclination  I had even the satisfaction to see her lavish some kind looks upon my unfortunate son  which the other could neither extort by his fortune nor assiduity  Mr  Thornhill s seeming composure  however  not a little surprised me  we had now continued here a week  at the pressing instances of Mr  Arnold  but each day the more tenderness Miss Wilmot shewed my son  Mr  Thornhill s friendship seemed proportionably to encrease for him   Page  38  He had formerly made us the most kind assurances of using his interest to serve the family  but now his generosity was not confined to promises alone  the morning I designed for my departure  Mr  Thornhill came to me with looks of real pleasure to inform me of a piece of service he had done for his friend George  This was nothing less than his having procured him an ensign s commission in one of the regiments that was going to the West Indies  for which he had promised but one hundred pounds  his interest having been sufficient to get an abatement of the other two      As for this trifling piece of service    continued the young gentleman    I desire no other reward but the pleasure of having served my friend  and as for the hundred pound to be paid  if you are unable to raise it yourselves  I will advance it  and you shall repay me at your leisure    This was a favour we wanted words to express our sense of  I readily therefore gave my bond for the money  and testified  Page  39  as much gratitude as if I never intended to pay   George was to depart for town the next day to secure his commission  in pursuance of his generous patron s directions  who judged it highly expedient to use dispatch  lest in the mean time another should step in with more advantageous proposals  The next morning  therefore  our young soldier was early prepared for his departure  and seemed the only person among us that was not affected by it  Neither the fatigues and dangers he was going to encounter  nor the friends and mistress  for Miss Wilmot actually loved him  he was leaving behind  any way damped his spirits  After he had taken leave of the rest of the company  I gave him all I had  my blessing      And now  my boy    cried I    thou
