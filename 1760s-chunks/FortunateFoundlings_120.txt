 and lay close at the bottom of the confessional    They happened to place themselves very near me  and the abbess taking a   letter out of her pocket  bad Clara read it  and tell her the substance   of it as well as she could  I found it was in French  by some words   which she was obliged to repeat over and over  before  not perfectly   understanding the language  she could be able to find a proper   interpretation of  The abbess  who has a little smattering of it   herself  sometimes helped her out  and between them both I soon found it   came from monsieur du Plessis  and contained the most tender and   compassionate complaint of your unkindness in not answering his   letter   that the symptoms he had of approaching death were not half so   severe to him as your refusing him a consolation he stood for much in   need of   that if you found him unworthy of your love  he was certainly   so of your compassion  and concluded with the most earnest entreaty  you   would suffer him to continue no longer in a suspence more cruel than a   thousand deaths could be       Oh heaven  cried Louisa  bursting into tears  how ungrateful must he   think me  and how can I return  as it deserves  so unexampled a   constancy  after such seeming proofs of my infidelity     Cruel  cruel    treacherous abbess  pursued she  Is this the fruits of all your boasted   sanctity   This the return to the confidence the generous du Plessis   reposed in you   This your love and friendship to me   Does heaven  to   increase the number of its votaries  require you to be false    perfidious  and injurious to the world       She was proceeding in giving vent to the anguish of her soul in   exclamations such as these  but Leonora begged she would moderate her   grief  and for her sake  as much as possible  conceal the reasons she   had for resentment  Louisa again promised she would do her utmost to   keep them from thinking she even suspected they had played her   false   then cried  But tell me  my dear Leonora  were they not a little   moved at the tender melancholy which  I perceive  ran thro  this   epistle  Alas  my dear  replied the other  they have long since forgot   those soft emotions which make us simpathize in the woes of   love   inflexible by the rigid rules of this place  and more by their   own age  they rather looked with horror than pity on a tender   inclination   they had a long conversation together  the result of which   was to spare nothing that might either persuade  or if that failed    compel you to take the order       It is not in their power to do the latter  interrupted Louisa  and this   discovery of their baseness  more than ever  confirms me in the   resolution never to consent       You know not what is in their power  said Leonora  they may make   pretences for confining you here  which  as they are under no   jurisdiction but the church  the church will allow justifiable   indeed    Louisa  continued she  I should be loth to see you have recourse to   force to get out of their hands which would only occasion you ill   treatment   to whom  alas  can you complain   you are a stranger in this   country  without any one friend to espouse your cause   were even Du   Plessis here in person  I know not  as they have taken it into their   heads to keep you here  if all he could urge  either to the pope or   confessory  would have any weight to oblige them to relinquish you  A   convent is the securest prison in the world  and whenever any one comes   into it  who by any particular endowment promises to be an ornament to   the order  cannot  without great difficulty  disentangle themselves from   the snares laid for them   It is for this reason I have feared for you   ever since your entrance  for tho  I should rejoice in so agreeable a   companion  I know too well the miseries of an enforced attachment to   wish you to be partaker of it       Louisa found too much reason in what she said  to doubt the misery of   her condition   she knew the great power of the church in all these   countries where the roman catholic religion is established  more   especially in those places under the papal jurisdiction  and saw no way   to avoid what was now more terrible to her than ever  Those reflections
