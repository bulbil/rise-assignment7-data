  others that such a man dwells within      But  sir  says Harry  since  as you say and as I find  I have two   different boys or souls within me  pray  how came they to be   different  did the same God that desired to make the one soul   good  desire also to make the other soul evil      Your question  my darling  is very proper  though very deep  I   will however endeavour  to the best of my power  to accommodate   my answers to the weakness of your capacity      God  who is nothing but goodness  cannot possibly desire any   kind of evil  and therefore cannot be  immediately  the author   thereof  But he can make or create such poor little insignificant   beings as you and I are  Harry   though all that God himself can   do in our behalf cannot possibly make us good  or excellent  or   perfect  any otherwise than by informing us with his own goodness   and perfections      This would lead me  my love  to the unfolding that capital secret   of which you are not yet susceptible   a secret upon which this   world  sun  moon  and stars  with all the worlds upon worlds that   lie beyond them  depend and hang  as your hat would hang upon   yonder nail      The angels that are now in heaven are great  good  perfect  and   glorious beings   because they are filled with the greatness  good    ness  glory  and perfection of God  For they know that of them    selves they are nothing   and that in themselves they are no other   than empty and dark creatures  mere sensible capacities prepared   for the reception  the feeling  and enjoyment of the light  virtue    and blessedness of their bountiful Creator      How the spirit of man came to be  in itself  so much worse than               THE FOOL OF QUALITY  169     an empty and dark creature   how it came to be filled and polluted   with all manner of evil  with selfishness  pride  covetousness    abominable lusts  envy  hatred  malice  revengefulness  and wrath    fulness   how it further came to have a different spirit begotten   within it  informing its heart and turning the chords thereof to   sentiments of humility  charity  purity  love  patience  and peace   this  Harry  is the great secret  of which you are not yet capable     the secret  as I told you  whereon the world now hangs  whereby   it has been changed  and whereby it will be renewed      In the meantime  let it suffice for you to feel and to know  that   your dark spirit  so filled as I said with evil  is yourself  my Harry   is all that you have of the creature within you   and that the   good spirit  which is begotten within your evil spirit  is breathed   into you by the power and spirit of God himself  in order to   oppose and conquer the evil  and enlighten the darkness  and   purify the foulness of your selfish or creaturely spirit  that you   may finally become as the angels that are in heaven  filled with   the purity  glory  and blessedness of your God      Know therefore from henceforward  and let the sense of it sink   into your soul  my darling  that all the evil which is in you belongs   to yourself  and that all the good which is in you belongs to your   God   that you cannot  in or of yourself  so much as think a good   thought  or form a good wish  or oppose a single temptation or evil   motion within you  From hence learn to be humble  and to think   meanly of yourself  and not ascribe to yourself any kind of goodness   or virtue  for that would be sacrilege   it would be to rob God of his   peculiar property of goodness  From hence further learn  never to   prefer yourself to others  or to think better of yourself than of any   one living   for  so far as you are a creature  no one can be viler or   faultier than you are  however God may be pleased  through his   mercy and bounty to you  to be better in you than in others      Never exalt yourself  my Harry  neither in company nor conversa    tion of any kind say  I did this or I did that  or  I said this  or I   said that
