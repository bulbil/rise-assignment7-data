at a few leagues distance from this town  and sometimes coming hither to pass my time with my friend the governor  whom you both of you must know perfectly well   On this cue I related to them the story of Don Alphonso de Leyva  They heard the particulars with attention  and on my telling them that I had carried to Samuel Simon  on the part of that nobleman  the three thousand ducats of which we had robbed him  Lamela interrupted the thread of my narrative  and addressing his discourse to Raphael  said  Father Hilary  if this be true  the honest vendor of wares has no reason to quarrel with a robbery which has paid him fifty per cent  and our consciences  as far as that indictment goes  may bask in the sunshine of acquitted innocence  Brother Ambrose and I  said the bursar  did actually  on the assumption of the habit  send Samuel Simon fifteen hundred ducats privately  by a pious ecclesiastic who made a pilgrimage to Xelva for the sole purpose of accomplishing this restitution  but it will go hard with Samuel at the general reckoning  if he for filthy lucre could soil his fingers with that sum  after having been reimbursed in full by Signor de Santillane  But  said I  how do you know that your fifteen hundred ducats were faithfully paid into his hands  Unquestionably they were  exclaimed Don Raphael  I would answer for the disinterested purity of that ecclesiastic as soon as for my own  I would be your collateral security  said Lamela  he is a priest of the strictest sanctity  a sort of universal almoner  and though many times cited for sums of money  deposited with him for charitable uses  he has always nonsuited the plaintiff and gone out of court with an augmentation of alms giving notoriety   Our conversation continued for some time longer  at length we parted  with many a pious exhortation on their side  always to have the fear of the Lord before my eyes  and with many an earnest intreaty on mine  that they would remember me constantly in their prayers  Don Alphonso was now the first object of my search  You will never guess  said I  with whom I have just had a long conference  I am but now come from two venerable Carthusians of your acquaintance  the name of the one is father Hilary  that of the other  brother Ambrose  You are mistaken  answered Don Alphonso  I am not acquainted with a single Carthusian  Pardon me  replied I  you have seen brother Ambrose at Xelva in the capacity of commissary  and father Hilary as register to the Inquisition  Oh heaven  exclaimed the governor with surprise  can it be within the bounds of possibility that Raphael and Lamela should have turned Carthusians  It is even so  answered I  they professed several years ago  The former is bursar and proctor to the convent  the latter  porter   The son of Don Caesar rubbed his forehead twice or thrice  then shaking his bead  These worshipful officers of the Inquisition  said he  most assuredly purpose playing over the old farce on a new stage here  You judge of them by prejudice  answered I  from the impression of their characters as men of sin  but had you been edified by their lectures as I have been  you would think more favourably of their holiness  To be sure  it is not for mortal men to fathom the depth of other men s hearts  but to all appearance they are two prodigals returned home  It possibly may be so  replied Don Alphonso  there are many instances of libertines  who hide their heads in cloisters  after having scandalized human nature by their obliquities  to expiate their offences by a severe penance  I heartily wish that our two monks may be such libertines restored   Well  and why not  said I  They have embraced the monastic life of their own accord  and have squared their conduct for a length of time according to the maxims of their order  You may say what you please  retorted the governor  but I do not like the convent s rents being received by this father Hilary  of whom I cannot help entertaining a very untoward opinion  When the fine story he told us of his adventures comes across my mind  I tremble for the reverend brotherhood  I am willing to believe with you  that he has taken the vow with the pious intention of keeping it  but the blaze of gold may be too much for the weakness of his regenerated eye sight  It is bad policy to lock up a reformed drunkard in a wine cellar   In the course of a few days Don Alphonso s misgivings were fully justified  these two official props and stays of the establishment ran away with the year s revenue  This news  which was immediately noised about the town  could not do otherwise than set the tongues of the wits in motion  for they always make themselves merry at the crosses and losses of the well endowed religious orders  As for the governor and myself  we condoled with the Carthusians  but kept our acquaintance with the apostate pilferers in the background       CH  VII     Gil Blas returns to his seat at
