 But my spirits were not high  I courtesied to his compliment  and was silent   Sir Charles presented Emily to him —My Emily  Beauchamp  I hope to live to see her happily married  The man whose heart is but half so worthy as hers  must be an excellent man   Modesty might look up  and be sensible to compliments from the lips of such a man  Emily looked at me with pleasure  as if she had said  Do you hear  madam  what a fine thing my guardian has said of me   Sir Charles asked Mr  Beauchamp  how he stood with my Lady Beauchamp   Very well  answered he  After such an introduction as you had given me to her  I must have been to blame  had I not  She is my father s wife  I must respect her  were she ever so unkind to me  She is not without good qualities  Were every family so happy as to have Sir Charles Grandison for a mediator when misunderstandings happened  there would be very few   125 lasting differences among relations  My father and mother tell me  that they never sit down to table together  but they bless you  And to me they have talked of nobody else  But Lady Beauchamp depends upon your promise of making her acquainted with the Ladies of your family   My sisters  and their Lords  will do honour to my promise in my absence  Lady L  Lady G  let me recommend to you Lady Beauchamp as more than a common visiting acquaintance  Do you  Sir  to Mr  Beauchamp  see it cultivated   Mr  Beauchamp is an agreeable  and  when Sir Charles Grandison is not in company  handsome and genteel man  I think  my dear  that I do but the same justice that every body would do  in this exception  He is chearful  lively  yet modest  and not too full of words  One sees both love and respect in every look he casts upon his friend  and that he is delighted when he hears him speak  be the subject what it will  He once said to Lord W  who praised his nephew to him  as he does to every body near him  The universal voice  my Lord  is in his favour where ever he goes  Every one joins almost in the same words  in different countries  allowing for the different languages  that for sweetness of manners  and manly dignity  he hardly ever had his equal   Sir Charles was then engaged in talk with his Emily  she before him  he standing in an easy genteel attitude  leaning against the wainscot  listening  smiling  to her prattle  with looks of indulgent love  as a father might do to a child he was fond of  while she looked back every now and then towards me  so proud  poor dear  of being singled out by her guardian   She tript to me afterwards  and leaning over my shoulder  as I sat  whispered—I have been begging of my guardian to use his interest with you  madam  to take me down with you to Northamptonshire     126 And what is the result —She paused —Has he denied your request —No  madam—Has he allowed you to go  my dear  if I comply  turning half round to her with pleasure   She paused  and seemed at a loss  I repeated my question   Why  no  he has not consented neither—But he said such charming things  so obliging  so kind  both of you  and of me  that I forgot my question  tho  it was so near my heart  But I will ask him again   And thus  Lucy  can he decline complying  and yet send away a requester so much delighted with him  as to forget what her request was   Miss Grandison—Lady G  I would say—singled me out soon after—This Beauchamp is really a very pretty fellow  Harriet   He is an agreeable man  answered I   So I think  She said no more of him at that time   Between dinner and tea  at Lady L  s motion  they made me play on the harpsichord  and after one lesson  they besought Sir Charles to sing to my playing  He would not  he said  deny any request that was made him on that day   He sung  He has a mellow manly voice  and great command of it   This introduced a little concert  Mr  Beauchamp took the violin  Lord L  the bass viol  Lord G  the German flute  Lord W  sung base  Lady L  Lady G  and the Earl  joined in the chorus  The song was from Alexander s Feast  The words    Happy  happy  happy pair   None but the good deserves the fair   Sir Charles  tho  himself equally brave and good  preserring the latter word to the former     Lady L  had always insisted upon dancing at her sister s wedding  We were not company enough for country dances  But music having been order d  and   127 the performers come  it
