unlucky illness  and your brother’s ill timed assiduity in going so often to him when he was at Richmond  looks as if we had been endeavouring to recall him  Every body knows the marriage was almost concluded  and Lady Grimston  though she thinks our reasons for breaking it off were extremely cogent  yet as she knows the world well  thinks it has not virtue enough to believe those to be the true reasons  and that it will be much more apt to put an invidious construction on the affair  that may be very detrimental to you in your future prospects  These considerations alone ought to determine you  but there is one still of greater moment  which I hope  from the goodness of your heart  will have still greater weight with you  That unfortunate young lady  who ought to be the wife of Mr Faulkland  if you were once put beyond the reach even of his most distant hope  would stand the better chance for having justice done to her  at least it would leave him void of that pretence which he at first pleaded  and which probably he will continue to do  while you remain single  Think seriously of the matter  my love  I shall only add  that Mr Arnold is every way an unexceptionable match  and that your acceptance of him will be extremely agreeable to me  as  on the contrary  your refusal will give an uneasiness to your indulgent mother  which she never yet experienced from you   She left me with these cruel words  cruel in their kindness—Oh  she knows I am flexible by nature  and to her will  yielding as air  What can I do  My heart is not in a disposition to love—Yet again and again I repeat it  Mr Faulkland has no interest there  What he once had he has lost  but I cannot compel it to like  and unlike  and    like anew at pleasure  Fain would I bring myself chearfully to conform to my mother’s will  for I have no will of my own  I never knew what it was to have one  and never shall  I believe  for I am sure I will not contend with a husband   I have told Mrs Vere what my mother said to me  she is intirely of her mind  every body is combined against me  I am treated like a baby  that knows not what is fit for it to chuse or to reject   September 15  I have been searching my heart  my dear Cecilia  to try if there remained a lurking particle of my former flame unextinguished  a flame I call it  as we are allowed the metaphor  but it never rose to that  it was but a single ray  a gentle glow that just warmed my breast without scorching  what it might have arisen to I will not say  but I have the satisfaction to find  that the short lived fire is quite extinct  and the mansion is even chilled with cold   This was a very necessary scrutiny  before I would even entertain a thought of Mr Arnold  and believe me  had I found it otherwise than I say  I would rather have hazarded my mother’s displeasure by owning the truth to her  than injure any man  by giving him my hand with an estranged heart   I will acknowlege to you  my sister  that it was not without a struggle I reduced my mind to this frame  My heart  foolish thing  industrious to perplex itself  would fain have suggested some palliating circumstances in Mr Faulkland’s favour  but I forbid it to interpose  Trifler  said I  let your guardian  your proper guide  judge and determine for you in this important cause  whereupon so much of your future peace depends  It sighed  but had the virtue to submit  and I arraigned Faulkland before a little tribunal in my breast  where I would suffer reason only to preside  The little felon  love  knocked at the door once or twice  but justice kept him out  and after a long  and I think a fair  trial  he was at length cast  and in order to strengthen my resolves  and justify my mother’s  as well as my own conduct  these are the arguments which I have deduced from the evidences against him   If Mr Faulkland feared the frailty of his virtue  why did he not fly when he was first alarmed with the knowlege of the lady’s passion for him  If not for his own sake  yet at least for her’s  If he could not return her love  was he not cruel in suffering her to feed a hopeless flame  But since his evil fate urged him on  and the unhappy girl lost    her honour  was he not bound to repair it  He had never seen me at that time  was under no personal engagements to me  and might easily have acquitted himself to my brother  from so justifiable a motive   What if I had married him  ignorant of this secret  and it had afterwards come to my ears  how miserable would it have made me  to think that I had stood between an unfortunate young creature and her happiness  For had Mr Faulkland never heard
