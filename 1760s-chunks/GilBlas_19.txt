the routine of business on these occasions  We were fools enough to believe that the torture would be the very first stage of our examination  With this dread upon our spirits  we all made for the door  Some effected their escape into the street  others into the garden  but the whole party preferred the discretion of running away to the valour of standing their ground  The young tradesman of Astorga had as great an objection to bone twisting as the rest of us  so he did as Eneas  and many another good husband has done before him     ran away and left his wife behind  At that critical moment the muleteer  as I was told afterwards  who had not half so much sense of decency as his own mules  delighted at the success of his stratagem  began moving his motives to the citizen s wife  but this Lucrece of the Asturias  borrowing the chastity of a saint from the ugliness of the devil who tempted her  defended her sweet person tooth and nail  and showed she was in earnest about it by the noise she made  The patrol  who happened to be passing by the inn at the time  and knew that the neighbourhood required a little looking after  took the liberty of just asking the cause of the disturbance  The landlord  who was trying if he could not sing in the kitchen louder than she could scream in the parlour  and swore he heard no music but his own  was at last obliged to introduce the myrmidons of the police to the distressed lady  just in time to rescue her from the necessity of a surrender at discretion  The head officer  a coarse fellow  without an atom of feeling for the tender passion  no sooner saw the game that was playing  than he gave the amorous muleteer five or six blows with the butt end of his halberd  representing to him the indecency of his conduct in terms quite as offensive to modesty as the naughty propensity which had called forth his virtuous indignation  Neither did he stop here  but laid hold of the culprit  and carried plaintiff and defendant before the magistrate  The former  with her charms all heightened by the discomposure of her dress  went eagerly to try their effect in obtaining justice for the outrage they had sustained  His Worship heard at least one party  and after solemn deliberation pronounced the offence to be of a most heinous nature  He ordered him to be stripped  and to receive a competent number of lashes in his presence  The conclusion of the sentence was  that if the Endymion of our Asturian Diana was not forthcoming the next day  a couple of guards should escort the disconsolate goddess to the town of Astorga  at the expense of this mule driving Acteon   For my part  being probably more terrified than the rest of the party  I got into the fields  scampering over hedge and ditch  through enclosures and across commons  till I found myself hard by a forest  I was just going for concealment to ensconce myself in the very heart of the thicket  when two men on horseback rode across me  crying  Who goes there  As my alarm prevented me from giving them an immediate answer  they came to close quarters  and holding each of them a pistol to my throat  required me to give an account of myself  who I was  whence I came  what business I had in that forest  and above all  not to tell a lie about it  Their rough interrogatives were  according to my notion  little better than the rack with which our friend the muleteer had offered to treat us  I represented myself however as a young man on my way from Oviedo to Salamanca  told the story of our late fright  and faithfully attributed my running away in such a hurry to the dread of a worse exercise under the torture  They burst into an immoderate fit of laughter at my simplicity  and one of them said  Take heart  my little friend  come along with us  and do not be afraid  we will put you in a place where the devil shall not find you  At these words  he took me up behind him  and we darted into the forest   I did not know what to think of this odd meeting  yet on the whole I could not well be worse off than before  If these gentry  thought I to myself  had been thieves  they would have robbed  and perhaps murdered me  Depend on it  they are a couple of good honest country gentlemen in this neighbourhood  who  seeing me frightened  have taken compassion on me  and mean to carry me home with them and make me comfortable  But these visions did not last long  After turning and winding backward and forward in deep silence  we found ourselves at the foot of a hill  where we dismounted  This is our abode  said one of these sequestered gentlemen  I looked about in all directions  but the deuce a bit of either house or cottage  not a vestige of human habitation  The two men in the mean time raised a great wooden trap  covered with earth and briars  to conceal the entrance of a long shelving passage under ground  to which
