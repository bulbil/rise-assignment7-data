Gawkey  that before I yielded her the least assistance  she should do me the justice to clear my reputation  by explaining upon oath before a Magistrate  the whole of the conspiracy  as it had been executed against me —When she had given me this satisfaction  I presented her with   180 five guineas  a sum so much above her expectation  that she could scarce believe the evidence of her senses  and was ready to worship me for my benevolence —The declaration signed with her own hand  I sent to her father  who  upon recollecting and comparing the circumstances of my charge  was convinced of my integrity  and waited on me next day  in company with his friend the schoolmaster  to whom he had communicated my vindication —After mutual salutation  Monsieur Lavement began a long apology for the unjust treatment I had received  but I saved him a good deal of breath  by interrupting his harrangue  and assuring him  that so far from entertaining any resentment against him  I thought myself obliged to his lenity  which allowed me to escape  after such strong presumptions of guilt appeared against me  Mr  Concordance thinking it now his turn to speak  observed  that Mr  Random had too much candour and sagacity to be disobliged at their conduct  which  all things considered  could not have been otherwise  with any honesty of intention     Indeed  said he  if the plot had been unravelled to us by any supernatural intelligence  if it had been whispered by a genie  communicated by a dream  or revealed by an angel from on high  we should have been to blame in crediting ocular demonstration —but as we were left in the mist of mortality  it cannot be expected we should be incapable of imposition —I do assure you  Mr  Random  no man on earth is more pleased than I am at this triumph of your character  and as the news of your misfortune panged me to the very intrails  this   181 manifestation of your innocence makes my midrif quiver with joy  —  I thanked him for his concern  desired them to undeceive those of their acquaintance who judged harshly of me  and having treated them with a glass of wine  represented to Lavement the deplorable condition of his daughter  and pleaded her cause so effectually  that he consented to settle a small annuity on her for life  but could not be persuaded to take her home  because her mother was so much incensed that she would never see her     CHAP  LIII    I purchase new cloaths—reprimand Strutwell and Straddle—Banter proposes another matrimonial scheme—I accept of his terms—set out for Bath in a stagecoach  with the young lady and her mother—the behaviour of an officer and lawyer  our fellow travellers  described—a smart dialogue between my mistress and the captain   HAVING finished this affair to my satisfaction  I found myself perfectly at ease  and looking upon the gaming table as a certain resource for a gentleman in want  became more gay than ever —Although my cloaths were almost as good as new  I grew ashamed of wearing them  because I thought every body  by this time  had   182 got an inventory of my wardrobe —For which reason  I disposed of a good part of my apparel to a salesman in Monmouth street  for half the value  and bought two new suits with the money  I likewise purchased a plain gold watch  despairing of recovering that which I had so foolishly given to Strutwell  whom  notwithstanding  I still continued to visit at his levée  until the embassador he had mentioned  set out with a secretary of his own chusing —I thought myself then at liberty to expostulate with his lordship  whom I treated with great freedom in a letter  for amusing me with vain hopes  when he neither had the power nor inclination to provide for me —Nor was I less reserved with Straddle  whom I in person reproached for misrepresenting to me the character of Strutwell  which I did not scruple to aver was infamous in every respect —He seemed very much enraged at my freedom  talked a great deal about his quality and honour  and began to make some comparisons which I thought so injurious to mine  that I demanded an explanation with great warmth  and he was mean enough to equivocate  and condescend in such a manner  that I left him with a hearty contempt of his behaviour   About this time  Banter  who had observed a surprizing and sudden alteration in my appearance and disposition  began to enquire very minutely into the cause  and as I did not think fit to let him know the true state of the affair  lest he might make free with my purse  on the strength of having proposed the scheme that filled it  I told him that I had received a small supply from a relation in the country  who at the same time had promised to use all his interest  which was not   183 small  in solliciting some post for me that would make me easy for life —   If that be the case  said Banter  perhaps you won t care to mortify yourself a little  in making your fortune another way —I have a relation who is to set out for Bath next week  with
