an hour came to an anchor before the castle of Bocca Chica  with a spring upon our cable —The cannonading  which indeed was terrible   began  The surgeon  after having crossed himself  fell flat on the deck  and the chaplain and purser  who were stationed with us  in quality of assistants  followed his example  while the Welchman and I sat upon a chest looking at one another with great discomposure  scarce able to refrain   284 from the like prostration —And that the reader may know  it was not a common occasion that alarmed us thus  I must inform him of the particulars of this dreadful din that astonished us  The fire of the Spaniards proceeded from Bocca Chica mounting eighty four great guns  beside a mortar and small arms  from fort St  Joseph  mounting thirty six  from two faschine batteries  mounting twenty  and from four men of war  mounting sixty four guns each —This was answered by us  from our land battery  mounting twenty one cannon  our bomb battery  mounting two mortars  and twenty four cohorns  and five men of war  two of eighty  and three of seventy guns  which fired without intermission —We had not been many minutes engaged  when one of the sailors brought another on his back to the cockpit  where he tossed him down like a bag of oats  and pulling out his pouch  put a large chew of tobacco in his mouth  without speaking a word  Morgan immediately examined the condition of the wounded man  and cried     As I shall answer now  the man is as tead as my greatgrandfather  —   Dead  said his comrade  he may be dead now  for ought I know  but I ll be d—mn d if he was not alive when I took him up  —  So saying  he was about to return to his quarters  when I bid him carry the body along with him and throw it over board —   D—n the body   said he  I think  tis fair enough if I take care of my own  —  My fellow mate snatching up the amputation knife  pursued him half way up the cockpit ladder  crying    You lousy rascal  is this the church yard  or the charnel house  or the sepulchre  or the Golgotha of the ship  —  but was stopt in his   285 carreer by one calling    Yo ho  avast there—scaldings  —   Scaldings   answered Morgan  Got knows  tis hot enough indeed —who are you  —   Here s one  replied the voice     and I immediately knew it to be that of my honest friend Jack Rattlin  who coming towards me  told me  with great deliberation  he was come to be dock d at last  and discovered the remains of one hand which had been shattered to pieces with grape shot —I lamented with unfeigned sorrow his misfortune  which he bore with heroic courage  observing  that every shot had its commission  It was well it did not take him in the head  or if it had  what then  he should have died bravely  fighting for his king and country  Death was a debt which every man owed  and must pay now as well as another time —I was much pleased and edified with the maxims of this sea philosopher  who endured the amputation of his left hand without shrinking  the operation being performed  at his request  by me  after Mackshane  who was with difficulty prevailed to lift his head from the deck  had declared there was a necessity for his losing the limb —While I was employed in dressing the stump  I asked Jack s opinion of the battle  who shaking his head  frankly told me  he believed we should do no good    For why  because instead of dropping anchor close under shore  where we should have had to deal with one corner of Bocca Chica only  we had opened the harbour  and exposed ourselves to the whole fire of the enemy from their shipping and fort St  Joseph  as well as from the castle we intended to canonade  that besides  we lay at too great a distance to damage the walls  and three parts in four of our shot did not take place  for   286 there was scarce any body on board  who understood the pointing of a gun —Ah  God help us   continued he  if your kinsman lieutenant Bowling had been here  we should have had other guess work  —  By this time our patients had increased to such a degree  that we did not know which to begin with  and the first mate plainly told the surgeon  that if he did not get up immediately  and perform his duty  he would complain of his behaviour to the admiral  and make application for his warrant —This effectually roused Mackshane  who was never eaf to an argument in which he thought his interest was concerned  he therefore rose up  and in order to strengthen his resolution  had recourse more than once to a case bottle of rum which he freely communicated to the chaplain and purser  who had as much need of such extraordinary inspiration
