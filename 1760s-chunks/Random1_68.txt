 that I became a dupe to his deceit  and in an evil hour crowned his eager desire with full possession —Cursed be the day on which I gave away my innocence and peace  for a momentary gratification which has entailed upon me such misery and horror  cursed be my beauty that first attracted the attention of the seducer  cursed be my education  that by refining my sentiments  made my heart the more susceptible  cursed be my good sense that fixed me to one object  and taught me the preference I enjoyed was but my due  Had I been ugly  no body would have tempted me  had I been ignorant  the charms of my person would not have atoned for the coarseness of my conversation  had I been giddy  my vanity would have divided my inclinations  and my ideas would have been so diffused  that I should never have listened to the enchantments of one alone     But to return to my unfortunate story  we gave a loose to guilty pleasure  which for some months banished every other concern —But by degrees  his visits became less frequent  and his behaviour less warm  I perceived his coldness  my heart took the alarm  my tears reproached him  and I insisted upon the performance of his promise to espouse me  that whatever should happen  my reputation might be safe  He seemed to acquiesce in my proposal  and lest me on pretence   191 of finding a proper clergyman to unite us in the bands of wedlock —But alas  the Inconstant had no intention to return  I waited a whole week with the utmost impatience  sometimes doubting his honour  at other times inventing excuses for him  and condemning myself for harbouring the least suspicion of his faith —At length  I understood from a gentleman who dined at our house  that this perfidious wretch was on the point of setting out for London with his bride  to buy cloaths for their approaching nuptials —This information distracted me  the more so  as I found myself some months gone with child  and reflected  that it would be impossible to conceal my disgrace  which would not only ruin the character I had acquired in the country  but also bring the grey hairs of an indulgent parent with sorrow to the grave  Rage took possession of my soul  I denounced a thousand imprecations  and formed as many schemes of revenge against the traitor who had undone me  then my resentment would subside to silent sorrow  I recalled the tranquility I had lost  I wept over my infatuation  and sometimes a ray of hope would intervene  and for a moment cheer my drooping heart  I would revolve all the favourable circumstances of his character  repeat the vows he made  ascribe his absence to the vigilance of a suspicious father  who compelled him to a match his soul abhorred  and comfort myself with the expectation of seeing him before the thing should be brought to any terms of agreement —But how vain was my imagination  The villain left me without remorse  and in a few days the news of his marriage spread all over the country —My horror was then inconceivable    192 and had not the desire of revenge diverted the resolution  I should infallibly have put an end to my miserable life —My father observed the symptoms of my despair  and though I have good reason to believe  he guessed the cause  was at a great deal of pains to seem ignorant of my affliction  while he endeavoured with paternal fondness to alleviate my distress  I saw his concern  which increased my anguish  and raised my fury against the author of my calamity  to an implacable degree  Having furnished myself with a little money  I made an elopement from this unhappy parent in the night time  and about break of day  arrived at a small town from whence a stage coach set out for London  in which I embarked  and next day alighted in town  the spirit of revenge having supported me all the way against every other reflection —My first care was to hire a lodging  in which I kept myself very retired  having assumed a feigned name  that my character and situation might be the better concealed —It was not long before I found out the house of my ravisher  whither I immediately repaired in a transport of rage  determined to act some desperate deed for the satisfaction of my despair  though the hurry of my spirits would not permit me to concert or resolve upon a particular plan  When I demanded admission to Lothario  so let me call him  I was desired to send up my name and business  but this I refused  telling the porter I had business for his master s private ear  Upon which I was conducted into a parlour until he should be informed of my request —There I remained about a quarter of an hour  when a servant entered and told me his master was engaged with company  and begged to be   193 excused at that time —My temper could hold out no longer  I pulled a poignard from my bosom where I had concealed it  and rushing out  flew up stairs like a fury  exclaiming     Where is this perfidious villain  could I once plunge this dagger into his false heart  I would then die satisfied  —
