affection  that she thought so highly of my heart  as to believe I could not hate a woman who esteemed me  and who solicited my friendship  though a happy rival        I was touched  even to tears  at her behaviour  we embraced  and  if I know my own weak foolish heart  I love her       She talks of leaving Quebec before Rivers s return  she said  her coming was an imprudence which only love could excuse  and that she had no motive for her journey but the desire of seeing him  which was so lively as to hurry her into an indiscretion of which she was afraid the world took but too much notice  What openness  what sincerity  what generosity  was there in all she said       How superior  my dear  is her character to mine  I blush for myself on the comparison  I am shocked to see how much she soars above me  how is it possible Rivers should not have preferred her to me  Yet this is the woman I fancied incapable of any passion but vanity       I am sure  my dear Bell  I am not naturally envious of the merit of others  but my excess of love for Rivers makes me apprehensive of every woman who can possibly rival me in his tenderness       I was hurt at Madame Des Roches s uncommon merit  I saw with pain the amiable qualities of her mind  I could scarce even allow her person to be pleasing  but this injustice is not that of my natural temper  but of love       She is certainly right  my dear  to see him no more  I applaud  I admire her resolution  do you think  however  she would pursue it if she loved as I do  she has perhaps loved before  and her heart has lost something of its native trembling sensibility        I wish my heart felt her merit as strongly as my reason  I esteem  I admire  I even love her at present  but I am convinced Rivers s return while she continues here would weaken these sentiments of affection  the least appearance of preference  even for a moment  would make me relapse into my former weakness  I adore  I idolize her character  but I cannot sincerely wish to cultivate her friendship       Let me see you this afternoon at Quebec  I am told the roads will not be passable for carrioles above three days longer  let me therefore see you as often as I can before we are absolutely shut from each other       Adieu  my dear   Your faithful  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CXXIII   123   To the Earl of —   Silleri  April 14   ENGLAND  however populous  is undoubtedly  my Lord  too small to afford very large supplies of people to her colonies  and her people are also too useful  and of too much value  to be suffered to emigrate  if they can be prevented  whilst there is sufficient employment for them at home       It is not only our interest to have colonies  they are not only necessary to our commerce  and our greatest and surest sources of wealth  but our very being as a powerful commercial nation depends on them  it is therefore an object of all others most worthy our attention  that they should be as flourishing and populous as possible       It is however equally our interest to support them at as little expence of our own inhabitants as possible  I therefore look on the acquisition of such a number of subjects as we found in Canada  to be a much superior advantage to that of gaining ten times the immense tract of land ceded to us  if uncultivated and destitute of inhabitants       But it is not only contrary to our interest to spare many of our own people as settlers in America  it must also be considered  that  if we could spare them  the English are the worst settlers on new lands in the universe       Their attachment to their native country  especially amongst the lower ranks of people  is so very strong  that few of the honest and industrious can be prevailed on to leave it  those therefore who go  are generally the dissolute and the idle  who are of no use any where       The English are also  though industrious  active  and enterprizing  ill fitted to bear the hardships  and submit to the wants  which inevitably attend an infant settlement even on the most fruitful lands       The Germans  on the contrary  with the same useful qualities  have a patience  a perseverance  an abstinence  which peculiarly fit them for the cultivation of new countries  too great encouragement therefore cannot be given to them to settle in our colonies  they make better settlers than our own people  and at the same time their numbers are an acquisition of real strength where they fix  without weakening the mother country       It is long since the populousness of Europe has been the cause of her sending out colonies  a better policy prevails  mankind are enlightened  we are now convinced  both by reason and experience  that no
