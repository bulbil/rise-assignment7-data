 and unwilling to be seen by Melanthe in the present confusion   of her thoughts  she went to bed  leaving the same orders as she had   done the night before             CHAP  XIV        The base designs of the count de Bellfleur occasion a melancholy change   in Louisa s way of life  the generous behaviour of monsieur du Plessis   on that occasion        Had the agonies Louisa suffered been of very long continuance  she must   have sunk under them  but grief is easily dissipated in a young heart    and she awoke more tranquil   The principles of religion grew stronger   as her passion weaker  and she reflected that she ought to submit in   every thing to the will of heaven  which sometimes converts what seems   the greatest evil into good   The offer of such a match as monsieur du   Plessis  a man she loved  and who was master of accomplishments which   might excuse the most violent passion  appeared indeed a happiness she   would have gloried in had she been really such as he took her for  but   then she had known him but a very short time  had no experience of his   principles or humour  and tho  he seemed all honour  could not assure   herself that the generosity which so much engaged her might not be all   artifice  at least she found to think so would most contribute to her   ease  therefore indulged it as much as she was able  She condemned   herself for having given monsieur du Plessis permission to continue his   visits  after having assured him he had nothing to hope from them    because a further conversation might only serve to render both more   unhappy  She resolved however to give him no opportunity of talking to   her of his passion  and in order to avoid thinking of it herself as much   as possible  to go  as usual  into all company that came to Melanthe    and partake of every diversion that offered itself       Accordingly she forced herself to a gaiety  she was far from feeling    vainly imagining that by counterfeiting a chearfulness  she should in   time be able to resume it  but du Plessis hung too heavy at her heart    and when she affected the greatest shew of mirth  it was often   interrupted with sighs  which she was not always sensible of herself  He   visited her almost every day under one pretence or other  but she took   such care never to be alone at the times that she could possibly expect   him  that he had not the least opportunity to renew his addresses  any   otherways than by his looks  which  notwithstanding  were perfectly   intelligible to her  tho  she seemed not to observe them       Melanthe  no longer able to keep the secret of her amour  finding   Louisa  as she thought  had entirely regained her former sprightliness    acquainted her with all had passed between herself and count de   Bellfleur  which  tho  the other was no stranger to  she seemed   astonished at  and could not help telling her  that she feared the   consequence of an intrigue of that nature would one day be fatal to her   peace  Yet  said Melanthe  where one loves  and is beloved  it is hard   to deny oneself a certain happiness for the dread of an imaginary   ill   In fine  my dear Louisa  I found I could not live without him  and   heaven will sure excuse the error of an inclination which is born with   us  and which not all our reason is of force to conquer   But  added   she  you always seem to speak of the count  as of a man that wanted   charms to excuse the tenderness I have for him  and  I have observed    deny him those praises which I have heard you bestow very freely on   persons that have not half his merit       Louisa knowing how vain it was to contest with inclination  in persons   who are resolved to indulge it  and also that all advice was now too   late  began to repent of what she said  If  madam  replied she  after a   little pause  I have seemed unjust to the count s perfections  it was   only because I feared you were but too sensible of them  for otherwise    it must be owned  he has a person and behaviour extremely engaging  but   as the carnival will put an end to all the acquaintance we have   contracted here  it gives me pain to think how you will support a   separation       Perhaps it may not happen so soon as you imagine  said Melanthe   tho
