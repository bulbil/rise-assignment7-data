in Horace     GENT  HABERDASHER   Not Horace—that s a fine hum  indeed  not Horace  what the Devil  sure I know Horace a little better than you  I thought I should find you out—why  doesn t he go on  and say     Hoc ades huc Amino  concupedictis tuo   Page  179  Up then he started  looked in the peer glass  and stroked his eye brows gently     The lady  at that instant  standing with her back to him  told me —Sir  this gentleman is a prodigious scholar  and you must submit to him in these things  I assure you  But I could see  that she winked at me while she said this  I would have taken the hint  but flesh and Blood could not bear to give up Horoce to Qui mihi  Emboldened by the lady s signal  I told him  that perhaps  as gentlemen were not obliged to read so much as authors were  his memory might not be—    GENT  HABERDASHER   O dam it  Sir  as to that  I have a better memory than any man in England  and those two lines I spoke are Horace s  and I ll bet you 50 l  on t  and out he pulled a green purse  seemingly full of money  which  in his eagerness  he let fall upon the tea table  and broke a cup and saucer  belonging to a set of French china  that had been presented to the lady by a former lover  and which set she told the gentleman  she would not have had destroyed for 500 pounds     A strange scene of altercation ensued  reproaches rose high between them—until the gallant  swore several of the most horrid oaths  profaneness could put together  that he never would speak to her again  and hurried out of the room  bouncing the door after him  as violently  as if  like Sampson  he would shake the house down about us     Page  180  After the passionate departure of her friend  the lady addressed herself to me—but in a manner  different from that she received me with     Affectation was away—the haughtiness of the actress was banished  and only the fine woman of affability appeared     Desiring me to sit down  with a look  that spoke the most delicate sensibility  the lady told me—I believe  Sir  I am not the only person in this room  whom the hot headed man  that has just left it  made uneasy this morning  for if I guess right  your face told me  you understood every thing he said to me in French about you     AUTHOR   Indeed  madam  I understood every syllable     LADY   I thought so  by heavens  I thought so  I admire your behaviour  Sir  and will endeavour to recompence you  for the pain of mind I am conscious you must have endured  too much I feel of that myself  what are all diamonds  equipage  fine furniture  and elegance of dress  when the mind  retreating into itself  shrinks back ashamed to reflect on the means by which those are purchased  Yet I must act the hypocrite  I must conform—conform to those I hate  nay worse—bear with rich stupidity  applaud with seeming attention  arrogant dulness  and flatter  even fondly flatter  indelicate folly  Sure of all slavery  mine is the worst  where the will is not left free  what is—    Page  181  Thus she gave vent to her reflections  as she walked up and down the room  tears following one another  down the damask of her cheeks  transparent as dew drops  upon the rose leaf     At that moment  her lover  the gentleman haberdasher returned  and discovering her crying  run to her  took her in his arms  forced her to the settee  and kneeling down before her  begged her to forgive him  desiring her to accept of a ring he held out to her  and vowing  that had he known his leaving her so abruptly  would have so deeply affected her  he would not have done it for all the world     The lady s face at this time seemed agitated with astonishment  and disdain  by turns  but I had not an opportunity any longer to observe it  Her friend addressing me that instant  with  you ll excuse us this morning Mr  Writer  I shall be glad to see you some other time     Exit  Cannon   The DEDICATORY SPECIMEN     Assured of my play being presented  I sought some time for a proper person to dedicate it to  one from whom I could expect the greatest advantages  one  who could do me great service  if I did but properly apply myself  and blazon forth his merits to the WORLD     I had a sufficient quantity of matter by me which I had abstracted from the Greek  Roman  and French panegyricks  and also from the works of most of our best writers  upon
