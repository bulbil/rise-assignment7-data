up  and accordingly  sent them round  while Pallet tucked the table cloth under his chin   and brandished his knife and fork with singular address  but scarce were  they set down before him  when the tears ran down his cheeks  and he  called aloud  in a manifest disorder   Zounds  this is the essence of a  whole bed of garlic   That he might not  however  disappoint or disgrace  the entertainer  he applied his instruments to one of the birds  and  when he opened up the cavity  was assaulted by such an irruption of  intolerable smells  that  without staying to disengage himself from the  cloth  he sprang away  with an exclamation of  Lord Jesus   and involved  the whole table in havoc  ruin  and confusion   Before Pickle could accomplish his escape  he was sauced with the syrup  of the dormouse pie  which went to pieces in the general wreck  and as  for the Italian count  he was overwhelmed by the sow s stomach  which   bursting in the fall  discharged its contents upon his leg and thigh   and scalded him so miserably  that he shrieked with anguish  and grinned    6 22 15  3 45 PM   with a most ghastly and horrible aspect   The baron  who sat secure without the vortex of this tumult  was not at  all displeased at seeing his companions involved in such a calamity as  that which he had already shared  but the doctor was confounded with  shame and vexation  After having prescribed an application of oil to  the count s leg  he expressed his sorrow for the misadventure  which he  openly ascribed to want of taste and prudence in the painter  who did  not think proper to return  and make an apology in person  and protested  that there was nothing in the fowls which could give offence to a  sensible nose  the stuffing being a mixture of pepper  lovage  and  assafoetida  and the sauce consisting of wine and herring pickle  which  he had used instead of the celebrated garum of the Romans  that famous  pickle having been prepared sometimes of the scombri  which were a  sort of tunny fish  and sometimes of the silurus  or shad fish  nay  he  observed that there was a third kind  called garum haemation  made of  the guts  gills  and blood of the thynnus   The physician  finding it would be impracticable to re establish the  order of the banquet  by presenting again the dishes which had been  discomposed  ordered everything to be removed  a clean cloth to be laid   and the dessert to be brought in  Meanwhile  he regretted his incapacity  to give them a specimen of the aliens  or fish meals of the ancients   such as the jus diabaton  the conger eel  which  in Galen s opinion  is  hard of digestion  the cornuta  or gurnard  described by Pliny in his  Natural History  who says  the horns of many of them were a foot and  a half in length  the mullet and lamprey  that were in the highest  estimation of old  of which last Julius Caesar borrowed six thousand for  one triumphal supper  He observed that the manner of dressing them was  described by Horace  in the account he gives of the entertainment to  which Maecenas was invited by the epicure Nasidienus     Affertur squillas inter muraena natantes  etc   and told them that they were commonly eaten with the thus Syriacum   a certain anodyne and astringent seed  which qualified the purgative  nature of the fish  This learned physician gave them to understand  that  though this was reckoned a luxurious fish in the zenith of the Roman  taste  it was by no means comparable  in point of expense  to some  preparations in vogue about the time of that absurd voluptuary  Heliogabalus  who ordered the brains of six hundred ostriches to be  compounded in one illness   By this time the dessert appeared  and the company were not a little  rejoiced to see plain olives in salt and water  butt what the master of  the feast valued himself upon  was a sort of jelly  which he affirmed  to be preferable to the hypotrimma of Hesychius  being a mixture of  vinegar  pickle  and honey  boiled to proper consistence  and candied  assafoetida  which he asserted  in contradiction to Aumelbergius and  Lister  was no other than the laser Syriacum  so precious  as to be sold  among the ancients to the weight of a silver penny  The gentlemen took  his word for the excellency of this gum  but contented themselves with  the olives  which gave such an agreeable relish to the wine  that they  seemed very well disposed to console themselves for the disgraces they  had endured  and Pickle  unwilling to lose the least circumstance of  entertainment that could be enjoyed in their company  went in quest of  the painter  who remained in his penitentials in another apartment  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM
