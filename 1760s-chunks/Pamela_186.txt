be not virtuous    O  said they all  with one voice almost  Dear sir  shall we not see the   good old man you have so praised for his plain good sense  and honest   heart  If  said he  I thought Pamela would not be too much affected with   the surprise  I would make you all witness to their first interview  for   never did daughter love a father  or a father a daughter  as they two do   one another  Miss Darnford  and all the ladies  and the gentlemen too    begged it might be so  But was not this very cruel  my dear mother  For   well might they think I should not support myself in such an agreeable   surprise       He said  kindly  I have but one fear  that the dear girl may be too much   affected  O  said Lady Darnford  we ll all help to keep up her spirits    Says he  I ll go up  and prepare her  but won t tell her of it  So he   came up to me  as I have said  and amused me about Mr  Williams  to half   prepare me for some surprise  though that could not have been any thing   to this  and he left me  as I said  in that suspense  at his mystical   words  saying  He would send to me  when they were going to cards       My master went from me to my father  and asked if he had eaten any   thing  No  said Mrs  Jewkes  the good man s heart is so full  he cannot   eat  nor do any thing  till he has seen his dear daughter  That shall   soon be  said my master  I will have you come in with me  for she is   going to sit down with my guests  to a game at quadrille  and I will   send for her down  O  sir  said my father  don t  don t let me  I am not   fit to appear before your guests  let me see my daughter by myself    I beseech you  Said he  They all know your honest character  Goodman   Andrews  and long to see you  for Pamela s sake       So he took my father by the hand  and led him in  against his will  to   the company  They were all very good  My master kindly said  Ladies and   gentlemen  I present to you one of the honestest men in England  my good   Pamela s father  Mr  Peters went to him  and took him by the hand  and   said  We are all glad to see you  sir  you are the happiest man in the   world in a daughter  whom we never saw before to day  but cannot enough   admire       Said my master  This gentleman  Goodman Andrews  is the minister of the   parish  but is not young enough for Mr  Williams  This airy expression    my poor father said  made him fear  for a moment  that all was a   jest   Sir Simon also took him by the hand  and said  Ay  you have a   sweet daughter  Honesty  we are all in love with her  And the ladies   came  and said very fine things  Lady Darnford particularly  That he   might think himself the happiest man in England  in such a daughter  If    and please you  madam  said he  she be but virtuous   tis all in all    For all the rest is accident  But I doubt his honour has been too much   upon the jest with me  No  said Mrs  Peters  we are all witnesses  that   he intends very honourably by her   It is some comfort  said he  and   wiped his eyes  that such good ladies say so  But I wish I could see   her       They would have had him sit down by them  but he would only sit behind   the door  in the corner of the room  so that one could not soon see him   as one came in  because the door opened against him  and hid him almost    The ladies all sat down  and my master said  Desire Mrs  Jewkes to step   up  and tell Mrs  Andrews the ladies wait for her  So down I came       Miss Darnford rose  and met me at the door  and said  Well  Miss   Andrews  we longed for your company  I did not see my dear father  and   it seems his heart was too full to speak  and he got up  and sat down   three or four
