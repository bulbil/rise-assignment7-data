houses have already commenced hostilities  War  open war  and no quarter received or given  Two singing women  like heralds  have begun the contest  the whole town is divided on this solemn occasion  one has the finest pipe  the other the finest manner  one curtesies to the ground  the other salutes the audience with a smile  one comes on with modesty which asks  the other with boldness which extorts applause  one wears powder  the other has none  one has the longest waist  but the other appears most easy  all  all is important and serious  the town as yet perseveres in its neutrality  a cause of such moment demands the most mature deliberation  they continue to exhibit  and it is very possible this contest may continue to please to the end of the season   But the Generals of either army  have  as I am told  several reinforcements to lend occasional assistance  If they produce a pair of diamond buckles at one house  we have a pair of eye brows   61 that can match them at the other  If we outdo them in our attitude  they can overcome us by a shrug  if we can bring more children on the stage  they can bring more guards in red cloaths  who strut and shoulder their swords to the astonishment of every spectator   They tell me here  that people frequent the theatre in order to be instructed as well as amused  I smile to hear the assertion  If I ever go to one of their play houses  what with trumpets  hallowing behind the stage  and bawling upon it  I am quite dizzy before the performance is over  If I enter the house with any sentiments in my head  I am sure to have none going away  the whole mind being filled with a dead march  a funeral procession  a cat call  a jigg  or a tempest   There is perhaps nothing more easy than to write properly for the English theatre  I am amazed that none are apprenticed to the trade  The author  when well acquainted with the value of thunder and lightning  when versed in all the mystery of scene shifting  and trap doors  when skilled in the proper periods to introduce a wire walker  or a water fall  when instructed in every actor s peculiar talent  and capable of adapting his speeches to the supposed excellence  when thus instructed  knows all that can give a modern audience pleasure  One player shines in an exclamation  another in a groan  a third in a horror  a fourth in a start  a fifth in a smile  a sixth faints  and a seventh figets round the stage with peculiar vivacity  that piece therefore will succeed best where each has a proper opportunity of shining  the actor s business is not so much to adapt   62 himself to the poet  as the poet s to adapt himself to the actor   The great secret therefore of tragedy writing at present  is a perfect acquaintance with theatrical ah s and oh s  a certain number of these interspersed with gods  tortures  racks  and damnation  shall distort every actor almost into convulsions  and draw tears from every spectator  a proper use of these will infallibly fill the whole house with applause  But above all  a whining scene must strike most forcibly  I would advise from my present knowledge of the audience  the two favourite players of the town to introduce a scene of this sort in every play  Towards the middle of the last act  I would have them enter with wild looks and out spread arms  there is no necessity for speaking  they are only to groan at each other  they must vary the tones of exclamation and despair through the whole theatrical gamut  wring their figures into every shape of distress  and when their calamities have drawn a proper quantity of tears from the sympathetic spectators  they may go off in dumb solemnity at different doors clasping their hands  or slapping their pocket holes  this  which may be called a tragic pantomime  will answer every purpose of moving the passions  as well as words could have done  and it must save those expences which go to reward an author   All modern plays that would keep the audience alive  must be conceived in this manner  and indeed  many a modern play is made up on no other plan  This is the merit that lifts up the heart  like opium  into a rapture of insensibility  and can dismiss the mind from all the fatigue of thinking  this is the eloquence that shines in many   63 a long forgotten scene  which has been reckoned excessive fine upon acting  this the lightening that flashes no less in the Hyperbolical tyrant  who breakfasts on the wind  than in little Norval  as harmless as the babe unborn  Adieu   LETTER LXXVII  From the same   I HAVE always regarded the spirit of mercy  which appears in the Chinese laws with admiration  An order for the execution of a criminal is carried from court by slow journies of six miles a day  but a pardon is sent down with the most rapid dispatch  If five sons of the same father be guilty of the same offence  one of
