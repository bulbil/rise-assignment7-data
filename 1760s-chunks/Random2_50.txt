for that purpose  which is put in execution with great success—I make an attempt on the heart of Miss Gripewell  but an disappointed—I grow melancholy at my disappointment  and have recourse to the Bottle—receive a billet doux—am ravished with the contents—find myself involved in an intrigue  which I imagined would make my fortune—am confounded at my mistake  which banishes all thoughts of matrimony   IN the mean time  my attention was wholly engrossed in search of another mistress  and the desire of being revenged on Melinda  in both which schemes I was very much assisted by Billy Chatter  who was such a necessary creature among the ladies  that in all private dances he engaged the men —To him therefore I applied  desiring he would introduce me to a partner of some figure  at the next private assembly  for the sake of a frolick  the intention of which I would afterwards communicate  Billy  who had heard something of a difference between Melinda and me  immediately smoaked part of my design  and thinking I only wanted to alarm her jealousy a little  promised to gratify my desire  by matching me   144 with a partner worth thirty thousand pounds  whom the ladies of this end of the town  had lately taken into their management and protection —Upon further inquiry  I found this person s name was Miss Biddy Gripewell  that her father  who had been a pawnbroker  died intestate  by which means all his substance descended to this daughter  who was so little a favourite  that could the old man have prevailed with his own rapacious disposition  to part with as much money as would have paid the expence of a will  she would not have inherited the sixth part of his fortune —that during his life  so far from being educated in a way suitable to such great expectations  she was obliged to live like a servant wench  and do the most menial offices in the family —But his funeral was no sooner performed  than she assumed the fine lady  and found so many people of both sexes  to flatter  caress and instruct her  that  for want of discretion and experience  she was grown insufferably vain and arrogant  and pretended to no less than a duke or earl at least  for her husband —that she had the misfortune to be neglected by the English quality  but a certain poor Scottish Lord was then making interest to be introduced to her acquaintance —In the mean time  she was fallen into the hands of a notable lady  who had already disposed of her to a lieutenant of foot  a distant relation of her ladyship s  though Miss  as yet  knew nothing of the affair  and lastly  that if I proposed to dance with her  I must give him leave to represent me as a knight or foreign count at least —I was ravished at this piece of information  and contented  for one night  to personate a French Marquis  that I might the easier fulfil my revenge     145 Having made the appointment with Chatter  I went to Banter s lodgings  having by this time conceived a great opinion of his penetration and knowledge  and after I had injoined secrecy  told him every circumstance of my disgrace with Melinda  and imparted the plan I had projected to mortify that proud coquette  desiring his advice in improving  and assistance in executing the scheme —Nothing could be more agreeable to his misanthropical temper  than an account of her behaviour and my resentment  He applauded my resolution  and proposed that I should not only provide myself in a proper partner  but also procure such an one for Miss Goosetrap  as would infallibly intail upon her the ridicule of all her acquaintance  For this purpose he mentioned his barber  who  he said  was an exceeding coxcomb  lately come from Paris  whose absurd affectation and grimace would easily pass upon her  for the sprightly politesse of a gentleman improved by travel —I hugged him for this hint  and he assured me  it would be no difficult matter to make him believe  that Melinda having seen him by accident  was captivated by his appearance  and longed for his acquaintance —He actually engaged him on this pretence  and painted his good fortune in such colours  that the poor shaver was quite beside himself with joy —He was immediately fitted with a tawdry suit of cloaths belonging to Banter  and by him recommended to Chatter  as a very pretty fellow  just returned from his travels —Master Billy  who acted as gentleman usher to a great many of the fair sex in and about town undertook  at once  to bespeak Melinda in his behalf  and every thing happened according to my wish     146 At the time appointed  I appeared  dressed to the best advantage  and in the character of Marquis  had the honour of opening the ball with the rich heiress  who attracted the eyes of the whole company  by the prodigious number of jewels with which she was adorned —Among others  I perceived Melinda  who could no more conceal her envy than astonishment at my success  Her curiosity was still more flagrant and tormenting  for she had never seen Miss Gripewell before  and Chatter  who alone could give her any satisfaction on that head  was engaged in conversation at the other end of
