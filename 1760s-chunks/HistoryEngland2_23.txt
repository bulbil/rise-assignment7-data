who expected the immediate coming of Christ upon earth  appeared in the streets of London in arms  at the head of threescore enthusiasts like himself  and declared against any other Monarch but King Jesus  They had been wrought into such a pitch of phrenzy as to believe themselves invulnerable  and fought as men confident of victory  The few survivors of their defeat were taken  tried  condemned  and executed  they affirmed to the last  that  if they had been deceived  the Lord himself concurred in the imposture   It was now feared that the tide of loyalty would bear down all the sormer mounds of freedom  the parliament seemed to concur in all the designs of the court  and even to anticipate its wishes  but  though the King was established  his old faithful friends  and the followers of his family  were left unrewarded  There were numbers who had fought for his father  and for him  and had lost their all in his service  still pining in want and misery  while their persecutors    60 who  prefiting by the troubles of their country  had acquired fortunes during the civil war  were still permitted to enjoy them without molestation  The sufferers petitioned in vain  Charles was no way remarkable for gratitude  his pleasures  his flatterers  and concubines engrossed all his attention  and exhausted his finances  the unhappy Cavaliers murmured without redress  he fled from their gloomy expostulations to scenes of mirth  riot  and festivity   The kingdom now seemed to be converted into a theatre of debauchery  which had before been a scene of blood  The Independants were no longer to be seen  the Puritans were restrained  the horrors of the late war were the subject of ridicule  the formality and the ignorance of sectaries were displayed upon the stage  and even laughed at in the pulpit  The King had no religion  and  though he permitted the persecution of sectaries  it was merely from political motives  The late miseries of the nation were not sufficient to deter a few desperate fanaties from attempting to excite them afresh  they laid a scheme for surprising several towns in the North  and raising a general insurrection  the ministry discovered the plot  before it was ripe for execution  thirty of the conspirators were taken and executed  and this plot was a pretext for continuing the parliament then sitting  and repealing the act for triennial parliaments  as being dangerous in times of commotion   The English parliament seemed willing to make the King reparation for their former disobedience  and the Scotch were still more sanguine in the expressions of their attachment  Had Charles been an active Monarch  he might have now become an absolute one  They confirmed the doctrine of passive obedience by a solemn act  they assigned him a revenue of twelve hundred thousand pounds  exclusive of the expence necessary for sitting and supplying   61 the fleet  None of his predecessors were ever possessed of such a large revenue  nevertheless  his prodigality rendered him indigent  and  instead of desiring an ascendancy over his parliament  he was content to be an humble and continual dependant on their bounty   His prodigality  his libertinism  and the familiarity with which he permitted himself to be treated by his subjects  soon began to alter their sentiments from a veneration for royalty to a contempt of his person and administration  He declared war against Holland  merely to have an opportunity of spending upon his pleasures  a part of those sums granted him by parliament for the support of a fleet and army  This war was carried on with doubtful success  but the alarm which the nation received from Ruyter the Dutch Admiral s attempting to sail up the river Thames  still more disgusted them against their governor  Immediate dangers  though small  influence the mind with greater force than distant  though terrible calamities  They now called to mind the administration of Cromwell  when the people enjoyed security at home  and were respected abroad  they recollected that vigorous Usurper s labours for the good of the nation  and compared them with those of the present effeminate and unsuccessful reign   Natural and accidental calamities seemed to unite themselves to those brought on by bad management  A plague ravaged the city  which swept away more than one hundred thousand of its inhabitants  and soon after the city was almost entirely destroyed by a conflagration  which raged for three days without intermission  The spirit of the people soon surmounted these calamities  London soon rose more beautiful from its ashes  the streets were built anew more spacious and convenient than before  and their distress soon became their advantage     62 But neither war  nor accident  nor the murmurs of the people could abate the passion for gallantry  pleasure  and expence  that reigned through the court through the King s example  He had imbibed all that spirit of levity  during his residence in France  for which that kingdom is remarkable  Though he had been married soon after his restoration to the Infanta of Portugal  he kept several mistresses  by whom he had natural issue  Among this number were madamoiselle Queroüaille  a French woman  whom he created Duchess of Portsmouth  Mrs  Palmer  whom he made a Countess  and Nel Gwyn and Mrs  Davis  actresses taken
