reject such a man  Were I a woman  I should run mad for him  Well  I will go to him  and let him know without any farther demurs you will give him your hand to morrow morning  Our honest friend Price I think may join you  I will call on him  after I have seen Faulkland  to bid him prepare for the business  I will myself have the pleasure of giving you away  Good by—and away he went with a pleased busy countenance   I took up my pen as soon as he departed  and have scribbled thus far without suffering any reflections to stop me  Let me now lay down my pen  to pause before I leap into the frightful precipice that opens before me     To morrow  Ah  my Cecilia  what is that morrow to produce  it joins me for ever to Mr Faulkland  the chosen    of my heart  my first love  the man who adores me  who deserves all my affection  who has obliged me beyond all recompence  Who has a claim to my warmest gratitude  to my esteem  to my whole heart  I save his life  I have the power to make him happy  my brother  my kinsman urge me  my own heart too prompts me  Why cannot I then reconcile myself to my lot  Oh that question is answered by a fearful image that starts up to my fancy—I am not superstitious  yet believe me  my dear  I am at this instant chilled with horror   I am ashamed to confess my weakness  but I must call Patty to sit with me the remainder of the night  I cannot think of rest   Wednesday Morning  I have passed the whole night in endeavouring to fortify my mind against the important event that a few hours will accomplish  If Mr Faulkland’s mind should again become tranquil  which my kinsman gave me room to hope would be the consequence of gratifying the ardent wish of his soul  I must take care not to disturb it by shewing any reluctance in yielding him my hand  Had an Angel once told me that I should give my hand reluctantly to Mr Faulkland  I would not have believed it  yet fatally circumstanced as our marriage now is  it cannot be otherwise   And yet I ought to be his  I owe him a great sacrifice  and I am about to pay it  I am dressed and ready  I wait for my kinsman or my brother  one of whom  or both perhaps  will be here presently     Mr Warner is come  I have but just time to tell you that my brother and Mr Price are with Mr Faulkland  My kinsman says he is quite a new man  They wait for me  I go  Heaven guide my steps      Thursday  My fate is accomplished  What a change  Join with me  my dear Cecilia  in beseeching heaven to look graciously down on me in my new state  and to guide and protect my beloved Mr Faulkland  my ever destined husband  Alas  my dear  he is now many miles separated from me   The worthy Mr Price performed the sacred ceremony  Mr Warner did the office of a father  He and my brother were all who were present   There is something so amazing in all this  I can scarce credit my senses  but my life has been a series of strange  strange events   I am so bewildered  I cannot connect my thoughts  but I will try to give you my yesterday’s vision  for I can hardly persuade myself that what I recollect really happened     I broke off just as Mr Warner called on me  to carry me to the house of my brother’s friend   While we were in the coach  he told me  that having the night before informed Mr Faulkland of the joyful news of my consenting to marry him the next day  he seemed at first to doubt  and repeatedly conjured him not to deceive him  ’till having received the most solemn assurances of its being true  Mr Faulkland gave himself up to such ecstacies as made them apprehensive his joy might have effects almost as fatal in their consequences  as his despair was likely to produce before   Mr Warner had a mind to lower him a little  and thought  by putting him in mind of his danger  somewhat to allay his transports   Mrs Arnold’s consent to make you happy  said he  fills me with extreme joy  but it is not now a time to indulge it  you are here in peril of your life  you must preserve it now for Mrs Arnold’s sake  For Mrs Arnold’s sake  he replied  with ecstasy  yes  yes  ’tis now worth preserving  Mr Warner  Kinsman  Friend of my life   grasping his hand  dispose of me as you please  you shall guide all my steps  Will not Mrs Arnold go with me after we are made one   If  after having considered what may be urged to you on that head  you should still continue to desire it  replied my cousin  she will without doubt accompany you  But  my dear Sir
