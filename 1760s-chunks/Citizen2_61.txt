could not avoid being pleased to see all ranks of people on this occasion  levelled into an equality  and the poor  in some measure  enjoying the primitive privileges of nature  If there was any distinction shewn  the lowest of the people seemed to receive it from the rich  I could perceive a cobler with a levee at his door  and an haberdasher giving audience from behind his counter  But my reflections were soon interrupted by a mob  who demanded whether I was for the Distillery  or the Brewery  as these were terms with which I was totally unacquainted  I chose at first to be silent  however  I know not what might have been the consequence of my reserve  had not the attention of the mob been called off to a skirmish between a brandy drinker s cow  and a gin drinker s mastiff  which turned out  greatly to the satisfaction of the mob  in favour of the mastiff   This spectacle  which afforded high entertainment  was at last ended by the appearance of one of the candidates  who came to harangue the mob  he made a very pathetic speech upon the late excessive importation of foreign drams  and the downfall of the distillery  I could see some of the audience shed tears  He was accompanied in his procession by Mrs  Deputy and Mrs  Mayoress  Mrs  Deputy was not in the least in liquor  and for Mrs  Mayoress  one of the spectators assured me in my ear that  — She was a very fine woman before she had the small pox   Mixing with the croud  I was now conducted to the hall where the magistrates are chosen  but what tongue can describe this scene of confusion  the whole crowd seemed equally inspired with anger    190 jealousy  politics  patriotism and punch  I remarked one figure that was carried up by two men upon this occasion  I at first began to pity his infirmities as natural  but soon found the fellow so drunk that he could not stand  another made his appearance to give his vote  but though he could stand  he actually lost the use of his tongue  and remained silent  a third  who though excessively drunk could both stand and speak  being asked the Candidate s name for whom he voted  could be prevailed upon to make no other answer  but Tobacco and Brandy  In short  an election hall seems to be a theatre where every passion is seen without disguise  a school where fools may readily become worse  and where philosophers may gather wisdom  Adieu   LETTER CX  From the same   THE disputes among the learned here are now carried on in a much more compendious manner than formerly  There was a time when folio was brought to oppose folio  and a champion was often listed for life under the banners of a single sorites  At present  the controversy is decided in a summary way  an epigram or an acrostic finishes the debate  and the combatant  like the incursive Tartar  advances  and retires with a single blow   An important literary debate at present engrosses the attention of the town  It is carried on with   191 sharpness  and a proper share of this epigrammatical fury  An author  it seems has taken an aversion to the faces of several players  and has written verses to prove his dislike  the players fall upon the author  and assure the town he must be dull  and their faces must be good  because he wants a dinner  a critic comes to the poet s assistance  asserting  that the verses were perfectly original  and so smart that he could never have written them without the assistance of friends  the friends upon this arraign the critic  and plainly prove the verses to be all the author s own  So at it they are all four together by the ears  the friends at the critic  the critic at the players  the players at the author  and the author at the players again  It is impossible to determine how this many sided contest will end  or which party to adhere to  The town  without siding with any  views the combat in suspense  like the fabled hero of antiquity  who beheld the earth born brothers give and receive mutual wounds  and fall by indiscriminate destruction   This is in some measure a state of the present dispute  but the combatants here differ in one respect from the champions of the fable  Every new wound only gives vigour for another blow  though they appear to strike  they are in fact mutually swelling themselves into consideration  and thus advertising each other away into fame  Today says one  my name shall be in the Gazette  the next day my rival s  people will naturally enquire about us  thus we shall at least make a noise in the streets  though we have got nothing to sell  I have read of a dispute of a similar nature  which was managed here about twenty years ago  Hildebrand   192 Jacob  as I think he was called  and Charles Johnson were poets  both at that time possessed of great reputation  for Johnson had written eleven plays acted with great success  and Jacob  though he had written but five  had five
