 who accompanied him to the street door   where he was met by Peregrine on his return to the assembly   This choleric gentleman  who was a country squire  no sooner saw his  rival  than he began to brandish his cudgel in a menacing posture  when  our adventurous youth  stepping back with one foot  laid his hand upon  the hilt of his sword  which he drew half way out of the scabbard  This  attitude  and the sight of the blade which glistened by moonlight in his  face  checked  in some sort  the ardour of his assailant  who desired  he would lay aside his toaster  and take a bout with him at equal arms   Peregrine  who was an expert cudgel player  accepted the invitation   then  exchanging weapons with Pipes  who stood behind him  put himself  in a posture of defence  and received the attack of his adversary  who  struck at random  without either skill or economy  Pickle could have  beaten the cudgel out of his hand at the first blow  but as in that  case he would have been obliged in honour to give immediate quarter  he  resolved to discipline his antagonist without endeavouring to disable  him  until he should be heartily satisfied with the vengeance he had  taken  With this view be returned the salute  and raised such a clatter  about the squire s pate  that one who had heard without seeing the  application  would have taken the sound for that of a salt box  in the  hand of a dexterous merry andrew  belonging to one of the booths at  Bartholomew fair  Neither was this salutation confined to his head  his  shoulders  arms  thighs  ankles  and ribs  were visited with amazing  rapidity  while Tom Pipes sounded the charge through his fist   Peregrine  tired with his exercise  which had almost bereft his enemy of  sensation  at last struck the decisive blow  in consequence of which the  squire s weapon flew out of his grasp  and he allowed our hero to be  the better man  Satisfied with this acknowledgment  the victor walked  upstairs with such elevation of spirits and insolence of mien  that  nobody chose to intimate the resolution  which had been taken in his  absence  there  having amused himself for some time in beholding the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   country dances  he retreated to his lodging  where he indulged himself  all night in the contemplation of his own success   Next day in the forenoon he went to visit his partner  and the  gentleman  at whose house she lived  having been informed of his family  and condition  received him with great courtesy  as the acquaintance of  his cousin Gauntlet  and invited him to dinner that same day  Emilia was  remarkably well pleased  when she understood the issue of his adventure   which began to make some noise in town even though it deprived her of  a wealthy admirer  The squire  having consulted an attorney about the  nature of the dispute  in hopes of being able to prosecute Peregrine  for an assault  found little encouragement to go to law  he therefore  resolved to pocket the insult and injury he had undergone  and to  discontinue his addresses to her who was the cause of both   Our lover being told by his mistress that she proposed to stay a  fortnight longer in Windsor  he determined to enjoy her company all that  time  and then to give her a convoy to the house of her mother  whom he  longed to see  In consequence of this plan  he every day contrived some  fresh party of pleasure for the ladies  to whom he had by this time free  access  and entangled himself so much in the snares of love  that he  seemed quite enchanted by Emilia s charms  which were now indeed almost  irresistible  While he thus heedlessly roved in the flowery paths of  pleasure  his governor at Oxford alarmed at the unusual duration of  his absence  went to the young gentlemen who had accompanied him in his  excursion  and very earnestly entreated them to tell him  what they  knew concerning his pupil  they accordingly gave him an account of the  reencounter that happened between Peregrine and Miss Emily Gauntlet in  the castle  and mentioned circumstances sufficient to convince him that  his charge was very dangerously engaged   Far from having an authority over Peregrine  Mr  Jolter durst not even  disoblige him  therefore  instead of writing to the commodore  he took  horse immediately  and that same night reached Windsor  where he found  his stray sheep very much surprised at his unexpected arrival  The  governor desiring to have some serious conversation with him  they  shut themselves up in an apartment  when Jolter  with great solemnity   communicated the cause of his journey  which was no other than his  concern for his pupil s welfare  and very gravely undertook to prove   by mathematical demonstration  that this intrigue  if further pursued   would tend to the young gentleman s ruin and
