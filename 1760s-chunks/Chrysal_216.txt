an influence   on  that we can work them to whatever we please  and have already   poisoned their minds with prejudices against England        To provide officers of approved fidelity and experience to com    mand our forces is the next object of our care  Shall I candidly   own to you that such a length of time and multiplicity of affairs   had almost obliterated all my remembrance of my family   but the   moment I heard your name mentioned  with the respect due to your   merits in the present war  a flood of infant fondness melted my   heart  and tears of tenderest joy acknowledged that I had a brother       In January  1762  Great Britain declared war against Spain  the step   being rendered inevitable by the secret Spanish alliance with France    A month or two later  Spain invaded Portugal  whose king was our   ally          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 246     I immediately gave notice to our general  and by his order am   empowered to treat thua with you        On my engagement for your fidelity  for your abilities are known   to be far superior to any that shall oppose you  I am commissioned   to offer you the supreme command of all our forces in this great   imdertaking  With what joy I make this offer  the pleasure that   you would feel in serving your brother can best enable you to   judge        Though I will tell you further that mine is raised higher than   common feelings can convey a notion of  I have hitherto only un    folded the general design of our order  in which I am but a party    though a principal and material one  But shall I tell you also that   my designs terminate not with their s   as your command will make   you master of all their forces  and  as power is the consequence of   that  you will be able to confer it where you please  or  indeed    rather to retain it in your own hands  while I shall only ease you of   the trouble of conducting and establishing the policy of an infant   state  This was my motive for writing to you so pressingly to   come to me to Vienna  This is the end which I have been labouring   for all my life  I am advanced in years  and shall never marry to   beget an heir   you are young  and will have many  Assist me    therefore  to acquire our throne which must descend to your posterity   â€” a throne which  by holding it at first as under the sovereignty of   the order  will soon be established by them  even beyond their own   power to shake        I have now unbosomed myself to my brother with all the con    fidence of so near an alliance  You will  perhaps  wonder at my   openness with one whom I have not seen since he was a child    But I know your character in life  and  above all  I know myself   safe from being betrayed  because the information would not be   received  Considei   therefore  whether you will embrace this offer    whether you will reign in a splendour that will dazzle the eyes of   the greatest prince in Europe  or live here in slavery and depend    ence  The alternative will not admit a moment s hesitation   I   see you yield  I will acquaint our general with it  You and your   wife shall remain here with me  till the proper time for our departure   comes  which will depend on circumstances not yet settled  In the   meantime  we shall have an opportunity of conferring on these   subjects together  and preparing all things for our undertaking in   a manner that shall ensure success        Though my master made no reply to this proposal that testified   the least disapprobation of it  I could easily see that many parts of   the scheme affected him with the strongest abhorrence  at the same   time  that the offer of royalty was a temptation which shook his   resolution  and almost vanquished his virtue  His brother saw the   conflict in his heart with pleasure   had he yielded readily  and   without reluctance  he should have withdrawn his confidence from   such a depravity of soul  and the struggle convinced him that he   was his own  and he knew that man  as well as the woman  who   deliberates between virtue and vice  is lost          246 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XXVII     THE JESUIT PEOOBEDS TO SHOW THE RISE OF THE WAB IN
