double Love  altho  he should own to all the world  as he says he will     See  see  Mrs  Beaumont  these are his very words    his affection for Clementina  and glory in it      O Mrs  Beaumont  how my Soul  putting her hand to her forehead  then to her heart  loves his Soul  nor but for one obstacle  that would have shaken my Faith  and endangered my Salvation  had I got over it  should his Soul only have been the object of my Love   Let me but continue single  my dear friends  indulge me in the wish that has been so long next my heart  and take not advantage of the hopes I have given   236 you in writing  and I shall pass happily through this short life  a life that deserves not the bustle which we make about it  Ask me not either to    set or follow the example you propose to me    I cannot  cannot  do either  Unkind Chevalier  why  why  would you strengthen their hands  and weaken mine —Yet  if it became your justice  what had I but justice to expect from a just man  who has so eminently performed all his own duties  and particularly the filial  which he here calls an article of Religion     When she came to the concluding part of this Letter  and your wishes for her perfect recovery  health and welfare  and for the happiness of us all  May every blessing  said she  he wishes us  be his   Then folding up the Letter  and putting it in her bosom  This Letter  and that which accompanied it   meaning yours to her  I must read over and over   Shall I say  my Grandison  that I half pity the lovely Harriet Byron  tho  her name should be changed to yours  You must love Clementina  Were a sovereign Princess her rival  you must  Clementina  who so generously can give up a Love as fervent as ever glowed in a virgin heart  on superior motives  motives which regard Eternity  and receive joy in the prospect of your happiness with another woman  on a persuasion that that woman can make you happier than she herself could  because of a difference in Religion   My sister choosing to retire to her closet  to reperuse the two Letters  Mrs  Beaumont  knowing our curiosity  put down what had passed  intending  as she said  to write a copy of it for you   How were we all  on perusing it  charmed with our Clementina —I insisted  that nothing  at present  should be said to her of the Count of Belvedere  and of our wishes in his favour  My father gave into my opinion  He said  he thought the properest time to   237 mention the Count to her was  when we had an answer to the Letter I wrote to you on the 5th current  if that could give us assurances that you had made your addresses to the charming Byron  and were encouraged  The General was impatient  but he acquiesced  on finding every one come into my motion  but said  that if all this lenity did not do  he must beg leave to have his own measures pursued   SOME little particularity has appeared in the dear creature since I have written the above  She has been exceedingly earnest with her mother  to use her interest with my father  and us  to be allowed to go to England  But desires not the permission till you are actually married  She pleads my health  because of the salutary springs you mention to me   Several other pleas she offered  but  to say truth  they carried with them such an air of flightiness  that I am loth to mention them  Yet all of them were innocent  all of them were even laudable  But  shall I say   that some of them appeared too romantic for a settled brain to be so earnest  as she was  in having them carried into execution   We have no doubt  but all her view is  to avoid marriage  by such a strange excursion  Dear creature  said the Bishop  speaking of her just now  the veil denied her  she must have some point to carry  I wish we saw less rapidity in her manner   I  Grandison  for my part  remember how much she and we all suffered by denying her the farewel visit from you  on your taking leave of Italy the time before the last   But we think an expedient has offered  that will divert her from this wildness  as I must call it  Mrs  Beaumont has requested  that she may be allowed to take her with her to Florence for some weeks  Clementina is pleased with our readiness to oblige them both  and they will soon go     238 But all this time she is uniform and steady in her wishes for your marriage  She delights to hear Mrs  Beaumont talk of the perfections of the Lady to whom we are all desirous of hearing you are united  You
