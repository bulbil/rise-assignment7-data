stances of electioneering   they are too gross to give pleasure    and too well known to require repetition even to you  The efiects    I mean immediately in the place  were such as reason may suggest   to you  The electors  instead of making any advantage of the   price for which they thus had literally sold their consciences  liberties    and properties  continued to wallow in drunkenness  till every   penny of it was spent  after which it was so long before they could   settle rightly to work again  that it required a year s hard labour   and starving to repair what they suflEered by this bout of excess   and idleness  My new mistress was what is not unjustly called   the idol of an inn  Endowed by nature with prettiness enough to   entitle her to flattery  and sufficient pertness to make her a coquette    on her return from a boarding school  where her natural talents   were so well improved by education that she was thought fit to try   her fortune in the world  she took her place in the bar  and flirted   away with every gentleman that came to the house  in hopes of   taking in some one of the number for marriage  as others in her   way  had done  The first passion of the female heart is for finery    to the gratification of which girls seldom fail to apply all the money   in their power  But though my mistress was very far from being   insensible to this passion  another scarce less powerful with the sex   took the place of it at this time  which was curiosity      A young officer  who had lately been quartered in the house    and made warm addresses to her  had said so many fine things in   praise of a certain book called Memoirs of a Lady of Pleasure  that   she resolved to see it  and for that purpose applied at a circulating   library in the town  the keeper of which told her it was so scarce   and valuable a book that he could not possibly procure it for her   under a guinea  High as this price was  she would have found   means to raise it  so strong was her curiosity  had not the hurry of   the election  which just then came on  taken up all her time  But   every obstacle was now removed  and the very evening I came into   her possession  she muffled herself up in one of the maid s cloaks    and went for it as soon as it was dark  when I was the purchase of   this extraordinary bargain      I see you are shocked at the dishonesty and wickedness of my   new master for hiring out at such a price  or indeed at any price at   all  a book  whose obvious design  and which it is too well calculated   to accomplish  is to supplant every principle of virtue in the youthful   mind  But the blame rests not solely upon him  The excuse which   the poet puts into the mouth of the apothecary for selling poison    that   his poverty  but not his will  consented    may with equal   justice be alleged in palliation of a poor bookseller s vending         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 459     impious or immoral booksâ€” the poison of the mind  For this reason    as no penalty  however severe  may be sufficient to combat that   necessity  the most efiectual way to prevent the vending of either   poison would be to prohibit all those whose poverty might subject   them to such temptation  from trading in books or drugs of any   kmd  as it is most certain that if there were neither poor apothe    caries nor poor booksellers  the sale of both vicious books and   noxious drugs would be much less extensive than it is  if it could   not be totally suppressed  there being very few of the human species   so entirely given up to a reprobate sense as to murder either the   soul or body of a fellow creature  merely for the pleasure of doing it    It may be judged that I did not remain long in the service of this   master  The next morning after I came into his possession  he   came to London  where he laid out all the money he had in the pur    chase of a parcel of such books as he thought most likely to suit   the taste of his customers  without regard either to virtue or religion    on which occasion I changed his service for that of his bookseller          CHAPTER XLVI     ACCOITN T OF CHEYSAL s NEW MASTEE â€” HIS HEEOIC SPIRIT AND EE    SOLXTTION TO PUSH FOE A PENSION OE A PILLOEY â€” MEETING   BETWEEN HUM AND A POET
