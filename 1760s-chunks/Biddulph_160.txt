of the grave   If we had a friend  who  in compassion to our wants or weakness  consented to live with us  though under the pressure of years and bodily pain  and that friend were invited to a remote country  with an assurance of recovering health  of having youth renewed  and of possessing all the riches  power  honours  and accumulated pleasures that this world can bestow  should we not blush to own even a wish to detain him from such a station  What but a love of ourselves  superior to that which we bear to our friend  could suggest such a thought  How much more to be desired then is the change  to which my mother looks forward  with an assured hope   But there is something dismal in the idea of death  ’tis only our prejudices make it so  I have been endeavouring for many days past to familiarise it to my thoughts  and to consider death only as the name of a region through which my mother is to pass  in order to get at that delightful country to which she is invited  and whither I shall assuredly follow her  Such is the present frame of my mind  judge then  my sister  if this philosophy will not bear me up against the unexpected blow when it falls upon me   September 15  ’Tis strange  my Cecilia  that this best of parents  who had always so tenderly loved me  expresses now not the least uneasiness at the forlorn condition in which she must soon leave me  Her thoughts are employed on higher objects  and she seems to have weaned herself from all worldly attachments   I am going from you  my daughter  said she to me just now  and have no other legacy to leave you but a parent’s blessing  Your    brother possesses all when I die  I wish you had the means of enjoying life with comfort  but you must be contented  See that you bear your lot as becomes you  I perceive your grief for the melancholy condition to which I am now reduced  but added she smiling  I shall soon be released   Remember how David behaved on the death of that son  whose life he had so earnestly besought of his maker  let that serve you as an example  not to give yourself up to unprofitable sorrow  Bring up your children in the principles that I taught you  and God will take care of them  for I have never seen the righteous forsaken  nor his seed begging their bread   She said  she found herself drowsy  and desired me to leave her for a while  I have left her  going I hope to get a little sleep  she breathes with so much difficulty that she cannot bear to lie down  and never gets any rest but by snatches  as she sits in an arm chair supported by pillows   How heavy and cast down do I feel my spirits  but I know the worst—that is something — It is all over  and my mother  blessed woman  opens not her eyes again but to a joyful resurrection  Oh  my dear  there is no terror in death when he seizes us not unprepared  I went into my mother’s chamber  in about half an hour after I had quitted it  at her desire  I found her leaning back in her chair  her eyes shut  and a complacent air diffused over her face  which made me hope that her slumber was sweeter  and more profound than usual  I sat down by her to contemplate her benign countenance  and was some minutes before I discovered that she did not breathe  I took her hand  she had no pulse  and I soon found that the happy spirit had escaped from its house of clay  May I die the death of the righteous  and my latter end be like hers  No murmurings  no  no my sister  I will be patience itself   September 25  I have sent the remains of my venerable parent down to Sidney Castle  there to be interred with her ancestors  I wrote my brother an account of her death on the day it happened  but have as yet received no answer  Unnatural son  but I will not reproach him  some accident might have prevented his writing immediately on the receipt of my letter  He never intirely forsook the duty he owed his mother  but he has of late been quite estranged from us  his wife  vain  weak and    imperious  governs him totally  I must now begin to look about me for a place of abode suited to my present circumstances  My whole income would not pay more than half the rent of these lodgings in which I have lived with my dear mother  My poor Patty  I am grieved for her  I begged of her to seek another mistress  who might be able to reward her merit  and provide for her as she deserves  but the worthy affectionate girl told me  it would break her heart  if I talked of parting with her  You must have a servant of some sort  Madam  said she  why may not I do as well as another  If I were able to make you a proper
