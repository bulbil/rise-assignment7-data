him and Trunnion  who shook him by the  hand  drank to further acquaintance  and even invited him to a mess  of pork and pease in the garrison  The compliment was returned   good fellowship prevailed  and the night was pretty far advanced  when  the merchant s man arrived with a lantern to light his master home  upon  which  the new friends parted  after a mutual promise of meeting next  evening in the same place   CHAPTER III    Mrs  Grizzle exerts herself in finding a proper Match for her Brother   who is accordingly introduced to the young Lady  whom he marries in due  Season   I have been the more circumstantial in opening the character of  Trunnion  because he bears a considerable share in the course of these  memoirs  but now it is high time to resume the consideration of Mrs   Grizzle  who  since her arrival in the country  had been engrossed by a  double care  namely  that of finding a suitable match for her brother   and a comfortable yoke fellow for herself   Neither was this aim the result of any sinister or frail aggression  but  the pure dictates of that laudable ambition  which prompted her to the  preservation of the family name  Nay  so disinterested was she in this  pursuit  that  postponing her nearest concern  or at least leaving her  own fate to the silent operation of her charms  she laboured with such  indefatigable zeal in behalf of her brother  that before they had been  three months settled in the country  the general topic of conversation  in the neighbourhood was an intended match between the rich Mr  Pickle  and the fair Miss Appleby  daughter of a gentleman who lived in the  next parish  and who though he had but little fortune to bestow upon his  children  had  to use his own phrase  replenished their veins with some  of the best blood in the country     6 22 15  3 45 PM   This young lady  whose character and disposition Mrs  Grizzle had  investigated to her own satisfaction  was destined for the spouse of  Mr  Pickle  and an overture accordingly made to her father  who  being  overjoyed at the proposal  gave his consent without hesitation  and even  recommended the immediate execution of the project with such eagerness   as seemed to indicate either a suspicion of Mr  Pickle s constancy  or  a diffidence of his own daughter s complexion  which perhaps he thought  too sanguine to keep much longer cool  The previous point being thus  settled  our merchant  at the instigation of Mrs  Grizzle  went to visit  his future father in law  and was introduced to the daughter  with whom  he had  that same afternoon  an opportunity of being alone  What passed  in that interview I never could learn  though from the character of the  suitor  the reader may justly conclude that she was not much teased  with the impertinence of his addresses  He was not  I believe  the less  welcome for that reason  certain it is she made no objection to his  taciturnity  and when her father communicated his resolution  acquiesced  with the most pious resignation  But Mrs  Grizzle  in order to give  the lady a more favourable idea of his intellects than his conversation  could possibly inspire  resolved to dictate a letter  which her brother  should transcribe and transmit to his mistress as the produce of his own  understanding  and had actually composed a very tender billet for  this purpose  yet her intention was entirely frustrated by the  misapprehension of the lover himself  who  in consequence of his  sister s repeated admonitions  anticipated her scheme  by writing  for  himself  and despatching the letter one afternoon  while Mrs  Grizzle  was visiting at the parson s   Neither was this step the effect of his vanity or precipitation  but  having been often assured by his sister that it was absolutely necessary  for him to make a declaration of his love in writing  he took  this opportunity of acting in conformity with her advice  when his  imagination was unengaged or undisturbed by any other suggestion   without suspecting in the least that she intended to save him the  trouble of exercising his own genius  Left  therefore  as he imagined   to his own inventions  he sat down  and produced the following morceau   which was transmitted to Miss Appleby  before his sister and counsellor  had the least intimation of the affair                          Miss Sally Appleby        Madam   Understanding you have a parcel of heart  warranted      sound  to be disposed of  shall be pleased to treat for said      commodity  on reasonable terms  doubt not  shall agree for      same  shall wait on you for further information  when and where      you shall appoint
