odd   way of coming at this intelligence  and I have only one thing to blame   you for  that though I was resolved not to hear you in your own defence    yet  as you have so ready a talent at your pen  you might have cleared   your part of this matter up to me by a line or two  and when I had known   what seeming good grounds you had for pouring cold water on a young   flame  that was just then rising to an honourable expansion  should   not have imputed it  as I was apt to do  to unseasonable insult for my   tenderness to you  on one hand  to perverse nicety  on the other  or to    what I was most alarmed by  and concerned for  prepossession for some   other person  And this would have saved us both much fatigue  I of mind    you of body       And  indeed  sir  said I  of mind too  and I could not better manifest   this  than by the cheerfulness with which I obeyed your recalling me to   your presence       Ay  that  my dear Pamela  said he  and clasped me in his arms  was the   kind  the inexpressibly kind action  that has rivetted my affections   to you  and obliges me  in this free and unreserved manner  to pour my   whole soul into your bosom       I said  I had the less merit in this my return  because I was driven  by   an irresistible impulse to it  and could not help it  if I would       This  said he   and honoured me by kissing my hand   is engaging    indeed  if I may hope  that my Pamela s gentle inclination for her   persecutor was the strongest motive to her return  and I so much value a   voluntary love in the person I would wish for my wife  that I would have   even prudence and interest hardly named in comparison with it  And can   you return me sincerely the honest compliment I now make you   In   the choice I have made  it is impossible I should have any view to my   interest  Love  true love  is the only motive by which I am induced  And   were I not what I am  could you give me the preference to any other you   know in the world  notwithstanding what has passed between us  Why    said I  should your so much obliged Pamela refuse to answer this kind   question  Cruel as I have thought you  and dangerous as your views to   my honesty have been  you  sir  are the only person living that ever was   more than indifferent to me  and before I knew this to be what I blush   now to call it  I could not hate you  or wish you ill  though  from my   soul  the attempts you made were shocking  and most distasteful to me       I am satisfied  my Pamela  said he  nor shall I want to see those papers   that you have kindly written for to your father  though I still wish to   see them too  for the sake of the sweet manner in which you relate what   has passed  and to have before me the whole series of your sufferings    that I may learn what degree of kindness may be sufficient to recompense   you for them       In this manner  my dear father and mother  did your happy daughter find   herself blessed by her generous master  An ample recompense for all her   sufferings did I think this sweet conversation only  A hundred tender   things he expressed besides  that though they never can escape my   memory  yet would be too tedious to write down  Oh  how I blessed God    and  I hope  ever shall  for all his gracious favours to his unworthy   handmaid  What a happy change is this  And who knows but my kind  my   generous master  may put it in my power  when he shall see me not quite   unworthy of it  to be a means  without injuring him  to dispense around   me  to many persons  the happy influences of the condition to which   I shall be  by his kind favour  exalted  Doubly blest shall I be  in   particular  if I can return the hundredth part of the obligations I owe   to such honest good parents  to whose pious instructions and examples    under God  I owe all my present happiness  and future prospects   O   the joy that fills my mind on these proud hopes  on these delightful   prospects   It is too mighty for me  and I must sit down
