 visits at my own pleasure  till at last I became so accustomed to this  communication  that his house was as familiar to me as my own    Having in this manner secured himself in my confidence  he resumed the  favourite topic of love  and  warming my imagination by gradual advances  on the subject  my heart began to pant  when he saw me thus moved  he  snatched the favourable occasion to practise all his eloquence and art   I could not resist his energy nor even fly from the temptation that  assailed me  until he had obtained a promise that he should  at our  next meeting  reap the fruits of his tedious expectation  Upon this  condition  I was permitted to retire  and blessed heaven for my escape   fully determined to continue in the path of virtue I had hitherto trod   and stifle the criminal flame by which my peace and reputation were  endangered  But his idea  which reigned in my heart without control   soon baffled all these prudent suggestions    I saw him again  and he reminded me of my promise  which I endeavoured  to evade with affected pleasantry  upon which he manifested the utmost  displeasure and chagrin  shedding some crocodile tears  and upbraided  me with levity and indifference  He observed  that he had solicited my  favour for ten long months without intermission  and imagined I had held  out so long on virtuous motives only  but now he could plainly perceive  that his want of success had been owing to my want of affection  and  that all my professions were insincere  In a word  he persuaded me  that his remonstrances were just and reasonable  I could not see the  affliction of a man I loved  when I knew it was in my power to remove  it  and  rather than forfeit his opinion of my sincerity and love  I  consented to his wish  My heart now flutters at the remembrance of the  dear though fatal indiscretion  yet I reflect without remorse  and even  remember it with pleasure    If I could not avoid the censure of the world  I was resolved to bear  it without repining  and sure the guilt  if there was any in my conduct   was but venial  for I considered myself as a person absolved of all  matrimonial ties  by the insignificance of Lord       who  though a  nominal husband  was in fact a mere nonentity  I therefore contracted  a new engagement with my lover  to which I resolved to adhere with the  most scrupulous fidelity  without the least intention of injuring my  lord or his relations  for  had our mutual passion produced any visible  effects  I would immediately have renounced and abandoned my husband for  ever  that the fruit of my love for Mr  S   might not have inherited   to the detriment of the right heir  This was my determination  which  I thought just  if not prudent  and for which I have incurred the  imputation of folly  in the opinion of this wise and honest generation   by whose example and advice I have  since that time  been a little  reformed in point of prudentials  though I still retain a strong  tendency to return to my primitive way of thinking     6 22 15  3 45 PM    When I quitted Mr  S    after the sacrifice I had made  and returned to  my own bed  it may  perhaps  be supposed that I slept but little  True   I was kept awake by the joyful impatience of revisiting my lover  Indeed  I neglected no opportunity of flying to his arms  When Lord    was in  the country  we enjoyed each other s company without interruption   but when he resided in town  our correspondence was limited to stolen  interviews  which were unspeakably delicious  as genuine love presided  at the entertainment    Such was my happiness in the course of this tender communication  that  to this day I remember it with pleasure  though it has cost me dear in  the sequel  and was at that time enjoyed at a considerable expense  for  I devoted myself so entirely to my lover  who was desirous of engrossing  my time and thoughts  that my acquaintance  which was very numerous   justly accused me of neglect  and of consequence cooled in their  friendships  but I was  all for love  or the world well lost   and were  the same opportunity to offer  I would act the same conduct over again    Some there are who possibly may wonder how I could love twice with such  violence of affection  But all such observers must be unacquainted with  the human heart  Mine was naturally adapted for the tender passions  and  had been so fortunate  so cherished in its first impressions  that it  felt with joy the same sensations revive  when influenced by the same  engaging qualifications  Certain it is  I loved the second time as well  as the first
