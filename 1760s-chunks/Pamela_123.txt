questions by Mrs  Pamela    don t answer her one word  while I am here   But she is a lordly woman   to the maid servants  and that has always been her character  O how   unlike good Mrs  Jervis in every thing          Sunday morning       A thought came into my head  I meant no harm  but it was a little bold    For  seeing my master dressing to go to church  and his chariot getting   ready  I went to my closet  and I writ           The prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired for a       gentleman of great worth and honour  who labours under a temptation       to exert his great power to ruin a poor  distressed  worthless       maiden           And also           The prayers of this congregation are earnestly desired by a poor       distressed creature  for the preservation of her virtue and       innocence       Mrs  Jewkes came up  Always writing  said she  and would see it  And   strait  all that ever I could say  carried it down to my master   He   looked upon it  and said  Tell her  she shall soon see how her prayers   are answered  she is very bold  but as she has rejected all my favours    her reckoning for all is not far off  I looked after him out of the   window  and he was charmingly dressed  To be sure he is a handsome fine   gentleman   What pity his heart is not as good as his appearance  Why   can t I hate him   But don t be uneasy  if you should see this  for it   is impossible I should love him  for his vices all ugly him over  as I   may say       My master sends word  that he shall not come home to dinner  I suppose   he dines with this Sir Simon Darnford  I am much concerned for poor Mr    Williams  Mrs  Jewkes says  he is confined still  and takes on much  All   his trouble is brought upon him for my sake  This grieves me much  My   master  it seems  will have his money from him  This is very hard  for   it is three fifty pounds  he gave him  as he thought  as a salary   for three years that he has been with him  but there was no agreement   between them  and he absolutely depended on my master s favour  To be   sure  it was the more generous of him to run these risks for the sake   of oppressed innocence  and I hope he will meet with his reward in   due time  Alas for me  I dare not plead for him  that would raise my   oppressor s jealousy more  And I have not interest to save myself          Sunday evening       Mrs  Jewkes has received a line from my master  I wonder what it is  for   his chariot is come home without him  But she will tell me nothing  so   it is in vain to ask her  I am so fearful of plots and tricks  I know   not what to do   Every thing I suspect  for  now my disgrace is avowed    what can I think   To be sure  the worst will be attempted  I can only   pour out my soul in prayer to God  for his blessed protection  But  if   I must suffer  let me not be long a mournful survivor   Only let me not   shorten my own time sinfully           This woman left upon the table  in the chamber  this letter of my   master s to her  and I bolted myself in  till I had transcribed it    You ll see how tremblingly  by the lines  I wish poor Mr  Williams s   release at any rate  but this letter makes my heart ache  Yet I have   another day s reprieve  thank God           MRS  JEWKES        I have been so pressed on Williams s affair  that I shall set out this   afternoon  in Sir Simon s chariot  and with Parson Peters  who is his   intercessor  for Stamford  and shall not be back till to morrow evening    if then  As to your ward  I am thoroughly incensed against her  She has   withstood her time  and now  would she sign and seal to my
