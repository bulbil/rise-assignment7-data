to their strength  Nor shall they want it Madam  answered Patty  don’t be angry with me Madam  if I beg you will let me use my endeavours to supply them  What do you mean  said I  I know the goodness of your disposition  but how have you it in your power  You know Madam  said she  I am pretty expert at my needle  and as our landlady has always abundance of work on her hands  I undertook to assist her  and have for this fortnight past  while I was closely confined to miss’s room  finished a piece of curious work  for which she has this day paid me thirty shillings  You amaze me  said I  I never saw you employed otherwise than in your attendance on the child  I was afraid you would be displeased  Madam  she replied  and always hid my work when you came into the room  which I could easily do  as it was only a fine piece of point which I was grounding  and as I sat up night and day  I had an opportunity of sticking most constantly to it  which enabled me to do in a fortnight  what to another hand would be a month’s labour  Now  Madam  with your leave  I can go on in this manner  and though perhaps I cannot always earn so much  yet I am sure I can still procure enough to prevent your being drove to the necessity of parting with your apparel  till we are in a condition to leave such an expensive place as London is  And do you think  my dear Patty  said I  with tears of affection and gratitude in my eyes  that I will consent to take the fruits of your ingenious and honest industry from you  No  no  if you can find time by these means to procure a little supply for your own pocket  do so  but I will not suffer you to expend    a farthing of what you can earn  on my account  I saw she looked distressed and confounded  excuse me  Madam  said she  but I have made bold to lay out part of the money already  I thought the poor children would want a little wine to nourish them  and indeed  Madam  your spirits want some support after your long fatigue  I have bought a few bottles of wine  Madam  and some other little necessaries  I hope you will not take it ill   I pressed the affectionate creature’s hand  I cannot be angry with you  Patty  for your goodness  but such proofs of it as these distress me more than my wants could  I accept of your kindness for this time  but insist on your not doing such a thing again  If there be occasion for it  I can apply to my needle as well as you  and would sooner do so  than part with any of my things  since it gives you so much uneasiness   The poor girl was rejoiced at my acceptance of her friendly and tender offer  and produced her little purchase  which was indeed both seasonable and useful   November 23  I had this day a letter from Lady V——  I send you a copy of it   ‘I condole with you  my dear Mrs Arnold  on the afflicting loss you sustained in your good mother’s death  You mention not any particular consequences from this accident  but I know  that by Lady Bidulph’s death  you are deprived of a considerable part of your income  and on this account I have taken the liberty of friendship  to send you a supply  which your family calls may require  till your affairs are settled upon a better footing   ‘Let me know how you and your brother stand  if he should not be so kind to you as he ought  I insist upon your looking on me as your banker  who know not how to make so good a use of my income  as sharing it with those I love as I do you   ‘I am   c ’  The supply which Lady V—— mentioned  accompanied this letter  and was a bank bill of three hundred pounds   I own to you  my Cecilia  that my first emotions were only those of joy  surprize  and gratitude  for so unexpected and important a donation  but when those were a little subsided  I began to reflect on the nature  and manner of this noble act of friendship  I know Lady    V—— is one of the best women living  she is generous  and compassionate  and has always honoured me with a particular regard  yet I must confess to you  her present now comes to me suspected  I believe I told you  that Lady V—— had retired into Lancashire  to live with an only sister she has there  this Lady is a widow  and I have since been informed  was left with a very numerous young family  and an income scarce sufficient to support them genteely  they are now most of them grown up  and all the girls  of which there are five  unprovided for  Since Lady V——’s departure  I have been told  that it was principally on account of these young girls
