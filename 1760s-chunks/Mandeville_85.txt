 her nobleness of sentiment has conquered the reluctance she had to see her  she has even promised to endeavor to bear the sight of Lord Melvin  but I fear this is more than is in her power  she fainted when the request was first made  Lady Mary is expected here this evening        Bellville  you are coming to Belmont  once the smiling paradise of friendship  Alas  how changed from that once happy abode  Where are those blameless pleasures  that convivial joy  those sweet follies  which once gave such charms to this place           2 202       For ever gone  for ever changed to a gloomy sadness  for ever buried with Lady Julia      Lady Belmont struggles nobly with her grief  she has consented to see her friends  to see all who will hear her talk of her child  a tender melancholy has taken place of those horrors  which it was impossible long to support and live        Colonel Mandeville is to stay at Belmont  they are to indulge in all the voluptuousness of sorrow  they are to sit all day and talk of their matchless children  and count the hours till they follow them to the grave  They have invited all who will join in tears with them  the coach is gone to day for Mr  and Mrs  Herbert        Emily Howard and I bend our whole thoughts to find out means to soften their sorrows  I hope much from your conversation  and the endearing sensibility of your          2 203       soul  it is not by resisting  but by soothing grief  that we must heal the wounded heart      There is one pleasure to which they can never be insensible  the pleasure of relieving the miseries of others  to divert their attention from the sad objects which now engross them  we must find out the retreats of wretchedness  we must point out distress which it is in their power to alleviate        Oh  Bellville  But in vain does the pride of human wisdom seek to explore the counsels of the Most High  Certain of the paternal care of our Creator  our part is submission to his will         FINIS
