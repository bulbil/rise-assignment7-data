seek out the afflicted  His pride too I know is gratified by having me out of the way of observation  and so long as I do not call upon him  I find he will not enquire after me   The winter is now so far advanced  and I am in a condition so extremely weak  that I cannot  till the spring advances a little  think of taking my flight to my peaceful retreat in the country  I look eagerly forward to the time of my enlargement  such I may call it  for indeed  my dear  my spirits are quite exhausted with my long confinement in a little close lodging in this irksome town   January 27  The gentlewoman with whom I lodged in St Alban’s street  told Patty  who went to her house to day to enquire if there were any letters for me  that there have been  at different times  several people of my former acquaintance to look for me  but I do not find that one enquiry has come from my brother  I had given the gentlewoman instructions not to tell any stranger where I lodged  I believe this caution was needless  there are few who give themselves the trouble to trace out the steps of the unhappy  and I dare say  that those whom common form obliged to pay me a visit of condolence on my mother’s death  were none of them much hurt at the disappointment of not finding me — January 30 I have been laying down a little sort of plan for my future life  I told you the terms I could live upon with the farmer whom Patty found out for me  but as I cannot expect to be boarded at so cheap a rate when my children are grown bigger  I have been devising the means how to enlarge my scanty income against the time that our wants must necessarily increase  for I am firmly resolved my kind Lady V—— shall never augment the debt I already owe her  You know  my dear  I am pretty dexterous at my needle  the woman where I lodge deals in    embroidery  which is much in fashion  and I think I have not seen any  though she pays largely to her artificers in this way  equal to some pieces of my own work  Now  my Cecilia  I have resolved to apply myself to this when I get into the country  I shewed the woman a small fire skreen wrought by me when I was a girl  the same which I remember my poor Mr Arnold accused me of neglecting for my Horace  and which had never been made up  she said the work was so curious  that she would give any price for such a hand  Patty is well skilled in this sort of work too  and as I find she is determined not to quit me  I must  in return  endeavour not to let the poor girl be too great a sufferer for her kindness   I think we shall between us be able to do a good deal  and my landlady has promised to receive and dispose of our work for a small consideration  as fast as we can send it to her  which we shall have constant opportunities of doing   You cannot imagine how pleased I am with my scheme  Patty is in raptures at the thoughts of her being permitted to continue with me  I would even now set about my project if my health would allow me  but alas  my Cecilia  I am still so feeble  I am not able to sit up more than an hour or two at a time  and cannot walk a cross my narrow room without help  Fresh air and a little gentle exercise would I am sure  more than any thing  contribute to restore my strength  but the means to procure these  are not conveniently within my power  so that I must wait that slow  but generally sure remedy  patience   February 10  I have a wonderful incident to relate to you  you  my Cecilia  I know will join with me in admiring and praising God for his gracious providence   This morning I was but just risen and got down into my little parlour  when Patty came to tell me  a man desired to speak with me  I immediately ordered him to be admitted  Patty accordingly introduced the person  who had stood in the entry whilst she was speaking to me  He seemed to be a man between forty and fifty years old  mean in his apparel  though clean  I nodded to my maid to leave the room  which when she had done  I civilly demanded of the stranger his business   I was standing when he entered the room  and continued doing so while I spoke to him  not thinking from his appearance that he was intitled to sit down with me  You know I am not proud  but there is a    sort of usage established  which we naturally fall into  The man who had advanced some steps into the room  looked over his shoulder as if for a chair  so I understood the motion  and accordingly sat down myself  and bad him do so too  He did  and with an air as if he considered the civility to be only what was due
