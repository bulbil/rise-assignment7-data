former services are held as   cancelled  and herself treated with the rancour of the greatest   enemy        While England thus supports her character of generosity  and   acts with prudence  the Dutch  as if infatuated  stand quietly to   see the barrier   which cost themselves even so much in erecting for   their defence  thus given away to the very power against whom it   was erected  and who  they cannot be insensible  means nothing   less than their ruin  as soon as it can strike the blow to effect  But   such is the degeneracy of that people from every sentiment of virtue    public and private  that they will not give up the opportunity of   present gain to save their state from so evident  so imminent ruin    vainly  perhaps  expecting that England will still pursue the schemes   of knight errantry which have so long made her fight the quarrels   of her neighbours  while they themselves looked on almost as if   unconcerned in the event  and will be moved by the cries of the   distressed states to remedy the mistakes  and repair the losses of   their High Mightinesses        While every other state in Europe is thus employed  Spain and   Portugal enjoy all the advantages of peace  prudently taking no   part in a war which does not in the least concern them  Of these    the former  like the old lion in the fable  is only terrible to ignorant   apprehension on account of what it has been  and is now pacific   and harmless  because it no longer has the power of doing harm      1 In the first campaign  Frederick overran Saxony  and forced the   Saxon army to capitulate   and this unfortunate country wa3 occupied   alternately by both parties throughout the Seven Years  War  suffering   frightful calamities        By the Barrier Treaty  1 709   Holland was secured by England in    the possession of certain Flemish fortresses  as a protection againgt   France          â  248 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     Sensible of this weakness  it sleeps in the shadow of a mighty name    and mixes not in disputes which must only draw it into difficulties    without any prospect of advantage to engage in the attempt  But   it must not be let to enjoy this state of tranquility  so contrary to   our designs  any longer   and  as the present government there is   determined to persist in the measures that support it  it must be   â  overturned to make way for those who will be more obedient to our   advice  A method which we must also pursue with Portugal     for  though its strength is almost beneath the rank of an indepen    dent  much less a royal state  yet  upon the account of its wealth    which might hire forces to oppress us  it must be worked up to take   the same step  and break with England  as I have said before  to   which it has already made large advances  by several most unjust   and injudicious encroachments  on the trade of that nation        As for the war between France and England  it arises solely from   the contradictions between the interest of the two nations  which   Nature has set in an opposition impossible to be reconciled  But   the seat of this war is so remote from hence  that it would have no   influence on the affairs of Europe  did not the successes of the   English prevent France from giving the assistance that was ex    pected  and might be effectual to the designs of this court  for they   have so absolutely ruined her trade  that she is no longer able to   fulfil her engagements with Eussia particularly  and the several   courts of Germany  whom she undertook to pay  for fighting the   quarrel of her ally   so that the former  who had no other motive   but the money for entering into the war at first  will  of course    and the latter must of necessity desert that cause  not having any   internal support of their own  since this has failed them  Indeed    the Russians  finding all the mighty promises which were made   them vanish into air  begin to be sick of their bargain already    and long again for the solid advantages of their alliance with Eng    land  As for this court  it is now making its last effort  and  if this   is eluded or defeated  it has no other resource than shamefully to   receive the law from a prince upon whom it made so unjust an   attempt            CHAPTER XXVIII
