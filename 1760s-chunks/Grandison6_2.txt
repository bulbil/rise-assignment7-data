I am in hopes that we shall be able to accommodate   I have Bolton s proposals before me  The first child is dead  the second cannot live many months  He trembles at the proofs he knows we have of his villainy  He offers  on the death of this second child  to give us possession of the estate  and a large sum of   4 money  but thought not to be half of what the superannuated Calvert left  if we will give him general releases  The wretch is not  we believe  married to the relict of Calvert   I am loth  methinks  to let him escape the justice which his crimes call for  But such are the delays and chicaneries of the law  when practisers are found who know how to perplex an honest pursuer  and as we must have recourse to low and dirty people to establish our proofs  the vile fellow shall take with him the proposed spoils  They may not be much more than would be the lawyers part of the estate  were we to push the litigation   As to our poor Everard  nothing  I fear  can be done for him  with the men who are revelling on his spoils  I have seen one of them  The unhappy man has signed and sealed to his own ruin  He regrets  that a part of the estate which has been so long in the family and name  should go out of it  What an empty pride is that of name  The general tenor of his life was not a credit to it  tho  he felt not that  till he felt distress  The disgrace is actually incurred  Does not all the world know his loss  and the winner s triumph  And if the world did not  can he conceal from himself those vices  the consequences of which have reduced him to what he is  But perhaps the unhappy man puts a value upon the name  in compliment to me   Mention not to him what I write  The poor man is sensible enough of his folly  to engage pity  Whether from a right sense  or not  must be left to his own heart   As to the woman s claim  What in honour can I do  against a promise that he owns may be proved upon him  He did not condition with her  that she was to be a spotless woman  If he thought she was so when he solicited her to yield to his desires  he is the less to be excused  Vile as she comes out to be    5 he had proposed to make her as vile  if he had found her not so  He promised her marriage  Meant he only a promise  She is punished in being what she is  His punishment cannot be condign  but by his being obliged to perform his promise  Yet I cannot bear to think that my cousin Grandison should be made  for life  the dupe of a successful and premeditated villainy  and the less  as  in all likelihood  the profligate Lord B  would continue to himself  from the merit with her of having vindicated her claim  an interest in the bad woman s favour  were she to be the wife of our poor Everard   But certainly this claim must be prosecuted with a view only to extort money from my cousin  and they know him to be of a family jealous of its honour  I think she must be treated with for releases  I could not bear to appear in such a cause as this  in open court  in support of my cousin  against a promise made by him  He is of age  and thought to be no novice in the ways of the town  I am mistaken in Mr  Grandison s spirit  if it did not lead him to think himself very severely punished  were he to have no other punishment  for those vices  which were to be expensive to me   But if I should be able to extricate the unhappy man from this difficulty  what can next be done for him  The poor remains of his fortune will not support one who has always lived more than genteelly  Will he be able  think you  to endure the thoughts of living in a constant state of dependence  however easy and genteel I should endeavour to make it to him  There may be many ways  in the public offices  for example  of providing for a broken tradesman  But for a man who calls himself  and is  a gentleman  who will expect as such to rank with his employer  who knows nothing of figures  or business of any kind  who has been brought up in idleness  and hardly knows the meaning of the word diligence  and never   6 could bear confinement  what can be done for such a one in the public offices  or by any other employment that requires punctual attendance   But to quit this subject  for a more agreeable one   I have for some time had it in my thoughts to ask you  my dear friend  Whether your nephew is provided for to your liking and his own  If not  and he would put it in my power to serve him
