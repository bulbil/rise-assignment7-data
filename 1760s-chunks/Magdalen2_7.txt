about two o clock  quite surprizing Mr  and Mrs  Mildmay  as you may naturally imagine  by our unexpected appearance  The old gentleman at first carried matters very high  and seemed to think himself under a necessity of keeping a prodigious distance  but lady Haversham  who has a degree of consideration that equals her benignity  kindly made allowances for his behaviour  and  seizing him by the arm with all that candour of cordiality which generally disarms an ill grounded resentment  begged of him to consider her as a faithful friend to his family  who deeply partook in his misfortunes  though these misfortunes were unhappily created by the profligacy of her brother — My dear Mr  Mildmay   expostulated the admirable woman    I am almost as much to be pitied as yourself  you know how much my heart was in an alliance   38 with your house  and you also know how tender a friendship I ever entertained for the amiable Louisa  don t therefore  instead of giving me consolation  add ungenerously to my distress  but consider me as a person deeply sensible of all your wrongs  and warmly animated with all your resentments  The author of the present calamity is my brother  but I am sure you cannot think me the sister of his crime  nor imagine  that  because I am allied to him in blood  I must likewise be allied to the guilty part of his character  Look at me  I beseech you  with complacency  and tell me that my presence is not unwelcome in the country     This address there was no possibility of resisting—Mr  Mildmay s heart was melted  and  in spite of all his pride  he took hold of her hand with an air of   39 the greatest respect  held it to his lips  and endeavoured to make an apology—A rising flood of grief  however  choaked the passage of his words  he broke into a sob of inexpressible affliction  and hastily retired out of the room  You know  Harold  how readily the mother  as you call it  comes into my eyes  you know  besides  that I am twenty good years older than you  and have been once a father  I could not  therefore  stand the excess of poor Mr  Mildmay s emotion  my handkerchief was out in an instant  and  notwithstanding my utmost efforts  to suppress my concern  I blubbered so heartily as to be under a necessity of retiring also  unacquainted as I was with the house  and ridiculous as I must have made myself to the servants  As to Mrs  Mildmay  nothing can be more tender or affecting than the reception of your sister —The two ladies  at their first meeting  remained   40 clasped for some moments in each other s arms  each unable to speak a syllable  and both giving a very copious freedom to their tears   When we had all a little recovered ourselves  and taken a dish of chocolate  lady Haversham  with her usual delicacy  began to enter upon the business of her journey  lamenting the colonel s wound  in terms the most friendly  and hoping that the unfortunate affair at Reading would not prevent the possibility of a reconciliation between the two families  she then set forth your extreme contrition for the part you had acted by Louisa  and insinuated that she had a letter from you in her pocket  which  if Mr  Mildmay would take the trouble of reading  she was certain  would  in some measure  lessen the severity of his present indignation  Mr  Mildmay upon this took fire  swearing  with great   41 vehemence  that  so far from consenting to a reconciliation  he never would enjoy a moment s peace of mind till you were sacrificed to his vengeance  and  that  if he but knew where you were then concealed  he would himself  old as he was  call you to an instant account for murdering the reputation of his family   This was a sally of passion which we naturally expected  and therefore did not once interrupt him  till it was entirely exhausted  lady Haversham then resumed the subject  and begged of him to consider  that she was now talking as much for the sake of his happiness  as for the happiness of her brother — Indeed  my dear Mr  Mildmay   continued she    if I was not sensible that the present calamity  under which we all labour  requires great allowances  I should be apt to think you almost   42 as culpable as my brother himself  Does it follow  because he has grossly injured the honour of your house  that you yourself should do it still greater injuries  or can it admit of a moment s debate which is the most proper course to follow—that which will recover the tranquility of your family  or that which will expose it to an additional distress       If calling my brother to an account for his misbehaviour  could be attended with any advantages  I should not wonder so greatly at your resentment  but when to do that  as has been already unhappily the case  the safety of a dear and deserving son must be hazarded  and when  even
