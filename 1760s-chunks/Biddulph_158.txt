friend she would not fail to attend her at the appointed time   Miss Burchell’s behaviour was extremely composed  she either really was  or affected to be  extremely sorry at parting with me  she could not stay long with us  she said  as she had many things to settle in the remaining part of that evening  On taking leave of me  I shall not see you again  worthiest of women  said she  at least  for many months  but my love  my respect  and my gratitude towards you will be as lasting as my life  You shall hear often from me  and be so good as sometimes to tell me I am not forgotten  She embraced me with tears in her eyes  but I thought she tripped down stairs to her chair  as if her heart was very light   My mother liked her deportment  she said  she believed the flightiness of her behaviour before  was owing to her being quite intoxicated with the suddenness of her joy  on so unexpected a turn of fortune  but that since she had time for recollection  she had recovered her wonted bashful and sober air  with which she used to be so delighted  My mother says  she will contrive to carry a rich white brocade gown with her  in order to slip it on at Miss Burchell’s house  for she would not  on any consideration  appear in mourning on this joyful occasion  You know the reverence she has for omens   June 28  The important event is over  my Cecilia  Miss Burchell is now Mrs Faulkland  My mother is just returned  and saw the nuptial knot tied  The lady  she said  looked very lovely  and it was easy to observe she gave her hand with all her heart  Mr Faulkland’s behaviour was polite and unconstrained  but his attention to his bride was more gallant than tender  and his whole deportment was that of a man who seemed to endeavour at acquitting himself with a good grace of an act of duty  rather than of inclination  The latter part of the observation    is mine  not my mother’s  but I collected it from certain little particulars  which she related to me in her own way  without drawing any inference from them   He thanked her in a most respectful manner for the honour she had done him  and for her former friendship to Miss Burchell  but did not once mention my name  So much the better  I hope he will forget me   My mother is mighty alert on the occasion  and felicitates both herself and me on our having brought about this very important affair  She joined heartily with me in praying that the new married pair may be happy in each other  She is quite reconciled to Mr Faulkland  What a pity it was  said she—and stopped  then added  But every thing is for the best  I understood her  but made no reply   They go out of town to morrow morning  all happiness attend them   I expect Sir George will be quite outrageous about this marriage  My second refusal of his friend  with the addition of his now being wedded  through my persuasion  to a woman my brother never could endure  will  I fear  exasperate him beyond a possibility of reconciliation  I cannot help it  I have acted agreeably to the dictates of my duty  that must be my consolation  life is in itself a warfare  my life has been particularly so   July 8  My mother is far from being well  her spirits have been a little heightened for these few days past  but her disorder I see gains ground  the swelling in her legs is returning  and her rest at night quite broken  I am hourly habituating myself to think of her dissolution  or  in other words  am preparing myself for the worst evil that can now befal me  I hope I shall find myself equal to the trial   July 10  Here is a storm for you my dear  a letter from Sir George  I wanted such a thing to rouse me from the almost lethargic dulness that was creeping on me  Mr Faulkland has acquainted him with his marriage  Pray observe his brotherly address   Mrs Arnold  June 6  1706   ‘For I disclaim all relation to you  I have just now had a letter from Faulkland  wherein I am at once informed of your having    finally rejected him  and of his being married to Miss Burchell  As for the first  your own folly be on your head  You will have time enough for repentance  and I need wish you no other punishment than what will  and for me shall  be the consequences of your obstinate adherence to your own romantic wild opinions  But what in the name of blind infatuation could provoke you to urge the man  to whom you owed such obligations  to his destruction  You I know have done it  he could not be so mad but under your influence  You and my mother I suppose fancy you have done a righteous deed  but you have done what I am afraid poor Faulkland will have reason to—I will suppress the shocking word  that my indignation suggested
