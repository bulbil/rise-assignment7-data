the grate His friend the alguazil was there again  and he asked him what he wanted  Open the door  answered the alguazil  here is Mr Corregidor  At this dreadful name  my blood froze in my veins  I had a devilish loathing of those gentry since I had passed through their hands  and could have wished myself at that moment an hundred leagues from Madrid  As for my employer  less startled than myself  he opened the door  and received the magistrate respectfully  You see  said the corregidor  that I do not break in upon you with a whole posse  my maxim is to do business in a quiet way  In spite of the ugly reports circulated about you in the city  I think you deserve some little attention  What is your name  and business at Madrid  Sir  answered my master  I am from New Castile  and my title is Don Bernard de Castil Blazo  With respect to my way of life  I lounge about  frequent public places  and take my daily pleasure in a select circle of polite company  Of course you have a handsome fortune  replied the judge  No  sir  interrupted my Mecaenas  I have neither annuities  nor lands  nor houses  How do you live then  rejoined the corregidor  I will show you  replied Don Bernard  At the same time he lifted up a part of the hangings  before a door I had not observed  opened that and one beyond  then took the magistrate into a closet containing a large chest chuck full of gold   Sir  said he again  you know that the Spaniards are proverbially indolent  yet  whatever may be their general dislike to labour  I may compliment myself on bettering the example  I have a stock of laziness  which disqualifies me for all exertion  If I had a mind to puff my vices into virtues  I might call this sloth of mine a philosophical indifference  the work of a mind weaned from all that worldlings court with so much ardour  but I will frankly own myself constitutionally lazy  and so lazy  that rather than work for my subsistence  I would lay myself down and starve  Therefore  to lead a life befitting my fancy  not to have the trouble of looking after my affairs  and above all to do without a steward  I have converted all my patrimony  consisting of several considerable estates  into ready money  In this chest there are fifty thousand ducats  more than enough for the remainder of my days  should I live to be an hundred  For I do not spend a thousand a year  and am already more than fifty years old  I have no fears  therefore  for futurity  since I am not addicted  heaven be praised  to any one of the three things which usually ruin men  I care little for the pleasures of the table  I only play for my amusement  and I have given up women  There is no chance of my being reckoned  in my old age  among those libidinous grey beards to whom jilts sell their favours by troy weight   You are a happy man  said the corregidor  They are in the wrong to suspect you of being a spy  that office is quite out of character for a man like you  Take your own course  Don Bernard  continue to live as you like  Far from disturbing your peace  I declare myself your protector  I request your friendship  and pledge my own  Ah  sir  exclaimed my master  thrilled with these kind expressions  I accept with equal joy and gratitude your precious offer  In giving me your friendship you augment my wealth  and carry my happiness to its height  After this conversation  which the alguazil and myself heard  from the closet door  the corregidor took his leave of Don Bernard  who could not do enough to express his sense of the obligation  On my part  mimicking thy master in doing the honours of the house  I overburdened the alguazil with civilities  I made him a thousand low bows  though I felt for him in my sleeve the contempt and hatred which every honest man naturally entertains for an alguazil       CH  II     The astonishment of Gil Blas at meeting Captain Rolando in Madrid  and that robber s curious narrative   DON Bernard de Castil Blazo  having attended the corregidor to the street  returned in a hurry to fasten his strong box  and all the doors which secured it  We then went out  both of us well satisfied  he at having acquired a friend in power  and myself at finding my six rials a day secured to me  The desire of relating this adventure to Melendez made me bend my steps towards his house  but  near my journey s end  whom should I meet but Captain Rolando  My surprise was extreme  and I could not help quaking at the sight of him  He recollected me at once  accosted me gravely  and  still keeping up his tone of superiority  ordered me to follow him  I tremblingly obeyed  saying inwardly  Alas  he means  doubtless  to make me pay my debts  Whither will he
