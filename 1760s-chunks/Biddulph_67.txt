knew my husband would be pleased with my complaisance   I went accordingly to her house  a little before her hour of dining  which is much later than any body else’s in this part of the world  I found her dressed out  and seemingly in perfect health  She looked surprized when she saw me  and I then supposed that she hoped to have received a denial from me  and was disappointed at my coming     though I wondered that the answer she received to her message had not prepared her  This thought rushed into my mind in an instant  and I was sure she expected Mr Arnold  I told her  if I had thought I should have found her so well  that her message should not have brought me to her  for that I had determined not to stir out that day  till her invitation prevailed on me to change my mind  Sure  my dear  said she  there must have been some mistake in delivering the message to you  it was for to morrow I desired the pleasure of your company to dine with me  for today I am absolutely engaged  However  I am very glad you are come  for I shall not go out till seven o’clock  I was vexed and mortified  either your servant or mine made a mistake  said I  for I was told you desired to see me to day  besides you sent me word you were not well  She seemed a little abashed at this  I was very ill in the morning  she said  and though I was engaged to spend the evening abroad  did intend to have sent an excuse  but finding myself better  I changed my purpose   Dinner was immediately served  and I sat down  but with a reluctance that prevented me from eating  I would have taken my leave soon after dinner  but Mrs Gerrarde insisted on my staying  and told me  if I refused her  she should think I had taken something amiss of her  She called for cards  I suffered myself to be persuaded  and we fell to piquet   I played with disgust  and without attention  every minute wishing to break away  Coffee was at length brought in  I begged to be excused from staying  telling Mrs Gerrarde  I was sure I prevented her from going abroad  but she would take no denial  I was constrained to take a dish of coffee  and was hastening to get it down when the parlour door flew open  and lo  Mr Faulkland entered the room  If an object the most horrible to human nature had appeared before me  it could not  at that instant  have shocked me half so much  I let the cup and saucer drop from my hand  to say I turned pale  trembled and was ready to faint  would be too feeble a description of the effect this spectre had on me  I was senseless  I almost died away  Mrs Gerrarde pretended to be greatly alarmed  she ran for drops  and having given me a few in a glass of water  I made a shift to rise off my chair  and telling her  I should be glad of a little air  tottered to the street door  I determined to go home directly  but the universal tremor I was now in  disabled me from walking  and I sat down in the porch to recover myself a little  Mr Faulkland’s having been a witness to the agony his presence had thrown me into     did not a little aggravate the horror and confusion of my thoughts  Whatever his were  he had not spoke to me  nor was it possible for me to have remarked his behaviour  I staid not more than two minutes in the parlour after he entered  In this situation you will think my distress would hardly admit of any addition  but the final blow was yet to come  Mrs Gerrarde had staid a minute in the parlour to speak to Mr Faulkland after I went out  but presently followed me  and was soothing me with the kindest expressions  when I heard the trampling of horses  and presently beheld Mr Arnold alighting at the door  I now gave myself up for lost  My mind suddenly suggested to me that Mrs Gerrarde had contrived a plot upon my innocence  but how she had been able to bring it about  my thoughts were not then disengaged enough to conceive  My mind was all a chaos  I was not able to answer Mr Arnold when he spoke to me  He soon perceived my disorder  and enquired the cause  Mrs Gerrarde took upon her to answer  that I was just preparing to go home  when I was taken suddenly ill  I was going abroad  said she  and as I ordered the chariot much about this hour  I fancy it is ready  and may as well carry Mrs Arnold home  you had best step into the parlour  my dear   to me  till it is brought to the door   I am now able to walk  madam  said I  there is no occasion to give you that trouble  Mr Arnold said  I should not walk by any means  and Mrs Gerrarde immediately calling to a servant to order
