care to please her that had made him stretch   his wit beyond it s natural extent  and that if he had loved her less    he would have been able to have told her so in a much better stile    Possessed with this fancy   What a ridiculous thing this love is   said   she   What extravagancies does it sometimes make men guilty of  yet one   never sees this madness in them after they become husbands  If I were to   marry Sir Frederick  I do not doubt but he would soon recover his   senses        How does a mind  unbroke with cares and disappointments  entirely free   from passion  and perfectly at peace with itself  improve  and dwell on   every thing that affords the least matter for its entertainment  This   young lady found as much diversion in anticipating the innocent pranks   she intended to play with the authors of these two letters  as an infant   does in first playing with a new baby  and afterwards plucking it to   pieces  so true is the observation of the poet  that             All are but children of a larger growth        But this sprightliness of humour in Miss Betsy soon received a sad and   sudden interruption  having sent  as she constantly did every day  to   enquire after the health of Mr  Goodman  her servant returned with an   account  that he had expired that morning  Though this was an event    which she  and all who knew him  had expected for some time  yet could   she not be told of the death of a gentleman  under whose care and   protection she so long had been  and who had behaved in all respects so   like a parent towards her  without being very deeply affected with the   news  she was then at dinner  but threw down her knife and fork  rose   from the table  and retired to her chamber and wept bitterly  the more   violent emotions of grief were soon assuaged  but her melancholy and   dejection of spirits continued much longer  and  while they did so  she   had the power of making the most just reflections on the vain pursuits    the fleeting pleasures  and all the noise and hurry of the giddy world    Love  and all the impertinences which bear that name  now appeared only   worthy of her contempt  and  recollecting that Sir Frederick had   mentioned visiting her that evening  she sent a servant immediately to   Mrs  Modely s  desiring her to acquaint that gentleman  that she had   just lost a very dear friend  and was in too much affliction to admit of   any company       This being the day on which Mr  Francis Thoughtless was expected to be   in London  this affectionate sister perceiving  by his last letter to   her  that his health was not perfectly established  was under a very   great concern  lest he should be put to some inconvenience by Mr    Goodman s death  for a proper lodging on his first arrival  but she soon   found her tender fears  on this occasion  altogether groundless       Those objections which had hindered Mr  Thomas Thoughtless from taking   her into his family  had not the same weight in relation to Mr  Francis    whose sex set him above meddling with those domestick concerns  the   command of which he had given to another  and his reputation would   suffer nothing by being under the same roof with the mistress of his   brother s amorous inclinations       He went to the inn where he knew the L    e stage puts up  welcomed Mr    Francis with open arms  as soon as he alighted from the coach  and gave   him all the demonstrations of brotherly affection that the place they   were in would admit of  then conducted him to his house  and insisted   that he should not think of any other home  till he was better provided   for  and settled in the world       A servant belonging to the elder Mr  Thoughtless was immediately   dispatched to Miss Betsy  with a letter from the younger  and it was   from this man that she received the agreeable intelligence  that the two   brothers were together  The terms in which Mr  Francis wrote to her were   these              To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            My dear sister            Heaven be thanked  I am at last got safe to London  a place  which         I assure you  some months ago I almost despaired of
