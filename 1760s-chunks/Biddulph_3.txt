or more distant periods of time  according as I gave her the opportunity  by letting her know our motions   I have from those selected the most material parts of her history  and connected them so as to make one continued narrative   There were long intervals of time between many of the most important incidents of her life  but as the passages which intervened were either foreign to the main scope of her story  or too trivial to be recorded  in copying her papers they were omitted   I have myself prefixed to her story a very brief account    of the lady’s family   Thus much  Sir  added the good lady  I thought necessary to premise to you  for your better understanding her history  which I have never yet shewn to any body but my son   When I took my leave  she put the manuscript into my hands  with a charge to be careful of it   We returned to town  and in less than three weeks I had the mortification to hear that this respectable old Lady  by whom I had been entertained with so much friendship and politeness  was dead  Her son  my friend  was on this occasion obliged to go down into Buckinghamshire  it was some months before I saw him again  as he had a good deal of family business to settle   When he came back to London  I offered to return him the manuscript  which he had quite forgot  He told me  as he had all the original papers  that copy was at my service   I then expressed my wish that it were made public  To this he at first objected  as he said there were several persons living  related to the parties concerned in some of the principal events of the story  who might take umbrage at it  I told him  that this might easily be obviated  by changing the names both of persons and places  which I would undertake to do throughout the whole  and I was afterwards so urgent with him to comply with my request  that he at last yielded  With his consent therefore I give it to the world  just as I received it  without any alteration  excepting the proposed one of a change of names       MEMOIRS OF MISS SIDNEY BIDULPH  Mrs Catharine Sidney Bidulph  was the daughter of Sir Robert Bidulph of Wiltshire  Her father died when she was very young  and of ten children none survived him but this lady  and his eldest son  afterwards Sir George Bidulph  The family estate was not very considerable  and Miss Bidulph’s portion was but four thousand pounds  a fortune however at that time but quite contemptible  it was in the beginning of queen Ann’s reign   Lady Bidulph was a woman of plain sense  but exemplary piety  the strictness of her notions  highly commendable in themselves  now and then gave a tincture of severity to her actions  though she was ever esteemed a truly good woman   She had educated her daughter  who was one of the greatest beauties of her time  in the strictest principles of virtue  from which she never deviated  through the course of an innocent  though unhappy life   Sir George Bidulph was nine or ten years older than his sister  He was a man of a good understanding  moral as to his general conduct  but void of any of those refined sentiments  which constitute what is called delicacy  Pride is sometimes accounted laudable  that which Sir George possessed  for he had pride  was not of this kind   He was of a weakly constitution  and had been ordered by the physicians to Spa for the recovery of a lingering disorder  which he had laboured under for some time  It was just on his return to England that the busy scene of his sister’s life opened  An intimate friend of hers  of her own sex  to whom she revealed all the secrets of her heart  happened at this juncture to go abroad  and it was for her perusal only the following journal was intended  That friend has carefully preserved it  as she thinks it may serve for an example to    prove  that neither prudence  foresight  nor even the best disposition that the human heart is capable of  are of themselves sufficient to defend us against the inevitable ills that sometimes are allotted  even to the best  ‘The race is not to the swift  nor the battle to the strong ’    THE JOURNAL  April 2  1703  My dear and ever beloved Cecilia is now on her way to Harwich  How insipid will this task of recording all the little incidents of the day now appear to me  when you  my sister  friend of my heart  are no longer near me  how many tedious months will it be before I again embrace you  how many days of impatience must I suffer before I can even hear from you  or communicate to you the actions  the words  the thoughts of your Sidney —But let me not grow plaintive  the stile my friend hates—I should be ungrateful  if I indulged it  to the best of mothers  who  to gratify and amuse me on this first occasion of
