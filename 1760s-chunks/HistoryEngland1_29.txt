hand to bless the people  Thus Becket became a saint  and Henry was suspected of being the author of his assassination   In order to divert the attention of the public from suspicions of this nature  Henry undertook the conquest of Ireland  a project formed some years before  but deferred on account of his long protracted quarrel  The more readily to gain the Pope s approbation of his undertaking   for nothing could then be atchieved without the sanction of Rome  he cleared himself  by oath  of being any way privy to the assassination  and made a solemn vow to go barefoot to Becket s tomb  there to receive the discipline of the church   Thus furnished with Pope Adrian s bull  which granted him a kingdom that was not his to give  he subdued Ireland with a rapidity equal to his most sanguine hopes  but it was no hard matter to conquer a country which was at that time barbarous  and divided under different chiefs  and each pursuing different views and interests   But the happiness this Monarch received from this accession of power  was soon allayed by a conspiracy in his own family  Among the few vices of this Monarch  unlimited gallantry was one  His Queen was disagreeable  and he was faithless  but  though an admirer of all the sex  he singled out  with particular affection  Rosamond Clifford  a lady of matchless beauty  Historians and poets talk of the fair Rosamond in the warmest strains of rapture  if what they say be true  never did England produce so much beauty united with so much grace before  He kept her concealed in a labyrinth   85 at Woodstock park  and  in her company  passed his hours of vacancy and pleasure  But the Queen at length came to a knowledge of this amour  and  pursuing her happy rival to her retreat  guided  say some  by a clew of silk  she obliged her to take poison   As this was an offence which the Queen could not be forgiven  she was resolved not to forgive  Her sons were soon brought to share her resentments  and a conspiracy was formed  abetted by all the malecontents of the kingdom  To this unnatural combination Henry opposed his usual prudence and resolution  he seemed on every side assaulted  but every where came off victorious  Ascribing  however  the opposition of his own children to the indignation of offended Heaven  he was resolved  by an exemplary penance  to conciliate its favour   Now was the time in which the clergy were to come off victorious  this was the season in which they were to reap the labours of their martyred defender  and by one weak action the King was now to cancel what a great part of his life he had been employed in bringing to ripeness  Being come within sight of Canterbury  he walked barefoot to Becket s tomb  in extreme pain  there he was scourged by the Monks  and spent the whole night upon the pavement  The Monks were thus reinstated again in all their claims  and the people involved in greater superstition than before   This penance  however  no way served to reconcile him to his family  he even cursed their ingratitude  and  wearied with domestic contention  resolved  at last  to undertake a crusade  his son Richard  however  still pursuing the dictates of ambition rather than of nature  deprived   86 him of all power to put this design into execution  Passion and disappointment  therefore  began to make visible depredations on his constitution  and mark him for the grave  he fell sick at Chinon in Normandy  and  finding his end approach  he caused himself to be carried into the church  before the altar  where he expired  with scarce a single attendant to deplore his fall   I am   c   LETTER XIII   Dear Charles   WHEN I compare the English  at this period  with the neighbouring nations  I can t avoid remarking in them a peculiar degree of courage  generosity  and politeness  They had  during the Saxon Kings  sunk into bigotry and effeminacy  but a mixture of the Norman fierceness improved their characters  and rendered them at once valiant yet forgiving   You have seen Henry  as well as all his Norman predecessors  improve those good qualities in his subjects  not less by influence than example  You have seen him attempting to increase the freedom of the people by corporation charters  and to diminish the power of the barons by weakning the foeudal government  by which the peasants and husbandmen were slaves  In these designs he succeeded  but he failed in his endeavours of lessening the power of the clergy  The kingdom at his decease  therefore  assumed a different appearance from what it wore before his accession  The people now began to have some  though but   87 a small share of  power  the barons had still vast authority  though less than formerly  while the clergy might be considered as a body entirely distinct from the rest of the community  governed by their own laws  and professing subjection only to the Pope   In this fituation were affairs  when Richard  the son of Henry  came  by succession  to
