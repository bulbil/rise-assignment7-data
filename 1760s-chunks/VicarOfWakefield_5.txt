worth a million  I have been young  and now am old  yet never saw I the righteous man forsaken  or his seed begging their bread  Let this be your consolation as you travel on  Go  my boy  whatever be thy fortune let me see thee once a year  still keep a good heart  and farewell    As he was possest of integrity and honour  I was under no apprehensions from throwing him naked into the amphitheatre of life  for I knew he would act a good part whether he rose or fell     His departure only prepared the way for our own  which arrived a few days afterwards   Page  21  The leaving a neighbourhood in which we had enjoyed so many hours of tranquility  was not without a tear  which scarce fortitude itself could suppress  Besides  a journey of seventy miles to a family that had hitherto never been above ten from home  filled us with apprehension  and the cries of the poor  who followed us for some miles  contributed to encrease it  The first day s journey brought us in safety within thirty miles of our future retreat  and we put up for the night at an obscure inn in a village by the way  When we were shewn a room  I desired the landlord  in my usual way  to let us have his company  with which he complied  as what he drank would encrease the bill next morning  He knew  however  the whole neighbourhood to which I was removing  particularly  Squire Thornhill  who was to be my landlord  and who lived within a few miles of the place  This gentleman he described as one who desired to know little more of the world than the pleasures it afforded  being particularly remarkable  Page  22  for his attachment to the fair sex  He observed that no virtue was able to resist his arts and assiduity  and that scarce a farmer s daughter within ten miles round but what had found him successful and faithless  Though this account gave me some pain  it had a very a different effect upon my daughters  whose features seemed to brighten with the expectation of an approaching triumph  nor was my wife less pleased and confident of their allurements and virtue  While our thoughts were thus employed  the hostess entered the room to inform her husband  that the strange gentleman  who had been two days in the house  wanted money  and could not satisfy them for his reckoning    Want money    replied the host    that must be impossible  for it was no later than yesterday he paid three guineas to our beadle to spare an old broken soldier that was to be whipped through the town for dog stealing    The hostess  however  still persisting in her first assertion  he was preparing to leave the room  swearing  Page  23  that he would be satisfied one way or another  when I begged the landlord would introduce me to a stranger of so much charity as he described  With this he complied  shewing in a gentleman who seemed to be about thirty  drest in cloaths that once were laced  His person was well formed  though his face was marked with the lines of thinking  He had something short and dry in his address  and seemed not to understand ceremony  or to despise it  Upon the landlord s leaving the room  I could not avoid expressing my concern to the stranger at seeing a gentleman in such circumstances  and offered him my purse to satisfy the present demand    I take it with all my heart  Sir    replied he    and am glad that a late oversight in giving what money I had about me  has shewn me that there is still some benevolence left among us  I must  however  previously entreat being informed of the name and residence of my benefactor  in order to remit it as soon as possible    In this I satisfied him fully  not only mentioning  Page  24  my name and late misfortunes  but the place to which I was going to remove    This    cried he    happens still more luckily than I hoped for  as I am going the same way myself  having been detained here two days by the floods  which  I hope  by to morrow will be found passable    I testified the pleasure I should have in his company  and my wife and daughters joining in entreaty  he was prevailed upon to stay supper  The stranger s conversation  which was at once pleassing and instructive  induced me to wish for a continuance of it  but it was now high time to retire and take refreshment against the fatigues of the following day     The next morning we all set forward together  my family on horseback  while Mr  Burchell  our new companion  walked along the foot path by the road side  observing  with a smile  that as we were ill mounted  he would be too generous to attempt leaving us behind  As the floods were not yet subsided  we were obliged to  Page  25  hire a guide  who trotted on before  Mr
