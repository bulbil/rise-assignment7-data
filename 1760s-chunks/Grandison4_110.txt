passed this mountain  yet the cold wind blew quantities of frozen snow in our faces  insomuch that it seemed to me just as if people were employed  all the time we were passing to wound us with the sharpest needles  They indeed call the wind that brings this sharp pointed snow  The Tormenta   An adventure  which any where else might have appeared ridiculous  I was afraid would have proved fatal to one of our chairmen  as I will call them  I had slapt down my hat to screen my eyes from the fury of that deluge of sharp pointed frozen snow  and it was blown off my head  by a sudden gust  down the precipices  I gave it for lost  and was about to bind a handkerchief over the woollen cap  which those people provide to tie under the chin  when one of the assistant carriers  for they are always six in number to every chair  in order to relieve one another  undertook to recover it  I thought it impossible to be done  the passage being  as I imagined  only practicable for birds  However  I promised him a   274 crown reward  if he did  Never could the leaps of the most dextrous of rope dancers be compared to those of this daring fellow  I saw him sometimes jumping from rock to rock  sometimes rolling down a declivity of snow like a ninepin  sometimes running  sometimes hopping  skipping  in short  he descended like lightning to the verge of a torrent  where he sound the hat  He came up almost as quick  and appeared as little fatigued  as if he had never left us   We arrived as the top in two hours  from Lanebourg  and the sun was pretty high above the horizon  Out of a hut  half buried in snow  came some mountaineers  with two poor sledges  drawn by mules  to carry as through the Plain of Mount Cenis  as it is called  which is about four Italian miles in length  to the descent of the Italian side of the mountain  These sledges are not much different from the chairs  or sedans  or horse  we then quitted  only the two under poles are flat  and not so long as the others  and turning up a little at the end  to hinder them from sticking fast in the snow  To the fore ends of the poles are fixed two round sticks  about two feet and a half long  which serve for a support and help to the man who guides the mule  who running on the snow between the mule and the sledge  holds the sticks with eaeh hand   It was diverting to see the two sledgemen striving to out run each other  Encouraged by Sir Charles s generosity  we arrived at the other end of the plain in less than two hours  The man who walked  or rather run  between the sledge and the mule  made a continual noise  halloowing and beating the stubborn beast with his fists  which otherwise would be very slow in its motion   At the énd of this plain we found such another hut as that on the Lanebourg side  Here they took off the smoaking mules from the sledges  to give them rest     275 And now began the most extraordinary way of travelling that can be imagined  The descent of the mountain from the top of this side  to a small village called Novalesa  is four Italian miles  When the show has filled up all the inequalities of the mountain  it looks  in many parts  as smooth and equal as a sugar loaf  It is on the brink of this rapid descent that they put the sledge  The man who is to guide it  sits between the seet of the traveller  who is seated in the elbow chair  with his legs at the outside of the sticks fixed at the fore ends of the flat poles  and holds the two sticks with his hands  and when the sledge has gained the declivity  its own weight carries it down with surprising celerity  But as the immense irregular rocks under the snow make now and then some edges in the declivity  which  if not avoided  would overturn the sledge  the guide  who foresees the danger  by putting his foot strongly and dextrously in the snow next to the precipice  turns the machine  by help of the above mentioned sticks  the contrary way  and  by way of zigzag  goes to the bottom  Such was the velocity of this motion  that we dispatched these four miles in less than five minutes  and  when we arrived at Novalesa  hearing that the snow was very deep most of the way to Susa  and being pleased with our way of travelling  we had some mules put again to the sledges  and ran all the way to the very gates of that city  which is seven miles distant from Mount Cenis   In our way we had a cursory view of the impregnable fortress of Brunetta  the greatest part of which is cut out of the solid rock  and commands that important pass   We rested all night at Susa  and  having bought a very commodious post chaise  we proceeded to Turin  where we dined
