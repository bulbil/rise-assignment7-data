and   sobbed for good part of an hour      As soon as he was somewhat composed  he resumed his seat    Mr  Clinton  says he  are you really sincere in your professions with   respect to my daughter  Shall I be rid of my doubts at once    May I venture to ask you a question on which my own life  as well   as that of my child  may depend   Should it please the Almighty   to raise her from her present bed of sickness  is it actually your   intention to make her your wife       Here I demanded with some warmth Is that a question  sir  at   this time   What reason have I given you to suspect my honour   or my truth  I do not suspect you  my Harry  I do not suspect   you   I know you would not deceive me  but you may have deceived   yourself  Your nature is tender and full of pity  and in the de    plorable state in which my girl lies  your great compassion may   have easily been mistaken by you for love  Your friendship for   me also may have helped to impose upon you  and you may have   construed your regard and attachment to the father into a sentiment   of tenderness and affection for the child  But oh  my Harry   should   any other woman be preferable in your eyes  or should it not be   in my girl s power to win and wear your affections  I shall then   have been instrumental in making you wretched  and my heart   may as well be broken the one way as the other  No  my father    no   I have no foreign Delilahs  no secret amours  no pleasures that   shun the light  My heart is a virgin heart  and my Matilda   possesses it without a rival      From the time that I was sensible of my father s partiality  a   little matter of ambition  whether laudable or otherwise  incited   me to attempt a distinction that would raise me toward a level with   an only brother  who looked down with neglect and contempt upon         192 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      me  Thence I became indefatigable in my studies at school and   college  as also in my application under you  sir  during the first   years of my apprenticeship  and this left me no manner of leisure   for female attachments  Indeed  I dreaded the appearance of any   advances from the sex  and turned from them as I would from so   many gins or pitfalls purposely dug for my destruction  My con    versation  sir  has been very little among the fair   and  excepting   my natural propensity to the sex  I never  till very lately  conceived   a liking for any woman  In truth  my dear father  that lady is not   alive whom my judgment or inclinations would prefer to your   Matilda  You need not fear my being wretched I think myself   most happy in her affections      Then  said he  I pronounce her the happiest of women  And   now  my Harry  I will tell you a secret  From the first time that   I beheld you  I wished you for my daughter   I wished that she   might have charms to attract and fix your heart   but as I feared    and was persuaded that this was not the case  I forbore to indulge   myself in such flattering expectations  You know I never took you   with me to see her at the boarding school   the true reason was    that I dreaded exposing her young and inexperienced heart to such   a temptation  lest she should conceive and languish under a hope    less passion      On her return to town my apprehensions on your score were   much abated  as I imagined that the great number of her gay and   glistering suitors would divide  or at least divert  her attention   from you  and I purposely laid all the business of our house on your   shoulders  that she might have as little of your company as possible      I further had the precaution to warn my child against the danger   of any affection for you  Matty  said I one day  among all this   assembly of fair and fortunate youths you are free and welcome to   choose your companion for life   there is only one who stands ex    cepted only one whom you must not look upon with an eye of ex    pectation  Who is that  papa  My younger brother and partner   in trade  said I  He looks much higher  Matty  than to the   daughter of
