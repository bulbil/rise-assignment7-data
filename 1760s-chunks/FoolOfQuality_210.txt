again  we   embraced  and cried  and kissed  and embraced and kissed again  as   though we never could be tired      In the mean while  the door being open  my cruel Barnaby en    tered  unperceived by either of us   and seeing a strange man so   fond and familiar with me  he opened a long clasped knife which   he had in his pocket  and rushing up  he gave my darling brother   three stabs in the body before he could speak a word or turn about   to defend himself  Then  casting down the knife  in a minute he   was out of the house  and I never saw him more      For a time I stood like a stone  and then  giving a great shriek    I fainted and fell on my brother as he lay weltering in his blood      Our little Mary  in the while  being frighted almost to death    ran about like a wild thing  and alarmed the street  Our neigh    bours crowded in  and sent for the next surgeon  My brother s   wounds were probed and dressed  and he was laid in our spare   bed      Meantime  being forward with child  I fell into strong and un    timely labour  and after very grievous travail was delivered of a   boy  who was christened and called James  after my dear and lately   deceased father      No pains of my own  however  kept me from inquiring after that   dear and lamented brother who had been killed  as I supposed  for   his love to me  But his youth and natural strength carried him   through all dangers  In three months he was up and about  as   well as ever   and in less than three more he set out on another   voyage  from whence he never  never  O never returned       Before he went abroad  my dear and sweet fellow had left me a   note of hand for the receipt of his wages  But in five years after I   heard that he was cast away  or killed by the Barbary people   and   though I went and went again in the middle of my wants  and in   the middle of my sorrows  to ask and to petition for his pay from   the Admiralty  I never could get an answer of any profit or any   comfort      My little Jemmy  however  grew  and throve  and prated apace    and was my only prop under all my afflictions  My husband  in    deed  had left me in pretty circumstances   and  had he but stayed   with me  we should have prospered above our fellows  But what   can a woman do  single  weak  and unprotected  I was imposed   upon by some   by others I was refused payment for the goods that   I had given   and at length I was reduced to poverty  and obliged   to shut up shop      Meantime I had spared no cost on the bringing up of my Jemmy          216 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      I had given him school learning   cond he now was grown a very   towardly and clever boy   and having taken to messages  my sweet   fellow every night used to bring to me whatever he had earned in   the daytime      In the loss of my husband and brother  in the loss of my Barnaby    and in the loss of my Tommy  to be sure I had grief upon grief     so that my health went from me  and next my strength went from   me  and I was not able to work at the washing business as before    But this didn t signify much while my child had his health   for he   had now got a porter s place in the custom house  and  young as he   was  he willingly carried heavy burdens to have the pleasure of   bringing home his hard earnings to his mammy  But about six   weeks ago  may it please your honour  my dear boy fell ill of a   quartan ague  as they call it  under which he and his mother s   heart still continue to labour      As soon as she had ended her short narrative Well  John  said   I  methinks this business will do   in my opinion you have got a   very worthy inheritor of your fortune   what say you to it  John     First  sir  let me ask her a question or two  if you please    Honest woman  draw your chair a little nearer to me  I pray
