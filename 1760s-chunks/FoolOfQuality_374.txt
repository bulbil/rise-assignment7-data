  public  I had the good fortune to be liked by him  so that he suf    fered no day to pass without seeing me  His name was Abenamin     he was accounted a great captain   he exceeded all his dominions   for grace of person and beauty of aspect   and that which ren    dered him still more singular was  that he had given liberty   to all the ladies of his seraglio  and for many years had kept   constant to the reigning sultana  said to be the most exquisite   beauty on earth      As we grew more intimate  in the exuberance of his affection for   his empress he could not refrain from speaking of her to me   and   he promised that  before I departed  I should see and converse   with her a grace  he said  never granted to any other man      At length the day being appointed for my public entry  I rode               THE FOOL OF QUALITY  417     through the city attended by a sumptuous train  and  alighting   before the palace  advanced to the hall of audience      The emperor was seated  with his sultana at his right hand  upon   a throne of ivoiy  As soon as I had approached the presence  and   began to open my commission  the empress gave a great shriek    and fell over in a swoon upon the bosom of her husband      The royal Abenamin instantly turned pale as death tore off her   veil with trembling hands to give her air and called me to his   assistance  as it is accounted profanation for any Moor to touch the   person of the empress  But heaven   O my friends   think what   was my astonishment when  in the pale face of the queen  I beheld   the loved features of our darling Eloisa       The court broke up in confusion  and her women came hurrying   with drops and essences  As soon as she recovered  she opened   her eyes upon me  and reaching out her arms  and catching me   to her  she cried O my uncle  my dearest uncle   am I so blessed   then  as to behold you before I expire       The monarch  in the mean time  looked upon me with a jealous   eye  and twice put his hand to the haft of his dagger  but checked   his rising indignation till he should have the mystery of his   queen s behaviour explained  The women then raised her up and   bore her to her apartment   while the emperor  turning to me   with no very friendly aspect  ordered me to follow him      When I had attended a considerable time in the ante chamber    he came forth with a serene and joyous countenance  and embracing   me  cried O my friend   my dear kinsman   how transported I am   to find and acknowledge you for such   the parent of my angel   becomes a part of myself      He then led me by the hand into the bed chamber of my Eloisa    where we renewed our caresses without restraint  But the monarch    fearing that these emotions would be too much for her  told me that   he had something for my private ear till dinner  and took me into   an adjoining closet      There seating  and taking me affectionately by the hand  I will   now tell you  iny uncle  says he  how I came by this inestimable   treasure of your niece      I had fitted out a royal ship of my own  not as a corsair  but   rather for trade in the Mediterranean  On their return from the   coast of Egypt  as they passed  after a violent hurricane  within     sight of old Carthage  my people perceived at a distance a sloop   stranded on a shoal of sand about a league from the shore  Im    mediately they sent out a boat  and took the distressed company   in  consisting of my charmer  two female companions  and three   servants in livery  beside the boatmen      The iritenrlants of my ship behaved themselves with all possible   respect toward the young lady and her attendants   and endeavoured   to quiet her terrors by assuring her that she was free  and that   their prince was a person of too much honour and humanity to   derive any advantage from the disasters of the unfortunate      The moment that they brought her before me  pale  trembling    and in tears   while she dropped on her knees  and lifted to me her   fine eyes
