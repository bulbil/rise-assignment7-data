my heart  when I assure you  that no man breathing can more respect you  than  Sir   Your most faithful and obedient Servant  THOMAS DEANE   LETTER XIV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To THO  DEANE  ETo THO  DEANE  Esq   Thursday  Oct  5   YOU know not  my dear Mr  Deane upon what an unthankful man you would bestow your favours  I pretend not to be above complying with the   52 laudable customs of the world  Princes are examples to themselves  I have always  in things indifferent  been willing to take the world as I find it  and conform to it   To say Miss Byron is a treasure in herself  is what every man would say  who has the honour to know her  Yet I would not  in a vain ostentation  as the interest of a man and his wife is one  make a compliment to my affection by resigning or giving from her her natural right  especially as there is no one of her family that wants to be benefited by such gifts or resignations  But then I will not allow  that any of her friends shall part with what is theirs  to supply—What  A supposed deficiency in her fortune  And by whom  as implied by you  supposed a deficiency —By me  and it is left to me to confirm the imputation by my acceptance of the addition so generously  as to the intention  offered  Had I incumbrances on my estate  which  undischarged  would involve in difficulties the woman I love  I know not what  for her sake  I might be tempted to do  But avarice only can induce a man who wants it not to accept of the bounty of a Lady s friends  in their life time especially—When those friends are not either father or mother  one of them not a relation by blood  tho  he is by a nearer tye  that of Love  And it is not the fortune which the Lady possesses  in her own right  an ample one   I am as rich as I wish to be  my dear Mr  Deane  Were my income less  I would live within it  were it more  it would increase my duties  Permit me  my good Sir to ask  Has the MAN  as you call him  and a MAN indeed he appears to me to be  who intends to make so noble a present to a stranger  no relations  no friends  who would have reason to think themselves unkindly treated  if he gave from them such a large portion of his fortune   I would not be thought romantic  neither aim I at   53 ostentation  I would be as glad to follow  as to set  a good example  Can I have a nobler  if Miss Byron honours me with her hand  than she  in that case  will give in preferring me to the Earl of D  a worthy man  with a much more splendid fortune than mine  Believe me  my dear Mr  Deane  it would  on an event so happy  be a restraint to my own joy before friends so kindly contributing to the increase of her fortune  lest they should imagine that their generosity on the occasion  was one of the motives of my gratitude to her for her goodness to me   You tell me  that Miss Byron knows nothing of your proposals  I beseech you  let her not know anything of them  Abase not so much  in her eye  the man who presumes on her favour for the happiness of the rest of his life  by supposing  Your supposition  Sir  may have weight with her  he could value her the more for such an addition to her fortune  No  Sir  Let Miss Byron  satisfied with the consciousness of a worth which all the world acknowleges  in one of the most solemn events of her life look round among her congratulating friends with that modest confidence which the sense of laying a high obligation on a favoured object gives to diffident merit  and which the receiving of favours from all her friends  as if to supply a supposed defective worth  must either abate  or  if it do not  make her think less of the interested man  who could submit to owe such obligations   If these friendly expostulations conclude against the offer of your generous friend  they equally do so against that of Mr  Selby  Were that Gentleman and his Lady the parents of Miss Byron  the case would be different  But Miss Byron s fortune is an ascertained one  and Mr  Selby has relations who stand in an equal degree of consanguinity to him  and who are all intitled  by their worthiness  to his favour  My best respects and thanks are however due  and I beg you   54 will make my acknowledgments accordingly  as well to your worthy friend  as to Mr  Selby   I take the liberty to send you down the rent roll of my English estate  Determine for me as you please  my dearest Mr  Deane  Only take this caution—Affront me not a second time  but let the settlements be such  as may be fully
