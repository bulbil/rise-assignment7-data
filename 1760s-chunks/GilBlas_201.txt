her malady  She has an incurable ulcer in her back  which I come every evening to dress  This is the real occasion of those visits which disturb your peace  Henceforward  rest assured that you have her all to yourself  But if you are not satisfied with this expectation  and are absolutely bent on a fencing match  you have only to say so  I am not a man to turn my back upon a game at sword play  With these words in his mouth he drew his long rapier  which made my heart jump into my throat  and stood upon his guard  It is enough  said I  putting my sword up again in its scabbard  I am not a wild beast  to turn a deaf ear to reason  after what you have told me  there is no cause of enmity between us  Let us shake hands  At this proposal  by which he found out that I was not such a devil of a fellow as he had taken me for  he returned his weapon with a laugh  met my advances to be reconciled  and we parted the best friends in the world   From that time forward Sephora never came into my thoughts but with the most disgusting associations  I shunned all the opportunities she gave me of entertaining her in private  and this with so obvious a study  almost bordering on rudeness  that she could not but notice it  Astonished at so sudden a reverse  she was dying to know the cause  and at length  finding the means of pinning me down to a tête à tête  Good Mr Steward  said she  tell me  if so please you  why you avoid the very sight of me  It is true that I made the first advances  but then you fed the consuming fire  Recall to memory  if it is not too great a favour  the private interview we had together  Then you were a magazine of combustibles  now you are as frozen as the north sea  What is the meaning of all this  The question was not a little difficult of solution  for a man unaccustomed to the violence of amorous interrogatories  The consequence was  that it puzzled me most confoundedly  I do not precisely recollect the identical lie I told the lady  but I recollect perfectly that nothing but the truth could have affronted her more highly  Sephora  though by her mincing air and modest outside one might have taken her for a lamb  was a tigress when the savage was roused in her nature  I did think  said she  darting a glance at me full of malice and hideousness  I did think to have conferred such honour as was never conferred before  on a little scoundrel like you  by betraying sentiments which the first nobility in the country would make it their boast to excite  Fitly indeed am I punished for having preposterously lowered myself to the level of a dirty  snivelling adventurer   That was pretty well  but she did not stop there  I should have come off too cheaply on such terms  Her fury taking a long lease of her tongue  that brawling instrument of discord rung a bob  major of invective  each strain more clamorous and confounding than the former  It certainly was my duty to have received it all with cool indifference  and to have considered candidly that in triumphing over female reserve  and then not taking possession of the conquest  I had committed that sin against the sex  which would have transformed the most feminine of them into a Sephora  But I was too irritable to bear abuse  at which a man of sense in my place would only have laughed  and my patience was at length exhausted  Madam  said I  let us not rake into each other s personal misfortunes  If the first nobility in the country had only looked at your back  they would have forgotten all your other charms  and have boasted but little of the sentiments they had excited you to betray  I had no sooner laid in this home stroke  then the enraged duenna visited me with the hardest box on the ear that ever yet proceeded from the delicate fingers of a woman scorned  Such favours might pall on repetition  so I did not wait for a second  but took shelter in the nimbleness of my legs from the clatter of castigation she was going to shower down on me   I returned thanks to the protecting powers for having brought me clear off from this unequal encounter  and fancied that I had nothing further to apprehend  since the lady had taken corporal vengeance  It was likely  too  that she would be wise and hold her tongue  for the honour of her own back  and  in point of fact  a full fortnight had elapsed without my hearing a word upon the subject The very tingling in my own cheek began to abate  when I was told that Sephora was taken ill  With that forgiveness of injuries so natural to me  I was sincerely afflicted at the news  I really felt for the poor lady  I concluded that  unable to contend with a passion so ill repaid  that hapless victim of her own tenderness was giving up the ghost  It was with exquisite pain that I turned this subject in my
