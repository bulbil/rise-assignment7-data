they have behaved them    selves greatly   I cannot but respect  while I envy  while I hate   them  for leaving us no share in the honour of this action  save   that of granting a poor  and indispensable pardon      I admit they have deserved every thing that is evil at your   hands  They have proved the most inveterate and efficacious of   your enemies  They alone have withstood the rapid course of   your conquests  and have withheld from you the crown to which   you were born  Is it therefore that you would reward them    that you would gratify their desires that you would indulge their   ambition  and en wreath them with everlasting glory and applause       But if such a death would exalt mechanics over the fame of the   most illustrious heroes  how would the name of my Edward  with   all his triumphs and honours  be tarnished thereby  Would it   not be said that magnanimity and virtue are grown odious in the   eyes of the monarch of Britain  and that the objects whom he   destines to the punishment of felons  are the very men who deserve   the praise and esteem of mankind  The stage on which they   would suffer would be to them a stage of honour   but a stage   of shame to Edward a reproach to his conquests a dark and   indelible disgrace to his name       No  my lord  let us rather disappoint the saucy ambition of   these burghers  who wish to invest themselves with glory at our   expense  We cannot  indeed  wholly deprive them of the merit   of a sacrifice so nobly intended   but we may cut them short of   their desires  in the place of that death by which their glory   would be consummated  let us bury them under gifts  let us put   them to shame with praises  we shall thereby defeat them of   that popular opinion which never fails to attend those who suffer   in the cause of virtue      I am convinced you have prevailed be it so  cried Edward   prevent the execution have them instantly before us       They came   when the queen  with an aspect and accents diffusing   sweetness  thus bespoke them       Natives of France  and inhabitants of Calais   Ye have put us   to vast expense of blood and treasure in the recovery of our   just and natural inheritance   but you acted up to the best of   an erroneous judgment  and we admire and honour in you that   valour and virtue by which we are so long kept out of our   rightful possessions      You noble burghers you excellent citizens  though you were   tenfold the enemies of our person and our throne  we can feel   nothing on our part save respect and affection for you  You   have been sufficiently tested  We loose your chains  we snatch   you from the scaffold   and we thank you for that lesson of humilia    tion which you teach us  when you shew us that excellence is not         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          39         of blood  of title  or station that virtue gives a dignity superior   to that of kings  and that those whom the Almighty informs   with sentiments like yours  are justly and eminently raised above   all human distinctions      You are now free to depart to your kinsfolk  your countrymen   to all those whose lives and liberties you have so nobly redeemed   provided you refuse not to carry with you the due tokens of   our esteem      Yet we would rather bind you to ourselves by every endearing   obligation   and  for this purpose  we offer to you your choice of   the gifts and honours that Edward has to bestow  Kivals for   fame  but always friends to virtue  we wish that England were   entitled to call you her sons      Ah  my country   exclaimed St  Pierre  it is now that I tremble   for you  Edward could only win your cities  but Philippa con    quers hearts      Brave St  Pierre  said the queen  wherefore look ye so dejected     Ah  madam   replied St  Pierre  when I meet with such another   opportunity of dying  I shall not regret that I survived this day      Here a long pause ensued  At length the earl recollected   himself  Mr  Meekly  said he  you have now proved to me your   position more effectually  more convincingly  than all the powers   of ratiocination could possibly do  While
