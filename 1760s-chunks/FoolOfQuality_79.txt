I make   a present of all these things to my Harry  And now tell me  my   love  what will you do with them  Why  dada  says Harry  you   know that I cannot wear them myself  No  my dear  says Mr    Fenton  for you have clothes enough beside  and some of them   would not fit you  and others would smother you  What then   will you do with them  will you burn them  or throw them away     O  that would be very naughty and wicked indeed   says Harry    No  dada  as I do not want them myself  I will give them to those   that do  That will be very honestly done of you  says Mr  Fenton    for  in truth  they have a better right to them  my Harry  than you   have  and that which you cannot use cannot belong to you  So   that  in giving you these things  my darling  it should seem as   if I made you no gift at all  O  a very sweet gift   says Harry    How is that  says Mr  Fenton  Why  the gift of doing good to   other people  sir  Mr  Fenton  then stepping back  and gazing on   our hero  cried Whoever attempts to instruct thee  my angel    must himself be instructed of heaven  who speaks by that sweet   mouth      But Harry  it would not be discreet of you to give these things   to the common beggars who come every day to our door  give   them victuals and halfpence or pence a piece  and welcome   but   if you give such beggars twenty suits of clothes  they will cast   them all off and put on their rags again  to move people to pity   them  But when you spy any poor travellers going the road  and   your eyes see that they are naked  or your heart tells you that   they are hungry  then do not wait till they beg of you  but go and   beg of them to favour you with their acceptance   then take them   unto the fire and warm them and feed them  and when you have   so done  take them up to your storeroom and clothe them with   whatever you think they want   and believe me  my Harry  when    ever you are cold  or hungry  or wounded  or in want  or in sickness   yourself  the very remembrance of your having clothed  and fed    and cured  and comforted the naked and the hungry  the wounded   and the afflicted  will be warmth  and food  and medicine  and balm   to your own mind      While Mr  Fenton spoke  the muscles of Harry s expressive   countenance  like an equally tuned instrument  uttered unisons to   every word he heard      From this day forward  Harry and Ned by turns were frequently   out on the watch   and often single  or in pairs  or by whole families          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  65     Harry would take in a poor father and mother  with their help    less infants  driven perhaps from house or home by fire or other   misfortune  or oppressive landlord  or ruthless creditor   and having   warmed  and fed  and clothed  and treated the old ones as his   parents  and the little ones as his brothers and sisters  he would   give them additional money for charges on the road  and send them   away the happiest of all people except himself      By this time  Mr  Fenton had inquired into the circumstances   and characters of all the poor in the town and throughout the   precincts   and  having refuted or confirmed the intelligence he had   received  by a personal inspection and visit from house to house    and having made entries of all such as he deemed real objects   and worthy of his beneficence  he invited the heads of the several   families to take a dinner with him every Sunday at his hall      On the following Sunday there came about thirty of these   visitants  which number soon increased to fifty weekly guests      On entering  they found the cloth ready spread  and Mr  James    having counted heads  laid a crown in silver upon every plate    which first course was a most relishing sauce to all that followed    A plentiful dinner was then introduced  and the guests being seated    Mr  Fenton  Harry  Ned  and the four domestics attended  and   disposed themselves in a manner the most ready to supply the
