absence may bring me to a perfect indifference       Thus  Louisa  continued she  you see the beginning and end of an   adventure which has made some noise in town  to be out of which I have   taken a resolution to travel till the whole shall be forgotten  and I   have entirely rooted out of my heart all manner of consideration for   this ungrateful man       Louisa thanked her for the condescension me had made her in entrusting   her with so important a secret  and said every thing she could in praise   of the resolution she had taken to leave England for a time  not only   because it was exactly conformable to her own desires  but also that she   thought it so laudable in itself  Melanthe then assured her that she was   not capable of changing her mind in this particular  and that her   equipage was getting ready at London for that purpose  so that she   believed they should embark in a few days  Louisa  on hearing this    said  that she must then provide herself with some things it would be   necessary for her to have in order to appear in the station her ladyship   was pleased to place her  but the other  who  as may be seen by her   history  never preserved a medium in any thing  would not suffer her to   be at the least expence on that account  but took the care of furnishing   her with every thing on herself  and accordingly sent a man and horse to   town directly to her mercer s  draper s  milliner s  and other   tradesmen  with orders to send down silks  laces  hollands  and whatever   else was requisite  which being brought  were put to be made fit for   wearing by workwomen at Windsor  so that now our Louisa made as good a   figure  and had as great a variety of habits as when under the   guardianship of Dorilaus  and  to complete her happiness  this new   benefactress grew every day more  and more delighted with her company       All being now prepared  they came to London  where they lay but one   night before they took shipping for Helvoetsluys in Holland  where    being safely landed  they proceeded to Utrecht  and so to   Aix la chappelle  there they stayed some weeks for the sake of the   waters  air  and good company  and Louisa thought it so pleasant  that   she would have been glad not to have removed for some time longer  but   Melanthe was yet restless in her mind  and required frequent change of   place  Here it was  however  that Louisa thought she might venture to   write to Dorilaus  to ease him of that kind concern she doubted not but   he was in for her welfare  by the advertisement already mentioned in the   Gazette  The purport of her letter was as follows        Ever Honoured Sir         Child of your bounty as I am  I flatter myself   that  in spight of my enforc d disobedience    it would be a trouble to you to hear I should   do any thing unworthy of that education you were   pleased to bestow on me  I therefore take the liberty   of acquainting you  that heaven has raised   me a protectress in a lady of quality with whom   I now am  as you will see by the date of this  at   Aix la chappelle  As all the favours I receive   from her  or all the good that shall happen during   my whole life is  and will be entirely owing   to you as the fountain head  it will be always my   inclination  as well as duty  to pay you the tribute   of grateful thanks   Poor recompence    alas  for all you have done for me  yet those    with my incessant prayers to heaven  are all in   the power of       Your most dutiful       LOUISA        She took no notice of the advertisement  not only as she could not be   positive it related to herself  as also because she thought  if he were   certain she had read it  he might resent her not answering it  as   discovering a too great diffidence of his honour  She added  however  a   postscript  entreating him to let her brother know  that whatever   happened  he should have no reason to find fault with her conduct       After they left Aix la chappelle  they took bye roads to avoid the   armies  yet notwithstanding all their care  they now and then met   parties who were out on foraging  but as it happened  they were always
