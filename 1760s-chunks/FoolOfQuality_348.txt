apparent in the face of my preserver      It is with shame and great reluctance  my dearest brother  that   at times I recite passages tending so much to my own praise     and yet  did I omit them  I should do great injustice to the kind   and amiable partiality of those who were so fondly my lovers and   my beloved      But  madam  said I to the marchioness  did you not hint some    thing of his majesty s being enamoured of my Louisa   Ah  such a   rival would be a terrible business indeed  especially in a country   of unlimited power       There is no fear of that now  said my lady  The king has   changed his fancy  from young mistresses and old counsellors  to         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  385     young counsellors and old mistresses  But what I mentioned was   once very serious and alarming      My Louisa was scarce turned of fourteen  when the Duchess   de Choisseul requested her company to Marlay  where the court   then was  The king fixed his eye on her  and inquired who she   was   but took no further notice at that time  Missing her  how    ever  at the next  and again at the following drawing room  he   asked the marquis what became of his fair daughter   said he had   a place in his eye for her   and desired  in an accent of authority    that he would send her to court      The marquis instantly took the alarm  He was ever jealous   of his honour  and singularly nice in matters of female reputation    He gave his majesty a sort of equivocal consent   and  hurrying   home  ordered me directly to prepare for carrying my daughter put   of the French dominions  The night was employed in hastening   and packing  We disguised our Louisa in the manner as you   saw her metamorphosed at Kotterdam  and set off for Holland   before day  The rest you know  my Clinton  as you were the prin    cipal mover in all our concerns  But tell me  my Lewis  can you   conjecture on what account those assassins set upon you   I declare    madam  said the marquis  I cannot   perhaps they mistook me for   another   or  now I recollect  it might be owing to some familiar   chat which I had the other night with a pretty opera girl  who is   said to be in the keeping of a very great man  But  madam  you   forgot to tell my brother how my father was banished  on account   of Louisa  to his paternal seat in Languedoc  on the borders of the   Mediterranean  Very true  said the marchioness  and was not   recalled till Madam Maintenon was taken into supreme favour      But I wonder what is become of our faithful Gerard   I thought   that he would have been the first to come  and to throw himself at   the feet of his hero  Indeed  my Harry  he would have tired any    who love you less  with his praises  and perpetual talking of you and   your exploits  O  here he comes   Step in  Gerard  Is there any   one in this company that you remember beside the family       Gerard then advanced with a half frantic aspect  and  kneeling   and grappling at my hand  seemed desirous of devouring it  God   be praised  he cried  God be praised  my noble  my glorious   master  that I see you once again   and above all  that I have the   blessing of seeing you in a place where a throne of beaten gold   should be raised to your honour  O  had I been here  all sorts   of respects and worships  instead of indignities  should have been   paid to your deservings  But I have provided for the hang dog   Jacome   I have tied him neck and heels  and tumbled him into a   dark vault      Ay  said I   but my good friend  Gerard  I have not yet got my   share of satisfaction upon him   pray  show me where he is  I then   followed Gerard to the place where the deplorable wretch was   cast   and  cutting all his cords  I led him back to the company  and   warmly joined his petition for pardon and restoration      As soon as Jacome and Gerard were withdrawn Ah  my brother     cried the marquis  what new name shall we find for a man of your   new character
