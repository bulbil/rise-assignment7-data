  As we were on our way to Don Matthias s house  this honest shopkeeper said    It is fit  methinks  that you should be let into the steward s character  His name is Gregorio Rodriguez  Between ourselves  he is a man of low birth  with a talent for intrigue  in which vocation he has laboured till a stewardship in two distressed families completed their ruin  and made his fortune  I give you notice  that his vanity is excessive  he loves to see the under servants creeping and crawling at his feet  It is with him they must make interest if they have any favour to beg of their master  for should they happen to obtain it without his interference  he has always some shift or other at hand to get the boon revoked  or at least render it of no avail  Regulate your conduct on this hint  Gil Blas  pay court to Signor Rodriguez in preference to your master himself  and leave no stone unturned to get into his good graces  His friendship will be of material service to you  He will pay your wages to the day  and  if you have management enough to worm yourself into his confidence  you may chance to pick up some of the fragments which fall from his table  There are enough for an hungrier dog than you  Don Matthias is a young nobleman  with no thought to throw away but on his pleasures  nor the slightest suspicion how his own affairs are going on  What a house for a steward who knows how to be a steward   When we got to our journey s end  we asked to speak with Signor Rodriguez  We were told that we should find him in his own apartment  There he was  sure enough  and with him a clownish sort of fellow holding a blue bag  full of money  The steward  looking more wan and yellow than a girl in a hurry for a husband  ran up to Melendez with open arms  the draper was not behindhand with him  and they each hugged the other with a shew of friendship  at least as much indebted to art as nature for its plausible effect  After this  the next question was about me  Rodriguez examined me from top to toe  saying very civilly at the same time that I was just such an one as Don Matthias wanted  and that he would with pleasure take upon himself to present me to that nobleman  Thereupon Melendez gave him to understand how deeply he was interested in my behalf  he begged the steward to take me under his protection  and leaving me with him  after plenty of compliments  withdrew  As soon as he was gone out  Rodriguez said  I will introduce you to my master the moment I have dispatched this honest husbandman  He called the country man to him forthwith  and taking his bag  Talego  said he  let us see if the five hundred pistoles are all right  He counted over the money himself  As the sum was found to be exact  the countryman took a receipt and went away  The cash was put back again into the bag  It was my turn next to be attended to  We may now  said my new patron  go to my master s levee  He usually gets up about noon  it is now near one o clock  and must be daylight in his apartment   Don Matthias had indeed just risen  He was still in his morning gown  kicking his heels in a great chair  with a leg tossed over one of the elbows  swinging backwards and forwards  and manufacturing his own snuff  His conversation was addressed to a footman in waiting  who officiated as a temporary valet de  chambre  My lord  said the steward  here is a young man whom I take the liberty of presenting to your lordship in the place of him you discharged the day before yesterday  Your draper  Melendez  has given him a character  he undertakes for his qualifications  and I believe you will be very well pleased with him  That is enough  answered the young nobleman  since he has your recommendation  I adopt him blindfold into my retinue  He is my valet de chambre at once  that business is settled  Let us talk of other matters  Rodriguez  you are come just in time  I was going to send for you  I have a budget of bad news  my dear Rodriguez  I played with ill luck last night  an hundred pistoles in my pocket lost  and two hundred more on credit  You know how indispensable it is for persons of high rank to pay their debts of honour  As for any other  it is no matter when they are paid  Punctuality is all very well between one tradesman and another  but they cannot expect it from one of us  These two hundred pistoles must be raised forthwith and sent to the Countess de Pedrosa  Sir  quoth the steward  that is sooner said than done  Where  prythee  am I to get such a sum  Threaten as I will  I never touch a maravedi from your tenants  And yet your establishment is to be kept up in style  and I am wearing myself to a thread
