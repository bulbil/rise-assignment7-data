any danger of being detected  by his commodore  who could not for an hour recollect himself from the  amazement and consternation which had overpowered his faculties   At length  however  he got up  and rang his bell with great agitation   He repeated the summons more than once  but no regard being paid to this  alarm  his dread returned with double terror  a cold sweat bedewed his  limbs  his knees knocked together  his hair bristled up  and the remains  of his teeth were shattered in pieces in the convulsive vibrations of  his jaws   In the midst of this agony he made one desperate effort  and  bursting  open the door of apartment  bolted into Hatchway s chamber  which  happened to be on the same floor  There he found the lieutenant in  a counterfeit swoon  who pretended to wake from his trance in an  ejaculation of  Lord have mercy upon us   and being questioned by the  terrified commodore with regard to what had happened  assured him he had  heard the same voice and clap of thunder by which Trunnion himself had  been discomposed   Pipes  whose turn it was to watch  concurred in giving evidence to the  same purpose  and the commodore not only owned that he had heard the  voice  but likewise communicated his vision  with all the aggravation  which his disturbed fancy suggested   A consultation immediately ensued  in which Mr  Hatchway gravely  observed that the finger of Heaven was plainly perceivable in those  signals  and that it would be both sinful and foolish to disregard its  commands  especially as the match proposed was  in all respects  more  advantageous than any that one of his years could reasonably expect   declaring that for his own part he would not endanger his soul and body  by living one day longer under the same roof with a man who despised the  will of Heaven  and Tom Pipes adhered to the same pious resolution   Trunnion s perseverance could not resist the number and diversity  of considerations that assaulted it  he revolved in silence all the  opposite motives that occurred to his reflection  and after having been   to all appearance  bewildered in the labyrinth of his own thoughts  he  wiped the sweat from his forehead  and  heaving a piteous groan  yielded  to their remonstrances in these words   Well  since it must be so  I  think we must ev n grapple  But d   my eyes   tis a d  d hard case  that a fellow of my years should be compelled  d ye see  to beat up  to windward all the rest of my life against the current of my own  inclination    This important article being discussed  Mr  Hatchway set out in the  morning to visit the despairing shepherdess  and was handsomely rewarded  for the enlivening tidings with which he blessed her ears  Sick as  she was  she could not help laughing heartily at the contrivance  in  consequence of which her swain s assent had been obtained  and gave the  lieutenant ten guineas for Tom Pipes  in consideration of the part he  acted in the farce   In the afternoon the commodore suffered himself to be conveyed to her  apartment  like a felon to execution  and was received by her in  a languishing manner  and genteel dishabille  accompanied by her  sister in law  who was  for very obvious reasons  extremely solicitous    6 22 15  3 45 PM   about her success  Though the lieutenant had tutored him touching his  behaviour it this interview  he made a thousand wry faces before he  could pronounce the simple salutation of  How d ye   to his mistress   and after his counsellor had urged him with twenty or thirty whispers   to each of which he had replied aloud   D   your eyes  I won t   he got  up  and halting towards the couch on which Mrs  Grizzle reclined in a  state of strange expectation  he seized her hand and pressed it to his  lips  but this piece of gallantry he performed in such a reluctant   uncouth  indignant manner  that the nymph had need of all her resolution  to endure the compliment without shrinking  and he himself was so  disconcerted at what he had done  that he instantly retired to the  other end of the room  where he sat silent  and broiled with shame and  vexation   Mrs  Pickle  like a sensible matron  quitted the place  on pretence of  going to the nursery  and Mr  Hatchway  taking the hint  recollected  that he had left his tobacco pouch in the parlour  whither he descended   leaving the two lovers to their mutual endearments  Never had the  commodore found himself in such a disagreeable dilemma before  He sat in  an agony of suspense  as if he every moment dreaded the dissolution of  nature  and the imploring sighs of his future bride added  if possible   to the pangs of his distress  Impatient of this situation  he rolled  his
