  THE ADVENTURES OF PEREGRINE PICKLE  In which are included Memoirs of a Lady of Quality  By Tobias Smollett  VOLUME I    CHAPTER I    An Account of Mr  Gamaliel Pickle  The Disposition of his Sister  described  He yields to her Solicitations  and returns to the Country   In a certain county of England  bounded on one side by the sea  and at  the distance of one hundred miles from the metropolis  lived Gamaliel  Pickle  esq   the father of that hero whose fortunes we propose to  record  He was the son of a merchant in London  who  like Rome  from  small beginnings had raised himself to the highest honours of the city   and acquired a plentiful fortune  though  to his infinite regret  he  died before it amounted to a plum  conjuring his son  as he respected  the last injunction of a parent  to imitate his industry  and adhere to  his maxims  until he should have made up the deficiency  which was a sum  considerably less than fifteen thousand pounds   This pathetic remonstrance had the desired effect upon his  representative  who spared no pains to fulfil the request of the  deceased  but exerted all the capacity with which nature had endowed  him  in a series of efforts  which  however  did not succeed  for by the  time he had been fifteen years in trade  he found himself five thousand  pounds worse than he was when he first took possession of his father s  effects  a circumstance that affected him so nearly  as to detach his  inclinations from business  and induce him to retire from the world to  some place where he might at leisure deplore his misfortunes  and  by  frugality  secure himself from want  and the apprehensions of a jail   with which his imagination was incessantly haunted  He was often heard  to express his fears of coming upon the parish  and to bless God  that   on account of his having been so long a housekeeper  he was entitled  to that provision  In short  his talents were not naturally active  and  there was a sort of inconsistency in his character  for  with all the  desire of amassing which any citizen could possibly entertain  he was  encumbered by a certain indolence and sluggishness that prevailed over  every interested consideration  and even hindered him from profiting by  that singleness of apprehension  and moderation of appetites  which have  so frequently conduced to the acquisition of immense fortunes   qualities which he possessed in a very remarkable degree  Nature  in all  probability  had mixed little or nothing inflammable in his composition   or  whatever seeds of excess she might have sown within him  were  effectually stifled and destroyed by the austerity of his education   The sallies of his youth  far from being inordinate or criminal  never  exceeded the bounds of that decent jollity which an extraordinary pot   on extraordinary occasions  may be supposed to have produced in a club  of sedate book keepers  whose imaginations were neither very warm nor  luxuriant  Little subject to refined sensations  he was scarce ever  disturbed with violent emotions of any kind  The passion of love never  interrupted his tranquility  and if  as Mr  Creech says  after Horace       Not to admire is all the art I know       To make men happy  and to keep them so   Mr  Pickle was undoubtedly possessed of that invaluable secret  at  least  he was never known to betray the faintest symptom of transport   except one evening at the club  where he observed  with some  demonstrations of vivacity  that he had dined upon a delicate loin of  veal   Notwithstanding this appearance of phlegm  he could not help feeling his  disappointments in trade  and upon the failure of a certain underwriter   by which he lost five hundred pounds  declared his design of  relinquishing business  and retiring to the country  In this resolution  he was comforted and encouraged by his only sister  Mrs  Grizzle  who  had managed his family since the death of his father  and was now in  the thirtieth year of her maidenhood  with a fortune of five thousand  pounds  and a large stock of economy and devotion     6 22 15  3 45 PM   These qualifications  one would think  might have been the means of  abridging the term of her celibacy  as she never expressed any aversion  to wedlock  but  it seems  she was too delicate in her choice  to find  a mate to her inclination in the city  for I cannot suppose that she  remained so long unsolicited  though the charms of her person were  not altogether enchanting  nor her manner over and above agreeable   Exclusive of a very wan  not to call it sallow  complexion  which   perhaps  was the effects of her virginity and mortification  she had  a cast in her eyes that was not at all engaging  and such an extent of
