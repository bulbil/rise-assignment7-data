as I did of such an event before I went over  because of the articles of Religion and Residence  I had not sought to engage more than her friendship  and I devoted myself wholly to Clementina—I own it  Ladies—And had I thought  Angel as she came out  upon proof  that I could not have given her my heart  I had been equally unjust  and ungrateful  For  dear Ladies  if you know all her story  you must know  that occasion called her out to act gloriously  and that gloriously she answered the call   He paused  We were still silent  My grandmamma and aunt looked at each other by turns  But their eyes  as well as mine  at different parts of his speech shewed their sensibility  He proceeded  gracefully looking down  and at first with some little hesitation   I am sensible  it was with a very ill grace  that  refused  as I must in justice call it  tho  on the noblest motives  by Clementina  I come to offer myself  and so soon after her refusal  to a Lady of Miss Byron s delicacy  I should certainly have acted more laudably  respecting my own character only  had I taken at least the usual time of a Widower Love  But great minds  such as Miss Byron s  and yours  Ladies  are above common forms  where decorum is not too much neglected  As to myself  what do I  but declare a passion  that would have been  but for one obstacle  which is now removed  as servent as man ever knew  Dr  Bartlett has told me  madam  to me   that you and my sisters have seen the Letters I wrote to him from Italy  By the contents of some of those  and of the Letters I left with you  madam  to my grandmamma   you have seen Clementina s constant adherence to the step she so greatly took  In this Letter  received but last Wednesday  taking one out of   83 his bosom   you will see  my last Letters to them unreceived  as they must be  that I am urged by all her family  for the sake of setting her an example  to address myself to a Lady of my own country  This impels me  as I may say  to accelerate the humble tender of my vows to you  madam  However hasty the step may be thought  in my situation  Would not an inexcusable neglect  or seeming indifference  as if I were balancing as to the person  have been attributable to me  had I  for dull and cold form s sake  been capable of postponing the declaration of my affection to Miss Byron  And if  madam  you can so far get over observances  which perhaps  on consideration  will be found to be punctilious only  as to give your heart  with your hand  to a man who himself has been perplexed by what some would call  particular as it sounds  a double Love  an embarrasment  however  not of his own seeking  or which he could possibly avoid  you will lay him under obligation to your goodness  to your magnanimity  I will call it  which all the affectionate tenderness of my life to come will never enable me to discharge   He then put the Letter  a translation of it inclosed  into my hand  I have already answered it  madam  said he  and acquainted my friend  that I have actually tendered myself to the acceptance of a Lady worthy of a sisterly relation to their Clementina  and have not been rejected  Your goodness must enable me  I humbly hope it will  to give them still stronger assurances of your favour  On my happiness they have the generosity to build a part of their own   Not well before  I was more than once apprehensive of fainting  as he talked  agreeable as was his talk  and engaging as was his manner  My grandmamma and aunt saw my complexion change at his particular address to me  in the last part of his speech  Each put her kind hand on one of mine  and held it on it  as my other hand held my handkerchief now   84 to my eyes  and now as a cover to my self felt varying cheek   At the same moment that he ceased speaking  he took our triply united hands in both his  and in the most respectful  yet graceful manner  his Letter laid in my lap  pressed each of the three with his lips  mine twice  I could not speak  My grandmamma and aunt  delighted  yet tears standing in their eyes  looked upon each other  and upon me  each as expecting the other to speak  I have perhaps  said he  with some emotion  taken up too much of Miss Byron s attention on this my first personal declaration  I will now return to the company below  To morrow I will do myself the honour to dine with you  We will for this evening postpone the important subject  Miss Byron  I presume  will be best pleased to have it so  I shall to morrow be favoured with the result
