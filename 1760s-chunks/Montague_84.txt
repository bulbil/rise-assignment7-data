Lordship would have the goodness to employ that interest for him in the purchase of a majority  which you have so generously offered to me  I am determined  as there is no prospect of real duty  to quit the army  and retire to that quiet which is so pleasing at my time of life  I am privately in treaty with a gentleman for my company  and propose returning to England in the first ship  to give in my resignation  in this point  as well as that of serving Mr  Fitzgerald  I shall without scruple call upon your Lordship s friendship       I have settled every thing with Fitzgerald  but without saying a word to Bell  and he is to seduce her into matrimony as soon as he can  without my appearing at all interested in the affair  he is to ask my consent in form  though we have already settled every preliminary       All this  as well as my intention of quitting the army  is yet a secret to my daughter       But to the questions your Lordship does me the honor to ask me in regard to the Americans  I mean those of our old colonies  they appear to me  from all I have heard and seen of them  a rough  ignorant  positive  very selfish  yet hospitable people       Strongly attached to their own opinions  but still more so to their interests  in regard to which they have inconceivable sagacity and address  but in all other respects I think naturally inferior to the Europeans  as education does so much  it is however difficult to ascertain this       I am rather of opinion they would not have refused submission to the stamp act  or disputed the power of the legislature at home  had not their minds been first embittered by what touched their interests so nearly  the restraints laid on their trade with the French and Spanish settlements  a trade by which England was an immense gainer  and by which only a few enormously rich West India planters were hurt       Every advantage you give the North Americans in trade centers at last in the mother country  they are the bees  who roam abroad for that honey which enriches the paternal hive       Taxing them immediately after their trade is restrained  seems like drying up the source  and expecting the stream to flow       Yet too much care cannot be taken to support the majesty of government  and assert the dominion of the parent country       A good mother will consult the interest and happiness of her children  but will never suffer her authority to be disputed       An equal mixture of mildness and spirit cannot fail of bringing these mistaken people  misled by a few of violent temper and ambitious views  into a just sense of their duty       I have the honor to be   My Lord   c   WILLIAM FERMOR     LETTER CXXXIV   134   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   May 5   I HAVE got my Emily again  to my great joy  I am nobody without her  As the roads are already very good  we walk and ride perpetually  and amuse ourselves as well as we can  en attendant your brother  who is gone a settlement hunting       The quickness of vegetation in this country is astonishing  though the hills are still covered with snow  and though it even continues in spots in the vallies  the latter with the trees and shrubs in the woods are already in beautiful verdure  and the earth every where putting forth flowers in a wild and lovely variety and profusion        Tis amazingly pleasing to see the strawberries and wild pansies peeping their little foolish heads from beneath the snow       Emily and I are prodigiously fond after having been separated  it is a divine relief to us both  to have again the delight of talking of our lovers to each other  we have been a month divided  and neither of us have had the consolation of a friend to be foolish to       Fitzgerald dines with us  he comes   Adieu  yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER CXXXV   135   To the Earl of —   Silleri  May 5       My Lord   I HAVE been conversing  if the expression is not improper when I have not had an opportunity of speaking a syllable  more than two hours with a French officer  who has declaimed the whole time with the most astonishing volubility  without uttering one word which could either entertain or instruct his hearers  and even without starting any thing that deserved the name of a thought       People who have no ideas out of the common road are  I believe  generally the greatest talkers  because all their thoughts are low enough for common conversation  whereas those of more elevated understandings have ideas which they cannot easily communicate except to persons of equal capacity with themselves       This might be brought as an argument of the inferiority of womens understanding to ours  as they are generally greater talkers  if we did not consider the limited and trifling educations we give them  men  amongst other advantages  have that of
