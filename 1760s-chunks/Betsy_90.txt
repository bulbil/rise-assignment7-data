and Mr  Chatfree       He answered to Mr  Trueworth s letter  however  with the utmost   complaisance  but without letting him know any part of his intentions in   relation to Miss Betsy  fearing lest any farther contest on this affair   might draw from that gentleman fresh proofs of a generosity to which   already he looked upon himself as too much obliged       Miss Betsy  little suspecting what had passed between her two lovers   since their meeting in the Green Park  received Mr  Trueworth  when he   came to visit her the same day  as usual  with a great deal of   good humour  She took not any notice that she had heard of the duel    imagining that he would himself inform her of it  and he not thinking it   would become him to do so  as having the advantage of his rival  it is   probable there would have been no mention made of it  if Lady Mellasin   had not come into the room  and told him  that she would not have broke   in upon his conversation with Miss Betsy  if it had been possible for   her to have resisted the pleasure of congratulating him  not only on his   safety  but also on his coming off victor in the field of battle       The modesty of Mr  Trueworth would not suffer him to hear these last   words without blushing  but  soon recovering himself   Fortune  Madam     answered he   is not always the most favourable to the most deserving    her partial smiles will never make me vain or happy  unless   continued   he  looking tenderly on Miss Betsy   she would add to her indulgence   here  and give me room to hope my services to this lady might one day be   crowned with the same success as she this morning gave my sword     The   one   said Miss Betsy  smiling   has nothing to do with the other  and I   do not know how to think a man  who really wishes nothing so much as to   appear agreeable in the eyes of his mistress  would run the hazard of   making the contemptible figure of a culprit at the bar of a court of   judicature        They then fell into some discourse on duelling  and Mr  Trueworth could   not help joining with the ladies  in condemning the folly of that   custom  which  contrary to the known laws of the land  and oftentimes   contrary to his own reason too  obliges the gentleman either to obey the   call of the person who challenges him to the field  or  by refusing    submits himself not only to all the insults his adversary is pleased to   treat him with  but also to be branded with the infamous character of a   coward by all that know him       Nothing material enough to be related happened in this visit  except   that Miss Flora  who had been abroad when Mr  Trueworth came  and   returned home a short time before he went away  talked much more in half   an hour than she had done for some whole days past  but it was in so   cold a manner  sometimes praising  sometimes blaming  his conduct in   regard to the transactions of that morning  that he could not well   determine in his mind  whether she was a friend or an enemy to the   success of his passion  Miss Betsy herself was a little surprized  but   nothing relating to that young lady dwelt much upon her mind  as she   really thought she had no design in any thing she said or did  The   behaviour of Mr  Staple ran much more in her head  she knew he was   pretty much wounded  and therefore might suppose him unable to wait on   her in person  but having expected he would send his compliments to her    either by letter or message  and finding he did neither the whole day    it seemed to her a thing too strange to be accounted for  She was    however  eased of the suspense she was in on that score  by receiving   from him  as she was at breakfast the next morning  the following   epistle             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Madam            A brother s recommendations  superior merit  and your own        inclination  have all united to plead my rival s cause  and gain        the verdict against unhappy me  I ought more early to have seen the        vanity of attempting to succeed where Mr  Trueworth was the
