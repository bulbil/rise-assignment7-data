 from the ossified Man  which I hear is deposited in Dublin College  whether his Mind partook of his Body s Disorder  and if his Heart grew hard in Proportion as his Nerves grew rigid  for if that be the Case  I would have the Gentleman  in Question  anointed with Oils  like an Olympic Wrestler  for indeed I believe an Act of Generosity would be a gymnastic Exercise to him  and I would have him put to sleep in a Tub of Goose Grease  to increase his Sensibility   Forgive me  Harry  for making so free  but I think it is better to laugh than cry  at Things which we cannot remedy  for I do not believe  what poor Lear makes a Question of  that there is any Cause  or Cure  in Nature  for hard Hearts   Your Observation  about Charles s Uneasiness  at being separated from his Wife  is  I believe  very just  for I own I think him incapable of Page  117 that delicate Tenderness  which renders Absence painful  but it is very possible he may be uneasy for the Reasons you assign  the Difficulty of Disuse  when Men are governed more by Habit than Reason  the miserable Vacuum which this has left in his Mind and Time  and which he is at a Loss how to fill up   c  for there is not  I believe  a more helpless Mortal breathing  or one less qualified for Solitude  His poor vague Mind is neither imbued with Religion or Philosophy  nor stored with Ideas enough to entertain himself  or any one else  for half an Hour  and  as he is generally much fatigued with Business  and cannot read  he must necessarily fall asleep  whenever he is left to himself  and such a Situation would make one regret the Loss of any Sort of Companion  therefore I heartily pity the poor Man   I should be very unhappy  if I doubted the Sincerity of your last Paragraph  but indeed I do not  for you have given me many kind Proofs to illustrate it  and you may believe me  in Return  when I assure you  that I would be content to give up half the Duration of my Life  to be certain of spending the Remainder of it with you  which is  however  no great Compliment  for all the Time you are absent I consider myself in a State of Annihilation  as I am deprived of the principal Spring  or Movement  which actuates this little Machine  or  rather  like a Clock  Page  118 with the striking Weight taken off  which is silent  though the Pendulum moves  and only expresses itself by the Hand  as I do now  But  though I am dumb to every one else  I find  as you may have long since observed in this long Letter  a vast Inclination of prating away to you  and should go on with this running Pattern  without any Ground  for an Hour or two more  but that the Piece of Mechanism  I have been alluding to  has  luckily for you  just now informed me  that the Post Office will be shut in five Minutes  Adieu  Adieu   Frances   LETTER CCXXI   I AM almost ashamed to acknowledge the Receipt of my dear Harry s last Letter  I absolutely blush  while I think of it  I can bear any thing better than Praise  which I do not deserve  Yet Praise from you will always be pleasing to me  for  though I may be conscious I do not merit it  yet I cannot distrust your Sincerity  and sure I shall always be delighted with your thinking I am what I would wish to be   I  by no Means  doubt your receiving much Pleasure from such a Bundle of my Letters coming at once to your Hands  My Idea of it is like passing a Day together  Though the Page  119 Subject was often changed  the Discourse was continued  while a single Letter appears like a short Visit  where the greatest Part of those Moments  we should wish to employ more agreeably  is taken up with the Form of coming in  and going out  Yet  I confess  I would rather see a Person I loved  for half an Hour every Day  than be debarred that Pleasure for a Month  though I were certain they would then stay a Week with me  for I think the   Joys of Meeting harldly pay the Pangs of Absence   This may be owing to an Impatience in my Temper  which I would gladly correct  as it occasions me many melancholy Hours  for  alas  the greatest Part of my Life is passed in a State of Separation from you  and even when you are with me  the Certainty of parting  at such a Time  embitters the present Pleasure  Pardon me  when I tell you  that I have often suspected your Love  when I have seen you quit me  with as much Indifference as you would a common Acquaintance  while my poor foolish Heart has heaved  and Eyes strained to follow you  I know you have so strong an Understanding  as would  were you possessed of
