must be tyrants  whether it is better to have them in the same house with us  or in the same village  or still farther off  in the metropolis  Now  Sir  for my own part  as I naturally hate the face of a tyrant  the farther off he is removed from me  the better pleased am I  The generality of mankind also are of my way of thinking  and have unanimously created one king  whose election at once diminishes the number of tyrants  and puts tyranny at the greatest distance from the greatest number of people  Now those who were tyrants themselves before the election of one tyrant  are naturally averse to a power raised over them  and whose  Page  202  weight must ever lean heaviest on the subordinate orders  It is the interest of the great  therefore  to diminish kingly power as much as possible  because whatever they take from it is naturally restored to themselves  and all they have to do in a state  is to undermine the single tyrant  by which they resume their primaeval authority  Now  a state may be so constitutionally circumstanced  its laws may be so disposed  and its men of opulence so minded  as all to conspire to carry on this business of undermining monarchy  If the circumstances of the state be such  for instance  as to favour the accumulation of wealth  and make the opulent still more rich  this will encrease their strength and their ambition  But an accumulation of wealth must necessarily be the consequence in a state when more riches flow in from external commerce  than arise from internal industry  for external commerce can only be managed to advantage by the rich  and they have also at the same  Page  203  time all the emoluments arising from internal industry  so that the rich  in such a state  have two sources of wealth  whereas the poor have but one  Thus wealth in all commercial states is found to accumulate  and such have hitherto in time become aristocratical  Besides this  the very laws of a country may contribute to the accumulation of wealth  as when those natural ties that bind the rich and poor together are broken  and it is ordained that the rich shall only marry among each other  or when the learned are held unqualified to serve their country as counsellors merely from a defect of opulence  and wealth is thus made the object of a wise man s ambition  by these means I say  and such means as these  riches will accumulate  The possessor of accumulated wealth  when furnished with the necessaries and pleasures of life  can employ the superfluity of fortune only in purchasing power  That is  differently speaking  in making dependants   Page  204  in purchasing the liberty of the needy or the venal  of men who are willing to bear the mortification of contiguous tyranny for bread  Thus each very opulent man generally gathers round him a circle of the poorest of the people  and the polity abounding in accumulated wealth  may be compared to a Cartesian system  each orb with a vortex of its own  Those  however  who are willing to move in a great man s vortex  are only such as must be slaves  the rabble of mankind  whose souls and whose education are adapted to servitude  and who know nothing of liberty except the name  But there must still be a large number of the people without the sphere of the opulent man s influence  namely  that order of men which subsists between the very rich and the very rabble  those men who are possest of too large fortunes to submit to the neighbouring man in power  and yet are too poor to set up for tyranny themselves  In this middle order of mankind are generally  Page  205  to be found all the arts  wisdom  and virtues of society  This order alone is known to be the true preserver of freedom  and may be called the People  Now it may happen that this middle order of mankind may lose all its influence in a state  and its voice be in a manner drowned in that of the rabble  for if the fortune sufficient for qualifying a person at present to give his voice in state affairs  be ten times less than was judged sufficient upon forming the constitution  it is evident that greater numbers of the rabble will thus be introduced into the political system  and they ever moving in the vortex of the great  will follow where greatness shall direct  In such a state  therefore  all that the middle order has left  is to preserve the prerogative and privileges of the one principal tyrant with the most sacred circumspection  For he divides the power of the rich  and calls off the great from falling with tenfold weight on the midle order placed beneath them  The middle order may be compared  Page  206  to a town of which the opulent are forming the siege  and which the tyrant is hastening to relieve  While the besiegers are in dread of the external enemy  it is but natural to offer the townsmen the most specious terms  to flatter them with sounds  and amuse them with privileges  but if they once defeat the tyrant  the walls of the town will be but a small defence
