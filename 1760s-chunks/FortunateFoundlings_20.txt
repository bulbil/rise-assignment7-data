of his insincerity   and inconstancy       Perceiving a great alteration in his behaviour  that he visited me less   frequently  and when he came  the ardours he was accustomed to treat me   with still more and more languid and enforced  I upbraided him in terms   which  tho  they shewed more love than resentment  and had he retained   any tolerable remains of tenderness for me  must have been rather   obliging than the contrary  he affected to take extremely ill  and told   me plainly  that nothing was so dear to him as his peace   that he was   not of a temper to endure reproaches  and that  if I desired the   continuance of our amour  I must be satisfied with him as he was  These   cool  and indeed insolent replies made me almost distracted  and   beginning to suspect he had some new engagement  I talked to him in a   manner as if I had been assured of it   he  perhaps  imagining it was   so  made no efforts to cure my jealousy  but behaved with so cruel an   indifference as confirmed my apprehensions       Resolving to be convinced whether I really had any rival or not  I   employed spies to observe where ever he went  and to whom  but alass    there required little pains to acquire the intelligence I fought   I   was soon informed that he was every day with the daughter of a little   mechanic   that he made her very rich presents  procured a commission in   the army for one of her brothers  and in fine  that he was as much   devoted to her as a man of his inconstant temper could be to any woman       How severe a mortification was this to my pride  but it had this good   attending it  that it very much abated my love   to be abandoned for so   mean a creature  and who had nothing but youth and a tolerable face to   recommend her  shewed such a want of taste as well as gratitude  as   rendered despicable in my eyes what had lately engrossed all my love and   admiration   The moment I received the information I sent for him   and   forcing my countenance to a serenity my heart was a stranger to  told   him it was only to take a last leave of a person whom I had been so far   mistaken in as to think deserving my affection  that I desired to see   him once more  but having now seen my error  desired he would desist his   visits for the future  He asked me with the same calmness he had lately   behaved with  what whim I had got in my head now  I  who had before   determined not to feed my rival s pride by shewing any jealousy of her    only replied  that as amours  such as ours had been  must have an end   some time or other   I thought none could be more proper than the   present  because I believed both of us could do it without pain       Answer for yourself  madam  cried he with some emotion  for I could   perceive my behaviour had a little flung his vanity  and resolute to   give him in my turn all the mortification in my power  nay  said I with   a disdainful toss of my head  I do not enquire into your sentiments   it   is sufficient mine are to break entirely off with you   neither is it   any concern to me how you may resent this alteration in my conduct  or   dispose of yourself hereafter  but I once more assure you  with my usual   frankness  that I now can see none of those perfections my foolish fancy   formerly found in you  and cannot be complaisant enough to counterfeit a   tenderness I neither feel nor think you worthy of       The surprize he was in kept him silent for some moments  but recovering   himself as well as he could  he told me  that if the levity of my nature   had made me cease to love him  he could not have expected endearments   should be converted into affronts  that if I was determined to see him   no more he must submit  and should endeavour to make himself as easy as   he could under the misfortune       These last words were uttered with a kind of sneer  which was very   provoking  however  I restrained my passion during the little time he   stayed  but as soon as I found myself alone gave it vent in tears and   exclamations   since which I have been mere at peace within myself  for   tho  I cannot say I hate him  I am now far from loving him  and hope   that time and
