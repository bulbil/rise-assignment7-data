of Guzman   Tell me now  Santillane  added he  do you not like my project  Excuse me  my lord  pleaded I  with a shrug  the design is worthy of the genius which gave birth to it  my only fear is  lest the Duke of Medina Sidonia should think fit to be out of humour at it  Let him take it as he list  resumed the minister  I give myself very little concern about that  His branch is no favourite with me  they have choused that of Abrados out of their precedence and many of their privileges  I shall be far less affected by his ill humours than by the disappointment of my sister  the Marchioness de Carpio  when she sees my daughter slip through her son s fingers  But let that be as it may  I am determined to please myself  and Don Ramires shall be the man  it is a settled point   My lord duke  having announced this firm resolve  did not carry it into effect without giving a new proof of his singular policy  He presented a memorial to the king  entreating him and the queen in concert  to do him the honour of taking the choice of a husband for his daughter on themselves  at the same time acquainting them with the pretensions of the suitors  and professing to abide by their election  but he took care  when naming the Marquis de Toral  to evince clearly whither his own wishes pointed  The king  therefore  with a blind deference for his minister  answered thus   I think that Don Ramires Nunez deserves Donna Maria  but determine for yourself  The match of your own choosing will be most agreeable to me    Signed  THE KING   The minister made a point of shewing this answer everywhere  and affecting to consider it as a royal mandate  hastened his daughter s marriage with the Marquis de Toral  a death blow to the hopes of the Marchioness de Carpio  and the rest of the Guzmans who had been speculating on an alliance with Donna Maria  These rival players of a losing game  not being able to break off the match  put the best face they could upon it  and made the fashionable world to resound with their costly celebrations of the event A superficial observer might have fancied that the whole family was delighted with the arrangement  but the pouters and ill wishers were soon revenged most cruelly at my lord duke s expense  Donna Maria was brought to bed of a daughter at the end of ten months  the infant was still born  and the mother died a few day afterwards   What a loss for a father who had no eyes  as one may say  but for his daughter  and in her loss felt the miscarriage of his design to quash the right of precedence in the branch of Medina Sidonia  Stung to the quick by his misfortune  he shut himself up for several days  and was visible to no one but myself  a sincere sympathiser  from the recollection of my own experience in his sorrow  The occasion drew forth fresh tears to Antonia s memory  The death of the Marchioness de Toral  under circumstances so similar  tore open a wound imperfectly skinned over  and so exasperated my affliction  that the minister  though he had enough to do with his own sufferings  could not help taking notice of mine  It seemed unaccountable how exactly his feelings were echoed  Gil Blas  said he one day  when my tears seemed to feed upon indulgence  my greatest consolation consists in having a bosom friend so much alive to all my distresses  Ah  my lord  answered I  giving him the full credit of my amiable tenderness  I must be ungrateful and degenerate in my nature if I did not lament as for myself  Can I be aware that you mourn over a daughter of accomplished merit  whom you loved so tenderly  without shedding tears of fellow feeling  No  my lord  I am too much naturalized to you on the side of obligation  not to take a permanent interest in all your pleasures and disappointments       CH  X     Gil Blas meets with the poet Nunez by accident  and learns that he has written a tragedy  which is on the point of being brought out at the theatre royal  The ill fortune of the piece  and the good fortune of its author   THE minister began to pick up his crumbs  and myself consequently to get into feather again  when one evening I went out alone in the carriage to take an airing  On the road I met the poet of the Asturias  who had been lost to my knowledge ever since his discharge from the hospital  He was very decently dressed  I called him up  gave him a seat in my carriage  and we drove together to Saint Jerome s meadow   Master Nunez  said I  it is lucky for me to have met you accidentally  for otherwise I should not have had the pleasure         No severe speeches  Santillane  interrupted he with considerable eagerness  I most own frankly that I did not mean to keep up your acquaintance  and I will tell you the
