that he must deposit a shilling in a little black coffin  supported by a human skull and thigh bones crossed  on a stool covered with black baize  that stood in one corner of the apartment  The squire  having made this offer with fear and trembling  ventured to survey the objects around him  which were very well calculated to augment his confusion  He saw divers skeletons hung by the head  the stuffed skin of a young alligator  a calf with two heads  and several snakes suspended from the ceiling  with the jaws of a shark  and a starved weasel  On another funeral table he beheld two spheres  between which lay a book open  exhibiting outlandish characters  and mathematical diagrams  On one side stood an ink standish with paper  and behind this desk appeared the conjurer himself  in sable vestments  his head so overshadowed with hair  that  far from contemplating his features  Timothy could distinguish nothing but a long white beard  which  for aught he knew  might have belonged to a four legged goat  as well as to a two legged astrologer   This apparition  which the squire did not eye without manifest discomposure  extending a white wand  made certain evolutions over the head of Timothy  and having muttered an ejaculation  commanded him  in a hollow tone  to come forward and declare his name  Crabshaw  thus adjured  advanced to the altar  and  whether from design  or  which is more probable  from confusion  answered   Samuel Crowe   The conjurer taking up the pen  and making a few scratches on the paper  exclaimed  in a terrific accent   How  miscreant  attempt to impose upon the stars — You look more like a crab than a crow  and was born under the sign of Cancer   The squire  almost annihilated by this exclamation  fell upon his knees  crying   I pray yaw  my lord conjurer s worship  pardon my ignorance  and down t go to baind me over to the Red Sea like—I se a poor Yorkshire tyke  and would no more cheat the stars  than I d cheat my own vather  as the saying is—a must be a good hand at trapping  that catches the stars a napping—but as your honour s worship observed  my name is Tim Crabshaw  of the East Raiding  groom and squair to Sir Launcelot Greaves  baron knaight  and arrant knaight  who ran mad for a wench  as your worship s conjuration well knoweth  The person below is Captain Crowe  and we coom by Margery Cook s recommendation  to seek after my master  who is gone away  or made away  the Lord he knows how and where    Here he was interrupted by the conjurer  who exhorted him to sit down and compose himself till he should cast a figure  then he scrawled the paper  and waving his wand  repeated abundance of gibberish concerning the number  the names  the houses  and revolutions of the planets  with their conjunctions  oppositions  signs  circles  cycles  trines  and trigons  When he perceived that this artifice had its proper effect in disturbing the brain of Crabshaw  he proceeded to tell him from the stars  that his name was Crabshaw  or Crabscaw  that he was born in the East Riding of Yorkshire  of poor  yet honest parents  and had some skill in horses  and that he served a gentleman whose name began with the letter G—  which gentleman had run mad for love  and left his family  but whether he would return alive or dead  the stars had not yet determined   Poor Timothy was thunderstruck to find the conjurer acquainted with all these circumstances  and begged to know if he might be so bauld as to ax a question or two about his own fortune  The astrologer pointing to the little coffin  our squire understood the hint  and deposited another shilling  The sage had recourse to his book  erected another scheme  performed once more his airy evolutions with the wand  and having recited another mystical preamble  expounded the book of fate in these words   You shall neither die by war nor water  by hunger or by thirst  nor be brought to the grave by old age or distemper  but  let me see—ay  the stars will have it so—you shall be—exalted—hah —ay  that is—hanged for horse stealing  — O good my lord conjurer   roared the squire   I d as lief give forty shillings as be hanged  — Peace  sirrah   cried the other   would you contradict or reverse the immutable decrees of fate  Hanging is your destiny  and hanged you shall be—and comfort yourself with the reflection  that as you are not the first  so neither will you be the last to swing on Tyburn tree   This comfortable assurance composed the mind of Timothy  and in a great measure reconciled him to the prediction  He now proceeded in a whining tone  to ask whether he should suffer for the first fact  whether it would be for a horse or a mare  and of what colour  that he might know when his hour was come  The conjurer gravely answered  that he would steal a dappled gelding
