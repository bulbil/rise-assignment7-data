      256 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      I am feelingly assured  sir  replied the valiant Peter  that God   was never angry in his whole life   and that is a long time that   has neither beginning nor ending  Don t you believe the gospel    says Mr  Clement   the scripture assures us  in a hundred places  of   the anger of God against impenitent sinners  I am the son of a   clergyman  sir  said Peter  and mayhap could quote scripture as   well as another  The scriptures were written for man   but how   should man understand them  if they were not written according to   his own language and to his own passions  I will ask you a   question  sir Can you be angry at a mite or a worm  which you   can crush into nothing at pleasure   I think not  said my tutor    No  certainly  said Peter  because you cannot fear a thing that has   not power to oifend you  Now  aU the world is but as a worm or   mite to God  and neither man nor angels can disturb or affect him   with any thing  except delight  on their acceptance of that happi    ness which he desires to give to all his creatures      Ay  but  says Mr  Clement  you see that God s anger and in    dignation was so great against sin  that nothing could satisfy for it   save the death of his beloved Son  Ay  but  says Peter  the scrip    ture which you quote tells you  that it was not his anger but his   love that sent him to us    For God so loved the world   a very   sinful world indeed     that he gave his only begotten Son to take   his death upon the cross   And I am as fully assured as I am of   my own being  that the same gracious God who has already re    deemed poor sinners  would willingly redeem the poor devils also   if they could but find in their hearts to desire his salvation      Here  catching and clasping his hand My dear Peter  said I    I embrace and wish from my heart that your doctrine may be   true  I have many tutors  Mr  Peter  and my father pays them all   with pleasure for the instructions that they give me  Tell me   then  Mr  Peter  what must he give you for the lesson which you   have taught me   What lesson  my hero   A very precious lesson    says I   a lesson that will always teach me   to despise myself for   a coward whenever I shall be angry       Peter then sprung up without speaking a word  and hugged  and   clasped  and kissed me with all his affections  Then  plucking a   button from the upper part of my coat I will accept of this token    my darling  says he   and will look at it many a time in the day   for your sake      But  Mr  Peter  said I  I think it would be my advantage to   keep up an acquaintance with you  and this cannot be so well done   while your dear Gatty is angry with me  You must therefore   promise me to carry a token to her also  as an olive branch of that   peace which I want to be made between us  I will  my love  says   he   I never refuse to give or accept the favours of a friend  You   must be upon honour   then  not to reject what I ofier you  I am   upon honour  he said      I then slipped something into his hand  at which he looked and   looked again   and then cried out from the overflowings of a good   and grateful heart You are either of the blood royal  or ought to   be so   For the man was very poor  though so very sensible and   well descended  and so he looked upon a little as a great matter          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  257     Here Harry closed his narration  and all the company gathered   about him  and nearly smothered him with their caresses  in which   little Susannah came in for her full share      On the following day Harry introduced his friend Vindex and   family to his dear father  who received them with a graciousness   that soon dispelled that awkward diffidence  and humbling sense of   obligations  under which the late unhappy preceptor apparently   sunk      As soon as it was known
