or me to get up behind him —pray  Sir  what have either you or I to do with it   CHAP  VIII   —Degustibus non est disputandum —that is  there is no disputing against HOBBY HORSES  and  for my part  I seldom do  nor could I with any sort of grace  had I been an enemy to them at the bottom  for happening  at certain intervals and changes of the Moon  to be both fiddler and painter  according as the fly stings —Be it known to you  that I  Page  25  keep a couple of pads myself  upon which  in their turns   nor do I care who knows it  I frequently ride out and take the air —tho  sometimes  to my shame be it spoken  I take somewhat longer journies than what a wise man would think altogether right —But the truth is —I am not a wise man —and besides am a mortal of so little consequence in the world  it is not much matter what I do  so I seldom fret or fume at all about it  Nor does it much disturb my rest when I see such great Lords and tall Personages as hereafter follow —such  for instance  as my Lord A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  and so on  all of a row  mounted upon their several horses —some with large stirrups  getting on in a more grave and sober pace —others on the contrary  tuck d up to their very chins  with whips across  Page  26  their mouths  scouring and scampering it away like so many little party colour d devils astride a mortgage —and as if some of them were resolved to break their necks —So much the better—say I to myself —for in case the worst should happen  the world will make a shift to do excellently well without them —and for the rest —why —God speed them —e en let them ride on without opposition from me  for were their lordships unhorsed this very night — tis ten to one but that many of them would be worse mounted by one half before tomorrow morning   Not one of these instances therefore can be said to break in upon my rest —But there is an instance  which I own puts me off my guard  and that is  when I see one born for great actions  and  what is  Page  27  still more for his honour  whose nature ever inclines him to good ones —when I behold such a one  my Lord  like yourself  whose principles and conduct are as generous and noble as his blood  and whom  for that reason  a corrupt world cannot spare one moment —when I see such a one  my Lord  mounted  though it is but for a minute beyond the time which my love to my country has prescribed to him  and my zeal for his glory wishes —then  my Lord  I cease to be a philosopher  and in the first transport of an honest impatience  I wish the HOBBY HORSE  with all his fraternity  at the Devil   My Lord   I Maintain this to be a dedication  notwithstanding its singularity in the three great essentials of matter   Page  28  form and place  I beg  therefore  you will accept it as such  and that you will permit me to lay it  with the most respectful humility  at your Lordship s feet —when you are upon them —which you can be when you please —and that is  my Lord  when ever there is occasion for it  and I will add  to the best purposes too  I have the honour to be   My Lord   Your Lordship s most obedient  and most devoted  and most humble servant  TRISTRAM SHANDY →    Page  29  CHAP  IX   I Solemnly declare to all mankind  that the above dedication was made for no one Prince  Prelate  Pope  or Potentate —Duke  Marquis  Earl  Viscount  or Baron of this  or any other Realm in Christendom —nor has it yet been hawk d about  or offered publickly or privately  directly or indirectly  to any one person or personage  great or small  but is honestly a true Virgin Dedication untried on  upon any soul living   I labour this point so particularly  merely to remove any offence or objection which might arise against it  from the manner in which I propose to make the most of it —which is the putting  Page  30  it up fairly to publick sale  which I now do   —Every author has a way of his own  in bringing his points to bear —for my own part  as I hate chaffering and higgling for a few guineas in a dark entry—I resolved within myself  from the very beginning  to deal squarely and openly with your Great Folks in this affair  and try whether I should not come off the better by it   If therefore there is any one Duke  Marquis  Earl  Viscount  or Baron  in these his Majesty s dominions  who stands in need of a tight  genteel dedication  and whom the above will
