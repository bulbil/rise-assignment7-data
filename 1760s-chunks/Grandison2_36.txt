I added  I remember  that I was pained by the teazings of these men  one after another  that I never took delight in their airy adulation  and was now the more pained  because of the vile attempt of Sir Hargrave  which had given me a surfeit of the sex   Miss Gr  A temporary surfeit  It is over  I hope  by this time  But  my dear—And yet as I owe to   89 your generosity the communication  I would not take occasion from it to teaze you—  Harriet  Miss Grandison will oblige me  say what she pleases   Miss Gr  As you intend to marry—As your friends are very desirous that you should—As Lady D  is an excellent woman—As her son is  as men go  a tolerable man—As he is a peer of the realm  which is something in the scale  tho  it is not of weight  singly consider d—As his estate is very considerable—As you may have your own terms—As you like not any one of your numerous admirers —All these As s considered  why  why  in the name of goodness  should you give so flat a denial  Yet have not seen the gentleman  and therefore can have no dislikes either to his sense or person  I wish  my dear  you would give such a reason for your denial  a denial so strongly expressed  as one would imagine such a woman as the countess of D  would be satisfied with  from such a one as Miss Byron   Lady L  Perhaps  now that Miss Byron has seen what a lady the countess of D  is—  Miss Gr  And now that she has overcome the temporary surfeit   Lady L  She will change her mind   Are you not  my dear aunt Selby  are you not  my Lucy  distressed for me at this place  I was at the time greatly so for myself   Harriet  My mind has been greatly disturbed by Sir Hargrave s violence  and by apprehensions of fatal mischiefs that might too probably have followed the generous protection given me  I was teazed before by good men—Mr  Orme  and Sir Rowland Meredith in behalf of his nephew  and by men not so good  Mr  Greville  and Mr  Fenwick  And when I had hoped to have a little respite  a little leisure to look about me  and to collect my almost dissipated spirits  to have this new proposal made to my friends  and to me  and by a lady so worthy  wonder not  Ladies  if I am unable  on a   90 sudden  to give such reasons for having refused to listen to it  as you require  altho   at the same time  I find not in my heart the least inclination to encourage it   Miss Gr  You have had your difficulties of late  my Harriet  to contend with  And those you must look upon as a tax to be paid by a merit so conspicuous  Even in this slighter case  as you love to oblige  I can pity you for the situation you are likely to be in  betwixt the refused son and the deserving mother  But when you consider  that the plagues of the discreet proceed from other people  those of the indiscreet from themselves  you will sit down with a just compliment to yourself  and be content  You see I can be grave now and then  child   Harriet  May I deserve to be called prudent and discreet  On that condition  I am willing to incur the penalty   Lady L  Come  come  that is out of the question  my dear  So you are contented of course  or in the way to be so   The Ladies took their leave  and seemed pleased with their visit   It is now  my dear friends  some how or other  become necessary  I think  to let you minutely into my situation  that you may advise  caution  instruct me—For  I protest  I am in a sort of wilderness —Pray  my Lucy  tell me—But it cannot be from Love  So I don t care—Yet to lie under such a weight of obligation  and to find myself so much surpassed by these ladies—Yet it is not from Envy  surely  That is a very bad passion  I hope my bosom has not a place in it for such a mean self tormentor  Can it be from Pride  Pride is a vice that always produces mortification  And proud you all made me of your favour—Yet I thought it was grateful to be proud of it   I wish I were with you  Lucy  I should ask you abundance of questions  and repose my anxious heart on your faithful bosom  and  at the same time  from   91 your answers  arm it against too great a sensibility  before it was too late  But pray  don t I remember  that you said  you found sighing a relief to you  on a certain occasion  I am serious  my dear  That there was a sort of you know not what of pleasure in sighing  Yet that it was involuntary —Did you not say  that you were ready
