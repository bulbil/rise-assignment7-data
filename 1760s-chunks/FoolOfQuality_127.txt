 Ah   I cried   I am then known  The darkness of the night hath   not been able to conceal me  My guilt is laid open before God and   his angels   and my present and past transgressions are entered into   his book  He yet pities  he yet relieves me  He snatches me from   the gulf wherein I had already plunged and saw no bottom  to   show me that no extremity can pass his power  and that on this   side of existence it is always too early to despair of his bounty    As soon as I got to my lodgings  I redeemed my wife s gown  and   sent out for a frugal supper  I then stepped up stairs  and  taking   a chair just opposite to my wife  I sat down and continued silent    but dared not to look up  She eyed me through and through  My   Hammy  says she  you are apt to meet with strange adventures    I know you not for the same person   you are not what you were   a few minutes ago  I found myself under the necessity of avowing   to her all that had happened  But  gracious heaven   through time   and through eternity never shall I forget the reply she made      Hammy  says she  with the face  air  and accent of heaven s   mildest minister  it ill becomes me to reprove a respected husband   for the excess of his goodness to me and my child   and yet I have   suffered more from the consideration of this excess  than from all   our other calamities put together  I love you entirely  my Hammy     but I love that part of you the most which you appear to regard   the least  It is a part that must survive the dissolution of all the   rest their short joys  their idle anxieties  their fierce desires  and   empty possessions and it must thereafter be yourself to all eternity    I once thought  my love  that learning was the principal promoter   of piety  But I have long since discovered that to know is not to   feel  and that argument and inclination are often as opposite as   adversaries that refuse all means of reconcilement      I will suppose you  for instance  in the depth of your knowledge    the wisest discoverer of the attributes of infinity  But what will   this do for you  my Hammy  You may contemplate these great   objects as matters with which you are no way connected      God  with all his omnipotence  can no otherwise make us happy   than by connecting himself with us  and this connection can no   way be formed but by our dependence upon him  And this de    pendence can no way be made but by our confidence in him   by   feeling that in ourselves  or the world around us  there is neither     I         H4 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      footing nor hold to save us from sinking for ever   and by catching   at God alone for the support of that existence which his bounty   bestowed      It is this confidence  my dear husband  that is called by the name   of FAITH   of which we ought to have such a portion at least as   might enable us to say to the worst that can befall  what the three   Jewish captives said to the king of Babylon    Our God is able to   deliver us   and he will in due time deliver us from all these   afflictions  But  though he should not deliver us  we will not forsake   our confidence in him  neither bow to any temptation that guilt   can set up      Since God  therefore  cannot communicate happiness to one who   refuses to trust in his goodness  or to repose upon his power   where   he is peculiarly favourable  he blesses him with all sorts of crosses   and disappointments  He breaks under him all the props of worldly   confidence  He snatches trom him the helps on which his hopes   had laid hold  that in the instant of sinking he may catch at   his Creator  and throw himself on the bosom of that infinite   benevolence      I am your loving wife  my husband  and this is your dear and   promising infant  But  what are we further to you   You neither   made us  nor can you preserve us   nor are you obliged to provide   for us beyond your weak and finite endeavours  Commit us  then    to Him in whom we have our existence   and know that should he   permit this innocent to suffer  and my
