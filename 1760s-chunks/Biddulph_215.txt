do not mean  said I  to return to Ireland  do you not know the risque that you run by putting yourself into the power of an exasperated family from whom you can expect nothing but the most malevolent persecution   I deliver myself up to the laws  replied Mr Faulkland  my life is devoted  ’tis indifferent to me how I die   Suppose  said I  Mrs Arnold should consent to marry you  would not that reconcile you to life   Oh  Sir  and he shook his head  I am not to be deceived twice   Your brother walked about the room without taking part in the conversation   I do not mean it  Sir  Mrs Arnold must be yours  I can influence her  do but return back with me  I give you my honour I will do my utmost to prevail on her to give you her hand immediately  Her heart is hardened  Sir  she will not consent  replied he  I have no friend to urge her  I am an outcast  and not fit to live—I will urge her  Sir  she respects me  she will be guided by me  she shall fulfil the promise she made you—Oh  Sir  you but deceive yourself—she will find out new excuses  I am not to be again allured by false hopes   He stepped towards the door as he spoke these words  and was about to open it  Your brother followed  and laid hold of his arm  I did the same  Sir George  said he  expose me not to insults  why do you persecute me  Leave me  Sir  I am not a madman—but I am determined—and he spoke as if he were indeed so   For heaven’s sake  Faulkland  said your brother  be composed  You have Mr Warner’s word of honour  you shall have mine too  that we will do our utmost to persuade Mrs Arnold to consent to your wishes  You have my full consent  you have won Mr Warner to your interest  my sister will yield to our joint entreaties  Yield  he repeated  no  no  Sir George  she has a stubborn heart  I once thought it otherwise  but it is turned to stone  nothing but my death will satisfy     her  and she shall be satisfied   He made an effort to break from us  Stay Mr Faulkland  said I  again laying hold of his hand  and I here swear to you by every thing that is sacred  that if you will suffer me to conduct you back into Mrs Arnold’s presence  I will insist on her immediately accepting of you for her husband  or I will for ever renounce all friendship with her  I know she esteems and values you above all men  I am therefore sure  I do no violence to her inclinations  and if she perseveres in her obstinate punctilios  I swear to you by the same oath  that I will no longer oppose you in your resolutions  let them be what they will   Sir George  added I  Do you join with me in giving your friend the same assurances  I do  answered he  solemnly addressing himself to Mr Faulkland  and swear by all my hopes of happiness hereafter  to act in conjunction with Mr Warner in every particular that he has promised   Mr Faulkland seemed to be moved  he looked whistfully at us by turns  as if willing  though afraid  to yield to our entreaties   At length  I think I may rely on you  said he  you will not break an oath  to Sir George  but that woman has such an inflexible heart  you cannot change that   We will do our utmost  we both answered together  Remember  then  said he  stretching out a hand to each of us  you have sworn  if she persists in her resolution  that you will leave me to myself  and oppose me no longer  We have  I will go back with you then cried Mr Faulkland  and stepped again nimbly to the door   It will be best  said I  if we can hire a coach to carry us  there is no necessity for our riding post  and we shall be less liable to observation than if we were on horse back  Mr Faulkland looked as if he suspected some design  do you not mean  said he  to go directly back to London  Certainly  I replied  And shall I see Mrs Arnold to night  Without doubt  if you desire it  Let us go then  said he  I think a coach is a tedious way of travelling  but I submit to your guidance   I left Sir George with him  and went out to enquire whether we could be provided with a coach and four  which after some delay was procured for us  We prevailed on Mr Faulkland  whilst it was getting ready  to take a little refreshment  He asked us  by what means we were informed of his departure   Sir George  unwilling to let him know that his servant had discovered it  evaded the question  and only replied  Do you think  Faulkland  that in the humour
