from a house which you have cast into mourning  every moment of your longer stay adds pungency to my distress  I no longer oppose your will  madam  returned I  preparing to take my leave  absence from you must then be my portion  but do not suppose that  anxious for the preservation of a life which is become hateful to you  I go to seek an asylum where I may be sheltered from your search  No  no  I bare my breast to your resentment  I shall wait with impatience at Toledo for the fate which you design me  and by surrendering at once to my pursuers  shall myself forward the completion of my miseries   At the conclusion of this speech I withdrew  My horse was returned to me  and I went to Toledo  where I abode eight days  and really with so little care to conceal myself that I know not how or why I have escaped an arrest  for I cannot suppose that the Count de Polan  whose whole soul is set on cutting off my retreat  should not have been aware that I was likely to pass through Toledo  Yesterday I left that town  where it should seem as if I was tired of my liberty  and without betaking myself to any fixed course of travelling  I came to this hermitage  like a man who had no reason to be ashamed of shewing himself  Such  father  was the cause of my absence and distraction  I beseech you to assist me with your counsels       CH  XI     The old hermit turns out an extraordinary genius  and Gil Blas finds himself among his former acquaintance   WHEN Don Alphonso had concluded the melancholy recital of his misfortunes  the old hermit said to him    My son  you have been excessively rash in tarrying so long at Toledo  I consider in a very different light from that you affect to place it in  what you have told me of your story  and your love for Seraphina seems to me to be sheer madness  Take my word for it  you will do well to cancel that young lady from your remembrance  she never can be of your communion  Retreat like a skilful general  when you cannot act with effect on the offensive  and pursue your fortune on another field  where success may smile on your endeavours  You will be terribly out of luck to kill the brother of the next young lady who may chance to succeed this only possible object of your affection   He was going to add many other inducements to resignation  in such a case as Don Alphonso s  when we saw another hermit enter our retreat  with a well stuffed wallet slung across his shoulders  He was on his return  with the charitable contributions of all the good folks in the town of Cuença  and the gathering did credit to the religion of the age  He looked younger than his companion  in spite of his thick  foxy beard  Welcome home  brother Anthony  said the elder of the two recluses  what news do you bring us from town  Bad enough  answered the carroty friar  putting into his hands a paper  folded in the form of a letter  this little instrument will inform you  The hoary sage opened it  and after reading on with an increased attention  as the contents seemed to grow more interesting  exclaimed  Heaven s will be done  Since the combustion is anticipated  we have only to fall in with the humour of our fate  Let us change our dialect  Signor Don Alphonso  pursued he  addressing his discourse to my young companion  you behold in me a man  like yourself  who has been a broad mark for the wantonness of fortune to take aim at  Word is sent me from Cuença  a town at the distance of a league hence  that some backbiter has been blackening my fair fame in the esteem of justice  who is coming with her hue and cry to disturb the repose of these rural scenes  and to lay her paw upon my person  But an old fox is too cunning to be caught in a trap  This is not the first time that I have cut and run before the bloodhounds of the law  But  thanks to myself for having my wits about me  I have always ended the chase in a whole skin  and held myself in readiness for another  It is now time to assume another form  for  whether you like me best in my old skin or my new  I cast my hermit s decrepit slough  to bask in the sunshine of youth and vigour   To suit the action to the word  he threw off the incumbrance of his ecclesiastical petticoat  and stood forth to view in a doublet of black serge with slashed sleeves  Then off went his cap  and snap went a string  which supported the hoary honours of a beard  and our anchorite was at once transformed to a brawny ruffian of eight and twenty or thirty  Brother Anthony  following a good example  discarded the outward show of religion  treated his fiery beard as the snowy one had been handled just before  and pulled out of an old worm eaten trunk a sorry rag
