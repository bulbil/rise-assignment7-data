The most interesting part of the task that now remained was to make the widow Oakley acquainted with her good fortune  in such a manner as might least disturb her spirits  already but too much discomposed  For this purpose they chose the landlady  who  after having received proper directions how to regulate her conduct  visited her in person that same evening  Finding her quite calm  and her reflection quite restored  she began with exhorting her to put her trust in Providence  which would never forsake the cause of the injured widow and fatherless  She promised to assist and befriend her on all occasions  as far as her abilities would reach  She gradually turned the conversation upon the family of the Greaves  and by degrees informed her  that Sir Launcelot  having learned her situation  was determined to extricate her from all her troubles  Perceiving her astonished  and deeply affected at this intimation  she artfully shifted the discourse  recommended resignation to the divine will  and observed  that this circumstance seemed to be an earnest of further happiness    Oh  I m incapable of receiving more   cried the disconsolate widow  with streaming eyes — Yet I ought not to be surprised at any blessing that flows from that quarter  The family of Greaves were always virtuous  humane  and benevolent  This young gentleman s mother was my dear lady and benefactress —he himself was suckled at these breasts  Oh  he was the sweetest  comeliest  best conditioned babe —I loved not my own Greaves with greater affection—but he  alas  is now no more    Have patience  good neighbour   said the landlady of the White Hart   that is more than you have any right to affirm—all that you know of the matter is by common report  and common report is commonly false  besides  I can tell you I have seen a list of the men that were killed in Admiral P—— s ship  when he fought the French in the East Indies  and your son was not in the number   To this intimation she replied  after a considerable pause   Don t  my good neighbour  don t feed me with false hope —My poor Greaves too certainly perished in a foreign land—yet he is happy —had he lived to see me in this condition  grief would soon have put a period to his days    I tell you then   cried the visitant   he is not dead  I have seen a letter that mentions his being well since the battle  You shall come along with me—you are no longer a prisoner  but shall live at my house comfortably  till your affairs are settled to your wish   The poor widow followed her in silent astonishment  and was immediately accommodated with necessaries   Next morning her hostess proceeded with her in the same cautious manner  until she was assured that her son had returned  Being duly prepared  she was blest with a sight of poor Greaves  and fainted away in his arms  We shall not dwell upon this tender scene  because it is but of a secondary concern in the history of our knight errant  Let it suffice to say  their mutual happiness was unspeakable  She was afterwards visited by Sir Launcelot  whom she no sooner beheld  than springing forwards with all the eagerness of maternal affection  she clasped him to her breast  crying   My dear child  my Launcelot  my pride  my darling  my kind benefactor  This is not the first time I have hugged you in these arms  Oh  you are the very image of Sir Everhard in his youth  but you have got the eyes  the complexion  the sweetness  and complacency of my dear and ever honoured lady   This was not in the strain of hireling praise  but the genuine tribute of esteem and admiration  As such  it could not but be agreeable to our hero  who undertook to procure Oakley s discharge  and settle him in a comfortable farm on his own estate   In the meantime Greaves went with a heavy heart to the house of Farmer Sedgemoor  where he found Suky  who had been prepared for his reception  in a transport of joy  though very weak  and greatly emaciated  Nevertheless  the return of her sweetheart had such an happy effect on her constitution  that in a few weeks her health was perfectly restored   This adventure of our knight was crowned with every happy circumstance that could give pleasure to a generous mind  The prisoners were released  and reinstated in their former occupations  The justice performed his articles from fear  and afterwards turned over a new leaf from remorse  Young Oakley was married to Suky  with whom he received a considerable portion  The new married couple found a farm ready stocked for them on the knight s estate  and the mother enjoyed a happy retreat in the character of housekeeper at Greavesbury Hall             CHAPTER THIRTEEN  IN WHICH OUR KNIGHT IS TANTALISED WITH A TRANSIENT GLIMPSE OF FELICITY   The success of our adventurer  which we have particularised in the last chapter  could not fail of enhancing his character  not only among those who knew him  but also among the people of the town
