 I am no stranger to your nobleness of sentiment  in your friendship and compassion all my hopes of tranquillity are founded  I will endeavour to conquer this ill placed prepossession  and render myself more worthy your esteem  If his marriage with another makes it impossible for him to suppose I throw myself designedly in his way  I will go with you to town in the winter  and try if the hurry of the world can erase his image from my bosom  If he continues unconnected  and no accident clears up to me his conduct  I will continue where I am  and for ever hide my folly in this retreat     I am   c  A  Hastings        2 91          Poor Bell  how I pity her  Heaven certainly means love for our reward in another world  it so seldom makes it happy in this  But why do we blame Heaven  It is our own prejudices  our rage for wealth  our cowardly compliance with the absurd opinions of others  which robs us of all the real happiness of life        I should be glad to know who this despicable fellow is  though really it is possible she may injure him  I must know his name  and find out whether or not she is torturing herself without reason  If he bears scrutinizing  our plans may coincide  and my jointure make us all happy  if not  he shall have the mortification of knowing she has an easy fortune  and of seeing her  what it shall be my business to make her next winter  one of the most fashionable women  and celebrated toasts  about town            2 92          After all  are we not a little in the machine style  not to be able to withdraw our love when our esteem is at an end  I suppose one might find a philosophical reason for this in Newton s Laws of Attraction  The heart of a woman does  I imagine  naturally gravitate towards a handsome  well dressed  well bred fellow  without enquiry into his mental qualities  Nay  as to that  do not let me be partial to you odious men  you have as little taste for mere internal charms as the lightest coquette in town  You talk sometimes of the beauties of the mind  but I should be glad  as somebody has said very well  to see one of you in love with a mind of threescore        I am really sorry for Bell  but hope to bring her out of these heroics by Christmas  The town air  and being followed five or six weeks as a beauty  will do wonders  I know no specific for a love fit like a constant round of pretty fellows            2 93          The world  I dare say  will soon restore her to her senses  it is impossible she should ever regain them in a lonely village  with no company but an old woman        How dearly we love to nurse up our follies  Bell  I dare say  fancies vast merit in this romantic constancy to a man who  if he knew her absurdity  would laugh at it        I have no patience with my own sex  for their want of spirit     Friday Night      O Heavens  who could have thought it  Of all the birds in the air  find me out Lord Melvin for Bell Hasting s lover  Nothing was ever so charming  to tell the story  which does his business here in a moment  serves my lovely Harry  and punishes the wretch s infidelity as it deserves  Adieu  I fly to communicate            2 94       Saturday Morning      All this is very strange to me  Lord Belmont  to whom I last night mentioned Lord Melvin s connexion with Bell  as a reason against his marrying Lady Julia  assures me no such thing was ever intended  that he was amazed how I came to think so  that Lord Rochdale has other views for his son  to which  however  he is averse  I am glad to hear this last circumstance  and hope Bell has wronged him by her suspicions        But who can this be that is intended for Lady Julia  I do not love to be impertinent  but my curiosity is rather excited  I shall not sleep till I am in this secret  I must follow my Lord about till I get a clue to direct me  How shall I begin the attack   Really  my Lord  says I  this surprizes me extremely  I could have sworn Lord Melvin was the person your Lordship meant  if it is not him  who can it be             2 95
