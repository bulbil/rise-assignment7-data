humbly beg your highness s pardon  But what answer am I   to send to the English  who have demanded that the troops should   march directly           Why  that I am so enraged at the insult offered to me by that   merchant that I will not let a man of them stir till I have satisfac    tion and a new subsidy   and that I keep this one in the meantime    to make up the deficiencies in former years          Deficiencies   I do not understand your highness   the sub    sidies have been always regularly paid          Obey my commands   I say there have been deficiencies    which I am not at leisure to explain in this emergency  but I suppose   my word will be taken for it          I fear your highness does not attend to the change which has   lately been in England  The people who might have taken such   an answer  are now out of power  and their successors are the very   men who have always been against dealing with your highness    and may now take the advantage of this breach of faith  for such I   well know they will call it  to throw off your alliance for ever   for   the people begin to see their own strength  and their governors   to exert it properly  and show them that they want no foreign   assistance  And  as a proof of this  at this very time when their   enemies not only talk of invading them more confidently than ever    but also have gone so far aa to make preparations for such an at    tempt  80 far from being diffident of their own strength  or intimid    ated to call for help  they have actually sent a powerful body of   their troops abroad  and are carrying on the war with vigour and   success in every quarter of the world  satisfied that the inhabitants   who remain at home are able to defend their country  and repel   every attempt that may be made against it  And this change in   their measures should give a caution how the persons who effected   it are provoked          I care not   I will make the experiment  But do you draw up   your dispatches in such a maimer that we may have it in our power         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 221     to explain them to whatever sense shall suit us best  In the mean    time  we must keep up our appearance of treating with France  to   give a weight to our designs        The minister was prevented from replying  by the entrance   of the muster  master  who had been just maHng a survey  and   taking an account of every man able to bear arms in his highness s   territories        Well    said his highness    how do your musters answer   Shall   I be able to enlarge the number of my troops this year           May it please your most serene highness    replied the ofBcer      here is the return  in which I have taken down every man from   twelve to seventy  according to youi commands          And how do they answer   Better than last year  I hope     there must be a great many boys have grown up since          The list  indeed  looks almost as full as usual   but the late   battles have so drained us of men to fill up the troops  that there   are scarce any but boys left at home  and those have been so badly   fed of late  that their size does not answer their years  and they look   wretchedly  besides  So that  upon the whole  I fear your highness   will find it very difficult to complete the forces already established    much more to raise any new          I must  I will raise them  Tell me not of difficulties  What I   command shall be performed  If there are not men  the women   shall put on the men s clothes and go  I will not be shortened of   my revenue   they shall fight themselves  since they have not bred   soldiers for me          This  please your highness  is a list of the disabled men  who are   not able to support themselves by any kind of work  having lost   their limbs in the wars
