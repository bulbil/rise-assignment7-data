   portion of attention and good nature  on what I have lately been         and what I at present am  the most unfortunate  and most forlorn of        womankind            M  MELLASIN GOODMAN            P S  My daughter Flora  the innocent partner of my griefs and        sufferings  will have the honour to deliver this to you  and  I        hope  return with a favourable answer        Lady Mellasin chose to send Miss Flora with this letter  as believing   her agreeable person  and manner of behaviour  would have a greater   effect on that youthful heart of the person it was addressed to  than   could have been expected from the formal and affected gravity of Mrs    Prinks       It is not unlikely  too  but that she might flatter herself with the   hopes of greater advantages by her daughter s going in person to Mr    Goodman s  than those which her letter had petitioned for  She had often   heard and read of men whose resentment had been softened and melted into   tenderness on the appearance of a lovely object  as the poet somewhere   or other expresses it             Beauty  like ice  our footing does betray        Who can tread sure on the smooth  slipp ry way        Miss Flora herself was also very far from being displeased at going on   this errand  and as it was not proper for her to dress in the manner she   would have done on making a visit to any other person  it cost her some   time  before her setting out  to equip herself in such a deshabille as   she thought would be most genteel and become her best       She had the good fortune to find Mr  Goodman at home  and was   immediately introduced to him  He was a little surprized at a visit made   him by a young lady whom he had never seen before  but not enough to   prevent him from receiving her with the utmost complaisance  He saluted   her  seated her in a chair  and then asked her what commands she had to   favour him with  on which  taking out the letter  and giving it to him     This  Sir   said she  with a deep sigh   will inform you of the request   that brings me here        Mr  Goodman read it hastily over  but  while he was doing so  could not   forbear shaking his head several times  yet spoke nothing till after a   pause of some minutes   Madam   said he   as this is a business which I   could not expect to have heard of  I must confess myself altogether   unprepared how to proceed in it  If Lady Mellasin   added he   will give   herself the trouble to send in three or four days  she may depend on an   answer from me        The coldness of these words  and the distant air he assumed while   speaking them  so widely different from that with which he had accosted   this lady on her first entrance  made her presently see she had nothing   to hope from this embassy on her own account  and made her also tremble   for that of her mother       As he urged her not to stay  nor even gave the least hint that he was   desirous of her doing so  she rose  and  with a most dejected air  took   her leave  telling him  in going out  that she should not fail of   acquainting Lady Mellasin with his commands  who  she doubted not  would   be punctual in obeying them       Mr  Goodman was  indeed  too well acquainted with the character of Miss   Flora to be capable of receiving any impression from the charms nature   had bestowed upon her  even though they had been a thousand times more   brilliant than in effect they were  and she had not been the daughter of   a woman who had rendered herself so justly hateful to him       Lady Mellasin was shocked to the very soul at being told the reception   her daughter had met with  and could not help looking upon it as a very   bad omen of her future success  She doubted but by his saying that he   must have time for deliberation  he meant that he would do nothing in   this point  without having first consulted his friends  and she had no   reason to expect that any of those he
