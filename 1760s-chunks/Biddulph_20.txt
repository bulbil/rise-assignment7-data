strictest principles of virtue  and the son of parents  who  thank God  always gave him the best example  should have so far deviated from the sober paths he was brought up in  as to treat the most glaring vices with a levity that shocked me  But  I suppose  the company he kept abroad  among whom this hypocrite Faulkland was his chief  has quite perverted him  He gave me the letter to read     which he had received from his friend whilst he was at Bath  and which  he said  was to convince me that it was such a trifling affair  that we ought not to take the least notice of it  And all his reason for this was  truly  because that loose man treats the subject as lightly as he does  I am afraid Sir George is no better than himself  or he would not have ventured to make him the confidant of his wild amours  and that at a time too when he was encouraged to address you  He tells him of a very pretty young lady  innocent he says too  that he got acquainted with  who came to Bath under the care of an aunt and uncle  he talks some idle stuff of avoiding her  when he found she liked him  and that the aunt  wicked woman   contrived to leave them together one evening  when  I understand  the poor young creature fell into the snare that was prepared for her  For  would you believe it  my dear  the monstrous libertine  notwithstanding his pretences  owned that he had paid a price for the girl to her aunt  The betrayed creature herself knew not of this   I own I had not patience to read the letter through  To say the truth  I but run my eye in a cursory manner over it  I was afraid of meeting  at every line  something offensive to decency  And this was the account  which  in your brother’s opinion  was entirely to exculpate Mr Faulkland  I think I never was so angry  I threw the letter to George with indignation  telling him  I was ashamed to find  that he  after knowing an incident of this kind  had so little regard to the honour of his sister  as to promote a marriage between her and such a rake  He answered  if I kept you unmarried till I found such a man as I should not call a rake  you were likely to live and die a maid  That for his part  he was very sorry  as well for Mr Faulkland’s sake as yours  he had ever proposed an union  which he found was likely to be overthrown by unseasonable scruples  And the gentleman  in a violent passion  flung out of the room  without deigning even to take up the letter which had fallen on the floor   I presume he went directly to his friend Faulkland  and told him all that had passed  for the plausible man came to me in the evening  and with looks  full of pretended sorrow  but real guilt  begged I would hear him on the subject of a letter which he said he found had unfortunately prejudiced me against him  To be sure he was prepared  and had  with George’s help  contrived an artful story to impose on me  He took me unawares  but I was resolved not to give him the advantage of arguments  but proceed to ask him a few plain questions  I therefore cut him short at once  by saying  Mr Faulkland     I am extremely concerned and shocked at what has happened  I will say but a few words to you  and desire to hear nothing more than answers to my questions  he bowed  and remained silent   I then asked him  taking the young lady’s letter out of my pocket  whether that was from the same person  of whom he had written an account to my son whilst he was at Bath  He answered  It is  madam  and I hoped from that letter  which I find Sir George has shewn you  you would be induced to believe that I never formed a thought of injuring that young lady  till some unfortunate circumstances combined  and suddenly surprized me into the commission of a fault that has made us both unhappy  Sir  said I  I don’t pretend to know people’s hearts  I can only judge of them from their actions  You acknowlege that she was a fine young woman  and you believe innocent  What excuse can you offer for being her destroyer  Dear madam  don’t use so severe an expression—Sir  I can use no other  How can you extenuate the fault  by which you merit so severe an appellation  To a lady of your rigid delicacy  madam  said he  perhaps what youth could offer  in extenuation of the fault  might appear but a weak plea  yet ’tis most certain  that I was surprized into the fatal error  I am under no promises  no ties  no engagements whatsoever to the lady  No ties  Sir   interrupting him  Is your own honour no tie upon you  supposing you free from any other obligation  You see the consequence of this
