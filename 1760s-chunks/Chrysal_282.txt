 therefore    it is the genteelest in my opinion  How many contractors have I   seen buy noblemen s fine houses  and members of parliament s   estates  with the profits of a single campaign   And so  my lord    and you  most honourable Mr Member  I am your humble servant          Honest Mr Contractor    replied both at the same time    yours   I         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 329         CHAPTER LVI     AFF35CTING CONSEQUENCES OF CABRYING THE FOKEGOINO SCHEMES   IJfTO EXECUTION  WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE CHABACTEE AND   HISTORY OF CHRYSAL s MASTER â€” OHBYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE     As soon as this worthy pair had left my master  he set about his   business of preying upon the necessities of every one who came   near him  with as much keenness as a vulture tears a carrion    and with as little feeling  or he could never have gone through   with it      The transactions I now saw are a pain to memory  For the   first few days after their success  the officers  under the same in    toxication with my late master  the serjeant  gave a loose to every   kind of extravagance  to compensate to themselves for the wants   and hardships they had suffered  But no sooner had they advanced   near the limits prescribed to their credit than the whole scene   changed  The first mention of the amount of their respective   shares was like a clap of thunder bursting over their heads  Their   astonishment for some time deprived them of their senses  But   when they were able to make a proper inquiry  and foimd the case   to be but too true  their rage broke through all bounds  and rose   almost to desperation  The horrors of a jail  the cries of a starving   family  every aggravation of human misery stared them in the face    and made the very thought of returning to their native country   too terrible to be endured  But there was no other remedy  Those   from whom alone it could proceed  were too much interested to   listen to their complaints  and  instead of preventing  permitted   their authority to be prostituted to complete their ruin  in the   manner proposed by their agents  so that the unhappy victims   were forced to submit to the terms imposed upon them  The   consequence of this  as I have said before  was that  to drown re    flection  they spent whatever trifle remained to them on concluding   the bargains which sealed their ruin in still greater excesses  and so   precipitated the distress they feared  As for the private men  the   impositions they suffered were  if possible  still severer  though   from their insensibility  perhaps  not so severely felt   as the man    agement of their affairs went through many more hands  every one   of whom had a pull at them  down to the very lowest class of the   harpies which prey upon an army  so that what remained to them   was too trifling to be of any service  even to the very few who   struggled with their necessities in order to save it      I have not entered minutely into the particulars of this horrid   scene  This slight sketch will give you a general notion of it  and   that is as much as a humane heart can bear  Indeed  no descrip    tion could reach the truth  I shall  therefore  only just flnish the   outlines of my master s character  and then pass on to the occur    rences in my next service  The extortions to which he was him    self forced to submit from those in authority  took off every shadow   of shame  to conscience he had long been a stranger  and added   double keenness to his natural propensity to extortion  by giving         330 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     it what he thought the appearance of justice  and provoking him   to wreak his resentment upon others  for what he suffered himself   from those above his reach  The opportunities for exerting his   talents this way were infinite in a  profession that is a mystery of   iniquity too complicated to be unravelled  too black to be conceived    but upon experience  which he had acquired to the most consum    mate degree  in the gradual progression of his life  A natural   sharpness of genius  which ought to have been curbed  not en    couraged  had influenced his parents to bind him  when very young    to an attorney  under whom he learned  besides other valuable   qualifications  the nice distinctions between law
