being dear to the most amiable woman breathing  in virtue of that claim  he may command every civility  every attention in my power  He breakfasted with me yesterday  we were two hours alone  and had a great deal of conversation  we afterwards spent the day together very agreably  on a party of pleasure in the country       I am going with him this afternoon to visit Miss Fermor  to whom he has a letter from the divine Emily  which he is to deliver himself       He is very handsome  but not of my favorite stile of beauty  extremely fair and blooming  with fine features  light hair and eyes  his countenance not absolutely heavy  but inanimate  and to my taste insipid  finely made  not ungenteel  but without that easy air of the world which I prefer to the most exact symmetry without it  In short  he is what the country ladies in England call a sweet pretty man  He dresses well  has the finest horses and the handsomest liveries I have seen in Canada  His manner is civil but cold  his conversation sensible but not spirited  he seems to be a man rather to approve than to love  Will you excuse me if I say  he resembles the form my imagination paints of Prometheus s man of clay  before he stole the celestial fire to animate him       Perhaps I scrutinize him too strictly  perhaps I am prejudiced in my judgment by the very high idea I had form d of the man whom Emily Montague could love  I will own to you  that I thought it impossible for her to be pleased with meer beauty  and I cannot even now change my opinion  I shall find some latent fire  some hidden spark  when we are better acquainted       I intend to be very intimate with him  to endeavour to see into his very soul  I am hard to please in a husband for my Emily  he must have spirit  he must have sensibility  or he cannot make her happy       He thank d me for my civility to Miss Montague  do you know I thought him impertinent  and I am not yet sure he was not so  though I saw he meant to be polite       He comes  our horses are at the door  Adieu   Yours   ED  RIVERS   Eight in the evening       We are return d  I every hour like him less  There were several ladies  French and English  with Miss Fermor  all on the rack to engage the Baronet s attention  you have no notion of the effect of a title in America  To do the ladies justice however  he really look d very handsome  the ride  and the civilities he receiv d from a circle of pretty women  for they were well chose  gave a glow to his complexion extremely favorable to his desire of pleasing  which  through all his calmness  it was impossible not to observe  he even attempted once or twice to be lively  but fail d  vanity itself could not inspire him with vivacity  yet vanity is certainly his ruling passion  if such a piece of still life can be said to have any passions at all       What a charm  my dear Lucy  is there in sensibility   Tis the magnet which attracts all to itself  virtue may command esteem  understanding and talents admiration  beauty a transient desire  but  tis sensibility alone which can inspire love       Yet the tender  the sensible Emily Montague no  my dear   tis impossible  she may fancy she loves him  but it is not in nature  unless she extremely mistakes his character  His approbation of her  for he cannot feel a livelier sentiment  may at present  when with her  raise him a little above his natural vegetative state  but after marriage he will certainly sink into it again       If I have the least judgment in men  he will be a cold  civil  inattentive husband  a tasteless  insipid  silent companion  a tranquil  frozen  unimpassion d lover  his insensibility will secure her from rivals  his vanity will give her all the drapery of happiness  her friends will congratulate her choice  she will be the envy of her own sex  without giving positive offence  he will every moment wound  because he is a stranger to  all the fine feelings of a heart like hers  she will seek in vain the friend  the lover  she expected  yet  scarce knowing of what to complain  she will accuse herself of caprice  and be astonish d to find herself wretched with the best husband in the world        I tremble for her happiness  I know how few of my own sex are to be found who have the lively sensibility of yours  and of those few how many wear out their hearts by a life of gallantry and dissipation  and bring only apathy and disgust into marriage  I know few men capable of making her happy  but this Sir George my Lucy  I have not patience       Did I tell you all the men here are in love with your friend Bell Fermor
