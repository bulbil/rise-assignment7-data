 a letter to his sister  at the desire of his uncle who  finding his end  approaching  wanted to see her without loss of time  Peregrine made his  appearance on the Bare  and was complimented on his coming abroad again   not only by his old messmates  who had not seen him for many weeks  but  by a number of those objects whom his liberality had fed  before his  funds were exhausted  Hatchway was  by his interest with the warden   put in possession of his former quarters  and Pipes despatched to make  inquiry about Crabtree at his former lodging  where he learned that  the misanthrope  after a very severe fit of illness  was removed to  Kensington Gravel pits  for the convenience of breathing a purer air  than that of London   In consequence of this information  Peregrine  who knew the narrowness  of the old gentleman s fortune  next day desired his friend Gauntlet to  take the trouble of visiting him  in his name  with a letter  in which  he expressed great concern for his indisposition  gave him notice of the  fortunate intelligence he had received from the Downs  and conjured  him to make use of his purse  if he was in the least hampered in his  circumstances  The captain took coach immediately  and set out for the  place  according to the direction which Pipes had procured   Cadwallader  having seen him at Bath  knew him again at first sight   and  though reduced to a skeleton  believed himself in such a fair  way of doing well  that he would have accompanied him to the Fleet  immediately  had he not been restrained by his nurse  who was  by his  physician  invested with full authority to dispute and oppose his will  in everything that she should think prejudicial to his health  for he  was considered  by those who had the care of him  as an old humourist   not a little distempered in his brain  He inquired particularly about  the sailors  who  he said  had deterred him from carrying on his  usual correspondence with Pickle  and been the immediate cause of his  indisposition  by terrifying him into a fever  Understanding that the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   breach between Pickle and Hatchway was happily cemented  and that he was  no longer in any danger from the lieutenant s resentment  he promised  to be at the Fleet with the first convenient opportunity  and  in the  meantime  wrote an answer to Peregrine s letter  importing  that he was  obliged to him for his offer  but had not the least occasion for his  assistance   In a few days  our adventurer recovered his vigour  complexion  and  vivacity  he mingled again in the diversions and parties of the place   and he received  in a little time  the money he had lent upon bottomry   which  together with the interest  amounted to upwards of eleven hundred  pounds  The possession of this sum  while it buoyed up his spirits   involved him in perplexity  Sometimes he thought it was incumbent  on him  as a man of honour  to employ the greatest part of it in  diminishing the debt for which he suffered  on the other hand  he  considered that obligation effaced  by the treacherous behaviour of his  creditor  who had injured him to ten times the value of the sum  and   in these sentiments  entertained thoughts of attempting his escape from  prison  with a view of conveying himself  with the shipwreck of  his fortune  to another country  in which he might use it to better  advantage   Both suggestions were attended with such doubts and difficulties  that  he hesitated between them  and for the present laid out a thousand  pounds in stock  the interest of which  together with the fruits of his  own industry  he hoped  would support him above want in his confinement   until something should occur that would point out the expediency of some  other determination  Gauntlet still insisted upon having the honour of  obtaining his liberty  at the expense of taking up his notes to Gleanum   and exhorted him to purchase a commission with part of the money which  he had retrieved  The lieutenant affirmed  that it was his privilege  to procure the release of his cousin Pickle  because he enjoyed a  very handsome sum by his aunt  which of right belonged to the young  gentleman  to whom he was  moreover  indebted for the use of his  furniture  and for the very house that stood over his head  and that   although he had already made a will in his favour  he should never be  satisfied  nor easy in his mind  so long as he remained deprived of his  liberty  and wanted any of the conveniences of life   Cadwallader  who by this time assisted at their councils  and was best  acquainted with the peculiarity and unbending disposition of the youth   proposed  that  seeing he was so averse to obligations  Mr
