you  Mr  Goodville  had the trouble of   contriving this business  and you ought at least to have the honour    if not the conduct  of your own plan      Mr  Goodville   Mr  Goodville   exclaimed Clement in a surprise    eagerly staring at him  and recollecting  as from a dream  the   altered features of his quondam friend and benefactor  Pray  sir    do you remember any thing of one Clement  a worthless young   fellow  whom once in your goodness you condescended to patronize     Clement   Clement   cried Mr  Goodville  getting up and hastening   to him  and catching him in his arms  My dear  my dear Clement    my man of merit and misfortunes  how rejoiced am I to find you     God be praised  God be praised   it is at length in my power to do   something material for you   But come with me to another room      Y 2         324 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      I have something to say to you   we will leave these gentlemen the   while to think further of the plan that lies before them      When Mr  Goodville and Clement had withdrawn Mr  Mole    said one of the company  you are concerned in a number of these   public benefactions  Yes  gentlemen  answered Mole  I believe   there is no charitable institution of any note in London in which I   am not a trustee  and to which I am not a contributor  For  though   I do not set up for sanctification by faith  yet I think I may pretend   to some justification by charity  Let the vulgar herd pay their   priesthood for cheating them out of their senses I give nothing to   the fat impostors  or their lucrative fable   my substance is little   enough for myself and the poor  Why  pray  sir  said Harry  are   you not a Christian   No  indeed  master  answered Mole  nor any   man who has sense enough to think for himself  Be pleased then    cried Harry  to hand me that paper a moment   here  sir  I dash my   name and contribution from the list of the subscribers  He who   denies glory to God in the highest  can never have peace or goodwill   toward men   and so  sir  you shall never be the almoner of a penny   of my money      You talk as you look  my dear  cried Mole   like one just eloped   from the nursery  where you were affrighted by tales of ghosts and   hobgoblins  I acknowledge  gentlemen  the benefit and beauty of   morality in its fullest extent   and had Jesus  the Christian prophet    confined himself to his system of moral precepts  I think he would   justly have been esteemed the greatest philosopher and legislator   that ever breathed   but when he  or rather his disciples in his   name  in order to enhance the authority of their mission  pre    tended to divinity in their master  the low bred and ignorant   wretches pulled together against the grain  and compounded such   a strange medley of fighting inconsistencies  and self evident ab    surdities  as are wholly eversive of every principle of right reason   and common  sense  They taught that God was made a man that    in order to expiate the sins of the world  the innocent was appointed   to suffer for the guilty that the sins of all offenders were to be   imputed to one who had never offended  and that the righteousness   of him who had never offended was to be imputed to criminals of   the deepest dye that the Creator submitted himself to the   malignity of his creatures  and that God himself died a shameful   death on the cross  And this  gentlemen  makes such a heap of   ridiculous incoherences such contradictions in sense and terms as   exceeds even the worship of apes and serpents  leeks and onions    and the other garbage of Egypt      You are a villain  and a thief  and a liar  cried Harry  altogether   inflamed with choler  Mole  on hearing these terms of highest   affront and reproach  instantly caught up a bottle and threw it at   our hero s head   but it happily missed him  and only bruised the   fleshy part of the shoulder of the gentleman who sat next  Harry   instantly sprang up and made at Mole  while the company rose also   and attempted to interfere   but some he cast on one hand and some   on the other  and overturning such as directly opposed him  he
