of his passion  which his fears magnified into hate  Oh  Emily  do I indeed hate him  you  to whose dear bosom your Julia confides her every thought  tell me if I hate this most amiable of mankind  You know by what imperceptible steps my inexperienced heart has been seduced to love  you know how deceived by the sacred name of friendship    But why do I seek to excuse my sensibility  is he not worthy all my tenderness  are we not equal in all but wealth  a consideration below my care  is not his merit above titles and riches  How shall I paint his delicacy  his respectful fondness  Too plainly convinced of his power over my heart  he disdains to use that power to my disadvantage  he declares he will never receive me but from my father  he consents to leave me till a happier fortune enables him to avow his love to all the world  he goes without asking the least promise in his favour  Heaven sure will        1 201       prosper his designs  will reward a heart like his  Oh  my Emily  did my father see with my eyes  what is fortune in the balance with such virtue  Had I worlds in my own power  I should value them only as they enabled me to show more strongly the disinterestedness of my affection      Born with a too tender heart  which never before found an object worthy its attachment  the excess of my affection is unspeakable  Delicate in my choice even of friends  it was not easy to find a lover equal to that idea of perfection my imagination had formed  he alone of all mankind rises up to it  the speaking grace  the easy dignity of his air  are the natural consequences of the superiority of his soul  He looks as if born to command the world  I am interrupted  Adieu            1 202       August 15th      To Colonel Bellville      YOU never were more mistaken  you will not have the honor of seeing me yet in town  My Lord thinks it infinitely more respectful to his Royal Master to celebrate this happy event in the country         My congratulations  says he  would be lost in the crowd of a drawing room  but here I can diffuse a spirit of loyalty and joy through half a country  and impress all around me with the same veneration and love for the most amiable of Princes which burns in my own bosom         Our entertainment yesterday was magnifique  and in the Gusto Belmonto  there is a beautiful lake in the park  on the borders          1 203       of which  on one side  interspersed amongst the trees  which form a woody theatre round it  at a distance of about three hundred yards  tents were fixed for the company to dine in  which consisted of all the gentlemen s families twenty miles round  Westbrook and his daughter were there  as my Lord would not shock them by leaving them only out when the whole neighbourhood were invited  tho  he observed  smiling  this was a favor  for these kind of people were only gentlemen by the courtesy of England  Streamers of the gayest colors waved on the tops of the tents  and glittered in the dancing sun beams  The tables were spread with every delicacy in season  at which we placed ourselves in parties  without ceremony or distinction  just as choice or accident directed  On a little island in the midst of the lake  an excellent band of music was placed  which played some of the finest compositions of Handel        1 204       during our repast  which ended  we spread ourselves on the borders of the lake  where we danced on the verdant green  till tea and coffee again summoned us to the tents  and when evening  had in her sober livery all things clad   a superb supper  and grand ball in the saloon  finished our festival      Nor were the villagers forgot  Tables were spread for them on the opposite side of the lake  under the shade of the tallest trees  and so disposed as to form the most agreeable points of view to us  as our encampment must do to them        I am ill at describing  but the least had a thousand unspeakable charms        Poor Harry  How I pity him  His whole soul was absorbed in the contemplation          1 205       of Lady Julia  with whom he danced  His eyes perpetually followed her  and  if I mistake not  his will not be the only heart which aches at parting on Tuesday  for so long is Harry s going postponed  He may go  but  like the wounded deer  he carries the arrow in his breast   Adio
