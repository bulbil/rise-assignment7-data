without that Sanction  After   having indulged the raptures this condescention excited  he proceeded to   the rest  and found the next he opened was from the baron de Palfoy  who   expressed himself to him in these terms        To Colonel  HORATIO           I think myself obliged to you for so much   exceeding the character I gave you  but I   value myself on knowing mankind  and am glad   to find I was not deceived in you  when I expected   you to do more than I durst venture on   my own opinion to assure the count  He tells me    in a letter I received from him the last courier    that the victorious Charles XII  himself cannot   behave with greater bravery in the time of action    nor more moderation after it is over   This   is a great praise  indeed  from such a man   as he  and I acquaint you with it not to make   you vain  for that would blemish the lustre of   your other good qualities  but that you may   know how to make proper acknowledgments to   that minister         Our court  I know  makes pressing influences   to the king of Sweden not to carry on the way   any farther  I wish they may succeed  or if they   should not  that you might be able to find some   opportunity of quitting the service for reasons   which you will see in a letter that accompanies   this  and to which nothing can be added to convince   you what part you ought to take   I   shall therefore say no more than that I am  with   a very tender regard        Yours        PALFOY          Rejoiced as he was at receiving a letter from the father of his   mistress  wrote in a manner which he might look upon as a kind of   confirmation he no longer would be refractory to his wishes  the latter   part of it contained an enigma he could by no means comprehend   It   seemed impossible to him there could be any reasons prevalent enough to   make him quit  with honour  a prince who had so liberally rewarded his   service  but hoping a further explanation  he lost not any time in   conjectures  and tearing open the other letter without giving himself   time to examine the hand in which it was directed  found  to his   inexpressible astonishment  the name of Dorilaus subscribed  It was   indeed wrote by that gentleman  and contained at follows        Dear Horatio            Accidents  which at our parting neither of   us could foresee  have doubtless long since   made you cease to hope any continuance of that   kindness my former behaviour seemed to promise    but never  perhaps did heaven deal its   blessings with a more mysterious hand than it   has done to you   That seeming neglect in   me  at a time when you were a prisoner among   strangers  and had most need of my assistance    had the appearance of the greatest misfortune   could befall you  yet has it been productive of   the greatest good  and laid the foundation of a   happiness which cannot be but lasting   I reserve   the explanation of this riddle till you arrive   at Paris  where I now am  and intend to   continue my whole life   That I impatiently   desire to see you  ought to be a sufficient inducement   for you to return with as much expedition   as possible   I will therefore make this   experiment of that affection  I might add duty    you owe me  and only give you leave to guess   what recompence this proof of your obedience   will entitle you to   If therefore the king of   Sweden is resolute to extend his conquests  entreat   his permission to resign  I know the obligations   you have to that excellent prince  but I   know also you have others to me which cannot   be dispensed with   besides  his majesty s affairs   cannot suffer by the loss of one man  yours   will be in danger  if not totally ruined  by your   continuance with him  and myself deprived at   the same time of the only remaining comfort of   my days   Your sister left me soon after you   did   she went to Aix la Chapelle  since   which I have never been able to hear any thing   of her   Let me not lose you both  if you   have any regard for your own interest
