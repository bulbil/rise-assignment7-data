 I fitted out my ship  and maimed her   with a crew as desperate as myself   resolving  though the war was   at an end  to pursue my revenge upon the Spaniards on the defence    less coast of their American dominions  in which my other passions   were urged to haste by fear of my creditors  the news of my failing   having come to Jamaica almost as soon as myseU      We therefore set out upon our cruise  or rather  piracy  without   delay  of which I shall not raise your horror with any further par    ticulars than that we went directly to the Spanish Main  where we   not only rifled all the ships we met  but also made descents on the   coasts and ravaged with a barbarity that was a reproach to human   nature      The tumult and hurry of this life kept my spirits in an agitation   that gave a kind of respite to my grief   and the spoil we made of   our first enterprises was so great as to awake hopes of restoring my   affairs so as to enable me to return to England with all the credit   wealth could give   and could I have known when to stop I was   soon rich even beyond my most sanguine hopes  But urged by   avarice and encouraged by success  I still went on headlong to my   fate  which I met in an attempt upon a town some way up the   country  the convenience and pleasantness of whose situation had   made it the residence of the richest families in the whole province    as its distance from the coast made  them live in a state of perfect   security without any fortification or guard      To this place we directed our march one evening  and arrived   at it a little after midnight  with an intention to surprise the in    habitants and return to our ship with the spoil before the country   could rise to intercept us      The first part of our design succeeded  and we got possession   of the town without any resistance  where we committed all   the outrages and roamed about with the Ucentious carelessness of   freebooters under no command      While every one thus prowled about for prey  Fate goaded me   to an arbour in a garden whither I followed the cries of women    I was just rushing in among them  inflamed with brutal desire  when   what was my astonishment to see AmeiUa in the most magnificent   undress throwing heaps of gold and jewels into a vault that opened   by a trap door into the arbour   I stood motionless at the sight   for some moments in distrust of my senses  But two such objects   as she and her riches soon awoke me from my trance  and I advanced   to take possession of both  resolving not to discover myself tiU a   more proper time   the strangeness of my dress  that was designed   to strike horror  and the blood which  from scenes of cruelty and         16 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     murder just committed  still reeked upon my hands and face    making it imposaible that she should know me      At the sight of me the women all shrieked  and Amelia  as I   advanced to lay hold on her  fell into a swoon  This embarrassed   me greatly  as I had no time to lose  for our sentinels just then   sounded a retreat  However  I determined to wait a little to see   if she recovered   and  stooping to raise her  to give her air  I re    ceived such a blow from behind as deprived me of all sense for   several hours   when  on my recovering  I found myself chained   on the ground in a dungeon      I was some time before I could believe my senses  or conceive   where I was   till the jailor  coming to see if I was alive  gave me   to understand that my companions had gone off without me  and   left me in the hands of a nobleman  who had himself knoektii me   down  as I was going to commit a rape upon his lady whUe she lay   in a swoon   and that I had been thrown into this dungeon that   if I recovered  I might suffer the punishment due to the outrages   we had committed both here and in several other places of their   dominions      I wanted no further information to show me the horrors of my   situation  I saw them all  and aggravated an hundredfold by the   accusation of my own conscience that could now trace the hand   of Heaven in the justice of my punishment  which had thus over    taken me
