to do it effectually  she began with   telling him the whole story of Lady Mellasin s and Miss Flora s removal    and then complained how dully she should pass the time with only Mr    Goodman  and an old gentlewoman who was to come to be his housekeeper     I thought you were about marrying   said he   and expected  from what   Mr  Goodman wrote to me  that my first compliment to you  on my arrival    would have been to have wished you joy   You are not broke off with the   gentleman  are you        The careless air with which he spoke these words  stung Miss Betsy to   the quick  she took no notice  however  how much she was piqued at them    but replied  that the whole affair was mere suggestion  that it was   true  indeed  she had for some time received the addresses of a   gentleman recommended by her brother Frank  that he  and some other of   her friends  were very much for the match  and she supposed had spoke of   it as a thing concluded on  because they wished it to be so  but  for   her own part  she never had as yet entertained one serious thought about   the matter  and  at present  was far from having any disposition to   become a wife   So that   continued she   if I am doomed to stay in Mr    Goodman s house  till I am relieved that way  it is very probable I may   be moped to death  and married to my grave         Where is the necessity for that   said he   Are there not places enough   in town  where you may find good company to board or lodge   with     Doubtless there are many such  Sir   replied she  with some   spirit   and if I am so unhappy as not to have any friend so kind to   make me an invitation  shall be obliged to seek an asylum amongst   strangers        Mr  Thoughtless looked a little confounded at these words  he had seen    from the beginning of her discourse  the aim to which it tended  and  as   he had his own reasons for not complying with her desire  would not seem   to understand her  but she now spoke too plain  and he was somewhat at a   loss what answer to make  so as not to give her any cause of accusing   his want of affection  and at the same time put her off from expecting   he would agree to what she would have him  in this point  when    fortunately for his relief  a letter  just brought by the post  was   presented to Miss Betsy   From L    e   said she  as soon as she took it   into her hand   From brother Frank  then  I suppose   cried he   No     answered she   from Lady Trusty  you will excuse me  brother  while I   look over the contents   She broke it open while she was speaking  and   read to herself as follows             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            My dear Miss Betsy            Sir Ralph received yesterday a letter from Mr  Thoughtless  dated        Calais  the third instant  so I doubt not but by this time I may        congratulate you on his safe arrival in London  but I am sorry to        acquaint you  that while you were embracing one brother  you were        in very great danger of losing another  but do not be too much        alarmed  I hope the worst is past  I believe he gave you an account        himself  that  by an unlucky fall from his horse  he was prevented        from going to London so soon as he had designed  but the mischief        done him by this accident was much greater than he imagined at the        time of his writing to you  What he took only for a common bruise         proved to be a contusion  and  for want of proper care at first         through the outrageousness of the pain  soon brought on a fever         for two whole days we were in the utmost apprehensions for his        life  but now  thanks
