and her favourite man had been caressing Miss ELLIOT through mistake for his mistress     133Some time after this adventure  Miss ELLIOT was engaged in another  which proved equally diverting with the former  An old French marquis  who was of a very amorous turn of mind  had lately been married to a young woman  who  not satisfied with her husband  had left him to live with a young French officer  This old gentleman  who resolved to be even with his wife  was looking out for some young woman  over whom his gold might make some impression  and having seen Miss ETLIOT at the play  resolved to tempt her with the golden bait  Accordingly  having found out where she lived  he sent his servant to her with a letter  requesting leave to see her at her own lodgings  as he had something of importance to communicate to her   She returned for answer  that she should be very glad to see him the next day  and he accordingly came at the appointed time  When he entered the room where she was  he saluted her very respectfully  which she returned with equal politeness  and being seated  he began to tell her his errand  adding  that if she proved cruel  it must   134 infallibly put an end to his life  Miss ELLIOT smiled within herself at his discourse  and imagining the duke could not have the least reason to object against her ke•ping company with a person fourscore years of age  she gave him such answers  as seemed to intimate  that he was far from being disagreeable to her   The marquis de Chancy  for that was his name  resolved to do all he could to render himself agreeable to her  and accordingly loaded her with presents and money  jewels and other valuable things  to a very considerable amount  in return for all which favours he esteemed himself amply recompenced  if he was sometimes indu ged with the favour of a kiss  or a squeeze of her hand  Our heroine was perfectly well satisfied with her new lover  whose deportment was really so far from leaving any room for jealousy  that it excited a deal of laughter in the duke when he was told of it  and with all the good humour imaginable  he congratulated his mistress on the new conquest she had made  The old marquis on the other   135 hand  rejoiced that he had succeeded so well in his amour with Miss ELLIOT  and thought the revenge he was now taking on his wife for her infidelity to him  entirely adequate to her crime   He did not however long enjoy his supposed happiness  The duke de N—nois invited the old gentleman to pass a month during the summer season with him  at his country feat  at the village of Bray  situated about four miles to the south of Paris  While they were there  the amour between the marquis and Miss ELLIOT was discovered by the officer who had so often adorned the old gentleman s forehead with what is esteemed an opprobrium to married men   Although before this discovery he had carried on the intrigue with very little restraint  he now openly avowed it  and our heroine to save her reputation was constrained to desire him to discontinue his visits  which he most readily complied with  as his fortune would not suffer him to support the expence he daily incurred   136 in keeping company with one so extravagant as Miss ELLIOT   It did not end here with the marquis  for the officer having told all his acquaintance the affair between him and our heroine  it added not a little to the lessening of his character  and he therefore concluded that he had much better seek out some other mistress  one who was not kept by  or had any connexion with any other men  as that would alone exempt him from the danger of being made the ridicule of all his acquaintance   Miss ELLIOT s next lover was a captain of foot  who behaved very generous to her  so as to merit her good graces in a higher degree  than any who solicited her favours after she was kept by the marquis de Chancy  He was a man endowed with such amiable qualities  that no woman could see him without immediately falling in love with him  and he had also such an engaging manner  that those who had been once in his company were become enamoured of him  With these qualifications  which were sufficient   137 to recommend him to the love of a woman of far less vanity than Miss ELLIOT  he found the way to her heart  and he had the pleasure to see that he was as agreeable to her as she could be to him  It may perhaps not be disagreeable to give our readers the following account of him   He was called captain R—ss  and was in his youth destined for maritime service  His father  who was a gentleman of small fortune in the west of England  had made friends to procure him the king s letter for a man of war  but as his greatest ambition was to appear the polite man  and the sea generally giving an air of rusticity which frequenting the best company can scarce wear off  he was obstinately bent on not accepting this proposal  Though his father
