Mr Faulkland was very inquisitive to learn particulars from my lady  which  he said  he was sure I had told her  but she took care not to give him the least hint which could lead him to suppose that He had any share in my fate  She says  he raves like a madman  and that she finds it absolutely necessary to keep him in ignorance of the truth  She was obliged to tell him  that my having discovered Mr Arnold’s amour with Mrs Gerrarde  she believed  was the sole cause of our separation  He asked her  Was she sure there was no other  adding  That he thought my temper had been too gentle  to fly  on a sudden  to such extremes  My lady took occasion to ask him  Whether he did not visit Mrs Gerrarde  He replied  He did sometimes  having formerly known her at Bath  She concludes with telling me  That Mr Arnold is become quite invisible to every friend he has  Mrs Gerrarde engrossing him wholly   I hope Mr Faulkland may not suspect how much He is concerned in my misfortune  my absenting myself  for some time before I left home  from V—— hall  and my departure from my husband     immediately after my interview with Mr Faulkland at Mrs Gerrarde’s  may raise some distrust in his mind  but  while it continues merely surmise  he can have no pretence for requiring an explanation from Mr Arnold  so that  if my husband keeps his own council  which he seems inclined to do  and my lord and lady V—— preserve the secret  I shall rest satisfied   October 20  My mother has written to Sir George  and given him a full account of my situation  with a request  which I prevailed on her to make  that he would not take any notice of the affair till he saw us  My brother  perhaps  may think of a way  with tenderness and safety  to remove Mr Arnold’s doubts  without farther exposing my reputation  or laying my husband open to mischief  A prudent  cool  and at the same time zealous friend  might devise some means to effect this  but I fear my brother’s disregard to Mr Arnold  his diminished love for me  and his resentment to my mother  will prevent him from engaging with that alacrity or precaution that the nicety of circumstances may require  I will  therefore  wait with patience  till God  in his own time  shall raise me from the state of humiliation into which I am fallen   October 22  With what a tortoise pace does time advance to the wretched  how dismal are those hours which are spent in reflecting on lost happiness  O Faulkland  how light was thy transgression  if we consider the consequences  compared to that which has driven me from my home  and from my children  steeled my husband’s heart against me  heaped infamy on my head  and loaded my mother’s age with sorrow and remorse  All this is the fatal consequence of Mr Arnold’s breach of his marriage vow  all this  and much more  I fear  that is to come   We keep ourselves entirely concealed from the knowlege of all our acquaintance  not a mortal visits us  but  now and then  Miss Burchell  and I have never stirred out of doors but to church   October 28  Sir George has answered my mother’s letter  just as I feared he would  he speaks of Mr Arnold with more contempt and aversion  than he does of me with pity or brotherly kindness  He says  ‘It is well    for him  that Mr Faulkland knows not of his injurious suspicions of him  or he would vindicate himself in a manner he little thinks of ’ He tells us  He does not know  at this distance  how to advise  but that  as I am of so patient and forbearing a spirit  he thinks my wrongs may sleep till he comes to town  which cannot yet be these three or four weeks  having leases to renew with his tenants  and abundance of other business to do in the country —So much for George’s tenderness   October 29  My comforts are circumscribed within a very narrow compass  for I cannot reckon one  but what I receive from poor Patty’s letters  who never fails to send me weekly an account of my dear little children  They are well  thank God  and not yet abandoned by their father  but even the knowlege of this is imbittered by repeated hints of Mr Arnold’s lost condition  Lost  I may call it  for his whole soul is absorbed in the mad pursuit of his own ruin  The poor girl  in the bitterness of her indignation  tells me  he has made Mrs Gerrarde a present of a favourite little pad of mine  she says  she had a mind to tear her off  when she saw her mounted upon it   I wish not to be told of any of Mr Arnold’s motions  and should forbid Patty to write to me any thing upon the subject  but that I fear my letter might fall into Mr Arnold’s hands  his curiosity might lead him to open it  for the conscious mind
