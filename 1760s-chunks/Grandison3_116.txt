I have not deserved of you  It can not be answered  at least by me  I shall not leave Bologna till I apprize you of it  and till I have the misfortune to be assured  that I cannot have any hope of the honour once designed me  I will only add  That my principles were well known before I was written to at Vienna   And do you reproach us with that step  It was a base one  It had not my concurrence  He went from me in a passion   I had enough at my heart  Dr  Bartlett  had I been spared this insult from a brother of Clementina  It went very hard with me to be threatened  But I thank God  I do not deserve the treatment   LETTER XXVIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   London  Friday Morning  Mar 31   HERE  my Lucy  once more I am  We arrived yesterday in the afternoon   Lady Betty Williams and Miss Clements have been already to welcome me on my return  My cousin   289 says  they are inseparable  I am glad of it  for Lady Betty s sake   Dr  Bartlett is extremely obliging  One would think  that he and his kinsman give up all their time in transcribing for us  I send you now his seventh  eight  and ninth Letters  In reading the two latter  we were struck  for the two sisters and my Lord were with us  with the nobleness of Clementina  Her motive  thro  her whole dilirium  is so apparently owing to her concern for the Soul of the man she loved  entirely regardless of any interest of her own  that we all forgot what had been so long our wishes  and joined in giving a preference to her   Dr  Bartlett s seventh Letter   I Had another visit paid me  proceeds Mr  Grandison  two hours after the general left me  by the kind hearted Camilla  disguised as before   I come now  Chevalier  said she  with the Marchioness s connivance  and I may say  by her command  and at the same time  by the command of Signor Jeronymo  who knows of my last attendance upon you  tho  no one else does  not even the Marchioness  He gave me this Letter for you   But how does the noblest young Lady in Italy  Camilla  How does Lady Clementina   More composed than we could have hoped for from the height of her dilirum  It was high  for she has but a very faint idea of having seen you this morning   The Marchioness had bid her say  that altho I had now given her despair instead of hope  yet that she owed it to my merit  and to the sense she had of the benefits they had actually received at my hands  to let me know  that it was but too likely that resentments might be carried to an unhappy length  and that therefore she wished I would leave Bologna for the present  If happier prospects presented  she would be the first to congratulate me upon them     290 I opened the Letter of my kind Jeronymo  These were the contents   I Am infinitely concerned  my dear Grandison  to find a man equally generous and brave as my brothor is  hurried away by passion  You may have acted with your usual magnaminity in preferring your Religion to your Love  and to your Glory  I  for my part  think you to be a distressed man  If you are not  you must be very insensible to the merits of an excellent woman  and very ungrateful to the distinction she honours you with  I must write in this stile  and think she does honour by it even to my Grandison  But should the consequences of this affair be unhappy for either of you  if  in particular  for my brother  What cause of regret would our family have  that a younger brother was saved by the hand which deprived them of a more worthy elder  If for you  how deplorable would be the reflexion  that you saved one brother  and perished by the hand of another  Would to God that his passion  and your spirit  were more moderate  But let me request this favour of you  That you retire to Florence  for a few days  at least   How unhappy am I  that I am disabled from taking part in a more active mediation —Yet the General admires you  But how can we blame in him a zeal for the honour of this family  in which he would be glad at his soul to include a zeal for yours   For God s sake quit Bologna for a few days only  Clementina is more sedate  I have carried it  that her confessor shall not at present visit her  yet he is an honest and a pious man   What a fatality  Every one to mean well  yet every one to be miserable  and can Religion be the cause of so much unhappiness  I cannot act  I can only reflect  My dear friend  let me know by a line  that you will depart from Bologna tomorrow    291
