 among other things  she pretended to joke me upon my passion for Narcissa  which she averred was no secret  and asked if I intended to dance with her at the next assembly —I was a good deal concerned to find myself become the town talk on this subject  lest the Squire  having notice of my inclinations  should disapprove of them  and by breaking off all correspondence with me  deprive me of the opportunities I now enjoyed —But I resolved to use the interest I had with him  while it lasted  and that very night  meeting him occasionally  asked his permission to solicit her company at the ball  which he very readily granted  to my inexpressible satisfaction   Having been kept awake the greatest part of the night  by a thousand delightful reveries that took possession of my fancy  I got up betimes  and flying to the place of rendezvous  had in a little time the pleasure of seeing Miss Williams approach with a smile on her countenance  which I interpreted into a good omen  Neither was I mistaken in my presage  She presented me with a letter from the idol of my soul  which  after having kissed it with great devotion  I opened with the utmost eagerness  and was blessed with her approbation in these terms     231  SIR   TO say I look upon you with indifference  would be a piece of dissimulation which  I think  no decorum requires  and no custom can justify  As my heart never felt an impression that my tongue was ashamed to declare  I will not scruple to own myself pleased with your passion  confident of your integrity  and so well convinced of my own discretion  that I should not hesitate in granting you the interview you desire  were I not over awed by the prying curiosity of a malicious world  the censure of which might be fatally prejudicial to the reputation of  Your NARCISSA   No Anchorite in the exstasy of devotion  ever adored a relique with more fervour than that with which I kissed this inimitable proof of my charmer s candour  generosity and affection  I read it over an hundred times  was ravished with her confession in the beginning  but the subscription of YOUR NARCISSA  yielded me such delight as I had never felt before  My happiness was still increased by Miss Williams  who blessed me with a repetition of her lady s tender expressions in my favour  when she received and read my letter —In short  I had all the reason in the world to believe that this gentle creature s bosom was possessed by a passion for me  as warm    232 though perhaps not so impetuous  as mine for her   I informed my friend of the Squire s consent  with regard to my dancing with Narcissa at the ball  and desired her to tell her mistress  that I would do myself the honour of visiting her in the afternoon  in consequence of his permission  when I hoped to find her as indulgent as her brother had been complaisant in that particular —Miss Williams expressed a good deal of joy  at hearing I was so much in favour with the fox hunter  and ventured to assure me  that my visit would be very agreeable to my mistress  the rather because Bruin was engaged to dine abroad —This was a circumstance  which I scarce need say  pleased me —I went immediately to the long room  where I found him  and affecting to know nothing of his engagement  told him  I would do myself the pleasure to wait upon him in the afternoon  and to present his sister with a ticket for the ball —He shook me by the hand  according to custom  and giving me to understand that he was to dine abroad  desired me to go and drink tea with Narcissa notwithstanding  and promised to prepare her for my visit in the mean time   Every thing succeeding thus to my wish  I waited with incredible patience for the time  which no sooner arrived  than I hastened to the scene  which my fancy had pre occupied long before —I was introduced accordingly  to the dear enchantress  whom I found accompanied by Miss Williams  who  on pretence of ordering tea  retired at my approach —This favourable accident  which alarmed my whole soul  disordered her also —I found myself actuated by an irresistible   233 impulse  I advanced to her with eagerness and awe  and profiting by the confusion that prevailed over her  clasped the fair angel in my arms  and imprinted a glowing kiss upon her lips  more soft and fragrant than the dewy rosebud just bursting from the stem  Her face was in an instant covered with blushes  her eyes sparkled with resentment  I threw myself at her feet  and implored her pardon —Her love became advocate in my cause  her look softened into forgiveness  she raised me up  and chid me with so much sweetness of displeasure  that I was tempted to repeat the offence  had not the coming of a servant with the tea board  prevented my presumption —While we were subject to be interrupted or over heard  we conversed about the approaching ball  at which she promised to grace me as a partner  but when the equi was removed  and we were left alone  I
