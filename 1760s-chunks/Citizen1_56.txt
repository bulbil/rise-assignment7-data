superior sanctity  learning  and rectitude  that there was no such thing heard of as persons being introduced into the church merely to oblige a senator  or provide for the younger branch of a noble family  I expected  as their minds were continually set upon heavenly things  to see their eyes directed there also  and hoped from their behaviour to perceive their inclinations corresponding with their duty  But I am since informed  that some are appointed to preside over temples they never visit  and  while they receive all the money  are contented with letting others do all the good   Adieu   LETTER XLI  From Fum Hoam  to Lien Chi Altangi  the discontented wanderer  by the way of Moscow   MUST I ever continue to condemn thy perseverance  and blame that curiosity  which destroys thy happiness  What yet untasted banquet  what luxury yet unknown  has rewarded thy painful adventures  Name a pleasure which thy native country could not amply procure  frame a wish that might not have been satisfied in China  Why then such toil  and such danger  in pursuit of raptures within your reach at home     176The Europeans  you will say  excel us in sciences and in arts  those sciences which bound the aspiring wish  and those arts which tend to gratify even unrestrained desire  They may perhaps outdo us in the arts of building ships  casting cannons  or measuring mountains  but are they superior in the greatest of all arts  the art of governing kingdoms and ourselves   When I compare the history of China with that of Europe  how do I exult in being a native of that kingdom which derives its original from the sun  Upon opening the Chinese history  I there behold an antient extended empire  established by laws which nature and reason seem to have dictated  The duty of children to their parents  a duty which nature implants in every breast  forms the strength of that government which has subsisted for time immemorial  Filial obedience is the first and greatest requisite of a state  by this we become good subjects to our emperors  capable of behaving with just subordination to our superiors  and grateful dependants on heaven  by this we become fonder of marriage  in order to be capable of exacting obedience from others in our turn  by this we become good magistrates  for early submission is the truest lesson to those who would learn to rule  By this the whole state may be said to resemble one family  of which the Emperor is the protector  father  and friend   In this happy region  sequestered from the rest of mankind  I see a succession of princes who in general considered themselves as the fathers of their people  a race of philosophers who bravely combated idolatry  prejudice  and tyranny  at the expence   177 of their private happiness and immediate reputation  Whenever an usurper or a tyrant intruded into the administration  how have all the good and great been united against him  Can European history produce an instance like that of the twelve mandarines  who all resolved to apprize the vicious emperor Tisiang of the irregularity of his conduct  He who first undertook the dangerous task was cut in two by the emperor s order  the second was ordered to be tormented  and then put to a cruel death  the third undertook the task with intrepidity  and was instantly stabbed by the tyrant s hand  in this manner they all suffered  except one  But not to be turned from his purpose  the brave survivor entering the palace with the instruments of torture in his hand  Here  cried he  addressing himself to the throne  here  O Tisiang  are the marks your faithful subjects receive for their loyalty  I am wearied with serving a tyrant  and now come for my reward  The emperor  struck with his intrepidity  instantly forgave the boldness of his conduct  and reformed his own  What European annals can boast of a tyrant thus reclaimed to lenity   When five brethren had set upon the great emperor Ginsong alone  with his sabre he slew four of them  he was struggling with the fifth  when his guards coming up were going to cut the conspirator into a thousand pieces  No  no  cried the emperor  with a calm and placid countenance  of all his brothers he is the only one remaining  at least let one of the family be suffered to live  that his aged parents may have some body left to feed and comfort them     178When Haitong  the last emperor of the house of Ming  saw himself besieged in his own city by the usurper  he was resolved to issue from his palace with six hundred of his guards  and give the enemy battle  but they forsook him  Being thus without hopes  and chusing death rather than to fall alive into the hands of a rebel  he retired to his garden  conducting his little daughter  an only child in his hand  There  in a private arbour unsheathing his sword  he stabbed the young innocent to the heart  and then dispatching himself  left the following words written with his blood on the border of his vest  Forsaken by my subjects  abandoned by my friends  use my body as you will
