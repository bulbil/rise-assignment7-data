is a faithful delineation of the misfortunes sustained by my family  This answer excited Aurora s curiosity  and she testified so strong a desire to learn the particulars  that the widow of Don Pedro could do no otherwise than promise her the satisfaction she desired  This promise  made before Ortiz  her two fellow servants  and myself  rooted us to the spot on which we were listening to their former conversation  My mistress would have sent us away  but Elvira  who saw plainly that we were dying with eagerness to be present at the explanation of the picture  had the goodness to desire us to stay  alleging at the same time that the story she had to relate was not of a nature to enjoin secrecy  After a moment s recollection  she began her recital to the following effect          CH  IV     The Fatal Marriage  a Novel   ROGER  king of Sicily  had a brother and a sister  His brother  by name Mainfroi  rebelled against him  and kindled a war in the kingdom  bloody in its immediate effects  and portentous in its future consequences  But it was his fate to lose two battles  and to fall into the king s hands  The punishment of his revolt extended no further than the loss of liberty  This act of clemency served only to make Roger pass for a barbarian in the estimation of the disaffected party among his subjects  They contended that he had saved his brother s life only to wreak his vengeance on him by tortures the more merciless because protracted  People in general  on better grounds  transferred the blame of Mainfroi s harsh treatment while in prison to his sister Matilda  That princess had  in fact  cherished a long rooted hatred against this prince  and was indefatigable in her persecutions during his whole life  She died in a very short time after him  and her premature fate was considered as the retribution of a just providence for her disregard of those sentiments implanted by nature for the best purposes   Mainfroi left behind him two sons  They were yet in their childhood  Roger had a kind of lurking desire to get rid of them  under the apprehension lest  when arrived at a more advanced age  the wish of avenging their father might hurry them to the revival of a faction which was not so entirely overthrown as to be incapable of originating new intrigues in the state  He communicated his purpose to the senator Leontio Siffredi  his minister  who diverted him from his bloody thoughts by undertaking the education of Prince Enriquez  the eldest  and recommending the care of the younger  by name Don Pedro  to the constable of Sicily  as a trusty counsellor and loyal servant  Roger  assured that his nephews would be trained up by these two men in principles of due submission to the royal authority  gave up the reins of guardianship to their control  and himself took charge of his niece Constance  She was of the same age with Enriquez  and only daughter of the princess Matilda  He allowed her an establishment of female attendants  and of masters in every branch of the politer studies  so that nothing was wanting either to her instruction or her state   Leontio Siffredi had a castle at the distance of less than two leagues from Palermo  in a spot named Belmonte  There it was that this minister exerted all his talents and diligence  to render Enriquez worthy of one day ascending the throne of Sicily  From the first  he discovered dispositions so amiable in that prince  that his attachment became as strong as if he had no child of his own  He had  however  two daughters    Blanche  the first born  one year younger than the prince  was armed at all points with the weapons of a most perfect beauty  Her sister Portia was still in her cradle  The mother had died in child bed of this youngest  Blanche and Prince Enriquez conceived a reciprocal affection as soon as they were alive to the influence of love  but they were not allowed to improve their acquaintance into familiar intercourse  The prince nevertheless found the means of occasionally eluding the prudential vigilance of his guardian  He knew sufficiently well how to avail himself of those precious moments  and prevailed so far with Siffredi s daughter  as to gain her consent to the execution of a project which he meditated  It happened precisely at this time that Leontio was obliged by the king s order to take a journey into one of the most remote provinces in the island  During his absence Enriquez got an opening made in the wall of his apartment  which led into Blanche s chamber  This opening was concealed by a sliding shutter  so exactly corresponding with the wainscot  and so closely fitting in with the ceiling and the floor  that the most suspicious eye could not have detected the contrivance  A skilful workman  whom the prince had gained over to his interests  helped him to this private communication with equal speed and secrecy   The enamoured Enriquez having obtained this inlet into his mistress s chamber  sometimes availed himself of his privilege  but he never took advantage of her partiality  Imprudent as it may well be thought  to admit of a secret entrance
