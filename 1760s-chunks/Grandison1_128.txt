to morrow  or forty years hence  But  Sir  speaking to the writer  Let not this that I have now said  be transcribed from your notes  It may to Sir Hargrave found ostentatiously  I want not  that anything should be read or shewn to him  that would appear like giving consequence to myself  except for Sir Hargrave s own sake   Mr  B   I beg  that it may not be spared  If you are capable of acting as you speak  by what I have heard of you in the affair on Hounslow Heath  and by what I have heard from you in this conversation  and see of you  I think you a wonder of a man  and should be glad it were in my power to reconcile you to each other   Sir Cha   I could not hold friendship  Mr  Bagenhall  with a man that has been capable of acting as Sir Hargrave has acted  by an innocent and helpless young Lady  But I will name the terms on which I can take by the hand  where ever I meet him  a man to whom I can have no malice  These are they  That he lay at   315 the door of mad and violent passion the illegal attempt he made on the best of women  That he express his sorrow for it  and  on his knees  if he pleases   it is no disgrace for the bravest man to kneel to an injured lady  beg her pardon  and confess her clemency to be greater than he deserves  if she give it   Mr  B   Good God  Shall that be transcribed  Sir Charles   Sir  Ch   By all means  And if Sir Hargrave is a man that has in his heart the least spark of magnanimity  he will gladly embrace the opportunity of acting accordingly  And put down  Sir  That sorrow  that cont rition  is all the atonement that can be made for a perpetrated evil   A faithful Narrative   Henry Cotes   February 27   DOES not your heart glow  my Lucy  now you have read  as I suppose you have  this paper  And do not the countenances of every one of my revered friends round you  Pray look   shine with admiration of this excellent man  And yet you all loved him before  And so you all think I did  Well  I can t help your thoughts —But I hope I shall not be undone by a good man   You will imagine  that my heart was a little agitated  when I came to read Mr  Bagenhall s question  Whether Sir Charles intended to make court to me himself  I am sorry to tell you  Lucy  that I was a little more affected than I wished to be  Indeed  I shall keep a look out  as you call it  upon myself  To say truth  I laid down the paper at that place  and was afraid to read the answer made to it  When I took it up  and read what followed  I might have spared  I saw  my foolish little tremors  See how frank I continue to be  But if you come not to this paragraph   316 before you are aware  you need not read it to my uncle   Mr  Bagenhall went away so much pleased with Sir Charles  as he owned  that Mr  Reeves encourages me to hope  some way may be found to prevent further mischief  Yet the condition  which Sir Charles has proposed for my forgiving the wretch—Upon my word  my dear  I desire not to see Sir Hargrave either upon his knees  or upon his feet  I am sure I could not see him without very violent emotions  His barbarity  his malice  his cruelty  have impressed me strongly  Nor can I be glad to see the wretch with his disfigured mouth and lip  His lip  it seems  has been sewed up  and he wears a great black silk patch  or plaister  upon the place   I can t find that Sir Charles has heard from the exasperated man  since Mr  Bagenhall left him yesterday   I hope nothing will happen to over cloud to morrow  I propose to myself as happy a day  as  in the present situation of things  can be given to  Your HARRIET BYRON   END of VOL  I
