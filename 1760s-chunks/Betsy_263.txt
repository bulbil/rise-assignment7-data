that there needed no   apologies  that every thing was mighty well  and such like words of   course  so no more was said upon this subject       But the pride of Mr  Munden filled him with so much inward rage and   spite  that he was scarce able to contain himself till his friend had   taken leave  and he no sooner was at liberty to say what he thought   proper  without incurring the censure of being unmannerly or unkind    than he began to reproach her in the most unjust and cruel terms  for   having  as he said  exposed him to the contempt and ridicule of a person   who had hitherto held him in the highest esteem       She made no other reply than that she was no less confounded than   himself at what had happened  that it was not in her power to prevent   it  that she could wish to be always prepared for the reception of any   friend  and that she was certain  when he reflected on the cause  he   would be far from laying any blame on her       In speaking these words  she ran to her cabinet  and  as Lady Trusty had   directed  produced an account to what uses every single shilling she had   received from him had been converted since the last dispute they had   with each other on this score       In presenting these papers to him   Read these bills   said she   and be   convinced how little I deserve such treatment from you  you will find   that there are no items inserted of coffee  tea  or chocolate    articles   continued she  with an air a little disdainfully   which you   seemed to grumble at  though yourself and friends had the same share in    as well as me and mine         Rot your accounts   cried he  tearing the papers she had given him into   a thousand pieces   have you the folly to imagine I will be troubled   with such stuff  It is sufficient I know upon the whole what ought to be   done  and must plainly tell you  once for all  that you should rather   think of retrenching your expences  than flatter yourself with expecting   an increase of my allowance to you         My expences  my expences   reiterated she with vehemence   what does   the man mean     My meaning   answered he  sullenly   would need no   explanation  if you had either any love for me  or prudence enough to   direct you to do what would entitle you to mine  but since you are so   ignorant  I must tell you  that I think my family too much encumbered    you have two maids  I do not desire you to lessen the number  but they   are certainly enough to wait upon you in the morning  I have a man  for   whom I never have any employment after that time  and he may wait at   table  and attend you the whole afternoon  I see therefore no occasion   you have to keep a fellow merely to loiter about the house  eat  drink    and run before your chair when you make your visits  I insist    therefore  that you either discharge him  or consent to give him his   livery and wages  and also to allow for his board out of your own annual   revenue of pin money        What usage was this for a young lady  scarce yet three months married    endued with every qualification to create love and esteem  accustomed to   receive nothing but testimonies of admiration from as many as beheld   her  and addressed with the extremest homage and tenderness by the very   man who now seemed to take pride in the power he had obtained of   thwarting her humour  and dejecting that spirit and vivacity he had so   lately pretended to adore       How utterly impossible was it for her now to observe the rules laid down   to her by Lady Trusty  Could she  after this  submit to put in practice   any softening arts she had been advised  to win her lordly tyrant into   temper  Could she  I say  have done this  without being guilty of a   meanness  which all wives must have condemned her for       But though the answers she gave to the proposal made her by this   ungenerous husband  were such as convinced him she would never be   prevailed upon to recede from any part of what was her due by contract    and though she testified her resentment  on his attempting such a   thing  in terms haughty enough  yet did she confine herself within the   limits
