his genius—he recounts his adventures   WHILE we eat our breakfast together  I acquainted him with the character and condition of the poet  who came in with his play at that instant  and imagining we were engaged about business  could not be prevailed upon to sit  but leaving his performance  went away —My friend s tender heart was melted at the sight of a gentleman and Christian  for he had a great veneration for both these epithits  in such misery  and assented with great chearfulness to a proposal I made of cloathing him with our superfluities  a task with which he charged himself  and departed immediately to perform it   He was no sooner gone  than I locked my door and sat down to the tragedy  which I read to the end with vast pleasure  not a little amazed at the conduct of the managers who had rejected it —The fable  in my opinion was well chosen  and naturally conducted  the incidents interesting  the characters beautifully contrasted  strongly marked  and well supported  the diction poetical  spirited and correct  the unities of the drama maintained with the most scrupulous exactness  the opening gradual and engaging  the 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 surprizing  and the catastrophe affecting  In   275 short  I judged it by the laws of Aristotle and Horace  and could find nothing in it exceptionable  but a little too much embellishment in some few places  which objection he removed to my satisfaction  by a quotation from Aristotle s poetics  importing  that the least interesting parts of a poem ought to be raised and dignified by the charms and energy of diction   I revered his genius  and was seized with an eager curiosity to know the particular events of a fortune so unworthy of his merit —At that instant Strap returned with a bundle of cloaths  which I sent with my compliments to Mr  Melopoyn  as a small token of my regard  and desired the favour of his company to dinner —He accepted my present and invitation  and in less than half an hour made his appearance in a decent dress  which altered his figure very much to his advantage —I perceived by his countenance  that his heart was big with gratitude  and endeavoured to prevent his acknowledgments  by asking pardon for the liberty I had taken  he made no reply  but with an aspect full of admiration and esteem  bowed to the ground  while the tears gushed from his eyes —Affected with these symptoms of an ingenuous mind  I shifted the conversation from this subject  and complimented him on his performance  which I assured him  afforded me infinite pleasure —My approbation made him happy  dinner being served  and Jackson arrived  I begged their permission for Strap to sit at table with us  after having informed them  that he was a person to whom I was extremely obliged  they were kind enough to grant that savour  and we eat together with great harmony and satisfaction     276 Our meal being ended  I expressed my wonder at the little regard Mr  Melopoyn had met with from the world  and signified a desire of hearing how he had been treated by the managers of the play houses  to whom  I understood from Jackson  he had offered his tragedy  without success —   There is so little entertaining in the incidents of my life  said he  that I am sure the recital will not recompence your attention  but since you discover an inclination to know them  I understand my duty too well to disappoint your desire     MY father  who was a curate in the country  being by the narrowness of his circumstances  hindred from maintaining me at the university  took the charge of my education upon himself  and laboured with such industry and concern in the undertaking  that I had little cause to regret the want of publick masters —Being at great pains to consult my natural byass  he discovered in me betimes  an inclination for poetry  upon which he recommended to me an intimate acquaintance with the classicks  in the cultivation of which  he assisted me with paternal zeal and uncommon erudition —When he thought me sufficiently acquainted with the ancients  he directed my studies to the best modern authors  French and Italian as well as English  and laid a particular injunction upon me  to make myself master of my mother tongue   About the age of eighteen  I grew ambitious of undertaking a work of some consequence  and with my father s approbation  actually planned the tragedy you have read  but before I had finished four acts  that indulgent parent died    277 and left my mother and me in very indigent circumstances —A near relation compassionating our distress  took us into his family  where I brought my fable to a conclusion  and soon after  my mother quitted this life —When my sorrow for this melancholy event had subsided  I told my kinsman  who was a farmer  that having paid my last duty to my parent  I had now no attachment to detain me in the country  and therefore was resolved to set out for London  and offer my play to the stage  where I did not doubt of acquiring a large share of fame as well as fortune  in which case I should not
