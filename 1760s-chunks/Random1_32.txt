invited Weazel to sleep the remaining part of the night with him  I retired to mine  where I found Strap mortally afraid  he having got away in the dark  while the captain and his lady were at logger heads       83  CHAP  XII   Captain Weazel challenges Strap  who declines the combat—an affair between the captain and me—the usurer is fain to give miss Jenny five guineas for a release—we are in danger of losing a meal—the behaviour of Weazel  Jenny  and Joey on that occasion—an account of captain Weazel and his lady—the captain s courage tried—Isaac s mirth at the captain s expence   NEXT morning  I agreed to give the master of the waggon ten shillings for my passage to London  provided Strap should be allowed to take my place when I should be disposed to walk —At the same time I desired him to appease the incensed captain  who by this time had got into the kitchen  with a drawn sword in his hand  and threatned with many oaths  to sacrifice the villain  who attempted to violate his bed  but it was to no purpose for the master to explain the mistake  and assure him of the poor lad s innocence  who stood trembling behind me all the while  the more submission that appeared in Strap  the more implacable seemed the resentment of Weazel  who swore he must either fight him  or he would instantly put him to death —I was extremely provoked at this insolence  and told him  it could not be supposed that a poor barber lad would engage a man of the sword at his own   84 weapon  but I was persuaded he would wrestle or box with him —To which proposal Strap immediately gave assent  by saying  he would box with him for a guinea —Weazel replied with a look of disdain  it was beneath any gentleman of his character to fight like a porter  or even to put himself on a footing  in any respect  with such a fellow as Strap —   Ods bodikins   cries Joey  sure coptain  yaw wauld not coommit moorder  Here s a poor lad that is willing to make attoonement for his offence  and an that woant t satisfie yaw  offers to fight yaw fairly —An yaw woan t box  I dare say  he will coodgel with yaw —Woan t yaw  my lad  —  Strap  after some hesitation  answered    Ye—yes  I ll cudgel with him  —  But this expedient being also rejected by the captain  I began to smell his character  and tipping Strap the wink  told the company  that I had always heard it said  the person who receives a challenge should have the choice of the weapons  this therefore being the rule in point of honour  I would venture to promise on the head of my companion  that he would even fight captain Weazel at sharps  but it should be with such sharps as Strap was best acquainted with  namely razors—At my mentioning razors  I could perceive the captain s colour to change  while Strap pulling me by the sleeve  whispered with great eagerness —   No  no  no  for the love of God  don t make any such bargain  —  At length  Weazel recovered himself  turned towards me  and with a ferocious countenance  asked    Who the devil are you —will you fight me    With these words  putting himself in a posture  I was grievously alarmed at   85 seeing the point of a sword within half a foot of my breast  and springing to one side  snatched up a spit that stood in the chimney corner  with which I kept my formidable adversary at bay  who made a great many half longes  skipping backward every time  till at last I got him pinned up in a corner  to the no small diversion of the company  While he was in this situation  his wife entered  and seeing her husband in these dangerous circumstances  uttered a dreadful scream  and swooned  Upon this  Weazel demanded a cessation  which was immediately granted  and after his lady had recovered  was contented with the submission of Strap  who falling on his knees before him  protested the innocence of his intention  and asked pardon for the mistake he had committed  This affair being ended without bloodshed  we went to breakfast  but missed two of our company  to wit  miss Jenny and the usurer  As for the first  Mrs  Weazel informed us  that she had kept her awake all night with her groans  and that when she got up this morning  miss Jenny was so much indisposed  that she could not proceed on her journey —At this moment  a message came from her to the master of the waggon  who immediately went into her chamber  followed by us all —She told him in a lamentable tone  that she was afraid of a miscarriage owing to the fright she received last night  from the brutality of Isaac  and as the event was uncertain  desired the usurer might be detained to answer for the consequence—Accordingly this ancient Tarquin was found in the waggon  whither he had retired to avoid the shame of last night s disgrace  and brought by force into
