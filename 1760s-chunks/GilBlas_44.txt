as I was dressing    I am still in luck that the knaves have not carried off my clothes and what little money I had in my pocket  I gave them some credit for being so considerate  They had even been generous enough to leave me my boots  which I parted with to the landlord for a third of their cost  At last I sallied out of the ready furnished lodging  unencumbered  heaven be praised  with baggage or attendance  The first thing I did was to go and see if my mules were still at the inn where we alighted the evening before  It was not to be supposed that Ambrose would have neglected a due attention to them  and it would have been well for me if I had always taken such exact measure of his character  I learned that he had not waited for the morning  but had been careful to fetch them by over night  Under the circumstances  satisfied I should never see them again  any more than my portmanteau  I walked sulkily along the streets  musing on the future plans I should adopt  I was tempted to go back to Burgos  and once more have recourse to Donna Mencia  but  regarding this as an abuse of that lady s goodness  and being aware  moreover  what a fool I should look like  I thought it best to forego that idea  I made a vow too for the future to be on my guard against women  I could have sent the chaste Susanna to the house of correction  From time to time my ring caught my eye  it was a present from Camilla  and I was ready to burst with anguish  Alas  thought I  I am no judge of jewellery  but I shall be  by experience of these hucksters who exchange without a robbery  I need not go to a jeweller to be told I am an ass  I can see my own face in my ruby   Yet I did not neglect to know the truth respecting the value of my ring  and showed it to a lapidary  who rated it at three ducats  At such an estimate  though as much as I expected  I made a formal surrender to the devil  of the Philippine isles  the governor and his niece  or rather  I only restored his own subjects to their lawful sovereign  As I was going out of the lapidary s shop a young fellow brushed by me  and on looking round  made a full stop  I could not recollect his name at first  though his features were perfectly familiar to me  How now  Gil Blas  said he  are you ashamed of an old acquaintance  or have two years so altered the son of Nunez the barber  that you do not know him  Do not you recollect Fabricio  your townsman and schoolfellow  How often have we kept  before Doctor Godinez  upon universals and metaphysics   These words did not flow so fast as my recollection  and we embraced with mutual good will  Well  my friend  resumed he  I am overjoyed to meet with you  Words fall short    But how is this  Why  you look like    as heaven is my judge  you are dressed like a grandee  A gentleman s sword  silk stockings  a velvet doublet and cloak  embroidered with silver  Plague take it  this is getting on in the world with a vengeance  I will lay a wager you are in with some old monied harridan  You reckon without your host  said I  my affairs are not so prosperous as you imagine  That will not do for me  replied he  I know better things  but you have a mind to be close  And that fine ruby on your finger  master Gil Blas  whence comes that  if I may be so bold  It comes  quoth I  from an infernal jade  Fabricio  my dear Fabricio  far from being point  quint  and quatorze with the ladies of Valladolid  you are to know  my friend  that I am their complete bubble   I uttered these last words so ruefully  that Fabricio saw plainly that some trick had been played upon me  He was anxious to learn why I was out of humour with the lovely sex  I had no difficulty in satisfying his curiosity  but as the story was a long one  and besides we had no mind to part in a hurry  we went into a coffee  house to be a little more at ease  There I recounted to him  during breakfast  all that had happened to me since my departure from Oviedo  My adventures he thought whimsical enough  and testifying his sympathy in my present uneasy circumstances  added    We must make the best  my good lad  of all our misfortunes in this life  Is a man of parts in distress  he waits patiently for better luck  Such an one  as Cicero truly observes  never suffers himself to be humbled so low  as to forget that he is a man  For my own part  that is just my character  in or out of favour there is no sinking me  I always float on the surface of ill luck  For
