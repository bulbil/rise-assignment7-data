which was become the common joke of the  town  being circulated through the industry of the physicians  who  triumphed in his disaster  Peregrine  by means of Mr  Pipes  employed a  country fellow  who had come to market  to run with great haste  early  one morning  to the lodgings of all the doctors in town  and desire them  to attend the colonel with all imaginable despatch  In consequence of  this summons  the whole faculty put themselves in motion  and three  of the foremost arriving at the same instant of time  far from  complimenting one another with the door  each separately essayed to  enter  and the whole triumvirate stuck in the passage  While they  remained thus wedged together  they descried two of their brethren  posting towards the same goal  with all the speed that God had enabled  them to exert  upon which they came to a parley  and agreed to stand  by one another  This covenant being made  they disentangled themselves   and  inquiring about the patient  were told by the servant that he had  just fallen asleep   Having received this intelligence  they took possession of his  ante chamber  and shut the door  while the rest of the tribe posted  themselves on the outside as they arrived  so that the whole passage was  filled  from the top of the staircase to the street door  and the people  of the house  together with the colonel s servant  struck dumb with  astonishment  The three leaders of this learned gang had no sooner made  their lodgment good  than they began to consult about the patient s  malady  which every one of them pretended to have considered with great  care and assiduity  The first who gave his opinion  said  the distemper  was an obstinate arthritis  the second affirmed  that it was no other  than a confirmed pox  and the third swore  it was an inveterate scurvy   This diversity of opinions was supported by a variety of quotations  from medical authors  ancient as well as modern  but these were not of  sufficient authority  or  at least  not explicit enough to decide the  dispute  for there are many schisms in medicine  as well as in religion   and each sect can quote the fathers in support of the tenets they  profess  In short  the contention rose to such a pitch of clamour  as  not only alarmed the brethren on the stair  but also awaked the patient  from the first nap he had enjoyed in the space of ten whole days  Had  it been simply waking  he would have been obliged to them for the noise  that disturbed him  for  in that case  he would have been relieved from  the tortures of hell fire  to which  in his dreams  he fancied himself  exposed  But this dreadful vision had been the result of that impression  which was made upon his brain by the intolerable anguish of his joints   so that  when he awaked  the pain  instead of being allayed  was    6 22 15  3 45 PM   rather aggravated by a great acuteness of sensation  and the confused  vociferation in the next room invading his ears at the same time  he  began to think his dream was realised  and  in the pangs of despair   applied himself to a bell that stood by his bedside  which he rung with  great violence and perseverance   This alarm put an immediate stop to the disputation of the three  doctors  who  upon this notice of his being awake  rushed into his  chamber  without ceremony  and two of them seizing his arms  the third  made the like application to one of his temples  Before the patient  could recollect himself from the amazement which had laid hold on him  at this unexpected irruption  the room was filled by the rest of the  faculty  who followed the servant that entered in obedience to his  master s call  and the bed was in a moment surrounded by these gaunt  ministers of death  The colonel seeing himself beset with such an  assemblage of solemn visages and figures  which he had always considered  with the utmost detestation and abhorrence  was incensed to a most  inexpressible degree of indignation  and so inspirited by his rage  that  though his tongue denied its office  his other limbs performed their  functions  He disengaged himself from the triumvirate  who had taken  possession of his body  sprung out of bed with incredible agility  and   seizing one of his crutches  applied it so effectually to one of the  three  just as he stooped to examine the patient s water  that his  tie periwig dropped into the pot  while he himself fell motionless on  the floor   This significant explanation disconcerted the whole fraternity  every  man turned his face  as if it were by instinct  towards the door   and the retreat of the community being obstructed by the efforts of  individuals  confusion and tumultuous uproar ensued  For the colonel   far from limiting his prowess to the
