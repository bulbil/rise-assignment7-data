of Fancy  but not at all necessary upon moral or philosophical Subjects  For Example  If Mr  West speaks Sense or Reason  what Occasion is there to inform us  that Cicero thought the same Way  or said the same Thing  It is Argument  not Authority  which convinces  All Knowledge Page  21 is derived originally from the human Understanding  and a Thought is nevertheless our own  because it has been hit on by somebody else before  And one may as well quote Adam for breathing  because he was the first Creature who did so  as Euclid for saying that the three Angles of every Triangle are equal to two right ones  because  he was the first Person who demonstrated that Proposition   A quoting Author is just as ridiculous as a Country Girl  who  upon her first coming to Town  being decked out by the Help of her Friends  should make public Acknowledgment from whom she had her Stockings  her Shift  her Stays   c  So that  if every Person was there to claim their own  she would be left as naked as the Jay in the Fable  or as such a pyebald Author  say Writer rather  say Complier  say Publisher  say second hand Cook  who gives you a Beggar s Dish out of Fragments  or say Printer s Sign Post  upon which are pasted the heterogeneous Scraps of many Authors   I remember a stupid Sort of Fellow  who used to put me in mind of these Men  who are too modest to say any Thing of their own  for he never asked for Bread  Drink  told you what o Clock it was  or mentioned even the most trifling Occurrence  without adding    as the Man said   And whenever he had a mind  like these Men  to shew the Extent of his Page  22 Learning  by recurring up to the most antient Authority  he would cry   as the Man said a great while ago     The Importance of the Subject  which Mr  West treats on  is great  and ought to be the frequent Reflection of every Man of Sense  Morality  or Religion  He has considered it with Regard to the two last  and placed the Matter in several very strong Lights  But  as a Thing of this Consequence cannot stand in too many Points of View  I shall attempt to consider it with Relation to the first  merely as a rational Man  without any Regard to Virtue  relative only to our present State  and  in that Respect  confined intirely to ourselves  Which few Hints you may stile  Of the Oeconomy of Time—Of the simple Enlargement of it—Or  a certain Method to lengthen Life  in Spight of Fate  or of the Grave   There is an Expression often made use of by thoughtless People  which astonishes and provokes me extremely    Let us do so and so  to kill Time   It is some Revenge  however  to observe  what Suicides they are  at the same Time of this most horrid and unnatural Murder  So true it is  that We and our Time must live and die together  We generally lament the Shortness of Man s Life taken together  while we are blaming the Tediousness of every Portion of it  This Contradiction may be accounted Page  23 for  if we consider  that as Time  unemployed  lags heavily along  an idle Person  for this Reason  must complain of tiresome Days  and as Duration is marked only by the Succession of Ideas  his Life must appear shortest  who has fewest Actions or Passages to recollect     To consider Man  then  only with Regard to this Life  What a miserable Wretch must he be  whose passing Minutes are told as so many Hours  and whose past Years are reflected upon but as so many Days   Let us then  as rational Creatures  contrive so to employ ourselves in a Series of Actions  which  by marking every Period of our Lives  we may enjoy this great and happy Advantage  that the present Moments shall glide imperceptibly away  and our past Age appear so long  upon summing up  that we may not murmur at the short Span  of threescore Years and ten    O Vita Stulto longa  Sapienti brevis   Again   tis computed  that the generality of Men sleep away about one Third of their Time  that is  about eight Hours in the twenty four  Now five Hours is full sufficient for any Person  who would preserve Health of Body  and Vigour of Mind  So that there may be above three Hours saved out of every Day  which is about one Day in the Week  and that is one Year in seven  Then  by the Time a Man has reached Page  24 his grand Climacteric  he may be said to have lived just nine Years more than some of his twin Cotemporaries   What would a Man give for nine Years added to sixty three  How much more valuable are nine Years before sixty three  for surely that Time is the most preferable  which we can live without growing older  We cannot  indeed  borrow Time from Death  but
