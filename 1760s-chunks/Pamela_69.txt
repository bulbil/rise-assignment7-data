obliging honest hearted man as John          I am now come to SUNDAY       Well  here is a sad thing  I am denied by this barbarous woman to go   to church  as I had built upon I might  and she has huffed poor Mr    Williams all to pieces  for pleading for me  I find he is to be forbid   the house  if she pleases  Poor gentleman  all his dependance is upon my   master  who has a very good living for him  if the incumbent die  and he   has kept his bed these four months  of old age and dropsy       He pays me great respect  and I see pities me  and would  perhaps    assist my escape from these dangers  But I have nobody to plead for me    and why should I wish to ruin a poor gentleman  by engaging him against   his interest  Yet one would do any thing to preserve one s innocence    and Providence would  perhaps  make it up to him       O judge  but how shall you see what I write   of my distracted   condition  to be reduced to such a pass as to a desire to lay traps for   mankind  But he wants sadly to say something to me  as he whisperingly   hinted       The wretch  I think I will always call her the wretch henceforth  abuses   me more and more  I was but talking to one of the maids just now    indeed a little to tamper with her by degrees  and she popt upon us    and said  Nay  madam  don t offer to tempt poor innocent country maidens   from doing their duty  You wanted  I hear  she should take a walk with   you  But I charge you  Nan  never stir with her  nor obey her  without   letting me know it  in the smallest trifles   I say  walk with you  and   where would you go  I tro   Why  barbarous Mrs  Jewkes  said I  only to   look a little up the elm walk  since you would not let me go to church       Nan  said she  to shew me how much they were all in her power  pull   off madam s shoes  and bring them to me  I have taken care of her   others   Indeed she shan t  said I   Nay  said Nan  but I must if my   mistress bids me  so pray  madam  don t hinder me  And so indeed  would   you believe it   she took my shoes off  and left me barefoot  and  for   my share  I have been so frighted at this  that I have not power even   to relieve my mind by my tears  I am quite stupefied to be sure   Here I   was forced to leave off       Now I will give you a picture of this wretch  She is a broad  squat    pursy  fat thing  quite ugly  if any thing human can be so called  about   forty years old  She has a huge hand  and an arm as thick as my waist  I   believe  Her nose is flat and crooked  and her brows grow down over her   eyes  a dead spiteful  grey  goggling eye  to be sure she has  And her   face is flat and broad  and as to colour  looks like as if it had been   pickled a month in saltpetre  I dare say she drinks   She has a hoarse    man like voice  and is as thick as she is long  and yet looks so deadly   strong  that I am afraid she would dash me at her foot in an instant    if I was to vex her   So that with a heart more ugly than her face  she   frightens me sadly  and I am undone to be sure  if God does not protect   me  for she is very  very wicked  indeed she is       This is poor helpless spite in me   But the picture is too near the   truth notwithstanding  She sends me a message just now  that I shall   have my shoes again  if I will accept of her company to walk with me in   the garden   To waddle with me  rather  thought I       Well   tis not my business to quarrel with her downright  I shall   be watched the narrower  if I do  and so I will go with the hated   wretch   O for my dear Mrs  Jervis  or  rather  to be safe with my dear   father and mother
