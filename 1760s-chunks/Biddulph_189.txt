embarrassment of my brother and Lady Sarah  the old gentleman enjoyed it  and looked at them both  but as if he knew neither  My brother had recourse to the bottle  he drank my health  and civilly enough bowed to Mr Warner  just pronouncing the word Sir —the other scarce returned it by a slight inclination of his head   At last  addressing himself to me  cousin  if you have no aversion to tobacco  I should be glad if you would indulge me with a pipe  ’tis my custom after dinner  but I have not smoaked yet   As I had never observed him to do this  when he had dined with me before  I took it for granted the compliment was meant for Lady Sarah   I said I had no objection  and referred myself by a bow to Lady Sarah   She made no reply  and my kinsman  without seeming to mind    any one else  rang the bell  saying  if you don’t dislike it  there is no more to be said  The black  whom he had given me  presenting himself at the door  Mr Warner desired him to step to his lodgings for his pipe and some tobacco  The man quickly returned with a long japaned reed  with a boll fixed at the end of it  Mr Warner called for a lighted taper  and throwing himself back in his chair with one leg crossed over the other  lighted his pipe with much composure  puffing large clouds of smoak a cross Lady Sarah’s nose  who sat at his right hand  My sister  who had really an unaffected aversion to tobacco  could not bear this  she coughed excessively  and  with tears in her eyes  rose off her chair  and retired to the other end of the room  My old gentleman laughed till he weezed  nodding his head after her  and looking at me  as much as to say  I am glad I have sent her off   Sir George  though determined not to be put out of humour  thought this was going too far  I was really uneasy myself  and hardly knew how to act  for if I shewed any mark of distinction to Lady Sarah  I knew it would be construed by Mr Warner as an affront to him  I ventured  however  to tell her that if she would step into the drawing room  I should order coffee  and wait on her immediately   Ay  said my brother  approaching his lady  and taking her by the hand  let us get out of this horrid atmosphere that this honest gentleman has raised about us  The honest gentleman vouchsafed not to look at him  and my brother and sister withdrew into the adjoining room   As soon as they were gone  Mr Warner threw down his pipe  and striking the table with his clenched fist  burst into a loud laugh  Lord  Lord  said he  pride will have a fall  I think I have brought them down a little  how like asses they both looked  Well  now I am satisfied—I have had my revenge  you may go and drink your coffee with them  I’ll bid you good by   He immediately withdrew  and I joined my brother and sister  who were heartily rejoiced that they had got rid of him   Sir George said  he saw his design  but was resolved not to give an opportunity for insults  and so held his tongue  As he is your friend  Sidney  said he  I would not distress you by engaging you as a party on either side  which must have been the case  for that old fellow would not have suffered you to remain neutral   I told him our kinsman was whimsical  but that as he was now thoroughly satisfied at having paid them in kind  I was sure he would    never again seek to give them any offence  and they ought to forgive him by the law of retaliation   They laughed at the singularity of his manner  and the whole passed off in mirth  though Lady Sarah declared he had made her quite sick with his nauseous tobacco   March 3  The ridiculous scene  my Cecilia  for a while called off my thoughts from the melancholy subject which is now nearest my heart  I mean the shocking account which Sir George gave me of Mrs—  can I bear to call her—Faulkland  but it now recurs to me with all its horrors  Oh  my dear  what a fatal wretch have I been to Mr Faulkland  my best purposes  by some unseen power  are perverted from their ends  I wonder the food which I take to nourish me is not converted into poison when I touch it  But I will calm my troubled mind with this reflexion  that I meant not to do evil  Mr Faulkland  ignorant of his own misfortune  may  as hundreds of others in the same situation are  still be happy  if that light creature has but a single grain of honour or gratitude  I will not think of it—anticipating as you used to call me  I will banish the hateful idea from my mind   March 12  What do you think  my Cecilia
