with thirty stripes  the pain of which co operating with my disappointment and disgrace  bereft me of my senses and threw me into an extasy of madness  wherein I tore the flesh from my bones with my teeth  and dashed my head against the pavement —So that they were obliged to set a watch over me  to restrain me from doing further mischief to myself and others —This fit of phrenzy continued three days  at the end of which I grew calm and sullen  but as the desire of making away with myself still remained  I came to a determination of starving myself to death  and with that view refused all sustenance    209 Whether it was owing to the want of opposition  or to the weakness of nature  I know not  but on the second day of my fast  I found my resolution considerably impaired  and the calls of hunger almost insupportable —At this critical conjuncture a lady was brought into the prison  with whom I had contracted an acquaintance while I lived with Horatio  she was then on the same footing as I was  but afterwards quarreling with her gallant  and not finding another to her mind  altered her scheme of life  and set up a coffee house among the hundreds of Drury  where she entertained gentlemen with claret  arrack and the choice of half a dozen damsels  who lived in her house  This serviceable matron  having neglected to gratify a certain j—ce for the connivance she enjoyed  was indicted at the quarter sessions  in consequence of which her bevy was dispersed and herself committed to Bridewell —She had not been long there  before she learned my disaster  and coming up to me  after a compliment of condolance  enquired into the particulars of my fate  While we were engaged in discourse together  the master coming up  told me that the fellow on whose account I had suffered was taken  that he had confessed the theft  and cleared me of any concern in the affair  for which reason he  the master  had orders to discharge me  and that I was from that moment free  This piece of news soon banished all thoughts of death  and had such an instantaneous effect on my countenance  that Mrs  Coupler  the lady then present  hoping to find her account in me  very generously offered to furnish me with what necessaries I wanted  and take me into her own house  as soon as she could   210 compromise matters with the j—ces —The conditions of her offer  were  that I should pay three guineas weekly for my board  and a reasonable consideration besides for the use of such cloaths and ornaments as she should supply me with  to be deducted from the first profits of my embraces —These were hard terms  but not be rejected by one who was turned out helpless and naked into the wide world  without a friend to pity or assist her —I therefore embraced her proposal  and she being bailed in a few hours  took me home with her in a coach  As I was by this time conscious of having formerly disgusted my admirers by my reserved and haughty behaviour  I now endeavoured to conquer that disposition  and the sudden change of my fortune giving me a flow of spirits  I appeared in the most winning and gay manner I could assume  Having the advantage of a good voice and education over most of my rivals  I exerted my talents to the uttermost  and soon became the favourite with all company —This success alarmed the pride and jealousy of Mrs  Coupler  who could not bear the thoughts of being eclipsed  She therefore made a merit of her envy  and whispered about among her customers that I was unsound —There needed no more to ruin my reputation and blast my prosperity  every body shunned me with marks of aversion and disdain  and in a very short time I was as solitary as ever  Want of gallants was attended with want of money to satisfy my malicious landlady  who having purposely given me credit to the amount of eleven pounds  took out a writ against me  and I was arrested in her own house —Though the room was crouded with people  when the bailif   211 entered  not one of them had compassion enough to attempt to molify my prosecutrix  far less to pay the debt  they even laughed at my tears  and one of them bid me be of good cheer  for I should not want admirers in Newgate  At that instant a sea lieutenant came in  and seeing my plight  began to enquire into the circumstances of my misfortune  when this wit advised him to keep clear of me  for I was a fire ship —   A fire ship   replied the sailor  more like a poor galley in distress that has been boarded by such a fire ship as you  if so be that be the case  she stands in more need of assistance —Harkee  my girl  how far have you over run the constable  —  I told him that the debt amounted to eleven pounds  besides the expence of the writ —   An that be all  said he  you shan t go to the bilboes this bout  —  And taking out his purse  paid the money  discharged the bailif  and
