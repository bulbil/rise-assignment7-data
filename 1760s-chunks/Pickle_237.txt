 desired  their principal to order them down stairs  He readily complied with my  request  and sitting down by my bedside  told me with an air of triumph   that he had found me at last  and I frankly owned  that I was heartily  sorry for his success  Instead of upbraiding me with my escape  he  proceeded to entertain me with all the news in town  and gave me a  minute detail of everything that happened to him since our parting   among other articles of intelligence  giving me to understand  that he  had challenged Mr  S    who refused to fight him  and was in disgrace  with the prince of W   on that account    But here his lordship did not strictly adhere to the naked truth  He  had indeed  before our departure from the country  gone to my lover  and  insisted upon having satisfaction in Hyde Park  two days from the date  of his demand  and at three o clock in the afternoon  S    believing  him in earnest  accepted the invitation  though he observed  that these  affairs could not be discussed too soon  and wished the time of meeting  might be an earlier hour  But his lordship did not choose to alter the  circumstances of his first proposal  and  when he went away  said he  should expect him at the appointed place and time  if it did not rain    His antagonist gave me an account of the conversation  when I assured  him the whole business would end in smoke  Accordingly  my lord sent him  a letter on Monday  desiring that the assignation might be deferred till  Thursday  that he might have time to settle his affairs  and pay S    a hundred pounds  which he had formerly borrowed of him  When Thursday  came  he was favoured with another epistle  importing that the  challenger had changed his mind  and would seek satisfaction at law     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Thus ended that heroic exploit  which his lordship now boasted of with  such arrogant misrepresentation    While he thus regaled me with these interesting particulars  I was  contriving a scheme to frustrate the discovery he had made  so that I  did not contradict his assertions  but told him  that  if he would go  down stairs  I would rise and come to breakfast  He consented to this  proposal with great cheerfulness  and I own I was not a little surprised  to find him  at this first interview  in as good a humour as if nothing  had happened to interrupt the felicity of our matrimonial union    It cost me some invention to conceal my condition from his notice   being now within a week of the expected crisis  But I knew I had to  do with a man of no great penetration  and succeeded in my attempt  accordingly  We breakfasted with great harmony  and I invited him to  dinner  after having prevailed upon him to send away his myrmidons   whom  nevertheless  he ordered to return at eleven o clock at night  We  conversed together with great gaiety and mirth  When I rallied him for  visiting me in such a dishabille  he stood on tiptoe to view himself in  the glass  and  owning I was in the right  said he would go and dress  himself before dinner  He accordingly went away  charging my maid to  give him entrance at his return  and he was no sooner gone than I wrote  to Mr  S    giving him an account of what had happened  Then  without  having determined on any certain plan  I huddled on my clothes  muffled  myself up  and calling a chair  went to the next tavern  where I  stayed no longer than was sufficient to change my vehicle  and  to the  astonishment of the drawers  who could not conceive the meaning of  my perturbation  proceeded to a shop in the neighbourhood  where I  dismissed my second chair  and procured a hackney coach  in which I  repaired to the lodgings of my lawyer  whom I could trust  Having made  him acquainted with the circumstances of my distress  and consulted him  about a proper place of retreat  after some recollection  he directed me  to a little house in a court  to which  by the assistance of my lover   my woman and clothes were safely conveyed that same evening    My lord  however  came to dinner  according to invitation  and did not  seem at all alarmed when my maid told him I was gone  but stepped to my  lawyer to know if he thought I should return  Upon his answering in the  affirmative  and advising his lordship to go back in the meantime  and  eat the dinner I had provided  he very deliberately took his advice   made a very hearty meal  drank his bottle of wine  and  as I did not  return according to his expectation  withdrew in order to consult his
