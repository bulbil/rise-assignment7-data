 yet did not rob him of his vivacity  some of the queen s   women  and the young ladies about the princess  particularly   mademoiselle Charlotta  had a thousand sprightly entertainments among   themselves  into which he  the baron de la Valiere  and some others who   had attachments at that court  were always admitted       But now the time arrived in which he was to lose the society of that   valuable friend  the campaign was ready to open  and he was obliged to   head his troops and follow the marshals de Villars and Marsin   into Flanders       All the conversation turning now on war  those martial inclinations    which love and the season of the year had occasioned to lye dormant for   a while in the bosom of Horatio  now revived in him  he embraced the   baron at taking leave of him with tears of affection and regret  how   cruel is my fate  said he  to make me of a nation at enmity with yours    and that I can neither fight for you nor against you       Well  my dear Horatio  replied the other  France may hereafter have   occasion to employ your arm where there are no ties of duty to restrain   you   in the mean time  continued he with a smile  softer engagements   may employ your thoughts   mademoiselle Charlotta de Palfoy is a   conquest worth pursuing       This was the first hint the baron had ever given him of the discovery he   had made of his sentiments  and it so much the more surprized him that   he was told by another what he was not certain of himself   he knew   indeed the society of that young lady gave him infinite satisfaction    and that he was restless when absent from her  but these words  and the   air with which they were spoke  shewed him more of his own heart than he   had before examined into   he blush d excessively  and made no answer    on which  you have no cause  resumed the baron  to be asham d of the   passion you are inspired with  nor troubled at my discovery of it   I   assure you I have seen it a long time  and tho  you never honoured me   with your confidence in that point  have taken all opportunities of   doing justice to your merit in the conversations I have had with   mademoiselle  who I had the satisfaction to find was not displeased with   what I said upon that head  and I flatter myself with having a good   account of the progress you have made at my return       I have too much experience of your friendship and goodness to me    replied Horatio  not to assure myself of your doing me all manner of   kind offices   I have indeed so great a regard for that lady you   mention  that I know none of her sex who I so much wish should think   well of me  yet is she utterly ignorant of the sentiments I have for   her  and if I am possessed of that passion which they call love  which I   protest I am not certain of myself  I have never made the least   declaration that can give her room to imagine any such thing       The baron laughed heartily to hear him speak in this manner  and then   told him there was no need of words to make known an inclination of that   kind   it was to be seen in every look and motion of the person inspired   with it   Mademoiselle de Palfoy  continued he  young as she is  I dare   answer has penetration enough to see the conquest she has made  but has   not yet learned artifice enough to conceal that she is at the same time   subdued herself   and if you would take the advice of a person who has   some experience in these affairs  you will endeavour to engage her to a   confession before too much observation on the behaviour of others to   their lovers  shall teach her those imperious airs by which women   frequently torment the heart that adores them  tho  their own perhaps in   doing so feels an equal share       Horatio  who had seen something like this between the baron and his   mistress  found a great deal of reason in what he said  and promised to   be guided by him  especially as he had encouragement enough to hope  by   all the treatment he had found from Charlotta  that a declaration of   love from him would not offend her beyond forgiveness       From that time forward he therefore began to think in what manner he   should first disclose the tender secret to the dear object of his   affections  when absent from her
