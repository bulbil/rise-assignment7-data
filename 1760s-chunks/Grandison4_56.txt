will despise the wise man s folly more than the silly man s  and with reason  because being uncharacteristic  it must sit more aukwardly upon him than the others can do   Yet wisdom itself  and the truest wisdom  goodness  said Mrs  Reeves  is sometimes thought to sit ungracefully  when it is uncharacteristic  not to the man  but to the times  She then named a person who was branded as an hypocrite  for performing all his duties publicly   He will be worse spoken of  if he declines doing so  said Dr  Bartlett  His enemies will add the charge of cowardice  and not acquit him of the other   Lady Gertrude being withdrawn  it was mentioned as a wonder  that so agreeable a woman  as she must have been in her youth  and still was for her years  should remain single  Lord G  said  that she   140 had had many offers  And once  before she was twenty  had like to have stolen a wedding  but her fears  he said  since that  had kept her single   The longer  said Sir Charles  a woman remains unmarried  the more apprehensive she will be of entering into the state  At seventeen or eighteen a girl will plunge into it  sometimes without either fear or wit  at twenty she will begin to think  at twenty four will weigh and discriminate  at twenty eight will be afraid of venturing  at thirty will turn about  and look down the hill she has ascended  and  as occasions offer  and instances are given  will sometimes repent  sometimes rejoice  that she has gained that summit sola   Indeed  said Mrs  Reeves  I believe in England many a poor girl goes up the hill with a companion she would little care for  if the state of a single woman were not here so peculiarly unprovided and helpless  For girls of slender fortunes  if they have been genteelly brought up  how can they  when familyconnexions are dissolved  support themselves  A man can rise in a profession  and if he acquires wealth in a trade  can get above it  and be respected  A woman is looked upon as demeaning herself  if she gains a maintenance by her needle  or by domestic attendance on a superior  and without them where has she a retreat   You speak  good Mrs  Reeves  said Sir Charles  as if you would join with Dr  Bartlett and me in wishing the establishment of a scheme we have often talked over  tho  the name of it would make many a Lady start  We want to see estabilished in every county  Protestant Nunneries  in which single women of small or no fortunes might live with all manner of freedom  under such regulations as it would be a disgrace for a modest or good woman not to comply with  were she absolutely on her own hands  and to be allowed to quit it whenever they pleased     141 Well  brother  said Lady G  and why could you not have got all this settled a fortnight ago  you that can carry every point  and have made poor me a Lady Abbess   You are still better provided for  my sister  But let the Doctor and me proceed with our scheme  The governesses or matrons of the society I would have to be women of family  of unblameable characters from infancy  and noted equally for their prudence  good nature  and gentleness of manners  The attendants  for the slighter services  should be the hopeful female children of the honest industrious poor   Do you not  Ladies  imagine  said Dr  Bartlett  that such a society as this  all women of unblemish d reputation  employing themselves as each  consulting her own genius  at her admission  shall undertake to employ herself  and supported genteelly  some at more  some at less expence to the foundation  according to their circumstances  might become a national good  and particularly a seminary for good wives  and the institution a stand for virtue  in an age given up to luxury  extravagance  and amusements little less than riotous   How could it be supported  said Lord W   Many of the persons  of which each community would consist  would be  I imagine  replied Sir Charles  no expence to it at all  as numbers of young women  joining their small fortunes  might be able  in such a society  to maintain themselves genteelly on their own income  tho  each  singly in the world  would be distressed  Besides  liberty might be given for wives  in the absence of their husbands  in this maritime country  and for widows  who  on the deaths of theirs  might wish to retire from the noise and hurry of the world  for three  six  or twelve months  more or less  to reside in this well regulated society  And such persons  we may suppose  would be glad  according to their respective abilities  to be benesactresses to it    142 No doubt but it would have besides the countenance of the well disposed of both sexes  since every family in Britain  in
