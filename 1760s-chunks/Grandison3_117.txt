and you will then a little lighten the heart of your  JERONYMO   I sent my grateful compliments to the Marchioness by Camilla  I besought her to believe  that my conduct on this occasion should be such as should merit her approbation  I expressed my grief for the apprehended resentments  I was sure that a man so noble  so generous  so brave  as was the man from whom the resentments might be supposed to arise  would better consider of every thing  But it was impossible for me  I bid Camilla say  to be far distant from Bologna  because I still presumed to hope for a happy turn in my favour   I wrote to Signor Jeronymo to the same effect  I assured him of my high regard for his gallant brother  I deplored the occasion which had subjected me to the General s displeasure  bid him depend upon my moderation  I referred to my known resolution of long standing  to avoid a meditated rencounter with any man  urging  that he might  for that reason  the more securely rely upon my care to shun any acts of offence either to or from a son of the Marquis della Porretta  a brother of my dear friend Jeronymo  and of the most excellent and beloved of sisters   Neither the Marchioness nor Jeronymo were satisfied with the answers I returned  But what could I do  I had promised the General that I would not leave Bologna till I had apprized him of my intention to do so  and I still was willing  as I bid Camilla tell the Marchioness  to indulge my hopes of some happy turn   The Marquis  the Bishop  and General  went to Urbino  and there  as I learnt from my Jeronymo  it was determined  in full assembly  that Grandison  as well from difference in Religion  as from inferiority in degree and fortune  was unworthy of their alliance  And it was   292 hinted to the General  that he was equally unworthy of his resentment   While the father and two brothers were at Urbino  Lady Clementina gave hopes of a sedate mind  She desired her mother to allow her to see me  But the Marchioness believing there were no hopes of my complying with their terms  and being afraid of the consequences  and of incurring blame from the rest of her family  now especially  that they were absent  and consulting together on what was proper to be done  desired she would not think of it   This refusal made Clementina the more earnest for an interview  Signor Jeronymo gave his advice in favour of it  The misfortune he had met with  had added to his weight with the family  It is a family of harmony and love  They were hardly more particularly fond of Clementina than they were of one another  throughout the several branches of it  This harmony among them added greatly to the family consequence  as well in public as private  Till the attempt that was made upon their Jeronymo  they had not known calamity   But the confessor strengthening the Marchioness s apprehensions of what the consequence of indulging the young Lady might be  all Jeronymo s weight would have failed to carry this point  had it not been for an enterprize of Clementina  which extremely alarmed them  and made them give into her wishes   Camilla has enabled me to give the following melancholy account of it  to the only man on earth to whom I could communicate particulars  the very recollection of which  tears my heart in pieces   The young Lady s malady  after some favourable symptoms which went off  returned in another shape  her talkativeness continued  but the hurry with which she spoke and acted  gave place to a sedateness that she seemed very fond of  They did not suffer her to go   293 out of her chamber  which she took not well  But Camilla being absent about an hour  on her return missed her  and alarmed the whole house upon it  Every part of it  and of the garden  was searched  From an apprehension that they dared not so much as whisper to one another  they dreaded to find her whom they so carefully sought after   At last  Camilla seeing  as she supposed  one of the maid servants coming down stairs with remarkable tranquillity  as she thought  in her air and manner  Wretch  said she  how composed do you seem to be in a storm that agitates every body else   Don t be angry with me  Camilla  returned the supposed servant   O my Lady  my very Lady Clementina  in Laura s cloaths  Whither are you going  madam —But let the Marchioness know  said she  to one of the women servants who then appeared in sight  that we have found my young Lady—What  dear madam  is the meaning of this —Go  Martina  to another womanservant  go this instant to my Lady —Dear Lady Clementina  what concern have you given us   And thus she went on  asking questions of her young Lady  and giving orders  almost in the same breath  till the Marchioness came to them in a joyful hurry  from one of the pavilions in the garden  into which she had thrown
