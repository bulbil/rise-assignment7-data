or maliciously  pretend to justify their Characters  at the same Time  they acknowledge all Appearances to be strong against them  for this is even to allow they had the Vice and Folly of a Harlot  but wanted her only Virtue  Courage  How cruel and severe must it be  to say  a Woman had no one Quality  or Principle  to preserve her from Perdition  but Cowardice  and how unhappy must it be for her too  when she finds this   Hypocrisy against the Devil  will not avail her  either in this World  or the next  for as the  Supervision  is seldom indulged to the Speculation of the   128 Curious  People can only judge  as Iago expresses it   by Circumstances leading to the Door of Truth   and  as for the next World  I fear Heaven needs no overt Act  to prove loose Morals Treason     You see  my Dear  what a different Side of this Question you have reclaimed me to  you have not only won my Heart  but my Morals too  not that the cowardly Despair of Conquest would ever have brought my indomitable Spirit to yield   till  by weighing well your Worth  against your Person  I thought I should gain  like Porus  by my Defeat   LETTER LXXV   Dear FANNY   I RECEIVED your Letter from Liverpool  which  like most of your Letters of late  was very pretty  and very provoking  If you had as much Ingenuousness  as Ingenuity  we should have been always upon better Terms  than we are  However  you are honest enough to confess yourself a Woman  which  at the same Time  accounts naturally for your Inconsistency  and gives me comfortable Hopes  that we nay again be very good Friends  for I have great Sympathy in me with meer mortal   129 Women  but have the most clumsy Address you can imagine towards your infallible Divinities   I do not know any Person who can tell a Story better  and to whom it is more Advantage to be put upon the Defensive  your Letter is a remarkable Instance of this  for it is equally filled with literal  as well as metaphorical Turns  However  I shall not dwell any longer on this Head  since you are become a Woman  but conclude this Letter with referring you to the— Ode of the — Book of Horace  which you may meet with translated by several Hands  to which  desiring your Answer sincerely  I subscribe myself  Your constant Friend  Lover  and humble Servant   LETTER LXXVI   Dear FANNY   I AM just returned from my Circuit  and found your Letter here  which I was doubly pleased at  to hear you were well  and to hear you were coming to Town  I laughed a good deal at myself  just after I had wrote my last Letter to you  to think of my Carelesness about   130 the Number of the Book  and Ode of Horace  I alluded to  I did not exactly remember Chapter and Verse  when I was writing  but left Blanks to be filled up  when I returned from my Study  but forgot it   till the Day after my Letter went  However  I am extremely satisfied at my Mistake now  as you so quickly found out the Allusion  Le Sage entend a demi môt  and that I hope from thence  it was from a strong Sympathy between us on the same Subject   Donec gratus eram tibe   c    I am sorry  tho   to hear you call this but an Armstice  for I assure you  I sincerely meant a lasting Peace  but I suppose you know your own Temper to be so like the French  warm  lively  and restless  that you look on all Terms made with you  as with them  to be only Truces  gaining Breath to renew the Fight  You say modestly you have no Hopes of regaining my Friendship  and you are in the Right of it  in Strictness of Speech  for you have indeed never lost it  nor are you likely so to do  for  as I have sometimes said  or meant to say to you  I find you have my Friendship  in spite of yourself  and my Love  in spite of myself  And on these Terms we shall always be  from a happy Discovery I have made lately  that you have been  and shall always be  in the Right  in every Article of your Life  Not that this Truth   131 appears to me with all the Strength of Demonstration I could wish  but I read you  as I do Euclid  impatient to come to some pleasant  practical Problem  I take all the Theorems for granted  which lead to so charming an End   I delivered your Letter and Pantin to my Sister  she leaves me soon  and will answer you  I believe  in Person   Adieu   Here followed an Interval of six Months  in which Time there passed no Sort of Intercourse  either of Visit  or Correspondence  for Frances had taken Offence at some Particulars in Henry s Behaviour
