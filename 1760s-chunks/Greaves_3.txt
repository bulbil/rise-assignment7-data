s squire  Timothy Crabshaw  or that very individual horse  Gilbert  whose lot is to be one moment caressed  and the next  cursed for a  hard hearted  unchristian tuoad    Barring the Gobbles  all these characters are important in the book from first to last  Sir Launcelot Greaves  then  is significant among Smollett s novels  as indicating a reliance upon the personages for interest quite as much as upon the adventures  If the author failed in a similar intention in Fathom  it was not through lack of clearly conceived characters  but through failure to make them flesh and blood  In that book  however  he put the adventures together more skilfully than in Sir Launcelot Greaves  the plot of which is not only rather meagre but also far fetched  There seems to be no adequate reason for the baronet s whim of becoming an English Don Quixote of the eighteenth century  except the chance it gave Smollett for imitating Cervantes  He was evidently hampered from the start by the consciousness that at best the success of such imitation would be doubtful  Probably he expresses his own misgivings when he makes Ferret exclaim to the hero   What        you set up for a modern Don Quixote  The scheme is rather too stale and extravagant  What was a       well timed satire in Spain near two hundred years ago  will       appear       insipid and absurd       at this time of day  in a country like England   Whether from the author s half heartedness or from some other cause  there is no denying that the Quixotism in Sir Launcelot Greaves is flat  It is a drawback to the book rather than an aid  The plot could have developed itself just as well  the high minded young baronet might have had just as entertaining adventures  without his imitation of the fine old Spanish Don   I have remarked on the old Smollett touch in Sir Launcelot Greaves —the individual touch of which we are continually sensible in Roderick Random and Peregrine Pickle  but seldom in Count Fathom  With it is a new Smollett touch  indicative of a kindlier feeling towards the world  It is commonly said that the only one of the writer s novels which contains a sufficient amount of charity and sweetness is Humphry Clinker  The statement is not quite true  Greaves is not so strikingly amiable as Smollett s masterpiece only because it is not so striking in any of its excellences  their lines are always a little blurred  Still  it shows that ten years before Clinker  Smollett had learned to combine the contradictory elements of life in something like their right proportions  If obscenity and ferocity are found in his fourth novel  they are no longer found in a disproportionate degree   There is little more to say of Sir Launcelot Greaves  except in the way of literary history  The given name of the hero may or may not be significant  It is safe to say that if a Sir Launcelot had appeared in fiction one or two generations earlier  had the fact been recognised  which is not indubitable  that he bore the name of the most celebrated knight of later Arthurian romance  he would have been nothing but a burlesque figure  But in 1760  literary taste was changing  Romanticism in literature had begun to come to the front again  as Smollett had already shown by his romantic leanings in Count Fathom  With it there came interest in the Middle Ages and in the most popular fiction of the Middle Ages  the  greatest of all poetic subjects   according to Tennyson  the stories of Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table  which  for the better part of a century  had been deposed from their old time place of honour  These stories  however  were as yet so imperfectly known—and only to a few—that the most to be said is that some connection between their reviving popularity and the name of Smollett s knight errant hero is not impossible   Apart from this  Sir Launcelot Greaves is interesting historically as ending Smollett s comparatively long silence in novel writing after the publication of Fathom in 1753  His next work was the translation of Don Quixote  which he completed in 1755  and which may first have suggested the idea of an English knight  somewhat after the pattern of the Spanish  Be that as it may  before developing the idea  Smollett busied himself with his Complete History of England  and with the comedy  The Reprisal  or the Tars of Old England  a successful play which at last brought about a reconciliation with his old enemy  Garrick  Two years later  in 1759  as editor of the Critical Review  Smollett was led into a criticism of Admiral Knowles s conduct that was judged libellous enough to give its author three months in the King s Bench prison  during which time  it has been conjectured  he began to mature his plans for the English Quixote  The result was that  in 1760 and 1761  Sir Launcelot Greaves came out in various numbers of the British Magazine  Scott has given his authority to the statement that Smollett wrote many of the instalments in great haste  sometimes  during a visit in Berwickshire
