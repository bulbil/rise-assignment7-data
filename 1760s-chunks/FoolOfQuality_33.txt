 He went after a while to Dublin    where  so Charlotte Brooke told Maria Edgeworth  he used  instead   of walking up and down his room composing  to sit for hours   gazing into vacancy   and died peacefully in 1783  aged seventy    seven years as he lived  a philosopher  a gentleman  and a   Christian      But of all his works  the  Fool of Quality  was the best  the   most characteristic  and possibly the most precious in his eyes    He spent several years over it  The first volumes were published   in 1766  when he was sixty years old   the fifth not till 1770  In   it we have the whole man   the education of an ideal nobleman   by an ideal merchant prince has given him room for all his specu    lations on theology  political economy  the relations of sex and   family  and the training  moral and physical  of a Christian gen    tleman   and to them plot and probability are too often sacrificed    Its pathos is  perhaps  of too healthy and simple a kind to be con    sidered very touching by a public whose taste has been palled by   the  aesthetic brandy and cayenne  of French novels  John   Wesley s opinion of it was  that it was   one of the most beautiful   pictures that ever was drawn in the world   the strokes are so   delicately fine  the touches so easy  natural  and affecting  that I   know not who can survey it with tearless eyes  unless he has a   heart of stone       Nevertheless  overmuch striving for pathos is the defect of the   book  The characters in it  in proportion as they are meant to   be good  are gifted with a passionate and tearful sensibility  which   is rather French or Irish than English  and which will irritate  if   not disgust  many whose Teutonic temperament leads them to   pride themselves rather on the repression than the expression of   emotion  and to believe  and not untruly  that feelings are silent   in proportion to their depth  But it should be recollected that   this extreme sensibility was a part of Brooke s own character    that each man s ideal must be  more or less  the transfiguration of   that which he finds in himself  and that he was honest and rational   in believing that his sensibility  just as much as any other property     b2         U Y PREFACE      of his humanity  when purified from selfishiwess  which was in his   ethics the only method of perfection   could be made as noble  fair    and useful  as any other faculty which God had given      The fifth volume  seemingly published in 1770  is certainly inferior   to the rest  and without seeing in it  as some have done  only   the   magnificent ruins of genius   one may judge from it that his noble   intellect was failing rapidly  even before that loss of his wife which   gave the death blow alike to heart and brain  Nevertheless  even   hi it are deep and beautiful thoughts  on theology and political   economy   and in his decadence  Henry Brooke is still in advance   of his age  preaching truths which are now accepted by most   educated Englishmen  and other truths which will be accepted by   them ere long      Nevertheless  that   Good wine needs no bush   is an old proverb     one so true  that the fact of this book needing a preface  will pos    sibly create a prejudice in the eyes of many      The book  it will be said  is not yet a hundred years old   if   therefore it had been of real value  it would not have so soon lost   its popularity  Surely  some intrinsic defect in it has caused it   to be not undeservedly forgotten  And if an average reader   deigned to open the book  he would probably find in the first   hundred pages quite enough to justify to himself his prejudice    The cause of its failure  he would say  is patent  The plot is   extravagant as well as ill woven  and broken  besides  by episodes   as extravagant as itself  The morality is Quixotic  and practically   impossible  The sermonizing  whether theological or social  is   equally clumsy and obtrusive  Without artistic method  without   knowledge of human nature and the real world  the book can never   have touched many hearts  and can touch none now      To all which it may be answered  that if the form
