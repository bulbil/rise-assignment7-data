 moderation  and wean himself from his former customs by degrees   and  above all things  to rise immediately after his first sleep  and  exercise himself in a morning s walk  In order to render this last part  of the prescription the more palatable  the doctor promised to attend  him in these early excursions  and even to introduce him to a certain  personage of note  who gave a sort of public breakfasting to the minor  virtuosi of the age  and often employed his interest in behalf of those  who properly cultivated his countenance and approbation   This proposal was extremely acceptable to our young gentleman  who   besides the advantage which might accrue to him from such a valuable  connection  foresaw much entertainment and satisfaction in the discourse  of so many learned guests  The occasions of his health and interest   moreover  coincided in another circumstance  the minister s levee being  kept betimes in the morning  so that he could perform his walk  yield  his attendance  and breakfast at this philosophical board  without  encroaching a great deal upon his other avocations  Measures being thus  preconcerted  the physician conducted our adventurer to the house of  this celebrated sage  to whom he recommended him as a gentleman of  genius and taste  who craved the honour of his acquaintance  but he  had previously smoothed the way to his introduction  by representing  Peregrine as a young fellow of great ambition  spirit  and address  who  could not fail to make a figure in the world  that therefore he would be  a creditable addition to the subordinates of such a patron  and by his  qualifications  intrepidity  and warmth of temper  turn out a consummate  herald of his fame  Upon these considerations  he met with a most  engaging reception from the entertainer  who was a well bred man  of  some learning  generosity  and taste  but his foible was the desire of  being thought the inimitable pattern of all three   It was with a view to acquire and support this character  that his  house was open to all those who had any pretensions to literature     6 22 15  3 45 PM   consequently he was surrounded by a strange variety of pretenders  but  none were discouraged  because he knew that even the most insignificant  might  in some shape  conduce to the propagation of his praise  A  babbler  though he cannot run upon the scent  may spring the game  and   by his yelping  help to fill up the cry  No wonder  then  that a youth  of Pickle s accomplishments was admitted and even invited into the pack   After having enjoyed a very short private audience in the closet  our  young gentleman was shown into another room  where half a dozen of his  fellow adherents waited for the Maecenas  who in a few minutes appeared   with a most gracious aspect  received the compliments of the morning   and sat down to breakfast  in the midst of them  without any further  ceremony   The conversation at first turned upon the weather  which was  investigated in a very philosophical manner by one of the company  who  seemed to have consulted all the barometers and thermometers that ever  were invented  before he would venture to affirm that it was a chill  morning  This subject being accurately discussed  the chief inquired  about the news of the learned world  and his inclination was no sooner  expressed than every guest opened his mouth  in order to ratify his  curiosity  But he that first captivated his attention was a meagre   shrivelled antiquary  who looked like an animated mummy  which had been  scorched among the sands of the desert  He told the patron  that he had   by accident  met with a medal  which  though it was defaced by time  he  would venture to pronounce a genuine antique  from the ringing and taste  of the metal  as well as from the colour and composition of the rust  So  saying  he produced a piece of copper coin  so consumed and disguised  by age  that scarce a vestige of the impression was to be perceived   Nevertheless  this connoisseur pretended to distinguish a face in  profile  from which he concluded that the piece was of the Upper Empire   and on the reverse he endeavoured to point out the bulb of the spear   and part of the parazonium  which were the insignia of the Roman Virtus   together with the fragment of one fold of the multicium in which she was  clothed  He likewise had discovered an angle of the letter N  and  at  some distance  an entire I  from these circumstances conjecturing  and  indeed concluding  that the medal was struck by Severus  in honour of  the victory he obtained over his rival Niger  after he had forced the  passes of Mount Taurus  This criticism seemed very satisfactory to  the entertainer  who  having examined the coin by the help of his  spectacles  plainly discerned the particulars which the owner had  mentioned  and was
