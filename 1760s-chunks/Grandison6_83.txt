relax a little  than by strictness of behaviour  Yet I admire those  who  from a full persuasion of their duty  do not relax  and the more  if they have got above moroseness  austerity  and uncharitableness   After dinner  Mr  Milbourne  a very good man  minister of a Dissenting congregation in our neighbourhood  accompanied by Dr  Curtis  called in upon us  They are good friends  made so by the mediation of my grandmamma  some years ago  when they did not so well understand each other  Dr  Curtis had been with us more than once  since Sir Charles was our visiter  He greatly admires him  you need not doubt  It was beautiful  after compliments had passed between Sir Charles and the gentlemen  to see the modest man shine out in your brother s behaviour  Indeed he was free and easy  but attentive  as expecting entertainment and instruction from them  and leading each of them to give it in his own way   They staid but a little while  and when they were gone  Sir Charles said  He wanted no other proof of their being good men  than they gave by their charity  and friendship to each other  My uncle  who  you know  is a zealous man for the Church  speaking a little severely of persons whom he called Scismatics  O Mr  Selby  said Sir Charles  let us be afraid of prescribing to tender consciences  You and I  who have been abroad  in countries where they account us worse than Schismatics  would have been loath to have been prescribed to  or compelled  in articles for which we ourselves are only answerable to the common Father of us all▪  I believe in my conscience  Sir Charles  replied my uncle  if the truth were known  you are of the mind of that King of Egypt  who said  He looked upon the diversity of religions in his kingdom with as much pleasure as he did on the diversity of flowers in his garden     207 I remember not the name of that King of Egypt  Mr  Selby  but I am not of his mind  I should not  if I were a king  take pleasure in such a diversity  But as the examples of Kings are of great force  I would  by making my own as faultless as I could  let my people see the excellence of my persuasion  and my uniform practical adherence to it  instead of discouraging erroneous ones by unjustifiable severity  Religious zeal is generally a fiery thing  I would as soon quarrel with a man for his Face  as for his Religion  A good man  if not over hated by zeal  will be a good man  whatever be his faith  and should always be intitled to our esteem  as he is to our good offices as a fellow creature   The Methodists  Sir Charles  What think you of the Methodists  Say you love  em  and  and  and  adds dines  you shall not be my nephew   You  now  my dear Mr  Selby  make me afraid of you  You throw out a menace  the only one you could perhaps think of  that would make me temporize   You need not  you need not  be afraid  Sir Charles  said my uncle  laughing  What say you  Harriet  Need he  Hay  looking in my downcast face  Why speak you not  lovely Love  Need Sir Charles  if he had disobliged me  to have been afraid —Hay   Dear Sir  you have not of a long time been so—  So  what  Harriet  So  what  dearest  looking me quite down   Fie  Mr  Selby  said my grandmamma  Sir Charles  stepping to me  very gallantly took my hand—O Mr  Selby  you are not kind  said he  But allow me to make my advantage of your unkindness  My dear Miss Byron  let you and I withdraw  in compassion to Mr  Selby  let us withdraw  We will not hear him chidden  as I see the Ladies think he ought to be   And he hurried me off  The surprize made me appear more reluctant than I was in my heart     208 Every one was pleased with his air and manner  and by this means he relieved himself from subjects with which he seemed not delighted  and obtained an opportunity to get me to himself   Here had he stopt  he would have been welcome  But hurrying me into the Cedar parlour  I am jealous  my Love  said he  putting his arm round me  You seemed loth to retire with me  Forgive me  But thus I punish you  whenever you give me cause  And  dear Lady G  he downright kissed me—My lip  and not my cheek—and in so fervent a way—I tell you every thing  my Charlotte—I could have been angry—had I known how  from surprize  Before I could recollect myself  he withdrew his arm  and  resuming his usual respectful air  it would have made me look affected  had I then taken notice of it  But I don
