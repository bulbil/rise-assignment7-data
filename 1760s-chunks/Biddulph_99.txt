filled for herself  The wine was excellent  not that poor sort which is commonly drunk in France  In short  we finished our bottle  I thought her now a match for what I had to say  I had made the glass pass briskly  and had filled up the intervals with singing catches  and rattling on any subject that came into my head   Mrs Gerrarde  who no doubt expected I should make an advance of some kind or other  seemed to grow a little out of humour at my levity  I found the burgundy had been quite thrown away upon her  and had had very little effect  she was silent for a few minutes  and seemed to be considering of something  at last she opened  and I will give you the conversation that passed between us  by way of dialogue   Mrs G Mr Faulkland  it is time that you and I should understand one another’s meaning a little better than we do at present  you know very well that you have put an end to all my expectations in England  indeed  if I were at liberty  I could not have the face to return there again in any character but that of your wife   I was glad she began first  and that  though I guessed at her views  she had used so little caution in discovering them  as it at once roused in me an indignation which I could not suppress  and without which I could not have brought myself to mortify her as she deserved    Mr F My wife  madam   stopping her at that tremendous word  be pleased to tell me if I heard you right   Mrs G Yes  Sir  it was as your wife I said  if you think you and I are to live together on any other terms  you will find yourself exceedingly mistaken   I smiled  and suffered her to go on   I thought  Sir  stifling the anger that I saw rising   that the words which you yourself dictated in the letter which I just now wrote  where you say  I had in you found a protector  and one by whose means I should be able to pass the rest of my life in a manner more suitable to a woman of a generous way of thinking  than that wherein she considered herself as incroaching on the rights of another—Were not these your own words  Sir   Mr F They were  Madam   To say the truth  there was something equivocal in the paragraph  though  when I desired her to write it  this construction never entered into my head    Mrs G Then  Sir  how am I to understand them   Mr F I protest  Madam  you have forced a construction that I never once so much as dreamed of   Mrs G Why  Mr Faulkland  with a very brisk tone   do you fancy    that by changing Mr Arnold for you on any other conditions  that I am such a mighty gainer by the bargain   Mr F Why really  Madam  if that were to be the case  I don’t think you would be a very great loser  you have got as much from poor Arnold as you could expect  I am able to do better for you  and  as I am nobody’s property  it would certainly  in that respect  be rather a more eligible course   Mrs G Sir  you use me very ill  I did not expect such treatment   Mr F How  pray Madam  Did I ever say I would marry you   Mrs G No  Sir  but your behaviour has given me room to suppose that such a thing was in your thoughts   Mr F Are you not then the more obliged to me for treating you with such respect as made you fancy so   Mrs G Respect  respect  muttering between her teeth   Mr Faulkland   and she stood up  there is not a man in England but yourself  after what I have declared  that would refuse making me his wife   Mr F What have you declared  Mrs Gerrarde   Mrs G Why  have I not ingenuously owned my failings  shewed myself sorry for them  quitted them  and made all the reparation in my power    I was amazed to see how audaciously she had adopted as her own  the sentiments which I had suggested to her  it was so like her  that I could have laughed in her face    Mr F Your behaviour  on this occasion  has really been worthy of the imitation of all your own sex  and the praise of ours  for a woman voluntarily to quit an irregular life  and that too from mere motives of conscience— I was stopped by a knavish sneer  which I could not subdue  She saw it  and fired immediately  but strutted about the room to cool herself  at last  for I sat very silent  looking at her  and playing with one of the glasses —  Mrs G Mr Faulkland  if you are disposed to have done trifling  and will vouchsafe me a serious answer  pray tell me  Are you absolutely determined not to marry me
