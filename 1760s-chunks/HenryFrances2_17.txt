I declare solemnly  I have felt a higher Satisfaction in considering myself as your first Friend  than ever I did in thinking myself the Object of your Affection  I know myself capable of retaining your Esteem  because I will never do any Thing to forfeit it  and therefore I receive greater Pleasure from any Mark of your Confidence  than from the fondest Expressions of your Love — Not but I shall ever wish to preserve that too  as I have paid the Price for it  by giving mine  but we are  in general  fonder of what we have no Right to  than what is justly our s     There is no Part of your Character so much indears you to me  as the Tenderness and Humanity of your Disposition  I have actually felt the same Transport in thinking of it  as you have done in the Exercise  my Heart has trembled  and Eyes overflowed with Pleasure  as if I had done some generous or humane Act myself   I do assure you  that often in the extreme Fondness of my Heart  when I have looked at  and heard you with the sincerest Delight  I have been ready to burst into Tears  from reflecting that the Happiness  I then enjoyed  might some Page  63 Time prove an Aggravation of my Misery  and sure there is no Anguish equal to that  which arises from our departed Joys  I do not remember I was ever so much affected at any thing I read  as at a Passage of Young s  which I met with during the Interregnum of our Loves    And she was mine  and I was—was most bless d   Gay Title of the deepest Misery   But I will have done with this melancholy Subject  and I sincerely hope it will never more occur to my Remembrance     Your Brother and Sister have been with me all Day  so that I must quit you sooner than I would  Set down all the Blots and Blunders to their Account  for though my Thoughts are fixed on you  yet being obliged to converse with them  makes both my Hands and Eyes to wander  They have been vastly civil to me  since I came to Town   I intreat you will inquire about my Saturday s Letter  and believe me  my dearest Life   Your sincerest  and most affectionate Friend  Frances   Page  64  LETTER CCI  HENRY to FRANCES   Musaeum   I AM concerned at the Account of your Health  You say you do not know what ails you  but that you are sick  and have lost your Appetite  and Spirits  Now take it thus  and you will find the true State of your Disorder  You have lost your Spirits  consequently your Appetite  and then it is no Wonder you are sick  But the Cause of this Progression is yet to be related  namely  the Fretting  you have humoured yourself in  upon this late Occasion  I wish  my dear Fanny  I could make you as good a Philosopher in Practice  as you are in Theory  You have made me both  for which I am more beholden to you  than to my Mother for my Birth  She made me but an Animal  you have made me a Man   I desire you will send me Lady — s Letter  when you have answered it  I am interested in the smallest Circumstance relating to you  and am vain of every Compliment paid you   I think there is something very pretty in your Sentiments about Friendship  You have carried the Thought farther  than I had ever considered it  by saying  even our Faults  or Foibles  we Page  65 should not hide  in such an Intercourse  but I think there is even a certain Honesty in such an open Dealing  for Friendship  such as deserves that Name  is an Union for Life  and  as in the meaner Partnerships of Trade  we should reveal the Drawbacks of Debts  or Insufficiencies upon our Stock  how much more nice ought we to be in this noble and generous Society  I think  with you  that Persons of different Sexes are most likely to preserve the best  and most lasting Friendships  and really believe  that  in the very few Marriage States  which can be deemed happy  the most perfect Concords of this Kind are to be found  That Gentleness of Manners  and Complacency of Behaviour  which you mention  may be considered as the Essence of Virtue  rather than the mere Ornament of it  and the French Writers treat of them in this pretty Light  under the Title of  Les petites Morales   If strict Philosophy will not admit of this Expression  they may certainly be allowed the Marks of the most amiable Virtues  as they are sure Signs of Good nature  Humility  and Humanity  As some of the Sages said  that Virtue need but put on a visible Form  to bewitch Mankind with her Charms  I think  that  what is meant by the Term  Good breeding  must certainly be the Dress  she would appear in  Mere naked Virtue  perhaps  may be a fit Contemplation for an Angel  but she must
