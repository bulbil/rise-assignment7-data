a dog  the squeaking of a pig   the crowing of a cock  and he had learned the war whoop uttered by the  Indians in North America  These talents were exerted successively   at different times and places  to the terror of Mrs  Trunnion  the  discomposure of the commodore himself  and the consternation of all  the servants in the castle  Peregrine  with a sheet over his clothes   sometimes tumbled before his aunt in the twilight  when her organs of  vision were a little impaired by the cordial she had swallowed  and the  boatswain s mate taught him to shoe cats with walnut shells  so that  they made a most dreadful clattering in their nocturnal excursions   The mind of Mrs  Trunnion was not a little disturbed by these alarms   which  in her opinion  portended the death of some principal person in  the family  she redoubled her religious exercises  and fortified her  spirits with fresh potations  nay  she began to take notice that Mr   Trunnion s constitution was very much broken  and seemed dissatisfied  when people observed that they never saw him look better  Her frequent  visits to the closet  where all her consolation was deposited  inspired  the confederates with a device which had like to have been attended with  tragical consequences  They found an opportunity to infuse jalap in one  of her case bottles  and she took so largely of this medicine  that her  constitution had well nigh sunk under the violence of its effect  She  suffered a succession of fainting fits that reduced her to the brink  of the grave  in spite of all the remedies that were administered by a  physician  who was called in the beginning of her disorder   After having examined the symptoms  he declared that the patient had  been poisoned with arsenic  and prescribed only draughts and lubricating  injections  to defend the coats of the stomach and intestines from  the vellicating particles of that pernicious mineral  at the same time  hinting  with a look of infinite sagacity  that it was not difficult to  divine the whole mystery  He affected to deplore the poor lady  as if  she was exposed to more attempts of the same nature  thereby glancing  obliquely at the innocent commodore  whom the officious son of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   Aesculapius suspected as the author of this expedient  to rid his hands  of a yoke fellow for whom he was well known to have no great devotion   This impertinent and malicious insinuation made some impression upon the  bystanders  and furnished ample field for slander to asperse the morals  of Trunnion  who was represented through the whole district as a monster  of barbarity  Nay  the sufferer herself  though she behaved with great  decency and prudence  could not help entertaining some small diffidence  of her husband  not that she imagined he had any design upon her life   but that he had been at pains to adulterate the brandy with a view of  detaching her from that favourite liquor   On this supposition  she resolved to act with more caution for the  future  without setting on foot any inquiry about the affair  while the  commodore  imputing her indisposition to some natural cause  after the  danger was past  never bestowed a thought upon the subject  so that the  perpetrators were quit of their fear  which  however  had punished them  so effectually  that they never would hazard any more jokes of the same  nature   The shafts of their wit were now directed against the commander himself   whom they teased and terrified almost out of his senses  One day  while  he was at dinner  Pipes came and told him that there was a person  below that wanted to speak with him immediately  about an affair of the  greatest importance  that would admit of no delay  upon which he ordered  the stranger to be told that he was engaged  and that he must send up  his name and business  To this demand he received for answer a message  importing that the person s name was unknown to him  and his business  of such a nature  that it could not be disclosed to any one but the  commodore himself  whom he earnestly desired to see without loss of  time   Trunnion  surprised at this importunity  got up with great reluctance   in the middle of his meal  and descending to a parlour where the  stranger was  asked him  in a surly tone  what he wanted with him in  such a d  d hurry  that he could not wait till he had made an end of his  mess  The other  not at all disconcerted at this rough address  advanced  close up to him on his tiptoes  and  with a look of confidence and  conceit  laying his mouth to one side of the commodore s head  whispered  softly in his car   Sir  I am the attorney whom you wanted to converse  with in private     The attorney   cried Trunnion  staring  and  half choked with choler
