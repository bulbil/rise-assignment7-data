little that night  but getting up early in the morning  went to the place appointed  where I met my she friend  and imparted to her my success with the squire—She was very much pleased at the occasion  which  she said  could not fail of being agreeable to Narcissa  who in spite of her passion for me  had mentioned some scruples relating to my true situation and character  which the delicacy of her sentiments suggested  and which she believed I would find it necessary to remove  though she did not know how —I was a good deal startled at this insinuation  because I foresaw the difficulty I should find in barely doing myself justice  for although it never was my intention to impose myself upon any woman  much less on Narcissa  as a man of fortune  I laid claim to the character of a gentleman  by birth  education and behaviour  and yet  so unlucky had the circumstances of my life fallen out  I should find it a very hard matter to make good my pretensions even to these  especially to the last  which was the most essential—Miss Williams was as sensible as I  of this my disadvantage  but comforted me with observing  that when once a woman has bestowed her affections on a man  she cannot help judging of him in all respects  with a partiality easily influenced in his favour —she remarked that altho  some situations of my life had been low  yet none of them had been infamous  that my indigence   215 had been the crime not of me  but of fortune  and that the miseries I had undergone  by improving the faculties both of mind and body  qualified me the more for any dignified station  and would of consequence  recommend me to the good graces of any sensible woman —she therefore advised me to be always open and unreserved to the inquiries of my mistress  without unnecessarily betraying the meanest occurrences of my fate  and trust to the strength of her love and reflection  for the rest —The sentiments of this sensible young woman on this  as well as on almost every other subject  perfectly agreed with mine  I thanked her for the care she took of my interests  and promising to behave myself according to her direction  we parted  after she had assured me  that I might depend upon her best offices with her mistress  and that she would front time to time  communicate to me such intelligence as she could procure  relating to my flame —Having dressed myself to the best advantage  I waited for the time of dinner with the most fearful impatience  and as the hour drew nigh  my heart beat with such increased velocity  and my spirits contracted such disorder  that I began to suspect my resolution  and even to wish myself disengaged —At last Mr  Freeman called at my lodgings  in his way  and I accompanied him to the house where all my happiness was deposited —We were very kindly received by the squire  who sat smoaking his pipe in a parlour  and asked if we chose to drink any thing before dinner  tho  I never had more occasion for a cordial  I was ashamed to accept his offer  which was also refused by my friend  We sat down  however  and entered into conversation  which lasted half an   216 hour  so that I had time to recollect myself  and  so capricious were my thoughts  even to hope that Narcissa would not appear—when all of a sudden  a servant coming in  gave us notice that dinner was upon the table—and my perturbation returned with such violence  that I could scarce conceal it from the company as I ascended the staircase —When I entered the dining room  the first object that saluted my ravished eyes  was the divine Narcissa  blushing like Aurora  adorned with all the graces that meekness  innocence and beauty can diffuse  I was seized with a giddiness  my knees tottered  and I scarce had strength enough to perform the ceremony of salutation  when her brother slapping me upon the shoulder  cried    Measter Randan  that there is my sister    I approached her with eagerness and fear  but in the moment of our embrace  my soul was agonized with rapture —It was a lucky circumstance for us both  that my entertainer was not endued with an uncommon stock of penetration  for our mutual confusion was so manifest  that Mr  Freeman perceived it  and as we went home together  congratulated me on my good fortune —But so far was Bruin from entertaining the least suspicion  that he encouraged me to begin a conversation with my mistress in a language unknown to him  by telling her  that he had brought a gentleman  meaning me  who could jabber with her in French and other foreign lingos  as fast as she pleased  then turning to me  said    Odds bobs  I wish you would hold discourse with her  in your French or Italiano  and tell me if she understands it as well as she would be thought to do—there s her aunt and she will chatter together whole days in it    217 and I can t have a mouthful of English for love or money    I consulted the looks of my amiable mistress  and
