 I suppose  by his being disturbed in his devotion  and in a trice  snatched the object of my suspicion from my sight —After making an apology for my intrusion  I acquainted him with the situation of Rattlin  but could by no means prevail upon him to visit him on deck where he lay  he bid me desire the boatswain to order some of the men to carry him down to the cockpit  and in the mean time he would direct Thomson in getting ready the dressings —When I signified to the boatswain the doctor s desire  he swore a terrible oath  that he could not spare one man from the deck  because he expected the masts would go by the board every minute —This piece of information did not at all contribute to my peace of mind  however  as my friend Rattlin complained very much  with the assistance of Morgan  I supported him to the lower deck  whither Mr  Mackshane  after much intreaty  ventured to come  attended by Thomson with a boxful of dressings  and his own servant  who carried a whole set of capital instruments —He examined the fracture and the wound  and concluding from a livid colour extending itself upon the limb  that a mortification would ensue  resolved to amputate the leg immediately —This was a dreadful sentence   257 to the patient  who recruiting himself with a quid of tobacco  pronounced with a woful countenance    What  is there no remedy  doctor  must I be dock d  can t you splice it  —   Assuredly  doctor Mackshane  said the first mate  with submission  and deference  and veneration to your superior abilities  and opportunities  and stations  look you  I do apprehend  and conjecture  and aver  that there is no occasion nor necessity to smite off this poor man s leg  —   God almighty bless you  dear Welchman   cried Rattlin  may you have fair wind and weather wheresoever you re bound  and come to an anchor in the road of heaven at last  —  Mackshane  very much incensed at his mate s differing in opinion from him so openly  answered  that he was not bound to give an account of his practice to him  and in a peremptory tone  ordered him to apply the tourniquet —At the sight of which  Jack starting up  cried    Avast  avast  d—n my heart  if you clap your nippers on me  till I know wherefore —Mr  Random  won t you lend a hand towards saving of my precious limb  Odd s heart  if lieutenant Bowling was here  he would not suffer Jack Rattlin s leg to be be chopped off like a piece of old junk  —  This pathetic address to me  joined to my inclination to serve my honest friend  and the reasons I had to believe there was no danger in delaying the amputation  induced me to declare myself of the first mate s opinion  and affirm that the preternatural colour of the skin  was owing to an inflammation occasioned by a contusion  and common in all such cases  without any indication of an approaching gangrene  Morgan  who had a   258 great opinion of my skill  manifestly exulted in my fellowship  and asked Thomson s sentiments of the matter  in hopes of strengthening our association with him too  but he being of a meek disposition  and either dreading the enmity of the surgeon  or speaking the dictates of his own judgment  in a modest manner  espoused the opinion of Mackshane  who by this time  having consulted with himself  determined to act in such a manner  as to screen himself from censure  and at the same time revenge himself on us  for our arrogance in contradicting him —With this view  he demanded to know if we would undertake to cure the leg at our peril  that is  be answerable for the consequence —To this Morgan replied  that the lives of his creatures are in the hands of Got alone  and it would be great presumption in him to undertake for an event that was in the power of his maker  no more than the doctor could promise to cure all the sick to whom he administered his assistance  but if the patient would put himself under our direction  we would do our endeavour to bring his distemper to a savourable issue  to which  at present  we saw no obstruction —I signified my concurrence  and Rattlin was so over joyed  that shaking us both by the hands  he swore no body else should touch him  and if he died  his blood should be upon his own head —Mr  Mackshane  flattering himself with the prospect of our miscarriage  went away  and left us to manage it as we should think proper  accordingly  having sawed off part of the splinter that stuck through the skin  we reduced the fracture  dressed the wound  applied the eighteen tailed bandage  and put the leg in a box  secundum artem —Every thing succeeded according   259 to our wish  and we had the satisfaction  of not only preserving the poor fellow s leg  but likewise of rendering the doctor contemptible among the ship s company  who had all their eyes on us during the course of this
