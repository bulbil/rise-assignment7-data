 he not only purged himself of having done any   actual dishonour to her husband  for the attention they would   not permit him to controvert  but also made satisfaction to his   resentment for the attempt  with one hundred pounds  for which    as he had not a sum immediately about him  he gave a draught   on his banker  and waited in duress  till the arrival of it released   him      This misfortune made him more cautious for some time   but   he begins to forget it now  and goes on with his business as before    One thing  indeed  he takes sufficient care about  and that is  that   the waist of his breeches is properly secured   for so strong is the   impression which that accident made upon him  that he never   walks a dozen steps without pulling them up      You see  most of them begin to nod  I shall therefore draw the   curtain here  and leave them to their nap with this observation    that a few such examples as the clergjrman  and many of the kind   there are  particularly eminent in this exalted virtue of charity   ia both the sexes  are sufficient to take off the prejudice which  the   others must excite  and to preserve the proper respect to principles   they propose to imitation          CHAPTER XLII     SOME AOCOTTirT OF THE OFFICERS OF THE CHARITT â€” THBIB CAKE OF   THEMSELVES â€” THEY FALL OUT AB0t7T THE DIVISION OF THE   SPOIL â€” A TBBBIBLE TTPKOAR IS APPEASED BY A DEMAND OF QENBKAL   CONCERN â€” THE CONCISE MANNER OF PASSING PUBLIC ACCOUNTS â€”   CHBYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE     When I had taken sufficient view of the governors  I had leisure   to turn my observations to the servants of the society  whose be    haviour raised an indignation too strong to be expressed by words    If the governors feasted  they paid for their feasting   but th          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 135     servants feasted no less  and were paid for it   Nor was this enor    mity confined to this day   their whole time was one continued   scene of it  and much the greater part of the contributions of the   public was prostituted to this abominable abuse  while the poor    for whose relief they were given  too often languished in want of   the meanest necessaries  the fund being insufficient for their wants    and the luxury and wages of their servants      I was diverted from these reflections by an uproar in one of the   private apartments of the house  where some of the superior servants   had got together over a bottle of wine to settle their respective   dividends of the subscriptions of the day  I call them servants    for that is the proper appellation of all who serve for hire  As   I was yet vunfisposed of  to any particular person  I had it in   my power  as I have told you before  to range through the whole   territories of the society to which I belonged  and therefore   flew to see what might be the cause of this riot in so improper a   place  where I was witness to such a scene as almost transcends   belief      At the upper end of the table sat the treasurer  for it would be   a reproach to the poorest society to have fewer officers than the   state  with his accounts before him  After a bumper to the success   of the charity    Mr Steward    said he    our subscriptions have   been so good this year that I think we may venture to enlarge our   salaries a little  for last year they were really scarce worth a gentle    man s acceptance          That is true    replied the steward    and I beUeve we may   enlarge the house allowance too  for  upon the present establish    ment  it is hardly enough for the days we meet here  and will not   afford anything to carry home  to entertain a friend with  as a   gentleman would desire  It is but swelling some of the sick articles    which at present are scarce above the consumption  When I was   overseer of the parish  we managed things better  We then lived   like gentlemen  Nay  I remember when I was churchwarden    that we spent the whole summer jaunting about the country in   pursuit of a gentleman who had a child sworn to him  for fifty   shillings  which he had been ordered to pay  till the bill of our   e3 penses came to fifteen pounds   and yet nobody could say against
