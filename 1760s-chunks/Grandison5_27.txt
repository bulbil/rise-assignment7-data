and for which you have asked  and are granted three months time  Have you not  Sir  strengthened your engagement by your request  And have not they intitled themselves to the performance  by their compliance with it  Page  67 The obligation which rashness  and  perhaps  surprize  laid you under  your deliberation has confirmed   You say  that your new creditors are men of the town  sharpers  and gamesters  But  my cousin  how came you among such  They came not to you  I say not this to upbraid you  But I must not have you deceive yourself  Who but a man s self is to suffer by his rashness or inconsideration  They are reputed to have been possessed of fortunes  however they came by them  which would have enabled them to answer the stakes they played for  had they been the losers  And would you not have exacted payment from them  had you been the winner  Did you at the time suspect loaded dice  or foul play  You are not  Sir  a novice in the ways of the town  If you had good proof of what  from the ill success you seem only to suspect  I should not account the debts incurred debts of honour  and should hardly scruple  had I not indirectly promised payment  by asking time for it  or had they refused to give it  to call in to my aid the laws of my country  and the rather  as the appeal to those laws would be a security to me  against ever again being seen in such company   Adversity is the trial of principle  Without it  a man hardly knows whether he is an honest man  Two things my cousin  in his present difficulties  must guard against  the one  that he do not suffer himself to be prevailed upon  in hopes to retrieve his losses  to frequent the tables by which he has suffered  and so become one of the very men he has so much reason to wish he had avoided  Who would not rather be the sufferer than the defrauder  What must be the nature of that man  who  having himself been ruined  will endeavour to draw in other innocent men to their ruin     The other that he do not permit prior and worthier creditors  creditors from valuable considerations  to suffer by the distresses in which he has involved himself   Page  68 It is a hard decision  But were I my cousin  I would divest myself of my whole estate  were it necessary  for the satisfaction of my creditors  and leave it to their generosity  to allow me what pittance they pleased for subsistence  and within that pittance would I live  not only for justice sake  but  were my difficulties owing to my own inconsideration  as a just punishment for not being satisfied with my own ampler fortune  and for putting to hazard a certainty  in hopes of obtaining a share in the property of others  Excuse me  my dear Everard  I mean not particular reflexion  but only to give you my notion of general justice in cases of this nature   Acquit yourself worthily of these difficulties  I consider you as my brother  And you shall be welcome to take with me a brother s part of my estate  till you can be restored to a competency   But with regard to the woman whom the infamous Lord B  would impose upon you as a wife  that is an imposition to which you must not submit  Had she been the poorest honest girl in Britain  and you had seduced her  by promises of marriage  I must have made it the condition of our continued friendship  that you had married her  But a kept woman —Let not HER  Let not the bad man  have such a triumph  I know his character well  I know his dependance on the skill of his arm  And I know his litigious spirit  and the use he is capable of making of his privilege  But regard not these  Let me advise you  Sir  after you have secured to your creditors the payment of their just debts  to come over to me  The sooner the better  By this means you will be out of the way of being disturbed by the menaces of this Lord  and the machinations of this woman  We will return together  I will make your case my own  Both the courage  and the quality  of the man who can be unjust  are to be despised  Is not Lord B  an unjust man in every article of his dealings with men  Do not Page  69 you  my dear cousin  be so in any one  and you will ever command the true fraternal love of  Your CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER XIII  Lady G  To Lady L    Selby house  Friday  June 16   HERE we are  my Caroline  And the happiest people in the world should we be  if Harriet were but well  my brother in England  and you and Lord L  with us   Mrs  Selby  Lucy  Nancy  Harriet  met us at Stony Stratford  escorted by uncle Selby  and his kinsman
