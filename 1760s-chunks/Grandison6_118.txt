we have given the Day  night and day  we neither take rest  nor give it  When  if we had the rare felicity of knowing our minds sooner  all might go on fair and softly  But then the gentle passion  I doubt  would glide into insipidity  Well  and I have heard my brother say     That things in general are best as they are    Why I believe so  for all these honest souls  as mantuamakers  attire women  work women    294enjoy a hurry that is occasioned by a wedding  and are half as well pleased with it  as if it were their own  They simper  smirk  gossip  over Bridal finery  spread this upon their arms or shoulders  admire that—Look you here—Look you there  And is not this —Is not that —And  Did you ever —No  never  in my born days —And is the Bride  do you say  such a lovely creature —And is the Bridegroom as handsome a man  as she a woman —O lud  O dear —Would to Heaven Northamptonshire were nearer  that one might see how charming  how graceful  how becoming  and so forth     And why should not we women  after all  contrive to make hurry skurries  You see how I correct myself as I go along  and make the world think our affairs a great part of the business of it  and that nothing can be done without us  Since  after a few months are over  new novelties take place  and we get into corners  sigh  groan  look silly and meagre  and at last are thrown into straw  as it is called  poor Caroline s case  who repines  that she can t be present on this new bustle in the family  But I am to write her word of every thing—Look to your behaviour  Harriet  on the great occasion   But a word about Caroline—Were it not for her being deprived of this pleasure  the good creature would be very happy  Lord L  and she are as fond as apes  She has quite forgot all her sufferings for him  He thanks her for his boy  She follows with her eye the little stranger  and is delighted with all that is done with him  to him  for him  Is pleased with everybody  even with the very servants  who croud in  by permission to see his little Lordship  and already claim an interest in him  Upon my word  she makes a very pretty fond mother  And aunt Nell  who  by the way  was at the Crying out  and was then so frighted  so thankful to God  and so happy in her own situation   No  not for the world  would she be other than she was   now grudges the nurses half their cares     295 What good creatures are we women   Well  but I don t know what to do about Emily  The first vice of the first woman was curiosity  and it runs through all her daughters  She has written to her Guardian  and nothing but an absolute prohibition will hinder her from making one in your train  Did the dear girl know the state of her own heart  she would choose to be a thousand miles off  rather than go  I have set her woman and mine to discourage her  I have reasoned with her myself  but there is no such thing as giving her one s true reasons  nor would I  willingly  Because she herself  having not found out her Love to be Love  I hope the fire may be smothered in her own heart  by the aid of time and discretion  before discovery  whereas  if the doors of it were to be opened  and the air let in  it might set the whole tenement in a blaze  Her Guardian s denial or assent will come  perhaps  in time  yet hardly  neither  for we shall set out on Monday  Aunt Nell is so pleased with her nursery of the little Peer  as she primly calls him  that you are rid of even her wishes to be with you  Being sure of this  I complimented her  that I knew your aunt Selby would have invited her  but that Lady L  would not be able to live without her company  all the world  and the world s wise  attentive and engrossed by your affair  She  good creature  was pleased—So as she could but be thought of importance by somebody  I knew she would be happy  I told her  that you invited nobody  but left all to your friends—Ay  poor dear Soul  said she  she has enough to think of  well as she loves your brother—and sighed for you—Worthy Ancient  The sigh a little deeper  perhaps  for some of her own Recollections   Mr  and Mrs  Reeves would not stay for us  What will you do with us all —Croud you  I sear  But dispose of us  at Shirley manor  or Selby house  as you please  Yours  and aunt Selby s  and grandmamma   296 Shirley s concern for us  is all we are solicitous
