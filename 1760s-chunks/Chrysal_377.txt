       I should be glad to know what that reason can be  for I must   own I cannot conceive it          Why  sir  it is a thing to be sure that may seem odd to you     but experience has taught us the truth of it  In short  sir  it is your   being alive          How   my being aUve   What difference can my life or death   make in the value of my pictures           A very great one  sir  I assure you  In all the course of my   business  I never knew one instance of a sale going off well  where   the owner was living  People conclude that a person parts with   pictures either through dislike or necessity  The former  you   know  depreciates them at once   nor does the other much less     as people of fashion despise a man  and everything belonging to   him  the moment it is known that he is in distress  Besides  an   auctioneer s tongue is tied up from saying anything of a person s   taste and judgment  and all that  while he is living   it sounds so   fulsome   and you are sensible that a good character of the collector   often goes a great way in helping off a collection          The best thing  then  for a man to do on such an occasion  I   presume  would be to shoot himself through the head   Heh         Ha   ha   ha   You are pleased to jest  sir   but to be sure   it would be of great advantage  Curiosity brings all the world   upon those occasions   and then a man has an opportunity of   eaying so many things  as  that the deceased would not take ten   times so much  if he were living   or  that the high price he gave   it caused the distress that made him kill himself   or a thousand   â  other striking things of the kind  I never have so much pleasure   as upon those occasions   they give a man such room to show   himself  Indeed  if gentlemen considered the thing in time  more   of them would take this method of delivering themselves and their   families both from distress  and not defer it till all is gone  and the   survivors can make nothing by their death   but few people take   any care for their families nowadays  It is a bold push  to be sure     though not so bad as a man s shooting himself to win a wager    neither  I should beg your pardon  sir  for speaking so freely    but  as I know it is not your case  you cannot take offence   though    Â«ven If I thought it was  I would not presume to recommend such         454 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     a thing for the  world  Every person is  to judge for himself  I   only give you my opinion what efieot it would have          I understand you very well  sir    answered the gentleman  who   had much difficulty to hear him out     and in return for your   opinion will give you my advice  which is  to consider better whom   you speak to in this insolent manner another time  for fear of re    ceiving such chastisement as contempt alone prevents my giving   you this moment    On saying which words he turned about  and   left the room          CHAPTER XLIV     OHRYSAL s master EBCBrVBS AN  AGREEABLE SUMMONS â€”  HTS EN    COMIITMS ON THE GENEROSITY OF MERCHANTS  AND ACCOtraTT OF   THE WAY MANY OE THEM ACQtTERB EEPUTATION FOR TASTE AND   JITDGMBNT â€” HE MEETS THE MERCHANT  WHO CONStFLTS HIM ON   A DIFPERENT BRANCH OP HIS BtTSINESS FROM THAT WHICH HE   EXPECTED â€” CHEYSAL S MASTER  IN ORDER TO ENCOtHBAGE HIS   CtrSTOMER  GIVES A LARGE ACCOUNT OF HIS OWN ABILITIES  AND   OPENS SOME CURIOUS SECRETS IN HIS BUSINESS â€” A BARGAIN IS   STRUCK  TO THE MUTUAL SATISFACTION OF BOTH PAETIES   AND   CHBYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE FOR THAT OF THE MERCHANT     Well as my master was accustomed to rebukes  there was some    thing in the nature of this which disconcerted him so much  that   he had not power to make the gentleman any reply  But he was   soon relieved from the trepidation into which it threw him  by   a message from an eminent merchant
