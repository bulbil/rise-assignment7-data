seemed to sleep for ages  and at last fought its way among us through tilts  tournaments  dragons  and all the dreams of chivalry  The rest of the world  China only excepted  are and have ever been utter strangers to its delights and advantages  In other countries  as men find themselves stronger than women  they lay a claim to a rigorous superiority  this is natural  and love which gives up this natural advantage must certainly be the effect of art  An art calculated to lengthen out our happier moments  and add new graces to society   I entirely acquiesce in your sentiments  says the lady  with regard to the advantages of this passion  but cannot avoid giving it a nobler origin than you have been pleased to assign  I must think  that those countries  where it is rejected  are obliged to have recourse to art to stifle so natural a production  and those nations  where it is cultivated  only make nearer advances to nature  The same efforts  that are used in some places to suppress pity and other natural passions  may have been employed to extinguish love  No nation  however unpolished  is remarkable for innocence  that is not famous for passion  it has flourished in the coldest  as well as the warmest regions  Even in the sultry wilds of southern America  the lover is not satisfied with possessing his mistress s person without having her mind      209  In all my Enna s beauties blest  Amidst profusion still I pine   Far tho  she gives me up her breast  Its panting tenant is not mine    But the effects of love are too violent to be the result of an artificial passion  Nor is it in the power of fashion to force the constitution into those changes which we every day observe  Several have died of it  Few lovers are unacquainted with the fate of the two Italian lovers  Da Corsin and Julia Bellamano  who after a long separation expired with pleasure in each others arms  Such instances are too strong confirmations of the reality of the passion  and serve to shew that suppressing it  is but opposing the natural dictates of the heart     Adieu   LETTER CXIV  To the same   THE clock just struck two  the expiring taper rises and sinks in the socket  the watchman forgets the hour in slumber  the laborious and the happy are at rest  and nothing wakes but meditation  guilt  revelry and despair  The drunkard once more fills the destroying bowl  the robber walks his   210 midnight round  and the suicide lifts his guilty arm against his own sacred person   Let me no longer waste the night over the  of antiquity  or the sallies of cotemporary genius  but pursue the solitary walk  where vanity  ever changing  but a few hours past  walked before me  where she kept up the ant  and now  like a froward child  seems hushed with her own importunities   What a gloom hangs all around  the dying lamp feebly emits a yellow gleam  no sound is heard but of the chiming clock  or the distant watch dog  All the bustle of human pride is forgotten  an hour like this may well display the emptiness of human vanity   There will come a time when this temporary solitude may be made continual  and the city itself  like its inhabitants  fade away  and leave a desart in its room   What cities  as great as this  have once triumphed in existence  had their victories as great  joy as just  and as unbounded  and with short sighted presumption  promised themselves immortality  Posterity can hardly trace the situation of some  The sorrowful traveller wanders over the awful ruins of others  and as he beholds  he learns wisdom  and feels the transience of every sublunary possession   Here  he cries  stood their citadel  now grown over with weeds  there their senate house  but now the haunt of every noxious reptile  temples   211 and theatres stood here  now only an undistinguished heap of ruin  They are fallen  for luxury and avarice first made them feeble  The rewards of state were conferred on amusing  and not on useful  members of society  Their riches and opulence invited the invaders  who  though at first repulsed  returned again  conquered by perseverance  and at last swept the defendants into undistinguished destruction   How few appear in those streets  which but some few hours ago were crowded  and those who appear  now no longer wear their daily mask  nor attempt to hide their lewdness or their misery   But who are those who make the streets their couch  and find a short repose from wretchedness at the doors of the oppulent  These are strangers  wanderers  and orphans  whose circumstances are too humble to expect redress  and whose distresses are too great even for pity  Their wretchedness excites rather horror than pity  Some are without the covering even of rags  and others emaciated with disease  the world has disclaimed them  society turns its back upon their distress  and has given them up to nakedness and hunger  These poor shivering females have once seen happier days
