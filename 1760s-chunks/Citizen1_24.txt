commonwealth  they are divided into almost as many factions as there are men  and their jarring constitution  instead of being stiled a republic of letters  should be entituled  an anarchy of literature   It is true  there are some of superior abilities who reverence and esteem each other  but their mutual admiration is not sufficient to shield off the contempt of the crowd  The wise are but few  and they praise with a feeble voice  the vulgar are many  and roar in reproaches  The truly great seldom unite in societies  have few meetings  no cabals  the dunces hunt in full cry till they have run down a reputation  and then snarl and fight with each other about dividing the spoil  Here you may see the compilers  and the book answerers of every month  when they have cut up some respectable name  most frequently reproaching each other with stupidity and dullness  resembling the wolves of the Russian forest  who prey upon venison  or horse flesh when they can get it  but in cases of necessity  lying in wait to devour each other  While they have new books to cut up  they make a hearty meal  but if this resource should unhappily fail  then it is that critics eat up critics  and compilers rob from compilations   Confucius observes that it is the duty of the learned to unite society more closely  and to persuade men to become citizens of the world  but the authors I refer to  are not only for disuniting society  but kingdoms also  if the   74 English are at war with France  the dunces of France think it their duty to be at war with those of England  Thus Freron  one of their first rate scriblers  thinks proper to characterise all the English writers in the gross  Their whole merit  says he     consists in exaggeration  and often in extravagance  correct their pieces as you please  there still remains a leaven which corrupts the whole  They sometimes discover genius  but not the smallest share of taste  England is not a soil for the plants of genius to thrive in    This is open enough  with not the least adulation in the picture  but hear what a Frenchman of acknowledged abilities says upon the same subject    I am at a loss to determine in what we excel the English  or where they excel us  when I compare the merits of both in any one species of literary composition  so many reputable and pleasing writers present themselves from either country  that my judgment rests in suspense  I am pleased with the disquisition  without finding the object of my enquiry      But lest you should think the French alone are faulty in this respect  hear how an English journalist delivers his sentiments of them     We are amazed  says he  to find so many works translated from the French  while we have such numbers neglected of our own  In our opinion  notwithstanding their fame throughout the rest of Europe  the French are the most contemptible reasoners  we had almost said writers  that can be imagined  However  nevertheless  excepting   c    Another English writer  Shaftsbury  if I remember  on the contrary  says  that the French authors are pleasing and judicious  more clear  more methodical  and entertaining than those of his own country       75From these opposite pictures  you perceive that the good authors of either country praise  and the bad revile each other  and yet  perhaps  you ll be surprized that indifferent writers should thus be the most apt to censure  as they have the most to apprehend from recrimination  you may  perhaps  imagine that such as are possessed of fame themselves should be most ready to declare their opinions  since what they say  might pass for decision  But the truth happens to be  that the great are solicitous only of raising their own reputations  while the opposite class  alas   are solicitous of bringing every reputation down to a level with their own   But let us acquit them of malice and envy  a critic is often guided by the same motives that direct his author  The author endeavours to persuade us  that he has written a good book  the critic is equally sollicitous to shew that he could write a better  had he thought proper  A critic is a being possessed of all the vanity  but not the genius  of a scholar  incapable  from his native weakness  of lifting himself from the ground  he applies to contiguous merit for support  makes the sportive sallies of another s imagination his serious employment  pretends to take our feelings under his care  teaches where to condemn  where to lay the emphasis of praise  and may with as much justice be called a man of taste  as the Chinese who measures his wisdom by the length of his nails   If then a book  spirited or humourous  happens to appear in the republic of letters  several critics are in waiting to bid the public not to laugh at a single line of it  for themselves had read it  and they know what is most proper to excite laughter    76 Other
