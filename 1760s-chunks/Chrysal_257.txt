   Then rising languidly â€”     What papers are those     said he    Did I not say I would not   be troubled about business           The survey of that ship  and your own accounts for the outsets   of this expedition    answered the clerk    which  if you please  you   had better look over now  as we shall have others to attend to soon    I am sorry to say it does not answer your expectations  but the   people alleged that they had been made to pay so extravagantly   for their contracts  that it was impossible for them to sink the   qualities of the stores so low as to be able to give you anything   worth your acceptance          Not able to give me anything     said the admiral  who had been   roused from his lethargic indifference by the first mention of his   own affairs    They lie  the scoundrels  and I ll make them linow   it  Tlie sick lists show that they have sunk them with a vengeance    and beyond every degree of reason  and if they think that I ll con    nive at their murdering the men  without having any share in the   profit  they shall find themselves damnably out in their reckonings    And therefore do you go directly to every purser in the fleet  and   order them to have a survey privately made of their worst stores    to produce when I call for it  I ll make them come down  and   handsomely  too  or they shall repent it          But  sir  is there not danger of their being provoked by such an   attack  to say something improper  and that they who made the   contracts with them may do you an ill office on another occasion     There are wheels within wheels          Let them  if they can    answered the admiral  clapping his   hands akimbo     I shall trouble them no more  If I mind my hits   this trip  I shall be as rich as the best of them  and will stay at home   and take my ease as well as they   and as to their speaking  whom   are they to speak to   Tell my brother that I am a knave  No    no  we shall hardly hear tales of each other   things hang too close         298 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     together for that  Do you  therefore  mind your business  and leave   these matters to me          But may not they spread stories abroad  which may injure your   character with the public           My character   not in the least  Such stories affect only the   clerks and such low people  whose perquisites these things are re    puted to be  and who only appear in them  But that caimot be   said to injure them neither  for what clerk ever had a character   that could be injured   Ha   ha   ha   so that your care for char    acter  forsooth  is quite unnecessary  Do what you will  you   cannot suffer in that  All you have to do is to mind your business    and when you have got money  no one will inquire about your   character        Saying this  he waved his hand to the clerk to withdraw  and then   walking a turn or two about his great cabin  opened the money    bag  and telling the contents  put a few pieces  among which I was    into his pocket  and locked up the rest in his strong box  after   which he threw himself again on the sofa  to rest after the fatigue   of so much business      You seem at a loss how to reconcile the sentiment which my   master discovered in his conference with the luxury and magnifi    cence of everything about him  but they contradict not each other   in the least  In the transactions with his clerk  he showed the   genuine motions of his heart  but with the other  he has nothing to   do  They are entirely at the expense of the public  though in a   maimer not obvious to every eye  being a kind of tax established   by custom on the pursers of men of war  under the appearance    indeed  of a present to their commanders  but in reality as a bribe   for coimdving at their impositions  and this tax it is that enables   those commanders to
