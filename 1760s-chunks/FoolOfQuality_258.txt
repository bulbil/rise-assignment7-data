though often de    feated  rose more vigorous and reinforced from every soil  Of times   long passed  what stupendous characters   what sacred names   what   watchful councils   what bloody effusions   what a people of heroes     what senates of sages   How hath the invention of nature been   stretched  how have the veins of the valiant been exhausted  to   form  support  reform  and bring to maturity  this unexampled con    stitution  this coalescence and grand effort of every human virtue    British Liberty        Here follows Mr  Fenton s short system of the beauties and   benefits of our constitution  But  if the reader loves amusement   preferable to instruction  he is at liberty to pass it over  and pro    ceed in the story           THE king  in the constitution of Great Britain  is more properly   the king of  than a king over the people  united to them  one of   them  and contained in them  At the same time that he is ackno v          274 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      ledged the head of their body  he is their principal servant or   minister  being the deputee of their executive power      His claim to the throne is not a claim as of some matter of pro    perty or personal right   he doth not claim  but is claimed by the   people in their parliament   and he is claimed or called upon  not to   the investiture of possessions  but the performance of duties  He   is called upon to govern the people according to the laws by which   they themselves have consented to be governed   to cause justice   and mercy to be dispensed throughout the realm   and to his ut    most to execute  protect  and maintain the laws of the gospel of   God  and the rights and liberties of all the people without dis    tinction   and this he swears on the gospel of God to perform  And   thus  as all others owe allegiance to the king  the Icing himself oweth   allegiance to the constitution      The existence of a king  as one of the three estates  is immutable    indispensable  and indefeasible  the constitution cannot subsist   without a king  But then his personal claim of possession  and of   hereditary succession to the throne  is in several instances pre    carious and defeasible  as in case of any natural incapacity to   govern  or of an open avowal of principles incompatible with the   constitution   or in case of overt acts demonstrative of such prin    ciples   or of any attempt to sap or overthrow a fundamental part   of that system which he was called in  and constituted  and has   sworn to maintain      Though the claim of all kings to the throne of Great Britain is a   limited and defeasible claim   yet the world can afford no rival  in   power or glory  to a constitutional sovereign of these free dominions      For the honour of their own body  they have invested this their   head with all possible illustration  he concentrates the rays of   many nations  They have clothed him in royal robes  and circled   his head with a diadem  and enthroned him on high   and they bow   down before the mirror of their own majesty      Neither are his the mere ensigns or external shows of regency     he is invested also with powers much more real than if they   were absolute      There are three capital prerogatives with which the king is   intrusted  which  at first sight  appear of fearful and dangerous   tendency  and which must infallibly and quickly end in arbitrary   dominion if they were not counterpoised and counteracted      His principal prerogative is to make war or peace  as also   treaties  leagues  and alliances with foreign potentates      His second prerogative is to nominate and appoint all ministers   and servants of state  all judges and administrators of justice  and   all officers  civil or military  throughout these realms      His third capital prerogative is  that he should have the whole   executive power of the government of these nations by his said   ministers and officers  both civil and military      I might here also have added a fourth prerogative  which must   have been capitally eversive of the constitution  had it not been   limited in the original trust I mean a power of granting pardon   to criminals  Had this power been unrestrained  all obligations   to justice might be absolved at
