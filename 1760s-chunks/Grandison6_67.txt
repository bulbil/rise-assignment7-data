her  I suppose  than he does before me     166 The widow had a plain  diligent  honest man  before  She has what is called taste  forsooth  or believes she has  She thinks Mr  Grandison a finer gentleman than him who left her in a condition to be thougbt worthy of the address of a gayer man  She prides herself  it seems  in the relation that her marriage will give her to a man of Sir Charles Grandison s character  Much worse reasons will have weight  when a woman finds herself inclined to change her condition  But Everard is very earnest that my brother should know nothing of the matter till all is over  So you  as I  have this piece of news in confidence  Lady L  has not been told it  His cousin  he says  who refused him his interest with Miss Mansfield  Lady W s sister  because he thought a further time of probation  with regard to his avowed good resolutions  necessary  would perhaps  for the widow s sake  if applied to  put a spoke in his wheel   Everard  I can hardly allow myself to call him Grandison  avows a vehement passion for the widow  She is rich —When they are set out together in taste  as she calls it  trade  or business  her first rise  quite forgot  what a gay  what a frolick dance will she and her new husband  in a little while  lead up  on the grave of her poor  plain  despised one    Tis well   tis well  my dear Harriet  that I have a multitude of faults myself  Witness  to go no further back  this Letter  or I should despise nine parts of the world out of ten   I find that Sir Charles  and Beauchamp  and Dr  Bartlett  correspond  Light is hardly more active than my brother  nor lightning more quick  when he has any thing to execute that must or ought to be done  I believe I told you early  that was a part of his character  You must not then wonder  or be offended  Shall I use the word offended  my dear   that you  in your turn  now he has found himself at liberty to address you  should be affected by his adroitness   167 and vivacity in your Femalities  as uncle Selby calls them  Aptly enough  I think  tho  I do not love that men should be so impudent  as either to find us out  or abuse us  You cannot always  were you to think him too precipitating  separate bad qualities from good in the same person  since  perhaps  the one is the constitutional occasion of the other  Could he  for example  be half so useful a friend as he is  if he were to dream over a Love affair  as you would seem to have him  in other words  gape over his ripened fruit till it dropt into his yaw yaw yawning mouth  He ll certainly get you  Harriet  within  or near  his proposed time  Look about you  He ll have you  before you know where you are  By book  as the saying is  will he pull you to him  struggle as you will  he has already got hold of you  or by crook  inviting  nay compelling you  by his generosity  gentle shepherdlike  to nymph as gentle  What you do  therefore  do with such a grace as may preserve to you the appearance of having it in your power to lay an obligation upon him  It is the opinion of both his sisters  that he values you more for your noble expansion of heart  and not ignorant  but generous frankness of manners  yet mingled with dignity  than for—even—your Beauty  Harriet—Whether you  who are in such full possession of every grace of person  care  as a woman  to hear of that  or not  His gay parterre similitude you remember  my dear  It is my firm belief  that those are the greatest admirers of fine flowers  who love to see them in their borders  and seldomest pluck the fading fragrance  The other wretches crop  put them in their bosoms  and in an hour or two  rose  carnation  or whatever  after one parting smell  throw them away   He is very busy  where ever he is  At his inn  I suppose  most  But he boasts not to you  or anybody  of what he does   He writes now and then a Letter to aunt Nell  and   168 she is so proud of the favour—Look you here  niece  Look you here —But I sha n t shew you all he writes —On go the spectacles—for she will not for the world part with the Letter out of her hands —She reads one paragraph  one sentence  then another—On and off go the spectacles  while she conjectures  explains  animadverts  applauds  and so goes on till she leaves not a line unread  Then folding it up carefully in its cover  puts it in her Letter or Ribband case  which shall I call it  For having
