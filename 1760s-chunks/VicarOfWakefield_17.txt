upon this occasion in a very coarse manner  when she observed  that by the living jingo  she was all of a muck of sweat  Upon our return to the house  we found a very elegant cold supper  which Mr  Thornhill had ordered to be brought  Page  84  with him  The conversation at this time was more reserved than before  The two ladies threw my girls quite into the shade  for they would talk of nothing but high life  and high lived company  with other fashionable topics  such as pictures  taste  Shakespear  and the musical glasses   Tis true they once or twice mortified us sensibly by slipping out an oath  but that appeared to me as the surest symptom of their distinction   tho  I am since informed swearing is now perfectly unfashionable   Their finery  however  threw a veil over any grossness in their conversation  My daughters seemed to regard their superior accomplishments with envy  and what appeared amiss was ascribed to tip top quality breeding  But the condescension of the ladies was still superior to their other accomplishments  One of them observed  that had miss Olivia seen a little more of the world  it would greatly improve her  To which the other added  that a single winter in town would make her little Sophia quite another thing  My wife warmly assented to both  adding   Page  85  that there was nothing she more ardently wished than to give her girls a single winter s polishing  To this I could not help replying  that their breeding was already superior to their fortune  and that greater refinement would only serve to make their poverty ridiculous  and give them a taste for pleasures they had no right to possess —   And what pleasures    cried Mr  Thornhill    do they not deserve  who have so much in their power to bestow  As for my part    continued he    my fortune is pretty large  love  liberty  and pleasure  are my maxims  but curse me if a settlement of half my estate could give my charming Olivia pleasure  it should be hers  and the only favour I would ask in return would be to add myself to the benefit    I was not such a stranger to the world as to be ignorant that this was the fashionable cant to disguise the insolence of the basest proposal  but I made an effort to suppress my resentment    Sir    cried I    the family which you now condescend  Page  86  to favour with your company  has been bred with as nice a sense of honour as you  Any attempts to injure that  may be attended with very dangerous consequences  Honour  Sir  is our only possession at present  and of that last treasure we must be particularly careful    —I was soon sorry for the warmth with which I had spoken this  when the young gentleman  grasping my hand  swore he commended my spirit  though he disapproved my suspicions    As to your present hint    continued he  I protest   nothing was farther from my heart than such a thought  No  by all that s tempting  the virtue that will stand a regular siege was never to my taste  for all my amours are carried by a coup de main      The two ladies  who affected to be ignorant of the rest  seemed highly displeased with this last stroke of freedom  and began a very discreet and serious dialogue  Page  87  upon virtue  in this my wife  the chaplain  and I  soon joined  and the  Squire himself was at last brought to confess a sense of sorrow for his former excesses  We talked of the pleasures of temperance  and the sun shine in the mind unpolluted with guilt  I was well pleased that my little ones were kept up beyond the usual time to be edified by such good conversation  Mr  Thornhill even went beyond me  and demanded if I had any objection to giving prayers  I joyfully embraced the proposal  and in this manner the night was passed in a most comfortable way  till at last the company began to think of returning  The ladies seemed very unwilling to part from my daughters  for whom they had conceived a particular affection  and joined in a request to have the pleasure of their company home  The  Squire seconded the proposal  and my wife added her entreaties  the girls too looked upon me as if they wished to go  In this perplexity I  Page  88  made two or three excuses  which my daughters as readily removed  so that at last I was obliged to give a peremptory refusal  for which we had nothing but sullen looks and short answers the whole day ensuing   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  X   The family endeavours to cope with their betters  The miseries of the poor when they attempt to appear above their circumstances   I Now began to find that all my long and painful lectures upon temperance  simplicity  and contentment  were entirely disregarded  The distinctions lately paid us by our betters awaked that pride which I had laid asleep  but
