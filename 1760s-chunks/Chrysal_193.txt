THB HISTORY OP THE BTJLGABIAN SOLDIEK â€” CHBYSAL IS CABBIBD TO   HIS DESTINED MASTER     The Bulgarian was unable to express his gratitude for this charity    the manner of presenting which doubled the obligation of it  But   the big tear that stole in silence down his manly cheek as he bowed   his head to his benefactor  spoke it with a more affecting eloquence   than any words could do  and influenced every person present so   much in his favour  as to make them vie in offering him their assist    ance  As soon as he recovered utterance â€”   Such    said he    is the   noble benevolence that distinguishes the sons of liberty   such the   generosity of heart that always extends the ready hand of a Briton    with relief to the distressed  May Heaven preserve to your happy   nation the blessings which enable it to exert its virtues  to make   them a blessing to all who want their assistance  And though envy   may malign  and ingratitude return benefits with evil  beneficence   finds its reward in its own exertion  in the certainty of a retribution   from those treasures which never fail        The turn of this soldier s discourse  and particularly the last part   of it  seemed so much above his present appearance  that it raised   a curiosity in his benefactor to ask him if he had been bred to arms    or how long he had professed the military life  and in what station        Oh  sir    replied he  with a sigh that seemed to tear his heart      your question recalls to my memory scenes that I would willingly   forget for ever  and obliges me to relate such things as would draw   tears from Tartars  Pandours  or the crueller soldiers of the King of   France  I was not bred to arms  nor have I followed the military   profession long  or in any other rank than that which rage and   despair first placed me in  when I ofiered myself to my sovereign   to repel the invaders  and revenge the desolation of my bleeding         216 ADVENTURES OP A GUINEA     country  My unhappy story is no more than this  â€” I am a native   of Bulgaria  the son of a minister of the Gospel  who  obserYing a   desire of knowledge in my youth  encouraged and improved it by   his own precepts and example  and led my studious mind through   the sublimest paths of science        As soon as he saw my resolutions sufficiently established to be   proof against the levity of youth and temptations of sense  he   yielded to my entreaties  and I was admitted into the sacred order   of which he was a member  and made the perfection of human   wisdom  the practice of piety and virtue under the direction of the   divine word  the business of my happy life  Happy  then  indeed     but now the recollection of that happiness aggravates my present   misery m  the irrecoverable loss of it  almost to despair  Aa the   religion of the benign Eedeemer of mankind does not enjoin im    possibilities by requiring us to eradicate passions which are the   essence of our nature  and whose indulgence  under the direction of   reason and virtue  is the end of our creation and the basis of our   being  and fulfils the first divine command  by continuing our   species  and increasing the number of His adorers  I obeyed the   impulse of virtuous love  and married the daughter of a neigh    bouring divine  who completed to me  as I vainly thought  the sum of   human happiness by a numerous offspring  which grew upon the knee   of their aged grandsire  my father  now become too feeble for the   active duties  while my labours supplied the necessaries of life to   my contented family  in which I thus stood the happy centre of   filial and paternal love        In this blissful state did I advance toward heaven  when envy   of his glory and fear of his virtues brought this destructive war   upon the dominions of our sovereign  Oh  my father   my chil    dren   my wife   in one day did I lose you all  These eyes beheld   my habitation reduced to ashes  my children massacred in the   wantonness of cruelty  in despite of the prayers of my aged father    whose snow white hairs  whose whole appearance would have   struck the ruthless hearts of the ancient heathen Gauls with rever    ence   in despite of the cries of my beauteous wife  who both begged   to draw their fury on themselves  from the defenceless
