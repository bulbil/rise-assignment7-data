complexion  He not only acted the reformer  or rather the  castigator  in the fashionable world  but also exercised his  talents among the inferior class of people  who chanced to incur his  displeasure  One mischievous plan that entered our hero s imagination  was suggested by two advertisements published in the same paper  by  persons who wanted to borrow certain sums of money  for which they  promised to give undeniable security  Peregrine  from the style and  manner of both  concluded they were written by attorneys  a species of  people for whom he entertained his uncle s aversion  In order to amuse  himself and some of his friends with their disappointment  he wrote  a letter signed A  B  to each advertiser  according to the address  specified in the newspaper  importing  that if he would come with his  writings to a certain coffee house near the Temple  precisely at six in  the evening  he would find a person sitting in the right hand box next  to the window  who would be glad to treat with him about the subject of  his advertisement  and  should his security be liked  would accommodate  him with the sum which he wanted to raise  Before the hour of this  double appointment  Pickle  with his friend Cadwallader  and a few more  gentlemen  to whom he had thought proper to communicate the plan  went  to the coffee house  and seated themselves near the place that was  destined for their meeting   The hope of getting money had such an evident effect upon their  punctuality  that one of them arrived a considerable time before the  hour  and having reconnoitred the room  took his station according to  the direction he had received  fixing his eye upon a dock that stood  before him  and asking of the barkeeper  if it was not too slow  He     6 22 15  3 45 PM   had not remained in this posture many minutes  when he was joined by a  strange figure that waddled into the room  with a bundle of papers in  his bosom  and the sweat running over his nose  Seeing a man in the box  to which he had been directed  he took it for granted that he was the  lender  and as soon as he could recover his breath  which was almost  exhausted by the despatch he had made   Sir   said he   I presume  you are the gentleman I was to meet about that loan   Here he was  interrupted by the other  who eagerly replied   A  B   sir  I suppose     The same   cried the last comer   I was afraid I should be too late   for I was detained beyond my expectation by a nobleman at the other end  of the town  that wants to mortgage a small trifle of his estate  about  a thousand a year  and my watch happens to be in the hands of the maker   having met with an accident a few nights ago  which set it asleep   But  howsomever  there is no time lost  and I hope this affair will be  transacted to the satisfaction of us both  For my own part  I love to do  good offices myself  and therefore I expect nothing but what is fair and  honest of other people    His new friend was exceedingly comforted by this declaration  which he  considered as a happy omen of his success  and the hope of fingering  the cash operated visibly in his countenance  while he expressed his  satisfaction at meeting with a person of such candour and humanity   The  pleasure   said he   of dealing with an easy conscientious man is  in my  opinion  superior to that of touching all the money upon earth  for what  joy can be compared with what a generous mind feels in befriending its  fellow creatures  I was never so happy in my life  as at one time  in  lending five hundred pounds to a worthy gentleman in distress  without  insisting upon rigid security  Sir  one may easily distinguish an  upright man by his countenance  for example now  I think I could  take your word for ten thousand pounds   The other  with great joy   protested  that he was right in his conjecture  and returned the  compliment a thousand fold  by which means  the expectation of both was  wound up to a very interesting pitch  and both  at the same instant   began to produce their papers  in the untying of which their hands shook  with transports of eagerness and impatience  while their eyes were so  intent upon their work  that they did not perceive the occupation of  each other   At length  one of them  having got the start of the other  and unrolled  several skins of musty parchment  directed his view to the employment of  his friend  and  seeing him fumbling at his bundle  asked if that was  a blank bond and conveyance which he had brought along with him
