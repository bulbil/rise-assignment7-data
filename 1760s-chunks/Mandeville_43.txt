farms are in the hands of a few men  to whom the sons of the old tenants are either forced to be servants  or to leave the country to get their bread elsewhere  The village  large and once populous  is reduced to about eight families  a dreary silence reigns over their deserted fields  the farm houses  once the seats of chearful smiling industry  now useless  are falling in ruins around him  his tenants are merchants and ingrossers  proud  lazy  luxurious  insolent  and spurning the hand which feeds them            1 223          Yesterday one of them went off largely in his debt  I took that occasion of pressing him on his most vulnerable side  and remonstrating the danger of trusting so much of his property in one hand  but I am afraid all I can say will have no effect  as he has  by this narrow selfish plan  a little encreased his rents at present  which is all he has in view  without extending his thoughts to that future time  when this wretched policy  by depopulating the country  will lower the price of all the fruits of the earth  and lessen  in consequence  the value of his estate        With all my friendship for Lord T      I cannot help observing in him another fault greatly below his rank and understanding  I mean a despicable kind of pride  which measures worth by the gifts of fortune  of which the largest portion is too often in the hands of the least deserving        His treatment of some gentlemen  whose fortunes were unequal to their birth and merit          1 224       yesterday  at his table  almost determined me to leave his house  I expostulated warmly  though not impolitely  with him on the subject  and almost got him to confess his error  My friendship for him makes me feel sensibly what must lessen his character in the eyes of all whose esteem is desirable  I wish him to pass a month at Belmont  that he may see dignity without pride  and condescension without meanness  that he may see virtue in her loveliest form  and acknowledge her genuine beauty   I am  my Lord   c    H  Mandeville           1 225         To George Mordaunt  Esq   Friday      I Have past a tedious fortnight at Lord T     s  without tasting any pleasure but that of talking of Lady Julia  with some ladies in the neighbourhood who know her  I estimate the merit of those I converse with  by the distinction of being known to her  those who are so happy as to be of her acquaintance have  in my eye  every charm  that polished wit or elegant knowledge can give  those who want that advantage scarce deserve the name of human beings  all conversation  of which she is not the subject  is lifeless and insipid  all of which she is  brilliant and divine        My Lord rallies me on my frequent visits to these Ladies  and  as one of them is extremely handsome  supposes it a beginning passion  the Lady herself  I am          1 226       afraid  is deceived  for  as she is particularly warm in her praises of Lady Julia  my eyes sparkle with pleasure at her approach  I single her out in every company  and dance with her at all our little parties  I have even an attention to her superior to that of common lovers  and feel for her a tenderness for which I want a name      Lady Anne has had the goodness to write twice to me  from Lord Rochdale s  whither my Lord went  with his amiable family  two days after I left Belmont  Lady Julia is well  she loves me  she hears of me with pleasure  Ought I at present to wish more        I have hinted to Lord T    my purpose  though not the dear motive which inspired it  he is warmly my friend  if there is truth in man  I will be more explicite the first time I see him alone  shall I own to you one weakness of my heart  I would be          1 227       served by any interest but Lord Belmont s  How can I pretend to his daughter  if all I have is  in a manner  his gift  I would be rich independently of his friendship      Lord T    is walking in the garden alone  I will go to him  and explain all my designs  his knowledge of mankind will guide me to the best road to wealth and honor  his friendship will assist me to the ample extent of his power  Adieu
