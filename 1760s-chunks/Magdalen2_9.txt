thing broken off while I was flattering my imagination with the happiness my family was to posses—to find the rupture also so dishonourable to us  and to think that a sister  who was my principal pride  should be guilty of such a crime  made me absolutely mad  so that I almost wonder how I refrained from   49 shooting Sir Robert through the head before I even offered him the choice of a pistol     Notwithstanding the colonel s seeming frankness  I could easily see he was secretly dissatisfied that he had not been consulted by his father in the conclusion of our accommodation  When the old gentlemen told him what he had consented to  he was extremely grave  and observed    That to be sure it was better to settle matters any how  than to think of going farther with family resentments   The tone and look with which he delivered this were visibly sarcastic  and I could  however  readily perceive he somewhat disconcerted his father  We took no notice of the expression  however  lady Haversham thinking with me  that those may be allowed to complain a little who feel a great deal  Dinner being ready by this   50 time  we took our leave of the colonel  and sat down in a very sociable manner to a very good repast  Your sister was all life  and Mrs  Mildmay  who has been a very fine woman  was animated with a chearfulness that really filled me with pleasure  as  from the character lady Haversham gave me of her worth  I could not but share very sensibly in her afflictions     In short  we were all extremely happy but Miss Beauclerk  This young lady  who ought to be the gayest person in company  was remarkably thoughtful and reserved  she scarcely touched a morsel of any thing  and even more than once let a sigh escape her pretty audible  she is a very fine girl indeed  Harold  and  if she is but half as good as she is handsome  it would be ten thousand pities that any thing should give her the least uneasiness  You cannot conceive how   51 excessively I am taken with her—there is so much real good sense  so much genuine delicacy  and so much true benevolence in every word and action  that was it possible for me ever to marry a second time  or possible for her to look on such an old fellow  I really believe she would be the woman in the world whom I should first think of—but what have I do with the sex  In my youth I lost the woman of my heart—When I last saw her she was just such another young creature as this Miss Beauclerk  all beauty and beneficence  all sensibility and love  Miss Beauclerk has in fact her very form  her very face  the same irresistable sweetness of voice  and elegance of manner which once distinguished my Nancy  and which  though long since buried in the grave  have been continually present to my imagination  Be good natured  Harold  and bear with me a little on this tender subject—You   52 know I seldom break out  and therefore may now and then be entitled to a little indulgence  especially as I am always so ready to put up with your everlasting impertinence   The ladies retiring a little after dinner  and leaving Mr  Mildmay and I to chat over a bottle of Burgundy  I took the liberty to make some enquiry about Miss Beauclerk  assuring the old gentleman that I was strongly prepossessed in her favour —   Why truly  Mr  Melmoth   returned he   I don t know a sweeter  better tempered girl in the world than this young lady  my Louisa and she contracted an intimacy at the boarding school  when they were both very young  and have ever since been remarkably distinguished for the closeness of their friendship  the one never knowing joy or a sorrow in which the other did not   53 immediately enhance the satisfaction  or mitigate the distress  I am sure  in the late unhappy affair  my daughter s misfortune affected Miss Beauclerk as closely as if Louisa had actually been her sister—During the time of her being here  she has applied herself with such assiduity to comfort and take care of my poor wife  that I consider her as a principal instrument in Mrs  Mildmay s preservation—Her mother  Sir  lost her husband while Harriot was yet an infant at the breast  he died it seems in the East Indies  and left the good lady in such very slender circumstances  that  had not a relation of her own  who died also about the same time  left her a fortune of 20000l  in the funds  she must have gone into some little way of business for the maintenance of herself and her daughter  Upon the interest of this sum she keeps a carriage  and   54 has a most delightful retirement about thirty miles off—What is extremely remarkable  is  that  though she was not much above twenty when her husband died  and when she came into possession of this fortune  yet  so far from acting like the generality of women  and listening to the addresses of every coxcomb who might have designs either upon her person or her purse  she retired
