 to write two sheets without naming Lady Julia  She is well  and beautiful as an angel  we have a ball to night on Lord Melvin s          1 238       return  against which she is putting on all her charms  We shall be at Belmont tomorrow  which is two or three days sooner than my Lord intended      Lady Julia dances with Lord Melvin  who is  except two  the most amiable man I know  she came up just as I sat down to write  and looked as if she had something to say  she is gone  however  without a word  her childish bashfulness about you is intolerable        The ball waits for us  I am interrupted by an extreme pretty fellow  Sir Charles Mellifont  who has to night the honor of my hand     A  Wilmot           1 239         To Lady Anne Wilmot       WE have a ball to night on Lord Melvin s return  against which she is putting on all her charms         Oh  Lady Anne  can you indeed know what it is to love  yet play with the anxiety of a tender heart  I can scarce bear the thoughts of her looking lovely in my absence  or in any eyes but mine  how then can I support the idea of her endeavouring to please another  of her putting on all her charms to grace the return of a man  young  amiable  rich  noble  and the son of her father s friend  a thousand fears  a thousand conjectures torment me  should she love another    the possibility distracts me     Go to her  and ask her if the tenderest  most exalted passion  if the man who          1 240       adores her    I know not what I would say    you have set me on the rack    If you have pity  my dearest Lady Anne  lose not a moment to make me easy       Yours   c  H  Mandeville         The End of the First Volume            2 1       The   HISTORY   of   Lady JULIA MANDEVILLE      Volume II      To Miss Howard   Belmont  Tuesday      O Emily  How inconsistent is a heart in love  I entreated Mr  Mandeville not to write to me  and am chagrined at his too exact obedience  I think  if he loved as I do  he could not so easily obey me  He writes to Lady Anne  and  though by my desire           2 2       I am ashamed of my weakness     but I wish he wrote less often  there is an air of gaiety in his letters which offends me    He talks of balls  of parties with ladies    Perhaps I am unjust  but the delicacy of my love is wounded by his knowing a moment s pleasure in my absence  to me all places are equal where he is not  all amusements without him are dull and tasteless  Have not I an equal right to expect  Emily  He knows not how I love him      Convinced that this mutual passion is the designation of Heaven to restore him to that affluence he lost by the partiality of an ancestor and the generous loyalty of his family  I give way to it without reserve  I regard my love as a virtue  I am proud of having distinguished his merit without those trappings of wealth  which alone can attract common eyes  His idea is for ever before me  I think with transport of those enchanting moments          2 3          Emily  that week of tender confidence is all my life  the rest is not worth numbering in my existence      My father to night gives a ball to Lord Melvin  with whom I am again  unwillingly  obliged to dance  I wish not to dance at all  to make this sacrifice to the most beloved of men  Why have I not courage to avow my sentiments  to declare he alone    This Lord Melvin too  I know not why  but I never see him without horror        O Emily  How do all men sink on the comparison  He seems of a superior rank of beings  Your Julia will never give her hand to another  she swears this to the dear bosom of friendship        This detested Lord Melvin is at the door  he will not let me proceed  he tells me it is to a lover I am writing
