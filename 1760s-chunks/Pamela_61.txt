a basket  to cheer our hearts now   and then  when we got together  as she said  And I kissed all the maids   again  and shook hands with the men again  but Mr  Jonathan and Mr    Longman were not there  and then I tripped down the steps to the   chariot  Mrs  Jervis crying most sadly       I looked up when I got to the chariot  and I saw my master at the   window  in his gown  and I courtesied three times to him very low  and   prayed for him with my hands lifted up  for I could not speak  indeed I   was not able  And he bowed his head to me  which made me then very glad   he would take such notice of me  and in I stepped  and was ready to   burst with grief  and could only  till Robin began to drive  wave my   white handkerchief to them  wet with my tears  and  at last  away he   drove  Jehu like  as they say  out of the court yard  And I too soon   found I had cause for greater and deeper grief       Well  said I to myself  at this rate I shall soon be with my dear father   and mother  and till I had got  as I supposed  half way  I thought of   the good friends I had left  And when  on stopping for a little bait   to the horses  Robin told me I was near half way  I thought it was high   time to wipe my eyes  and think to whom I was going  as then  alack for   me  I thought  So I began to ponder what a meeting I should have with   you  how glad you d both be to see me come safe and innocent to you    after all my dangers  and so I began to comfort myself  and to banish   the other gloomy side from my mind  though  too  it returned now and   then  for I should be ungrateful not to love them for their love       Well  I believe I set out about eight o clock in the morning  and I   wondered and wondered  when it was about two  as I saw by a church dial    in a little village as we passed through  that I was still more and more   out of my knowledge  Hey day  thought I  to drive this strange pace  and   to be so long a going a little more than twenty miles  is very odd  But   to be sure  thought I  Robin knows the way       At last he stopped  and looked about him  as if he was at a loss for the   road  and I said  Mr  Robert  sure you are out of the way   I m afraid I   am  said he  But it can t be much  I ll ask the first person I see  Pray   do  said I  and he gave his horses a mouthful of bay  and I gave him   some cake  and two glasses of Canary wine  and stopt about half an hour   in all  Then he drove on very fast again       I had so much to think of  of the dangers I now doubted not I had   escaped  of the loving friends I had left  and my best friends I was   going to  and the many things I had to relate to you  that I the less   thought of the way  till I was startled out of my meditations by the sun   beginning to set  and still the man driving on  and his horses sweating   and foaming  and then I began to be alarmed all at once  and called to   him  and he said he had horrid ill luck  for he had come several miles   out of the way  but was now right  and should get in still before it was   quite dark  My heart began then to misgive me a little  and I was very   much fatigued  for I had no sleep for several nights before  to signify    and at last I said  Pray Mr  Robert  there is a town before us  what   do you call it   If we are so much out of the way  we had better put up   there  for the night comes on apace  And  Lord protect me  thought I    I shall have new dangers  mayhap  to encounter with the man  who have   escaped the master  little thinking of the base contrivance of the   latter   Says he  I am just there   Tis but a mile on one side of the   town before us   Nay  said I  I may
