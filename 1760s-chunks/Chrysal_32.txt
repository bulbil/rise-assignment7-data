matter  and am not accotmtable for what she says or you think    sir   and I suppose if your cousin is not a fool she has not given   her money without something to show for it  But you must excuse   my talking any longer on so idle a subject   and so  sir  your servant        The mine was now sprung  and I waited with impatience for the   event  As to her demand  I knew she could never support it  as   there was no person present when she gave me the notes   and I   had negotiated them in a manner beyond all possibility of their   being traced          14 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     While I was hugging myself in this security  the friends of Amelia    persuaded her to bring a bill in Chancery against me  in which the   whole afiair was set forth without any exaggeration  But this I   made light of  as I had my lawyer ready  under whose directions   I swore such an answer that set her charge entirely aside  Elate   with this success  I thought this the time to pursue my victory    and wrote her a letter  in which I attributed everything of my con    duct of late that might have surprised her to love  and despair of   obtaining her by any other method   and offered her a settlement   above the demand she had made on me if she would consent to   my desires  This I wrote in such general terms that my letter   could not be brought in evidence against me  and the largeness of   the offer was only to decoy her into a treaty  there being nothing   further from my thoughts than ever to make her independent of   my pleasure      This insult only added new fuel to her resentment  and all the   answer I received was by another bill   but this met the same fate    by the same methods  as the former      After this I heard no more of Amelia for some time   but what   was my astonishment when I was informed that she had sold off   her jewels and other little effects  and was gone to a relation of her s   who lived in Jamaica   This broke all my designs   and despair   of ever obtaining her awoke my love  and aggravated my remorse   for my ill usage of her almost to madness      From this time the hand of Heaven seemed to be upon me     everything I had any concern in miscarried   and  to hasten my   ruin  my house was a perfect sink of riot and debauchery   my   wife  as she had no charms to excite desire  in a manner publicly   purchasing the gratification of her lusts at the most extravagant   expense  and living in a profusion that must destroy even a royal   fortune      Mine  great as it had been  sank under so many dissipations of all   kinds   and I had no resource left  as I said before  but in precipitate   flight  which Heaven made my passion for Amelia direct for Jamaica   to mark the justice of its vengeance the more plainly          CHAPTER VI     â  OONOLTTSION OF THE HISTORY OE TRASmC â€” HE ABBtVES AT JAMAICA   WHERE HE LEARNS THAT AMELIA HAD BEEN TAKEN BY THE SPAN     lABDS â€” HE TURNS BUCCANEER  AND RAVAGES THE SPANISH COASTS    WHERE HE PINDS AMELIA â€” JUST AS HE IS GOING TO SEIZE HEB   HE IS TAKEN PRISONER BY HER HUSBAND â€” HE IS CONDEMNED TO   DIB â€” HE SUES TO AMELIA JOR MBBOY   SHE REJECTS HIM WITH   ABHORRENCE â€” HIS PUNISHMENT IS CHANGED IBOM DEATH TO THE   MINES     I HAD hitherto varnished over my villainies with hypocrisy  and      strove to preserve some appearance  at least  of virtue   but this     as a restraint no longer possible  nor indeed profitable to me now         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA IS     when my flight took ofE the veil  and alarmed all mankind against   me   so that mine was really a state of war with all the world      On my arrival in Jamaica  I had the addition to my grief to find   that Amelia had been taken in her passage thither by a Spanish   privateer      This drove me to despair  I was wearied of life   but resolved   not to die unrevenged on those who had thus  as I thought  robbed   me of my hopes   never reflecting on the improbability of her   hearkening to my suit      Burning with this project
