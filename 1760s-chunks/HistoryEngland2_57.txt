brought in a bill to limit th number of play houses  to subject all dramatic writings to the inspection of the Lord Chamberlain  whos license was to be obtained before any work could ap¦pear  Among those who undertook to oppose thi bill  was the Earl of Chesterfield  who observed tha the laws already in being for keeping the stage withi due bounds  were every way sufficient    If  says heour stage players at any time exceed those bounds  they ough to be prosecuted  and may be punished  A new law there¦fore is  in the present instance  unnecessary  and every un¦necessary law is dangerous  Wit  my Lords  is the pro¦perty of those that have it  and it is too often the only pro¦perty they have  It is unjust therefore to rob a man at a…  153rate of his possessions  but it is cruelty to spoil him  if already poor  If poets and players are to be restrained  let them be restrained like other subjects  let them be tried by their Peers  and let not a Lord Chamberlain be made the sovereign judge of wit  A power lodged in the hands of a single man to determine  without limitation or appeal  is a privilege unknown to our laws  and inconsistent with our constitution    The house applauded his wit and eloquence  and the question was carried against him     The discontents occasioned by such proceedings at home  were still more increased by the depredations of the Spaniards  They disputed the right of the English to cut logwood in the Bay of Campeachy in America  a right which had been often acknowledged  but never clearly explained  in all former treaties between the two kingdoms  Their Guarda Costas plundered the English merchants with impunity  and  upon the least resistance  behaved with insolence  cruelty  and rapine  The subjects of Britain were buried in the mines of Potosi  deprived of all means of conveying their complaints to their protectors  and their vessels confiscated  in defiance of justice  The English court made frequent remonstrances to that of Madrid  of this outrageous violation of treaties  and they received for answer only promises of inquiry  which produced no reformation  Our merchants loudly complained of these outrages  but the minister expected  from negotiation  that redress which could only be obtained by arms  He knew that a war would increase the difficulties he had to encounter  and he was sensible that those he already encountered required all his art and industry to remove  A war  he was sensible  would require expences which he wished to share in peace  In short  all his measures now were not to serve the state  but to preserve his power  Influenced by these considerations  he industriously endcavoured to avoid a rupture  The fears he discovered only served to   154 increase the enemies insolence and pride  However the complaints of the English merchants were loud enough to reach the house of commons  their letters and memorials were produced  and their grievances enforced at the bar by council  The house  at length  agreed to an address  to intreat his Majesty to obtain effectual relief  and to convince Spain that its indignities would be no longer borne with impunity  These complaints produced a convention between the two crowns  concluded at Prado  importing  that two plenipotentiaries should meet at Madrid  to regulate the respective pretensions of either kingdom  respecting the trade in America  and the limits of Florida and Carolina  These conferences were to be finished in eight months  and  in the mean time  all hostile preparations should cease on either side  His Catholic Majesty agreed to pay the King of Great Britain ninety five thousand pounds  to satisfy the demands of the British subjects upon the crown of Spain  after deducting from the whole the demands of the crown and subjects of Spain upon that of Britain  Such an agreement as this was justly regarded on the side of the British ministry as a base desertion of the honour and interests of their country  And when the house of commons came to take the convention under consideration  it produced the warmest debate  All the adherents to the Prince of Wales had joined in the opposition  It was alledged  that the Spaniards  instead of granting a redress  had rather extorted a release for their former conduct  That they still asserted their former right to searching English ships  and had not so much as mentioned the word satisfaction in all the treaty  Notwithstanding all the remonstrances against this treaty  the majority of the house declared in its favour  and several members of the opposite sentiment retired from parliament  having despaired of being longer   155 serviceable in a place where party  and not reason  prevailed   As Spain had engaged to pay a large sum of money by this convention  some time after  when the minister demanded a supply  upon a different occasion  Lord Bathurst moved to know  whether Spain had paid the sums stipulated  as the time limited for the payment was expired  The Duke of Newcastle  by his Majesty s permission  acquainted the house  that it was not paid  and that Spain had assigned no reason for the delay  In some measure  therefore  to atone for his former slowness  the minister now began to
