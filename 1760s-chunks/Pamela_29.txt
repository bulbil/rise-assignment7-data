the cheek    you seem born to undo  or to be undone       God forbid  and please your ladyship  said I  it should be either   I   beg  said I  to withdraw  for the sense I have of my unworthiness   renders me unfit for such a presence       I then went away  with one of my best courtesies  and Lady Towers said    as I went out  Prettily said  I vow   And Lady Brooks said  See that   shape  I never saw such a face and shape in my life  why  she must be   better descended than you have told me       And so they run on for half an hour more in my praises  as I was told    and glad was I  when I got out of the hearing of them       But  it seems  they went down with such a story to my master  and so   full of me  that he had much ado to stand it  but as it was very little   to my reputation  I am sure I could take no pride in it  and I feared   it would make no better for me  This gives me another cause for wishing   myself out of this house       This is Thursday morning  and next Thursday I hope to set out  for I   have finished my task  and my master is horrid cross  And I am vexed   his crossness affects me so  If ever he had any kindness towards me  I   believe he now hates me heartily       Is it not strange  that love borders so much upon hate  But this wicked   love is not like the true virtuous love  to be sure  that and hatred   must be as far off  as light and darkness  And how must this hate have   been increased  if he had met with such a base compliance  after his   wicked will had been gratified       Well  one may see by a little  what a great deal means  For if innocence   cannot attract common civility  what must guilt expect  when novelty   has ceased to have its charms  and changeableness had taken place of it    Thus we read in Holy Writ  that wicked Amnon  when he had ruined poor   Tamar  hated her more than he ever loved her  and would have turned her   out of door       How happy am I  to be turned out of door  with that sweet companion my   innocence   O may that be always my companion  And while I presume not   upon my own strength  and am willing to avoid the tempter  I hope the   divine grace will assist me       Forgive me  that I repeat in my letter part of my hourly prayer  I owe   every thing  next to God s goodness  to your piety and good examples  my   dear parents  my dear poor parents  I say that word with pleasure  for   your poverty is my pride  as your integrity shall be my imitation       As soon as I have dined  I will put on my new clothes  I long to have   them on  I know I shall surprise Mrs  Jervis with them  for she shan t   see me till I am full dressed   John is come back  and I ll soon send   you some of what I have written   I find he is going early in the   morning  and so I ll close here  that I am                                         Your most dutiful DAUGHTER       Don t lose your time in meeting me  because I am so uncertain  It is   hard if  some how or other  I can t get a passage to you  But may be   my master won t refuse to let John bring me  I can ride behind him  I   believe  well enough  for he is very careful  and very honest  and you   know John as well as I  for he loves you both  Besides  may be  Mrs    Jervis can put me in some way                LETTER XXIV         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I shall write on  as long as I stay  though I should have nothing but   silliness to write  for I know you divert yourselves on nights with   what I write  because it is mine  John tells me how much you long for
