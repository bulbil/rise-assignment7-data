me applaud to the world what my heart must internally condemn  Would you have me tamely sit down and flatter our infamous betrayer  and to avoid a prison continually suffer the more galling bonds of mental confinement  No  never  If we are to be taken from this abode  only let us hold to the right  and wherever we are thrown  we can still retire to a charming apartment  and look round our  Page  86  own hearts with intrepidity and with pleasure    In this manner we spent that evening  Early the next morning  as the snow had fallen in great abundance in the night  my son was employed in clearing it away  and opening a passage before the door  He had not been thus engaged long  when he came running in  with looks all pale  to tell us that two strangers  whom he knew to be officers of justice  were making towards the house     Just as he spoke they came in  and approaching the bed where I lay  after previously informing me of their employment and business  made me their prisoner  bidding me prepare to go with them to the county gaol  which was eleven miles off      My friends    said I    this is severe weather on which you have come to  Page  87  take me to a prison  and it is particularly unfortunate at this time  as one of my arms has lately been burnt in a terrible manner  and it has thrown me into a slight fever  and I want cloaths to cover me  and I am now too weak and and old to walk far in such deep snow  but if it must be so  I ll try to obey you    I then turned to my wife and children  and directed them to get together what few things were left us  and to prepare immediately for leaving this place  I entreated them to be expeditious  and desired my son to assist his elder sister  who  from a consciousness that she was the cause of all our calamities  was fallen  and had lost anguish in insensibility  I encouraged my wife  who  pale and trembling  clasped our affrighted little ones in her arms  that clung to her bosom in silence  dreading to  Page  88  look round at the strangers  In the mean time my youngest daughter prepared for our departure  and as she received several hints to use dispatch  in about an hour we were ready to depart     Page   unnumbered   CHAP  VI     No situation  however wretched it seems  but has some sort of comfort attending it     WE set forward from this peaceful neighbourhood  and walked on slowly  My eldest daughter being enfeebled by a slow fever  which had begun for some days to undermine her constitution  one of the officers  who had an horse  kindly took her behind him  for even these men cannot entirely divest themselves of humanity  My son led one of the little ones by the hand  and my wife the other  while I leaned upon my youngest girl  whose tears fell not for her own but my distresses     Page  90  We were now got from my late dwelling about two miles  when we saw a crowd running and shouting behind us  consisting of about fifty of my poorest parishioners  These  with dreadful imprecations  soon seized upon the two officers of justice  and swearing they would never see their minister go to gaol while they had a drop of blood to shed in his defence  were going to use them with great severity  The consequence might have been fatal  had I not immediately interposed  and with some difficulty rescued the officers from the hands of the enraged multitude  My children  who looked upon my delivery now as certain  appeared transported with joy  and were incapable of containing their raptures  But they were soon undeceived  upon hearing me address the poor deluded people  who came  as they imagined  to do me service     Page  91     What  my friends    cried I    and is this the way you love me  Is this the manner you obey the instructions I have given you from the pulpit  Thus to fly in the face of justice  and bring down ruin on yourselves and me  Which is your ringleader  Shew me the man that has thus seduced you  As sure as he lives he shall feel my resentment  Alas  my dear deluded flock  return back to the duty you owe to God  to your country  and to me  I shall yet perhaps one day see you in greater felicity here  and contribute to make your lives more happy  But let it at least be my comfort when I pen my fold for immortality  that not one here shall be wanting    They now seemed all repentance  and melting into tears  came one after the other to bid me farewell  I shook each tenderly by the hand  and leaving them my blessing  proceeded forward without meeting any  Page  92  farther interruption  Some
