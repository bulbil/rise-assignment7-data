of vindicating himself effectually  and desired the complainant   109 to compose herself but for half an hour  in which he undertook to prove the absurdity of believing in the power of incantations  which were only idle dreams of ignorance and superstition —He accordingly pronounced a very learned discourse upon the nature of ideas  the powers and independance of the mind  the properties of stimulating medicines  the difference between a proneness to venery  which many simples would create  and a passion limited to one object  which can only be the result of sense and reflection  and concluded with a pathetic remonstrance  setting forth his unhappiness of being persecuted with the resentment of a lady whom he had never injured  nor even seen before that occasion  and whose faculties were  in all likelihood  so much impaired by her misfortunes  that an innocent person was in danger of being ruined by her disorder —He had no sooner finished his harrangue  than the forlorn princess began her lamentations afresh  and cautioned the company against his eloquence  which  she said  was able to byass the most impartial bench in christendom —Banter advised him to espouse her immediately  as the only means to salve his reputation  and offered to accompany him to the Fleet for that purpose  but Slyboot proposed that a father should be purchased for the child  and a comfortable alimony settled on the mother  Ranter promised to adopt the infant gratis  Wagtail was ready to worship him for his generosity  and though he persisted in protesting his innocence  condescended to every thing rather than his unblemished character should be called in question —The lady rejected the expedient  and insisted on matrimony  Bragwell took up the cudgels for the doctor  and undertook   110 to rid him of her importunity  for half a guinea  upon which Wagtail  with great eagerness  pulled out his purse and put it into the hand of his friend  who taking half a piece out of it  gave it to the plaintiff  and bid her thank God for her good fortune  When she had received this bounty  she affected to weep  and begged  since the physician had renounced her  he would at least vouchsafe her a parting kiss  this he was prevailed upon to grant  with great reluctance  and went up  with his usual solemnity  to salute her  she laid hold of his cheek with her teeth and held fast  while he roared with anguish  to the unspeakable diversion of all present  When she thought proper to release him  she dropped a low courtesy to the company  and quitted the room  leaving the doctor in the utmost horror  not so much on account of the pain  as the apprehension of the consequence of the bite  for by this time  he was convinced of her being mad  Banter prescribed the actual cautery  and put the poker in the fire to be heated  in order to sear the place —The player was of opinion that Bragwell should scoop out the part affected with the point of his sword  but the painter prevented both these dreadful operations  by recommending a balsam he had in his pocket  which never failed to cure the bite of a mad dog  With these words  he pulled out a small bladder of black paint  with which he instantly anointed not only the sore  but the greatest part of the patient s face  and left it in a frightful condition —In short  the poor creature was so harrassed with fear and vexation  that I pitied him extremely  and sent him home in a chair  contrary to the inclination of every body present       111 This freedom of mine  gave umbrage to Bragwell  who testified his displeasure  by swearing a few threats  without making any application  which was no sooner perceived by Slyboot  who sat by me  than with a view of promoting a quarrel  he whispered to me  that he thought Bragwell used me very ill  but every man was the best judge of his own affairs —I answered aloud  that I would neither suffer Mr  Bragwell nor him to use me ill with impunity  and that I stood in no need of his counsel in regard to the regulation of my conduct —He thought proper to ask a thousand pardons  and assure me  he meant no offence  while Bragwell feigned himself asleep  that he might not be obliged to take notice of what passed —But the player  who had more animal spirits  and less prudence than Slyboot  unwilling to let the affair rest  where he had dropt it  jogged Mr  Bragwell  and told him softly  that I called him names  and threatned to cudgel him —This I understood by his starting up and crying     Blood and wounds  you lie—No man durst treat me so ignominiously —Mr  Random  did you call me names  and threaten to drub me    I denied the imputation  and proposed to punish the scoundrel  who endeavoured to foment disturbance in the company  Bragwell signified his approbation  and drew his sword  I did the same  and accosted the actor in these words    Lookee  Mr  Banter  I know you possess all the mimickry and mischievous qualities of an ape  because I have observed you put them all
