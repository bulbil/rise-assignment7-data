youngest  we are the Sons of two rich citizens at Placentia  Longing extremely to see the kingdom of Portugal  we have each of us begged a hundred pistoles from our friends  and are setting out to satisfy our curiosity  Travelling on foot as we do  we shall be able to get a good way with that supply  shall we not  What do you think of it  If I had as much  answered I  they might take me who could catch me  I would scour over the four known quarters of the globe  and then set out on new discoveries  Fire and fury  Two hundred pistoles  Why it is an entail for a dukedom  You ought to lay by out of the interest  If it is agreeable to you  gentlemen  I will club with you as far as Almeria  whither I am going to take possession of an estate left me by an uncle who was settled there for twenty years or upwards   My young cockneys testified at once the pleasure they should derive from my company  Whereupon  when we were all three a little refreshed  we trudged on towards Alcantara  where we arrived early in the afternoon  No inn but the best was fit to hold such guests  We asked for a room  and were shown into one where there was a press with a good strong lock upon it  Supper was ordered without delay  but as some time was required to get it ready  I proposed to my travelling companions a gentle saunter about the town  The party seemed perfectly agreeable  We locked up our knapsacks in the press  the key of which one of the citizens put in his pocket  and out sallied we from the inn  The churches were the best lions we met with in our way  and while we were gaping about the principal  I pretended to have recollected on a sudden some very urgent business  Gentlemen  said I to my companions  it has just come across me that a good man of Toledo gave me a commission to say two words on his behalf to a merchant who lives hard by this church  Have the goodness to wait for me here  I will be back in a moment  With this excuse  I went off like a shot  in the direction of our inn  The press was my point of attack    I forced the lock  ransacked the baggage of my young citizens  and laid a sacrilegious hand on their pistoles  Poor youths  How they were to pay their reckoning  it was not for me to presume even to guess  for most assuredly I stripped them of all the natural means  After this feat  I decamped as expeditiously as my legs could carry me from the town  and took the direction of Merida  without caring a curse what became of the young brood I had plucked   Such a windfall as this placed me in a condition of travelling merrily  Though in the very blush of youth  a certain forecast was not wanting to carry me discreetly through the world  and keep my head above water  It must be admitted without question  that I was a youth of forward parts for my age  and unfettered by the prejudices of innocence  I determined to buy a mule  and cheapened one at the first market town  My knapsack was metamorphosed into a portmanteau  and by degrees I began to put on the man of consequence  On the third day a man came across me singing vespers with lungs like a pair of bellows on the highway  By his air  he seemed to be a musician of the church establishment  and I accosted him accordingly  Well done  my holy howler of the hallelujahs  You sing your penitential ditties at a good jovial pitch  To all appearance you sol fa with your whole heart and soul  Good sir  replied he  I belong  with your good leave  to the musical department of the Catholic church  and it is my common practice to keep my devotion and my wind in play by the rehearsal of an anthem or two as I travel along the road   With this disposition to be sociable  we soon got into conversation  It was clear to me that I had fallen in with a character not to be despised in point of shrewdness  nor indisposed to society and merriment  He was four or five and  twenty  My companion being on foot  I slackened my pace  for the pleasure of chatting with him  Among other things  we talked about Toledo  I am perfectly well acquainted with that city  said the brazen lunged torturer of anthems  It was my residence for a considerable time  and my connections there are not altogether contemptible  And in what part of the town  interrupted I  did you reside  In the New Street  was his answer  I was hand in glove with Don Vincent de Buena Garra  Don Matthias de Cordello  and two or three other gentlemen of very considerable fashion  We lived together  took our meals at the same mess  and  in short  were scarcely ever asunder  It was a charming society  This avowal was no small surprise to me  for it is to be understood  that the gentlemen whose names he cited with
