for the present but their own industry  and knew  not how to defray their expenses on the road  except by some acquisition  of this kind   Next morning they rose at daybreak  and resolving to anticipate their  fellow lodgers  bespoke post horses as soon as they could be admitted  into the city  so that  when our company appeared  their beasts were  ready in the yard  and they only waited to discuss the bill  which they  had ordered to be made out  The landlord of the inn presented his carte  with fear and trembling to one of those ferocious cavaliers  who no  sooner cast his eye upon the sum total  than he discharged a volley of  dreadful oaths  and asked if the king s officers were to be treated in  that manner  The poor publican protested  with great humility  that he  had the utmost respect for his majesty  and everything that belonged to  him  and that  far from consulting his own interest  all that he desired  was  to be barely indemnified for the expense of their lodging   This condescension seemed to have no other effect than that of  encouraging their arrogance  They swore his extortion should be  explained to the commandant of the town  who would  by making him a  public example  teach other innkeepers how to behave towards men of  honour  and threatened with such confidence of indignation  that the  wretched landlord  dreading the consequence of their wrath  implored  pardon in the most abject manner  begging  with many supplications  that  he might have the pleasure of lodging them at his own charge  This was  a favour which he with great difficulty obtained  they chid him severely  for his imposition  exhorted him to have more regard for his own  conscience  as well as to the convenience of his guests  and  cautioning  him in particular touching his behaviour to the gentlemen of the army   mounted their horses  and rode off in great state  leaving him very  thankful for having so successfully appeased the choler of two officers   who wanted either inclination or ability to pay their bill  for  experience had taught him to be apprehensive of all such travellers  who  commonly lay the landlord under contribution  by way of atonement  for the extravagance of his demands  even after he has professed his  willingness to entertain them on their own terms   CHAPTER L    Peregrine moralizes upon their Behaviour  which is condemned by the  Doctor  and defended by the Governor  They arrive in safety at Lisle   dine at an Ordinary  visit the Citadel  The Physician quarrels with a  North Briton  who is put in Arrest   These honourable adventurers being gone  Peregrine  who was present  during the transaction  informed himself of the particulars from the  mouth of the innkeeper himself  who took Heaven and the saints to  witness  that he should have been a loser by their custom  even if  the bill had been paid  because he was on his guard against their    6 22 15  3 45 PM   objections  and had charged every article at an under price  but such  was the authority of officers in France  that he durst not dispute  the least circumstance of their will  for  had the case come under the  cognizance of the magistrate  he must  in course  have suffered by the  maxims of their government  which never fail to abet the oppression  of the army  and  besides  run the risk of incurring their future  resentment  which would be sufficient to ruin him from top to bottom   Our hero boiled with indignation at this instance of injustice and  arbitrary power  and  turning to his governor  asked  if this too was  a proof of the happiness enjoyed by the French people  Jolter replied   that every human constitution must  in some things  be imperfect and  owned  that in this kingdom  gentlemen were more countenanced than  the vulgar  because it was to be presumed that their own sentiments  of honour and superior qualifications would entitle them to this  pre eminence  which had also a retrospective view to the merit of their  ancestors  in consideration of which they were at first ennobled  but he  affirmed  that the innkeeper had misrepresented the magistracy  which   in France  never failed to punish flagrant outrages and abuse  without  respect of persons   The painter approved of the wisdom of the French government  in bridling  the insolence of the mob  by which  he assured them  he had often  suffered in his own person  having been often bespattered by  hackney coachmen  jostled by draymen and porters  and reviled in the  most opprobrious terms by the watermen of London  where he had once lost  his bag and a considerable quantity of hair  which had been cut off  by some rascal in his passage through Ludgate  during the Lord Mayor s  procession  On the other hand  the doctor with great warmth alleged   that those officers ought to suffer death  or banishment at least
