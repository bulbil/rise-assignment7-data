like to get a little sleep  I think  madam  you had better go to bed  said Mrs Lamb  I have a very quiet chamber ready  where no noise in the house can disturb you  Shew me to it  answered Mrs Gerrarde  with a tone of weariness and ill humour  The woman obeyed  I followed  she carried her to the door of the room where the maid was  and throwing it open  Mrs Gerrarde  who supposed she was attending her  went in  I stepped in after her  Mrs Lamb withdrew   Mrs Gerrarde’s astonishment at the sight of her maid  is past description  Rachael  in a tone of admiration  Rachael  who did not think there was any thing unexpected or extraordinary in their meeting  quite at a loss to guess at what her mistress wondered  answered her in her turn with some surprize  Madam  and waited  expecting she would give her some orders  which finding the lady did not  the maid asked her  very composedly  Would she please to undress  I hope  Madam  said I  stepping forward  that Mrs Rachael has taken care to bring you every thing you may have occasion for  I shall leave you in her hands  and wish you a good repose  Strange  astonishing creature  said Mrs Gerrarde  looking at me with less anger than surprize  I bowed  and left the room   I ordered Mrs Lamb to have an eye to my prisoners  and heartily tired as I was  between dancing and travelling  I undressed and threw myself into bed  I slept till six o’clock in the evening  then rose  and put myself into a habit fitter for my journey than that in which I came  and which I had sent in a post trunk before me  by the messenger whom I had employed to apprize Lamb of my coming   Mrs Gerrarde was not yet stirring  I called for Rachael  and asked    her how she had come off with her lady  upon telling her the manner of her falling into my snare  Rachael told me her lady wondered mightily at my art  and said I was the strangest gentleman that ever was born  My friend Rachael softened the expression I fancy  I am sure Mrs Gerrarde did not call me a strange gentleman  She said her mistress smiled two or three times at her relation  particularly at my giving her the keys  I found  upon the whole  that my conduct in securing to her her money and her jewels  together with the attendance of her maid  had a good deal appeased her resentment   Mrs Gerrarde did not rise till near eight o’clock  I had ordered as elegant a dinner as the house could afford  and the lady having put herself into a genteel dishabille  with great alacrity sat down to table  and did not appear to have fretted away her appetite  I would suffer no one to attend but Rachael  I told Mrs Gerrarde that I purposed setting out for Dover that night  and that as it could not be supposed her maid should be able to ride so far  and that a second carriage with four horses  as less might not be able to keep pace with us  would be liable to observation  I would  if she pleased  resign my place in the chariot to Mrs Rachael  and attend her myself on horseback  She answered me coldly  Since she must go  it was indifferent to her who was to be her companion  Though the motive I offered for this manner of travelling was not without its weight  yet my true reason was to avoid being boxed up so long again with Mrs Gerrarde  My time was not yet come for explanations  and I was afraid of being upon good terms with her too soon   The remainder of the evening was spent by her and her maid in carefully packing up their baggage  which had been brought in a confused huddle to the inn  Mrs Gerrarde had a convenient trunk bought at Rochester for the purpose  and assisted herself in laying them up safely   She equipped herself in a smart riding dress  and at eleven o’clock  without any great reluctance  permitted me to put her and her maid into the chariot  The inn had no company in it  at least that we saw  and our host was too discreet to let any of his servants be in the way  I mounted my horse  and triumphantly galloped off with my prize   We reached Dover early next morning  and immediately got on board the packet  The lady by this time appeared so perfectly serene  that I believe in my soul I should not have got rid of her  if I had desired her to have gone back again  but she had assumed a new air     and affected a fine tender melancholy in her countenance  I guessed at her thoughts  and found afterwards my conjecture right  Will you believe me  Sir George  when I tell you the baggage had formed serious honourable designs upon my person  Fact  upon my word  I saw it presently  you know my knack of reading people’s minds in their faces   and was not sorry for the discovery  for though
