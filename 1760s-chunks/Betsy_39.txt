brother had described  but not seeing him afterwards  nor hearing any   mention made of him  at least that she took notice of  the imagination   went out of her head       This account of him  however  brought to her memory every thing she had   observed concerning him  and was very well convinced she had seen   nothing  either in his person or deportment  that was not perfectly   agreeable  yet  not withstanding all this  and the high encomiums given   of him by a brother  who she knew would not deceive her  she was a   little vexed to find herself pressed by one so dear and so nearly   related to her  to think of him as a man she ever intended to marry  she   thought she could be pleased to have such a lover  but could not bring   herself to be content that he ever should be a husband  She had too   much good sense not to know it suited not with the condition of wife to   indulge herself in the gaieties she at present did  which though   innocent  and  as she thought  becoming enough in the present state she   now was  might not be altogether pleasing to one who  if he so thought   proper  had the power of restraining them  In fine  she looked upon a   serious behaviour as unsuitable to one of her years  and therefore   resolved not to enter into a condition which demanded some share of it    at least for a long time  that is  when she should be grown weary of the   admiration  flatteries  and addresses of the men  and no longer find any   pleasure in seeing herself preferred before all the women of her   acquaintance       Though it is certain that few young handsome ladies are without some   share of the vanity here described  yet it is to be hoped there are not   many who are possessed of it in that immoderate degree Miss Betsy was    It is  however  for the sake of those who are so  that these pages are   wrote  to the end they may use their utmost endeavours to correct that   error  as they will find it so fatal to the happiness of one who had   scarce any other blameable propensity in her whole composition       This young lady was full of meditation on her new conquest  and the   manner in which she should receive the victim  who was so shortly to   prostrate himself at the shrine of her beauty  when she heard somebody   run hastily up stairs  and go into Lady Mellasin s dressing room  which   being adjacent  as has been already taken notice of on a very remarkable   occasion  she stepped out of the chamber to see who was there  and found   Mrs  Prinks very busy at a cabinet  where her ladyship s jewels were   always kept   So  Mrs  Prinks   said she   is my lady come home     No    Miss   replied the other   her ladyship is certainly the most   compassionate best woman in the world  her cousin is very bad indeed    and she has sent me for a bottle of reviving drops  which I am going   back to carry   With these words she shuffled something into her pocket    and having locked the cabinet again  went out of the room saying   Your   servant  Miss Betsy  I cannot stay  for life s at stake        This put Miss Betsy in the greatest consternation imaginable  she knew   Lady Mellasin could have no drops in that cabinet  unless they were   contained in a phial of no larger circumference than a thimble  the   drawers of it being very shallow  and made only to hold rings  croceats    necklaces  and such other flat trinkets  she thought there was something   very odd and extraordinary in the whole affair  A strange woman coming   in so abrupt a manner  her refusing to give the letter to any one but   Lady Mellasin herself  her ladyship s confusion at the receipt of it    her disguising herself  and going out with Prinks in that violent hurry    the latter being sent home  her taking something out of the casket  and   her going back again  all these incidents  I say  when put together    denoted something of a mystery not easily penetrated into       Miss Betsy  however  was not of a disposition to think too much  or too   deeply  on those things which the most nearly concerned herself  much   less on such as related entirely to other people  and Miss Flora coming   home soon after  and relating what conversation had passed in the visits   she had been making  and the dresses the several ladies had on
