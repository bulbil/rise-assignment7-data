saying     and though Mr  Fenton wished to know what the sad affair was   at which she had hinted  he declined asking any questions  for fear   of renewing her affliction      Mr  and Mrs  Clement had walked abroad  upon a visit  with their   pupil Harry   so that Mr  Fenton and his friend Ned  with Mr  and   Mrs  Fielding  made the whole of the present company      You are happily situated  sir  says Mr  Fielding  I blame myself    and all others who have any independence  and yet live in the city    Health  pleasure  and spirits are all for the country  Did any   poets or philosophers ever place their golden eras or golden scenes   amidst such a town as London   A man can scarce be himself   he   is confused and dissipated by the variety of objects and bustle that   surrounds him  In short  sir  I am like many others  the reverse   in persuasion of what I am in practice   I live in a city  although I   detest it  It is true that I am fond of society and neighbourhood     but experience has shown me that London is not the place in which   I can enjoy it      No  sir  said Mr  Fenton   if I was a lover of solitude  if I wished   to be the most recluse of all anchorites that bid adieu to the com    merce of mankind  I would choose London for my cell  It is in   such a city alone that a man may keep wholly unknown and un    noticed  He is there as a hailstone amidst a great shower   he   jumps and bustles about a while  then lies snug among his fellows    without being any more observed than if he were not upon earth    till he melts away and vanishes with the rest of his fraternity      I am not for a cell  sir  replied Mr  Fielding  I love society  but   yet a society that is founded on friendship   and people in great         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  149     cities are so divided and dissipated by the multitude of soliciting   objects and acquaintance  that they are rendered incapable of a   particular attachment  I imagine  however  that in a well peopled   and civilized part of the country  a man might make an election of   persons deserving his esteem  such as he would wish to live with in   a happy interchange of kind offices and affections  This  indeed    is my plan for my remainder of life   but the lawsuits  in which I   am at present involved  will not permit me to go in search of my   Utopia      At law   exclaimed Mr  Fenton   then  sir  you are much to be   blamed  or much to be pitied      I hope rather to be pitied than blamed  rejoined Mr  Fielding    Four suits descended to me on the part of my own father  and three   on the part of the father of my wife   and my adversaries  on all   sides  are such cocks of the game  that no overtures can induce   them to listen to any terms of compromise or accommodation      If matters of wealth or property  said Mr  Fenton  are really   matters of valuable estimation in life  it is much to be lamented   that there is no place on earth wherein property can be said to be   fixed or ascertained  Throughout the regions of Mahomet and   Asiatic despotism  life and property are alike tenures at the will   of the ruler  Again  throughout the European continent  no man    indeed no nation  can be assured of their possessions  exposed as   they are to the ambition and avarice of their almost perpetually   invading neighbours  Lastly  in these northern islands  whose de    fence nature herself appears to have undertaken by a guardianship   of circling rocks and seas   this does not however defend us from   intestine convulsions and changes  Think what a general change   of property has been made in Great Britain during the two very   late revolutions  I am told that  in a neighbouring country  the   alienation has been nearly universal  perhaps a third revolution   is also at hand      It is affirmed that the civil constitution of England is the best   calculated for the security of liberty and property of any that ever   was framed by the policy of man   and originally  perhaps  it might   have been so  when twelve simple and impartial men were appointed   for the speedy trial
