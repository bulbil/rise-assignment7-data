an exile  likely to be deprived of a noble fortune  his heart pierced with remorse for an involuntary crime  I saw too that he loved me  loved me with a fervent and unconquerable passion  Of this  in the anguish of his soul  at a time when he was wrought up to phrenzy  he had given but too strong demonstration  Shall I own it to you  my Cecilia  I think I never loved him as I did in that moment   My heart was at once assailed by a variety of passions  amongst which  gratitude  and the softest compassion  were predominant   I continued silent  whilst Mr Faulkland remained ardently gazing at me   My brother  I believe  thought us too solemn  the occasion indeed required it  but his fears for Mr Faulkland made him wish to give the scene a livelier turn   Come  sister  said he  let us not defer the happy event for which we are now met  we have no time to waste in ceremony  You remember what our mother used to say  ‘Many things fall out between the cup and the lip ’ My brother rose off his chair as he said this  Mr Warner taking the hint  approached  and took me by the hand  Let me  said he  to Mr Faulkland  have the happiness of bestowing this best of Creatures on the man that I think best deserves her   Mr Faulkland made no reply  but in taking the hand that my kinsman put into his  his looks spoke the rapture that swelled his heart  though I saw he put a constraint upon himself  and endeavoured to assume a deportment suitable to the important and solemn occasion   After the indissoluble knot was tied  my brother desired Mr Faulkland to retire with him into the next room for a few minutes   I concluded it was in order to press his departure  and to prevail on him to submit to going without me   This I found afterwards was the subject of their conversation     They returned to us in about a quarter of an hour  Mr Faulkland’s countenance less embarrassed than it was at going out of the room  On their entering  Mr Price took his leave  My brother addressed Mr Warner and me  Faulkland  said he  is convinced of the necessity there is for his immediately withdrawing from England  and he is determined to depart from hence at three o’clock to morrow morning  for I would by no means have him leave London by day light  as we know not who may be on the watch to trace his steps  He has consented that you  sister  should remain behind till Mr Warner’s affairs will permit him to conduct you over  In the mean time  Master Faulkland is to be brought from Ireland  and if you should not be ready to depart before his arrival  you may take him over with you to Holland   Mr Faulkland seemed rather to suffer my brother to make this explanation for him  than to assent chearfully to it  Mr Warner and I however laid hold of it  and immediately entered into discourse on the subject of our domestic concerns  and the measures proper to be observed on so critical an occasion   Mr Faulkland joined in the conversation with the utmost composure  and to my unspeakable joy  seemed perfectly settled and collected in his mind  I thought indeed he appeared a little constrained  and that he seemed to keep a constant guard over himself  lest he should betray any symptom of a too much heated imagination  but my kinsman afterwards observed with pleasure to me  that this denoted nothing more than a consciousness in Mr Faulkland of the unhappy wandering that had before so much alarmed us all  and into which he was sure there was not the least danger of his relapsing  as his heart was now perfectly at ease   Mr Faulkland told us he had letters to write to Ireland  which he would dispatch  that he might have nothing to interrupt the few short hours we had to pass together in the evening   Mr Warner said he had business to do that called him away  but that he would return after dinner  and my brother  that Mr Faulkland might be quite undisturbed  proposed my going home with him  and that we should come back together in the afternoon   Mr Faulkland did not object to this  and I went with Sir George   We returned early in the afternoon to Mr Faulkland  As my brother had let his friend into our secret  we passed up stairs without any notice being taken of us   Mr Faulkland had writ two letters  one of them very long  to Mr    Bond  which he gave my brother to read  but I know not the contents of it  The other was to that careful honest servant whom he had mentioned to us  with orders to bring over Master Faulkland with all convenient speed  and put him into Sir George’s hand   Mr Warner but just called in upon us in the evening  he said he had been making the necessary preparations for Mr Faulkland’s journey  and that having resolved himself to attend him as far as Harwich  he would  at the hour appointed call on him
