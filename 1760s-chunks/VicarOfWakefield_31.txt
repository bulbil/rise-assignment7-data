had long a sort of rivalry in point of taste  our spirit took the alarm at this stolen march upon us   Page  160  and notwithstanding all I could say  and I said much  it was resolved that we should have our pictures done too  Having  therefore  engaged the limner  for what could I do  our next deliberation was to shew the superiority of our taste in the attitudes  As for our neighbour s family  there were seven of them  and they were drawn with seven oranges  a thing quite out of taste  no variety in life  no composition in the world  We desired to have something done in a brighter style  and  after many debates  at length came to an unanimous resolution to be drawn together  in one large historical family piece  This would be cheaper  since one frame would serve for all  and it would be infinitely more genteel  for all families of any taste were now drawn in the same manner  As we did not immediately recollect an historical subject to hit us  we were contented each with being drawn as independent historical figures  My wife desired to be represented as Venus  with a stomacher richly set with diamonds  and her two little  Page  161  ones as Cupids by her side  while I  in my gown and band  was to present her with my books on the Bangorean controversy  Olivia would be drawn as an Amazon  sitting upon a bank of flowers  drest in a green joseph  laced with gold  and a whip in her hand  Sophia was to be a shepherdess  with as many sheep as the painter could spare  and Moses was to be drest out with an hat and white feather  Our taste so much pleased the  Squire  that he insisted on being put in as one of the family in the character of Alexander the great  at Olivia s feet  This was considered by us all as an indication of his desire to be introduced into the family in reality  nor could we refuse his request  The painter was therefore set to work  and as he wrought with assiduity and expedition  in less than four days the whole was compleated  The piece was large  and it must be owned he did not spare his colours  for which my wife gave him great encomiums  We were all perfectly satisfied with his performance   Page  162  but an unfortunate circumstance had not occurred till the picture was finished  which now struck us with dismay  It was so very large that we had no place in the house to fix it  How we all came to disregard so material a point is inconceivable  but certain it is  we were this time all greatly overseen  Instead therefore of gratifying our vanity  as we hoped  there it leaned  in a most mortifying manner  against the kitchen wall  where the canvas was stretched and painted  much too large to be got through any of the doors  and the jest of all our neighbours  One compared it to Robinson Crusoe s long boat  too large to be removed  another thought it more resembled a reel in a bottle  some wondered how it should be got out  and still more were amazed how it ever got in   But though it excited the ridicule of some  it effectually raised more ill natured suggestions in many  The  Squire s portrait being found united with ours  was an honour too great to escape envy  Malicious whispers  Page  163  began to circulate at our expence  and our tranquility continually to be disturbed by persons who came as friends to tell us what was said of us by enemies  These reports we always resented with becoming spirit  but scandal ever improves by opposition  We again therefore entered into a consultation upon obviating the malice of our enemies  and at last came to a resolution which had too much cunning to give me entire satisfaction  It was this  as our principal object was to discover the honour of Mr  Thornhill s addresses  my wife undertook to sound him  by pretending to ask his advice in the choice of an husband for her eldest daughter  If this was not found sufficient to induce him to a declaration  it was then fixed upon to terrify him with a rival  which it was thought would compel him  though never so refractory  To this last step  however  I would by no means give my consent  till Olivia gave me the most solemn assurances that she would marry the person provided to rival him upon this occasion  if Mr  Thornhill did not prevent it   Page  164  by taking her himself  Such was the scheme laid  which though I did not strenuously oppose  I did not entirely approve   The next time  therefore  that Mr  Thornhill came to see us  my girls took care to be out of the way  in order to give their mamma an opportunity of putting her scheme in execution  but they only retired to the next room  from whence they could over hear the whole conversation  which my wife artfully introduced  by observing  that one of the Miss Flamboroughs was like to have a very good match of it in Mr  Spanker  To this
