in his crimes  Do you call this a trivial    affair  If you knew the circumstances  said he  you would not view it in so disadvantageous a light  Faulkland certainly gained the affections of a young lady  though without seeking to do so  he never courted her  never attempted to please her  much less to win her heart  and least of all to ruin her virtue  I know that is an action he is not capable of committing  How comes it to pass then that he did so  said I  interrupting him  Why  the girl was silly  and she was thrown in his way by a vile designing woman that had the care of her  ‘And was he  again stopping him  to take advantage of her folly  and join with that vile designing woman  to destroy a poor young creature’s honour ’ The best men  said he confidently  may fall into an error  and if you expect to find a man entirely free from them  you look for what is not possible in human nature   I may expect to find a man without flagrant crimes to answer for  I hope  and I believe I spoke it with warmth  Do you call this one  madam  said he  with still more assurance  I hope Sidney will not be such a chit as to think in this manner  when she comes to hear the affair explained  I really grew down right angry  and could not forbear saying  I would rather see you married to your grave than to such a man  Your brother then begged I would hear Mr Faulkland justified  and be a little cool till that was done  I told him there was a terrible fact alleged  of which I could not conceive it possible for him to acquit himself   George said  he had a letter to shew me on the subject  which he had received from Mr Faulkland while he was at Bath  and which he was sure would convince me  that the whole affair was so trifling  it ought by no means to be objected to Mr Faulkland  nor  in his opinion  even mentioned to him   I told him I was sorry to find that he and I thought so differently  for that I was determined to speak to Mr Faulkland immediately about it  and  if he could not satisfy me intirely on the score of the injured lady  that he must never think of Sidney more   Your brother said  that the letter which was sent to you had come from the revengeful dog who had robbed his master  and that he would give half his estate to have the villain punished as he deserved  Mr Faulkland  it seems  had told him this himself  The fellow found    it in the pocket book which he had taken out of the escrutore  and his disappointment  perhaps  at not getting a better booty   for he found but twenty moidores besides   joined to his malice against his master  incited him to make the use he did of this letter  Now  continued my mother  though the fellow is undoubtedly a vile creature  yet  my dear  I think we are obliged to him for this discovery  providentially as it has come  to save you from what  in my opinion  would be the worst of misfortunes   The loss of this letter had alarmed Mr Faulkland so much  that he put an advertisement into the papers next day  worded in so particular a manner  as shewed how very fearful he was of that letter’s coming to light  for  no doubt  he suspected the man might make a dangerous use of it  The advertisement said  that if the servant  who had absconded from his master’s house in St James’s Square the night before  would restore the papers which he took with him  they should be received without any questions being asked  and a reward of twenty guineas paid to any person who should bring them back  This advertisement  which  to be sure  the fellow either did not see at all  or had not time enough to avail himself of it  shews you to what sad resources people are driven  who  having done unwarrantable actions  are often in the power of the lowest wretches  I own this circumstance gave me a very ill impression of Mr Faulkland  Your brother says  he remembers this man was one of the servants he took with him to Bath  and  without doubt  he knew of his amour  The advertisement has since been changed  by Sir George’s advice  I find the man is named  his person described  and a reward of fifty pounds offered for the apprehending him  but I take it for granted he has got out of reach   Though his little digression was very pertinent  I was impatient to know what had passed between my mother and Mr Faulkland on the fatal subject  and could not forbear asking her   I shall tell you  said she  in order  Your brother and I had some farther altercations  and indeed  my dear  it amazes me to find  that a young man  educated as Sir George was  in the early part of life  in the
