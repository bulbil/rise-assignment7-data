and my griefs cheered by the sweetness of your prattle     and I was melted down and minted anew  as it were  by the   unaffected warmth and innocence of your caresses      As I had no faith in dreams  not even in that of my Matty  I   thought it impossible that I should ever marry again  I therefore   resolved  in my own mind  to make you my heir  and to endow you   in marriage with the best part of my fortune  But you are a little   pale  madam   you look dejected and fatigued  If you please  I will   suspend my narration for the present  and in the morning  if you   choose it  as early as you will  I shall renew and proceed in my         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  213     insignificant history  Here he pressed her hand to his lips  She   withdrew with a tearful eye and a heaving heart  and the next   day he resumed his narration  as followeth          CHAPTER XV      THOUGH you  my cousin  at that time were a great consolation   to me  and a sweet lightener of my afflictions  yet the griefs of heart   which I had suffered were not without their effect  At length   they fell on my constitution  and affected my nerves or spirits   I   think our doctors pretty much confound the one with the other    Accordingly  I was advised to travel for change of air and exercise    and I was preparing for my journey  when there happened in my   family the most extraordinary instance of an ever watchful pro    vidence that occurs to my memory      My little old man John began to decline apace  and at length   took to his bed  and  having a tender friendship for him  I went to   sit beside him  and to comfort him the best I could  John  said T    are you afraid to die   No  sir  not at all  not in the least   I long   to be dissolved  and to be with our loving Lord  Indeed  John  said   I   I am inclined to think you have been a very good liver  A dog    sir a mere dog  desperately wicked  the vilest of sinners   I am   a murderer too  my master   there s blood upon my head  Blood     said I  and started  Yes  sir  replied John  but then the blood   that was shed for me is stronger and more precious than the blood   that was shed by me  Blood  however  John  is a very terrible   thing  are you not afraid to appear before the judgment seat of   Christ  By no means  my dear master  I have long since laid the   burden of my sins before him  for I had nothing else to bring to   him  nothing else to offer him   and he has accepted them and me    and my conscience is at rest in him  Then  John  there may yet   be room for hope  There is assurance  my master  for I have laid   hold upon the rock  and cannot be shaken      But how do you intend to dispose of your worldly substance     All that I have  sir  I got with you and my old master   and where I   found it  even there I resolve to leave it  Indeed  John  I will not   finger a penny of your money  How much may it amount to     Eight hundred and thirty seven pounds  sir  or thereabout  And   have you no relations of your own   Not one living that I know   of  Then think of some one else  for no part of it shall lie on my   conscience  I assure you      I have read  somewhere or other  sir  of a great king who was   advised of God  in a dream  to take the very first man whom he   should meet the next morning  to be his partner in the government    Now  if it pleases you  my master  I will follow the like counsel     and  whosoever shall be the first found before our door  let that   person be the owner and inheritor of my substance  It shall be   even as you say   I will go and see whom God shall be pleased to   send to us      Accordingly I went and opened our door  when a woman  who         214 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      had nearly passed  turned about at
