 on revisiting those dear scenes of infant happiness  which were increased by having with me that estimable  that affectionate mother  to whose indulgence all my happiness had been owing         But to return to the purpose of our visit  the house is what most people would think too large for the estate  even had I a right to call it all my own  this is  however  a fault  if it is one  which I can easily forgive       There is furniture enough in it for my family  including my mother  it is unfashionable  but some of it very good  and I think Emily has tenderness enough for me to live with me in a house  the furniture of which is not perfectly in taste       In short  I know her much above having the slightest wish of vanity  where it comes in competition with love       We can  as to the house  live here commodiously enough  and our only present consideration is  on what we are to live  a consideration  however  which as lovers  I believe in strictness we ought to be much above       My mother again solicits me to resume this estate  and has proposed my making over to her my half pay instead of it  though of much less value  which  with her own two hundred pounds a year  will  she says  enable her to continue her house in town  a point I am determined never to suffer her to give up  because she loves London  and because I insist on her having her own house to go to  if she should ever chance to be displeased with ours       I am inclined to like this proposal  Temple and I will make a calculation  and  if we find it will answer every necessary purpose to my mother  I owe it to Emily to accept of it       I endeavor to persuade myself  that I am obliging my mother  by giving her an opportunity of shewing her generosity  and of making me happy  I have been in spirits ever since she mentioned it        I have already projected a million of improvements  have taught new streams to flow  planted ideal groves  and walked  fancy led  in shades of my own raising       The situation of the house is enchanting  and with all my passion for the savage luxuriance of America  I begin to find my taste return for the more mild and regular charms of my native country       We have no Chaudieres  no Montmorencis  none of those magnificent scenes on which the Canadians have a right to pride themselves  but we excel them in the lovely  the smiling  in enameled meadows  in waving corn fields  in gardens the boast of Europe  in every elegant art which adorns and softens human life  in all the riches and beauty which cultivation can give       I begin to think I may be blest in the possession of my Emily  without betraying her into a state of want  we may  I begin to flatter myself  live with decency  in retirement  and  in my opinion  there are a thousand charms in retirement with those we love       Upon the whole  I believe we shall be able to live  taking the word live in the sense of lovers  not of the beau monde  who will never allow a little country squire of four hundred pounds a year to live       Time may do more for us  at least  I am of an age and temper to encourage hope       All here are perfectly yours       Adieu  my dear friend   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CLXX   170   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  Aug  6   THE leave of absence for my father and Fitzgerald being come some weeks sooner than we expected  we propose leaving Canada in five or six days       I am delighted with the idea of revisiting dear England  and seeing friends whom I so tenderly love  yet I feel a regret  which I had no idea I should have felt  at leaving the scenes of a thousand past pleasures  the murmuring rivulets to which Emily and I have sat listening  the sweet woods where I have walked with my little circle of friends  I have even a strong attachment to the scenes themselves  which are infinitely lovely  and speak the inimitable hand of nature which formed them  I want to transport this fairy ground to England       I sigh when I pass any particularly charming spot  I feel a tenderness beyond what inanimate objects seem to merit       I must pay one more visit to the naiads of Montmorenci   Eleven at night       I am just come from the general s assembly  where  I should have told you  I was this day fortnight announced Madame Fitzgerald  to the great mortification of two or three cats  who had very sagaciously determined  that Fitzgerald had too much understanding ever to think of such a flirting  coquetish creature as a wife       I was grave at the assembly to night  in spite
