was alone  I always made my visits short  as if through fear of being surprized with her  and went so far as to leave my chariot  when I came in it  at a distance from the house  and walked to it alone  with the caution of one fearful of being observed  It was a matter of indifference to me whether Mrs Gerrarde knew of this or not  my business was only to excite suspicions of an intrigue amongst her servants  in order to answer a future purpose  but if she were to know with what extreme precaution I visited her  my prudence could not but be very agreeable to her  she had her measures to observe as well as myself  As it was of consequence to her to conceal our acquaintance from Arnold’s knowlege  she must necessarily be pleased at the pains I took  without her laying herself open in making the request  to conceal it from him  and she saw I was as careful as she could wish never to interfere with him   In short  we carried on a private intercourse  that  if it could not be called gallantry  was something very like it  for I amused  complimented  and flattered her so agreeably  that I believe she    began to think herself sure of me  and wondered I did not make a better use of the favourable disposition she was in towards me  but I trifled with such dexterity  that even she  with all the cunning she is mistress of  could not possibly fathom my design   Having thus laid the foundation of my plot  I made no doubt of being able to execute it  with my Lord V——’s assistance  he was in raptures at the thought of our enterprize  and swore he would never have forgiven me  if I had not allowed him a share in it  He said  I would give my right hand to make Mrs Arnold happy  adding  besides it will save her husband from destruction  for  to my knowlege  that woman has already almost ruined his fortune   I asked him  might we venture to let my lady into the secret  He said  by no means  my lady was too squeamish to be trusted with such a notable exploit  but  when the affair was over  he would take upon him to excuse me to her  after he had diverted himself a little with her surprize   I fretted to death at Arnold’s staying so long in the country  as it delayed my enterprize  There was one circumstance indeed that a little compensated for this vexation  and that was  that my long stay at V—— hall  which could be no secret to him  though he dropped visiting there on purpose to avoid me  might in some measure help to efface his injurious suspicions with regard to his lady and me  besides  it gave the better colour to my other designs   At last the long sought for opportunity arrived  Arnold was obliged to go to London on his law affairs  I took care to inform myself of the day from Mrs Gerrarde’s maid  and learnt at the same time that her mistress purposed going to town in a week after  for she still endeavoured to save appearances  and dared to the last to pretend to reputation  I proposed giving a ball  to take my leave of the ladies  on the night subsequent to the day fixed for Arnold’s departure from South Park  My lord  almost as anxious for the event as myself  immediately dispatched invitations all over the neighbourhood  there was not a person of any fashion left unasked  Mr Arnold and Mrs Gerrarde  you may be sure  were not forgot  From the former  as we expected  we received a civil apology  from the latter  a message that she would be sure to come   This was at the distance of eight days from the appointed time  In the interim  I continued to visit Mrs Gerrarde as usual  and took care to bespeak her for a partner  Arnold went to town as opportunely as we could wish  I called on Mrs Gerrarde the same morning  and    having my lord’s permission for it  engaged her to come early enough to drink tea  as there were a good many more ladies invited for the same purpose  and  at going away  I dropped a few mysterious hints to her maid   In the evening there was a very large company met at V—— hall  and having concerted my whole plan  when the ladies were engaged at the tea table  I slipped out  mounted my horse  and rode to Mrs Gerrarde’s house  I desired to see her maid  and  taking her aside  told her not to be surprized  but that her lady was to go off with me that night  that the thing had  for certain reasons  not been determined on till that very evening  that I had just snatched a minute to desire her to get all her ladies trinkets together  and whatever money and bills she might have in her escruitore  In order to this  I gave her a parcel of small keys  which I had carried in my pocket for the purpose  and bid her hold herself in readiness against seven o’clock
