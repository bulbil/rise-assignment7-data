I told you what a very warm interest I have with the countess of Haversham his sister  and that she had sounded him in relation to his sentiments of me  without giving him the least intimation of my having any knowledge of her design —The   31 obliging countess executed her commission with the utmost delicacy and address  and easily discovered that all the attention which he paid to that Miss Townly  the first night of our acquaintance  was nothing more than the customary effects of his vivacity—She also discovered that he thought me infinitely handsome   that was his very word  but she feared he would struggle as much as possible with his inclinations  as he seemed to think it unlikely I should have still retained my heart  in the midst of such numberless admirers  her ladyship was pleased to say  as were every day soliciting the happiness of my hand  and applying for the interest of my father—However  she was good naturedly studious to make parties to bring us together  and last night he danced with me at a ball  which was given by the French ambassador  highly to the mortification  not only of that   32 Miss Townly  but of several other ladies  who had flattered themselves with the hope of engaging him for a partner   During the whole course of the evening he scarcely attended to any thing but the means of obliging me —In a thousand little circumstances he manifested both his tenderness and his delicacy  and in a thousand delightful whispers insinuated such well turned compliments  as nothing but affectation itself could possibly be offended with—Whenever he touched my hand he was seized with so exquisite a tremor as went to my very heart  and the envy which he visibly excited in the bosom of almost every other woman in the room  gave him such an additional charm  that he appeared as much an Oroondates to my fancy  as if I had been a heroine in some romance  and was   33 but newly delivered from the dungeon of a merciless giant  in consequence of his prowess and magnanimity   I have before told you that the first time I ever saw Sir Robert Harold  was at the playhouse here  and that the chastisement which he there publicly bestowed on two young officers  who rudely pushed a lady down  and seemed rather inclined to defend than to apologize for their brutality  was what rivetted him in my affection—Yet Harriot  were you to see the dear fellow  you would be charmed with him—In his person he is tall—but not so tall as to be inelegant in the least  nor so much inclined either to the extremes of corpulence or delicacy  as to be awkward on the one hand  or effeminate on the other  in short  the medium is so happy as to give the clearest idea imaginable of manliness and grace  and his legs are so   34 admirably formed—Indeed  Harriot  I don t believe there is a finer made man in the universe   As to his face there is no possibility of doing it justice in the description —You may perhaps imagine that I am on this occasion actuated by the partiality of a giddy headed girl  who  having once confessed herself enamoured of a man  thinks it absolutely necessary  for the credit of her taste  to paint him as the invariable standard of perfection —Indeed  Harriot  I have no necessity to be under so ridiculous an influence—Sir Robert is so much the every thing I could wish him to be  that exaggeration would be as useless as it is impossible  and only betray the excess of my weakness  without adding in the least to the credit of his attractions —His face  however  my dear  is distinguished with a certain energy of   35 expression  that throws out a whole soul upon every feature  and darts such an immediate meaning upon your bosom  that  had he been actually born dumb  he might have been set down as one of the first conversationists in the kingdom  Add to this  that there is an inherent stamp of condition in his air  which indicates the man of fashion  and  at first sight  no less engages your esteem than it excites your admiration—His complexion is a dark brown—but so delicate —His eyes are of a deep black  but replete with such sweetness and fire  that  though he kills you in a manner with a glance  he throws an elysium on the wound  and lessens every suffering of your sensibility with an extacy unutterable —Do  Harriot  laugh at my flight if you please—but remember the time is arrived  when even my sweet friend  with all her gravity  can be in over head and ears  and therefore she should   36 allow for the hyperboles of other doating girls  by the allowances which are necessary for her own —One word more about externals and I have done —You know I am a passionate admirer of fine teeth—Sir Robert has a most exquisite set  and they are always so white—that nothing can equal their beauty  in my opinion  but the lips which enclose them   You have thus  my dear Harriot  a faint sketch of Sir Robert Harold s exterior accomplishments —As to other matters  his education is finished  his fortune is extremely large  his courage approved  and his understanding unquestionable —He has indeed taken some extraordinary liberties
