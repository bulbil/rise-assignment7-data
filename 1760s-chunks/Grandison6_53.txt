He does me great honour to write to me to give him consolation  His is a charming Letter—So full of silial piety —Excellent young man  He breathes in it the true spirit of his friend   Sir Charles and his Beauchamp  and Dr  Bartlett  correspond  I presume  as usual  What would I give to see all Sir Charles writes that relates to us   Mr  Fenwick just now tells us  that Mr  Greville is not well  and keeps his chamber  He has my cordial wishes for his health  His last behaviour to me appears  the more I think of it  more strange  from such a man  I expected not that he would conclude with such generous wishes  Nancy  who does not love him  says  that it was such an overstrain of generosity from him  that it might well over set him  Did you think that our meek Nancy could have said so severe a thing  But meekness offended  as she once was by him  has an excellent memory  and can be bitter   We are preparing now to go to Shirley manor  Our cousins Patty and Kitty Holles will be there at dinner  They have been for a few weeks past at their aunt s  near Daventry  They are impatient to see   132 Sir Charles  Adieu  my dearest Ladies  Continue to love  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXIV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Monday Night  October 16   WE have been very happy this day at my grandmamma s  Your brother makes himself more and more beloved by all my friends  who yet declare  that they thought they could not have loved him better than they did before  My cousin Holles s say  they could sooner lay open their hearts to him  than to any man they ever saw  yet their freedom would never make them lose sight of their respect   He told me  that he had breakfasted with Mr  Greville  How does he conciliate the mind of every one to him  He said kind and compassionate things of Mr  Greville  and so unaffectedly —I was delighted with him  For  regardful as he would be  and is  of his own honour  no low  narrow jealousy  I dare say  will ever have entrance into his heart  Charity thinketh no evil  Of what a charming text is that a part  a  —What is there equal to it  in any of the writings of the philosophers   My dear Miss Byron  said he to me  Mr  Greville loves you more than you can possibly imagine  Despairing of success with you  he has assumed airs of bravery  but your name is written in large letters in his heart  He gave me continued he  the importance of asking my leave to love you still —What ought I to have answered —  What did you answer  Sir   That so far as I might presume to give it  I gave it    133 Had I the honour  added I  of calling Miss Byron mine  I would not barely allow your love of her  I would demand it —Have I not assured you  Mr  Greville  that I look upon you as my friend   You will quite subdue Mr  Greville  Sir  said I  You will  by the generosity of your treatment of him  do more than any body else ever could—You will make him a good man   Mr  Greville  madam  deserves pity  on more accounts than one  A wife  such a one as his good Angel led him to wish for  would have settled his principles  He wants steadiness  But he is not  I hope  a bad man  I was not concerned for his cavalier treatment of you yesterday  but on your own account  lest his roughness should give you pain  But his concluding wishes  and his preference of a rival to himself  together with the manner of his departure  unable as he was to withstand his own emotions  and the effect it had upon his spirits  so as to confine him to his chamber  had something great in it—And I shall value him for it  as long as he will permit me   Sir Charles and my grandmamma had a good deal of talk together  Dearly does she love to single him out  What a pretty picture would they make  could they be both drawn so as not to cause a profane jester to fall into mistakes  as if it were an old Lady makeing Love to a handsome young man   Let me sketch it out—See  then  the dear Lady  with a countenance full of benignity  years written by venerableness  rather than by wrinkles  in her face  dignity and familiarity in her manner  one hand on his  talking to him  His sine countenance shining with modesty and reverence  looking down  delighted  as admiring her wisdom  and not a little regardful of her half pointing finger  Let that be  for fear of mistakes  to a creature young enough to be her granddaughter  who  to avoid shewing too much sensibility  shall seem to be talking to two other young Ladies   134  Nancy and
