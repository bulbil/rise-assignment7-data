particular admirers  That she never would marry any man in the world  except he were just such another  in mind and manners  as Sir Charles Grandison     63 Ladies  my Lord  who in absence speak favourably of a man that forms not pretensions upon them  nor is likely to be troublesome to them  would soon convince that man of his mistake  were his presumption to rise upon their declared good opinions   I wonder  proceeded my Lord  that every young man is not good  I have heard you  cousin  praised in all the circles where you have been mentioned  It was certainly an advantage to you to come back to us a stranger  as I may say  Many youthful follies may perhaps be over passed  that we shall never know any thing of  But  be that as it will  I can tell you  Sir  that I have heard such praises of you  as have made my eyes glisten  because of my relation to you  I was told  within this month past  that no fewer than Five Ladies  out of one circle  declared  that they would stand out by consent  and let you pick and choose a wife from among them   What your Lordship has heard of this nature  let me say  without affecting to disclaim a compliment apparently too high for my merits  is much more to the honour of the one sex  than of the other  I should be glad  that policy  if not principle  principle might take root  and grow from it   would mend us men   So should I  nephew  But I  Poor man  he hung down his head   have not been a better man than I ought to be  Do you not despise me  in your heart  cousin —You must have heard—That cursed woman—But I begin to repent  And the truly good  I believe  cannot be either censorious  or uncharitable  Tell me  however  Do you not despise me   Despise my mother s brother  No  my Lord  Yet were a sovereign to warrant my freedom  and there was a likelihood that he would be the better for it  I would  with decency  tell him my whole mind  I am sorry to say it  but your Lordship  if you have not had virtue to make you worthy of being imitated    64 has too many examples among the great  as well as among the middling  to cause you to be censured for singularity  But your Lordship adds  to a confession that is not an ungenerous one  that you begin to repent   Indeed I do  And your character  cousin  has made me half ashamed of myself   I am not accustomed  my Lord  to harangue on these subjects to men who know their duty  But let me say  That your Lordship s good resolutions  to be efficacious  must be built upon a better foundation than occasional disgust or disobligation  But here  again  we are verging to a subject that we are both agreed to defer till after dinner   I am charmed with your treatment of me  cousin  I shall  for my own sake  adore my sister s son  Had I consulted my chaplain  who is a good man too  he would have too roughly treated me   Divines  my Lord  must do their duty   He then introduced the affair between Sir Hargrave Pollexfen and me  of which  I found  he was more particularly informed  than I could have imagined  And after he had launched out upon that  and upon my refusal of a duel  he  by a transition that was very natural  mentioned the rescued Lady  as he called her  I have heard  cousin  said he  that she is the most beautiful woman in England   I think her so  my Lord  replied I  And she has one excellence  that I never before met with in a Beauty  She is not proud of it   I then gave my opinion of Miss Byron in such terms  as made my Lord challenge me  as my sisters once did  on the warmth of my description and praises of her   And does your Lordship think  that I cannot do justice to the merits of such a Lady as Miss Byron  but with an interested view  I do assure you  that what I have said  is short of what I think of her    65 But I can praise a Lady  without meaning a compliment to myself  I look upon it  however  as one of the most fortunate accidents of my life  that I have been able to serve her  and save her from a forced marriage with a man whom she disliked  and who could not deserve her  There is hardly any thing gives me more pain  than when I see a worthy woman very unequally yoked  if her own choice has not been at first consulted  and who yet  tho  deeply sensible of her misfortune  irreproachably supports her part of the yoke   You are a great friend to the sex  kinsman   I am  I think the man
