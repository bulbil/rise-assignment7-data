he was pleased to come up to me  and said  Now  my dear  I   will attend you for a little walk in the garden  and I gave him my hand   with great pleasure       This garden is much better cultivated than the Lincolnshire one  but   that is larger  and has nobler walks in it  and yet there is a pretty   canal in this  and a fountain and cascade  We had a deal of sweet   conversation as we walked  and  after we had taken a turn round  I bent   towards the little garden  and when I came near the summer house  took   the opportunity to slip from him  and just whipt up the steps of this   once frightful place  and kneeled down  and said  I bless thee  O God    for my escapes  and for thy mercies  O let me always possess a grateful    humble heart  and I whipt down again and joined him  and he hardly   missed me       Several of the neighbouring gentry sent their compliments to him on his   return  but not a word about his marriage  particularly Mr  Arthur  Mr    Towers  Mr  Brooks  and Mr  Martin of the Grove          Monday       I had a good deal of employment in choosing patterns for my new clothes    He thought nothing too good  but I thought every thing I saw was  and he   was so kind to pick out six of the richest for me to choose three suits   out of  saying  We would furnish ourselves with more in town  when we   went thither  One was white  flowered with silver most richly  and he   was pleased to say  that  as I was a bride  I should make my appearance   in that the following Sunday  And so we shall have in two or three days    from several places  nothing but mantua makers and tailors at work    Bless me  what a chargeable and what a worthless hussy I am to the dear   gentleman   But his fortune and station require a great deal of it    and his value for me will not let him do less  than if he had married a   fortune equal to his own  and then  as he says  it would be a reflection   upon him  if he did   And so I doubt it will be  as it is  For either   way the world will have something to say  He made me also choose some   very fine laces  and linen  and has sent a message on purpose  with his   orders  to hasten all down  what can be done in town  as the millinery   matters  etc  to be completed there  and sent by particular messengers    as done  All to be here  and finished by Saturday afternoon  without   fail       I sent away John this morning  with some more of my papers to you  and   with the few he will give you separate  My desire is  that you will send   me all the papers you have done with  that I may keep my word with Lady   Davers  to beg the continuance of your prayers and blessings  to hope   you will give me your answer about my dear benefactor s proposal of   the Kentish farm  to beg you to buy  two suits of clothes each  of the   finest cloth for you  my dear father  and of a creditable silk for my   dear mother  and good linen  and every thing answerable  and that you   will  as my best friend bid me say  let us see you here as soon as   possible  and he will have his chariot come for you  when you tell John   the day  Oh  how I long to see you both  my dear good parents  and to   share with you my felicities       You will have  I m sure  the goodness to go to all your creditors  which   are chiefly those of my poor unhappy brothers  and get an account of all   you are bound for  and every one shall be paid to the utmost farthing    and interest besides  though some of them have been very cruel   and unrelenting   But they are entitled to their own  and shall be   thankfully paid       Now I think of it  John shall take my papers down to this place  that   you may have something to amuse you  of your dear child s  instead of   those you part with  and I will continue writing till I am settled  and   you are determined  and then I shall apply myself to the duties of the   family  in order
