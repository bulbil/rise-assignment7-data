Dettingen—they are double loaded  and if any highwayman in England robbs you of the value of a pin  while I have the honour of being in your company  d—n my heart  —  When he had expressed himself in this manner  a prim gentlewoman  who had sat silent hitherto  opened her mouth  and said  she wondered how any man could be so rude as to pull out such weapons before ladies —   Damme  madam   cried the champion  if you are so much afraid at sight of a pistol  how d ye propose to stand fire if there should be occasion  —  She let him know  that if she thought he could   193 be so unmannerly as to use fire arms in her presence  whatever might be the occasion  she would get out of the coach immediately  and walk to the next village  where she might procure a convenience to herself —Before he could make any answer  my Dulcinea interposed  and observed  that so far from being offended at a gentleman s using his arms in his own defence  she thought herself very lucky in being along with one by whose valour she stood a good chance of saving herself from being rifled —The prude cast a disdainful look at Miss  and said  that people who have but little to lose  are sometimes the most solicitous about preserving it —The old lady was affronted at this inuendo  and took notice  that people ought to be very well informed before they speak slightingly of other people s fortune  lest they discover their own envy  and make themselves ridiculous —The daughter declared  that she did not pretend to vie with any body in point of riches  and if the lady who insisted upon nonresistance  would promise to indemnify us all for the loss we should sustain  she should be one of the first to persuade the captain to submission  in case we should be attacked —To this proposal  reasonable as it was  the reserved lady made no other reply  than a scornful glance and a toss of her head —I was very well pleased with the spirit of my mistress  and even wished for an opportunity of distinguishing my courage under her eye  which I believed  could not fail of prepossessing her in my favour  when all of a sudden  Strap rode up to the coach door  and told us in a great fright  that two men on horse back were crossing the heath  for by this time we had passed Hounslow  and made directly towards us    194 This piece of information was no sooner delivered  than Mrs  Snapper began scream  her daughter grew pale  the other lady pulled out her purse to be in readiness  the lawyer s teeth chattered  while he pronounced     Tis no matter—we ll sue the county and recover  —  The captain gave evident signs of confusion  and I  after having commanded the coachman to stop  opened the door  jumped out  and invited the warrior to follow me —But finding him backward and astonished  I took his pistols  and giving them to Strap  who had by this time alighted  and trembled very much  I mounted on horse back  and taking my own   which I could better depend upon  from the holsters  cocked them both  and faced the robbers  who were now very near us —Seeing me ready to oppose them on horse back  and another man armed a foot  they made a halt at some distance to reconnoitre us  and after having rode round us twice  myself still facing about as they rode  went off the same way they came  at a hand gallop —A gentleman s servant coming up with a horse at the same time  I offered him a crown to assist me in pursuing them  which he no sooner accepted  than I armed him with the officer s pistols  and we galloped after the thieves  who trusting to the swiftness of their horses  stopped  till we came within shot of them  and then firing at us  put their nags to the full speed —We followed them as fast as our beasts could carry us  but not being so well mounted as they  our efforts would have been to little purpose  had not the horse of one of them stumbled and thrown his rider with such violence over his head  that he lay senseless  when we came up  and was taken without the least opposition  while his   195 comrade consulted his own safety in flight  without regarding the distress of his friend  We scarce had time to make ourselves masters of his arms  and tye his hands together  before he recovered his senses  when learning his situation  he affected surprize  demanded to know by what authority we used a gentleman in that manner  and had the impudence to threaten us with a prosecution for robbery —In the mean time we perceived Strap coming up with a crowd of people  armed with different kinds of weapons  and among the rest a farmer  who no sooner perceived the thief  whom we had secured  than he cried with great emotion    There s the fellow who robbed me an hour ago  of twenty pounds  in a canvas bag  —  He was immediately searched  and
