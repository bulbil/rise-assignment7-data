lead me  There may  perhaps  be some subterraneous retreat in this city  Plague take it  If I thought so  I would soon show him I have not got the gout  I walked  therefore  behind him carefully looking out where he might stop  with the pious design of putting my best leg foremost  if there was anything in the shape of a trap door   Rolando soon dispersed my alarms  He went into a well frequented tavern  I followed him  He called for the best wine  and ordered dinner  While it was getting ready  we went into a private room  where the captain addressed me as follows  You may well be astonished  Gil Blas  to renew your acquaintance with your old commander  and you will be still more so  when you have heard my tale  The day I left you in the cave  and went with my troop to Mansilla  for the purpose of selling the mules and horses we had taken the evening before  we met the son of the corregidor of Leon  attended by four men on horseback well armed  following his carriage  Two of his people we made to bite the dust  and the other two ran away  On this the coachman  alarmed for his master  cried out to us in a tone of supplication    Alas  my dear gentlemen  in God s name  do not kill the only son of his worship the corregidor of Leon  These words were far from softening my comrades  on the contrary  their fury knew no bounds  Good folks  said one of them  let not the son of a mortal enemy to men like us escape our vengeance  How many ornaments of our profession has his father cut off in their prime  Let us repay his cruelty with interest  and sacrifice this victim to their offended ghosts  The whole troop applauded the fineness of this feeling  and my lieutenant himself was preparing to act as high priest at this unhallowed altar  when I interdicted the rites  Stop  said I  why shed blood without occasion  Let us rest contented with the youth s purse  As he makes no resistance  it would be against the laws of war to cut his throat  Besides  he is not answerable for his father s misdeeds  nay  his father only does his duty in condemning us to death  as we do ours in rifling travellers   Thus did I plead for the corregidor s son  and my intercession was not unavailing  We only took every farthing of his money  and carried off with us the horses of the two men whom we had slain  These we sold with the rest at Mansilla  Thence we returned to the cavern  where we arrived the following morning a little before daybreak  We were not a little surprised to find the trap open  and still more so  when we found Leonarda handcuffed in the kitchen  She unravelled the mystery in two words  We wondered how you could have overreached us  no one could have thought you capable of serving us such a trick  and we forgave the effect for the merit of the invention  As soon as we had released our kitchen wench  I gave orders for a good luncheon  In the mean time we went to look after our horses in the stable  where the old negro  who had been left to himself for four and twenty hours  was at the last gasp  We did all we could for his relief  but he was too far gone  indeed so much reduced  that  in spite of our endeavours  we left the poor devil on the threshold of another world  It was very sad  but it did not spoil our appetites  and  after an abundant breakfast  we retired to our chambers  and slept away the whole day  On our awaking  Leonarda apprized us that Domingo had paid the debt of nature  We carried him to the charnel house where you may recollect to have lodged  and there performed his obsequies  just as if he had been one of our own order   Five or six days afterwards  it fell out that one morning  on a sally  we encountered three companies of the Holy Brotherhood  on the outskirts of the wood  They seemed waiting to attack us  We perceived but one troop at first  These we despised  though superior in number to our party  and rushed forward to the onset  But while we were at loggerheads with the first  the two others in ambuscade came thundering down upon us  so that our valour was of no use  There was no withstanding such a host of enemies  Our lieutenant and two of our gang gave up the ghost on this occasion  As for the two others and myself  we were so closely pressed and hemmed in  as to be taken prisoners  and  while two detachments convoyed us to Leon  the third went to destroy our retreat  How it was discovered  I will briefly tell you  A peasant of Luceno  crossing the forest on his way home  by chance espied the trap door of our subterraneous residence  which a certain young runaway had not shut down after him  for it was precisely the day when you took yourself
