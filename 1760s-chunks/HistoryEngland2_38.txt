must change  as the people happen to alter  The Queen s personal virtues  her successes  her adulation from the throne  contributed all to change the disposition of the nation  they now began to defend hereditary succession  non resistance  and divine right  they were now become Tories  and were ready to controvert the designs of a Whig ministry  whenever a leader offered to conduct them to the charge   These discontents were  in some measure  increased by a meditated union between the two kingdoms of England and Scotland  The treaty  for this purpose  was chiefly managed by the ministry  and  although it was fraught with numberless benefits to either kingdom  yet it raised the murmurs of both  The English expected nothing from the union of so poor a nation  but a participation of their necessities  they thought it unjust  that  while Seotland was granted an eighth part of the legislature  it yet should be taxed but a fortieth part of the supplies  On the other hand  the Scotch considered that their independency would be quite destroyed  and the dignity of their crown betrayed  they dreaded an increase of taxes  and seemed not much to esteem the advantages of an increased trade  In every political measure there are disadvantages on either side  which may be sufficient to deter the timid  but which a bold legislator disregards  The union  after some struggles  was effected  Scotland was no longer to have a parliament  but to send sixteen Peers  chosen from the body of their nobility  and forty five commoners  The two kingdoms were called by the common name of Great Britain  and all the subjects of both were to enjoy a commun iation of privileges and advantages     102 This measure  which strengthened the vigour of government  by uniting its force  seemed to threaten the enemies of Great Britain with dangers abroad  but the discontents of the nation at home prevented the effects of its newly acquired power  The Tories  now become the majority  were displeased with the Whig ministry  they looked with jealousy on the power of the Earl of Godolphin and the Duke of Marlborough  who had long governed the Queen  and lavished the treasures of the nation on conquests more glorious than serviceable  To them the people imputed the burthens under which they now groaned  and others which they had reason to fear  The loss of a battle near Almanza in Spain  where the English army were taken prisoners  under the command of the Earl of Galloway  with some other miscarriages  tended to heighten their displeasure  and dispelled the inebriation of former success  The Tories did not fail to inculcate and exaggerate these causes of discontent  while Robert Harley  afterwards Earl of Oxford  and Henry St  John  made soon after Lord Bolingbroke  secretly fanned the flame   Harley had lately become a favourite of the Queen  the petulance of the Duchess of Marlborough  who formerly ruled the Queen  had entirely alienated the affections of her mistress  She now placed them upon one Mrs  Masham  who was entirely devoted to Lord Oxford  Oxford was possessed of uncommon erudition  he was polite and intriguing  he had insinuated himself into the royal favour  and determined to sap the credit of Marlborough and his adherents  In this attempt he chose  for his second  Bolingbroke  a man of exalted powers of thinking  eloquent  ambitious  and enterprising  Bolingbroke was  at first  contented to act a subordinate character in this meditated oppo…tion  but  soon perceiving the superiority of his   103 own talents  from being an inferior  he was resolved to become Lord Oxford s rival  The Duke of Marlborough soon perceived their growing power  and resolved to crush it in the beginning  He refused to join in the Privy Council  while Harley was secretary  Godolphin joined his influence in this measure  and the Queen was obliged to appease their resentment  by discharging Harley from his place  Bolingbroke was resolved to share his disgrace  and voluntarily relinquished his employments   This violent measure  which seemed  at first  favourable to the Whig ministry  laid the first foundation of its ruin  the Queen was intirely displeased with the haughty conduct of the Duke  and  from that moment  he lost her confidence and affection  Harley was enabled to act now with less disguise  and to take more vigorous measures for the completion of his designs  In him the Queen reposed all her trust  though he now had no visible concern in the administration   The Whig party  in this manner  seemed to triumph for some time  till an occurrence  in itself  of no great importance  served to shew the spirit of the times  Doctor Sacheverel  a minister of narrow intellects and bigotted principles  had published two sermons  in which he strongly insisted on the illegality of resisting Kings  and enforced the divine origin of their authority  declaimed against the Dissenters  and exhorted the Church to put on the whole armour of God  There was nothing in the sermons  either nervous  well written  or clear  they owed all their celebrity to the complexion of the times  and are at present justly forgotten  Sacheverel was impeached by the commons  at the bar of the
