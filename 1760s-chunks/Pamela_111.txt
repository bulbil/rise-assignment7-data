 which I had hoped would have been happily ended  but   Providence did not see fit       She would make me rise about twelve  but I was so weak  I could only sit   up till the bed was made  and went into it again  and was  as they said    delirious some part of the afternoon  But having a tolerable night on   Thursday  I was a good deal better on Friday  and on Saturday got up    and ate a little spoon meat  and my feverishness seemed to be gone  and   I was so mended by evening  that I begged her indulgence in my closet    to be left to myself  which she consented to  it being double barred the   day before  and I assuring her  that all my contrivances  as she called   them  were at an end  But first she made me tell the whole story of my   enterprise  which I did very faithfully  knowing now that nothing could   stand me in any stead  or contribute to my safety and escape  And she   seemed full of wonder at my resolution  but told me frankly  that I   should have found it a hard matter to get quite off  for that she was   provided with a warrant from my master  who is a justice of peace in   this county as well as in the other  to get me apprehended  if I had got   away  on suspicion of wronging him  let me have been where I would       O how deep laid are the mischiefs designed to fall on my devoted   head   Surely  surely  I cannot be worthy of all this contrivance  This   too well shews me the truth of what was hinted to me formerly at the   other house  that my master swore he would have me  O preserve me    Heaven  from being his  in his own wicked sense of the adjuration       I must add  that now the woman sees me pick up so fast  she uses me   worse  and has abridged me of paper  all but one sheet  which I am to   shew her  written or unwritten  on demand  and has reduced me to one   pen  yet my hidden stores stand me in stead  But she is more and more   snappish and cross  and tauntingly calls me Mrs  Williams  and any thing   she thinks will vex me          Sunday afternoon       Mrs  Jewkes has thought fit to give me an airing  for three or four   hours  this afternoon  and I am a good deal better and should be much   more so  if I knew for what I am reserved  But health is a blessing   hardly to be coveted in my circumstances  since that but exposes me   to the calamity I am in continual apprehensions of  whereas a weak and   sickly state might possibly move compassion for me  O how I dread the   coming of this angry and incensed master  though I am sure I have done   him no harm       Just now we heard  that he had like to have been drowned in crossing the   stream  a few days ago  in pursuing his game  What is the matter  that   with all his ill usage of me  I cannot hate him  To be sure  I am not   like other people  He has certainly done enough to make me hate him  but   yet  when I heard his danger  which was very great  I could not in my   heart forbear rejoicing for his safety  though his death would have   ended my afflictions  Ungenerous master  if you knew this  you surely   would not be so much my persecutor  But  for my late good lady s sake    I must wish him well  and O what an angel would he be in my eyes yet  if   he would cease his attempts  and reform       Well  I hear by Mrs  Jewkes  that John Arnold is turned away  being   detected in writing to Mr  Williams  and that Mr  Longman  and Mr    Jonathan the butler  have incurred his displeasure  for offering to   speak in my behalf  Mrs  Jervis too is in danger  for all these three    probably  went together to beg in my favour  for now it is known where I   am       Mrs  Jewkes has  with the news about my master  received a letter    but she says the contents are too bad for me to know  They must be bad   indeed  if they be worse than what I have already known       Just now the horrid creature tells me  as a secret
