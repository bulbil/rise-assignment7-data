was but just dressed when Mr  Munden came to wait on her  and   conduct her to her brother s  where they were to dine  he told her he   had been with the elder Mr  Thoughtless at the lawyer s  about the   writings   So that now  my angel   said he   I flatter myself that my   days of languishment are near a period        He took the freedom of accompanying these words with a pretty warm   embrace    Forbear  Mr  Munden   cried she  with the most forbidding   coldness   you have yet no right to liberties of this nature         Cruel and unkind Miss Betsy   resumed he   must nothing  then  be   allowed to love  and all be left to law   He then went on with some   discourses of the passion he had for her  and the joy he felt in the   thoughts of his approaching happiness  to all which she made very short   replies  till at last it came into her head to interrupt him in the   midst of a very tender exclamation  by saying   Mr  Munden  I forgot to   mention one thing to you  but it is not yet too late  I suppose you   design to keep a coach        This a little startled him  and  looking upon her with a very grave   air   Madam   said he   you are sensible my estate will not permit me to   oblige you in this point     And can you imagine I will ever marry to   trudge on foot   cried she        I should be both sorry and ashamed   replied he   to see you do that    but there are other conveniences  which will  I hope  content you  till   fortune puts it in my power to do otherwise        He then reminded her of the expectations she had frequently heard him   make mention of  concerning his hopes of soon obtaining both an   honourable and lucrative employment  and assured her  that as soon as he   had procured a grant of it  he would set up an equipage accordingly       But this did not at all satisfy her  she insisted on having a coach   directly  and gave him some hints  as if she would not marry without   one  which very much nettling him  he desired she would remember her   promise  which was absolutely given  without the least mention of a   coach being made        I would not have you   said she   insist too much on that promise  lest   I should be provoked to give you the same answer Leonora  in the play    gives to her importunate lover             That boasted promise ties me not to time        And bonds without a date  they say  are void        Mr  Munden could not now contain his temper  he told her he could not   have expected such treatment after his long services  and her favourable   acceptance of them  that he thought he merited  at least  a shew of   kindness from her  and  in fine  that she did not act towards him as   became a woman of honour       This was a reproach which the spirit of Miss Betsy was too high to bear    she  blushing with indignation  and casting the most disdainful look   upon him  was about to make some answer  which  perhaps  in the humour   he then was  would have occasioned him to retort in such a manner as   might have broken off all the measures which had been so long   concerting  if a sudden interruption had not prevented it       Mr  Francis Thoughtless  not knowing anything of Mr  Munden s being   there  and happening to pass that way  called on his sister  to know if   she was ready to go to his brother s  it being near dinner time  he   immediately perceived  by both their countenances  that some brul√©e had   happened between them  and  on his asking  in a gay manner  the cause of   it  Mr  Munden made no scruple to relate the sum of what had passed  The   brother of Miss Betsy  though in his heart very much vexed with her    affected to treat what Mr  Munden had said  as a bagatelle  and  calling   to his sister s footman to get a hackney coach to the door  made them   both go with him to his brother s  saying  they would there adjust every   thing
