the first vacancy  notwithstanding which promise  he had had the mortification to see six or seven appointed in the same station almost every week—that now being utterly impoverish d  his sole hope consisted in the promise of a friend lately come to town  to lend him a small matter  for a present to the s—t—y  without which he was persuaded he might wait a thousand years to no purpose —I conceived a mighty liking for this young fellow  which  I believe  proceeded from the similitude of our fortunes  We spent the whole day together    125 and as he lived at Wapping  I desir d him to take a share of my bed —Next day we returned to the Navy Office  where  after being called before the board and question d about the place of my nativity and education  they order d a letter to be made out for me  which  upon paying half a crown to the clerk  I receiv d  and deliver d into the hands of the clerk at Surgeon s Hall  together with a shilling for his trouble in registering my name —By this time my whole stock was diminished to two shillings  and I saw not the least prospect of relief  even for present subsistence  much less to enable me to pay the fees at Surgeon s Hall for my examination  which was to happen in a fortnight —In this state of perplexity  I consulted Strap  who assured me  he would pawn every thing he had in the world  even to his razors  before I should want  but this I absolutely rejected  telling him  I would a thousand times rather list for a soldier  of which I had some thoughts  than be any longer a burthen to him —At the word soldier  he grew pale as death  and begged on his knees  I would think no more of that scheme     God preserve us all in our right wits   cried he  would you turn soldier  and perhaps be sent abroad against the Spaniards  where you must stand and be shot at like a woodcock —Heaven keep cold lead out of my carcass  and let me die in a bed like a christian  as all my fore fathers have done —What signifies all the riches and honours of this life  if one enjoys not content—And in the next  there is no respect of persons  Better be a poor honest Barber with a good conscience  and time to repent of my sins upon my death bed  than be cut off   126  God bless us  by a musket shot  as it were in the very flower of one s age  in the pursuit of riches and fame —What signifies riches  my dear friend   do they not make unto themselves wings  as the wise man saith  and does not Horace observe   Non domus aut fundus  non aeris accrvus aut duri Aegroto domini deduxit corpore febrem  non animo curas —I could moreover mention many other sayings in contempt of riches  both from the bible and other good books  but as I know you are not very fond of these things  I shall only assure you  that if you take on to be a soldier  I will do the same  and then if we should both be slain  you will not only have your own blood to answer for  but mine also  And peradventure the lives of all those whom we shall kill in battle —Therefore I pray you  consider whether you will sit down contented with small things  and share the fruits of my industry in peace   till providence shall send better tidings  or by your despair  plunge both our souls and bodies into everlasting perdition  which God of his infinite mercy forbid  —  I could not help smiling at this harangue  which was delivered with great earnestness  the tears standing in his eyes all the time  and promised to do nothing of that sort without his consent and concurrence —He was much comforted with this declaration  and told me  in a few days he should receive a week s wages which should be at my service  but advised me in the mean time  to go in quest of Jackson  and recover  if possible  what he had borrow d of me —I accordingly trudg d about from one end of the town to the other  for several days  without   127 being able to learn any thing certain concerning him  And  one day  being extreamly hungry and allur d by the steams that regal d my nostrils from a boiling cellar  I went down with an intention to gratify my appetite with two penny worth of beef  when  to my no small surprize  I found Mr  Jackson sitting at dinner with a footman—He no sooner perceiv d me than he got up  and shook me by the hand  saying    He was glad to see me  for he intended to have call d at my lodgings in the afternoon  —  I was so well pleas d with this rencounter  and the apologies he made for not keeping his appointment  that I forgot my resentment  and sat down to dinner  with the happy expectation of not only recovering my own money before we should part  but also reaping the benefit of his promise to lend
