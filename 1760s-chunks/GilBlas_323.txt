a yellow bundle under his arm  My friend  said he  give me leave to introduce Signor Ybagnez of Segovia  who  in spite of the bad example set him by the trade in general  trusts to fair dealing and small profits for a moderate pittance and an unblemished character  He will tell you to a fraction what the dress you want to part with is really worth  and you may take his calculation as the balance of justice  between  man and man  Oh yes I to a nicety  said the broker  Else wherefore live I in a Christian land  but to appraise for my neighbour as for myself  To take a mean advantage never was  thank heaven  and at these years never shall be  imputed to Ybagnez of Segovia  Let us look a little at those articles  You are the seller  I am the buyer  We have only to agree upon an equitable price  Here they are  said the bully  pulling them out  now own the truth  was there ever anything more magnificent  You do not often see such velvet  and then the trimming  You cannot say too much of it  answered the salesman  examining the suit with the prying eye of a dealer  it is of the very first quality  And what think you of the pearls upon this crown  resumed my friend  A little rounder  observed Ybagnez  and there would be no setting a price upon them  however  take them as they are  it is a very fine set  and I do not want to find fault about trifles  Now your common run of appraisers  under my circumstances  would affect to disparage the goods for the sake of getting them cheaper  one of those fellows would have the conscience to offer twenty pistoles  but there is nothing like bargaining with an upright  downright man  I will give forty at a word  take them or leave them   Had Ybagnez ventured up to a hundred  he would not have burned his fingers  for the pearls alone would have fetched two hundred anywhere  The bully  who went snacks  then said    Now only look  what a mercy it is  to fall into the hands of a man not of this world  Signor Ybagnez estimates money as dross  in comparison of his principles and his soul  He may die to night  and yet not be taken unprepared  That is too much  You make me blush  said the salesman of principle and soul  but so far is true  that my price is always fixed  Well  now  is it a bargain  The money down upon the nail too  Stop a moment  answered the bully  my little friend must first try on the clothes you have brought for him by my order  I am very much mistaken if they will not just fit him  The salesman then  untying his bundle  shewed me a second hand suit of dark cloth with silver buttons  I got up  and got into it  too big for me every way  but these gentlemen could have sworn it had been made to my measure  Ybagnez put it at ten pistoles  and as he was an upright  downright man  of fixed principle and soul  estimating money as dross in comparison of integrity  his first price was of course his last  He therefore took out his purse  and counted down thirty pistoles upon a table  after which he packed up the King of Leon s regalia  and went his way   When he was gone  the bully said    I am very well satisfied with that broker  And so he well might be  for I am certain he must have received at least a hundred pistoles as hush money  But there was no reason why the broker s benevolence should pay the debts of my gratitude  so he took half the money on the table  without saying with your leave or by your leave  and suffered me to pocket the remainder  with the following advice  My dear Scipio  with that balance of fifteen pistoles  I would have you get out of this town as fast as you can  for you may suppose that my lord archbishop will ferret you out if you are above ground  It would grieve me to the heart if  after having risen so superior to the prejudice of honesty  you had the weakness to fall foul of what alone keeps it afloat  the house of correction  I answered that it was my fixed purpose to make myself scarce at Seville  and accordingly  after buying a hat and some shirts  I travelled through vineyards and olive groves to the ancient city of Carmona  and in three days afterwards arrived at Cordova   I put up at an inn close by the market place  giving myself out for the heir of a good family at Toledo  travelling for his pleasure  My appearance did not belie the story  and a few pistoles  which I contrived carelessly to chink within the landlord s hearing  pinned his faith upon my veracity  Probably my unfledged youth might lead him to take me for some graceless little truant who had robbed his parents and run away  But that was no concern of his  he took the thing just
