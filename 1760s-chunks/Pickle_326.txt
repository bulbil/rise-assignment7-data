very small  and his  own hopes to be altogether desperate  in which case he was resolved to  dispose of the mortgage  purchase an annuity  and live independent   CHAPTER XCII   He is indulged with a second Audience by the Minister  of whose  Sincerity he is convinced  His Pride and Ambition revive  and again are  mortified     6 22 15  3 45 PM   If the young gentleman s money had been in other hands  perhaps the peer  would have been at very little pains  either in gratifying his demand   or opposing his revenge  but he knew that the sale of the mortgage  could not be effected without an inquiry  to which he did not wish to  be exposed  He  therefore  employed all his interest in procuring the  solicited audience  This being granted  Peregrine  with great warmth and  elocution  expatiated upon the injury his fortune had suffered in the  affair of the borough  for which he had stood candidate  he took notice  of the disappointment he had sustained in the other election  reminded  him of the promises with which he had been amused  and  in conclusion   desired to know what he had to expect from his favour  The minister  having patiently heard him to an end  replied with a most gracious  aspect  that he was very well informed of his merit and attachment  and  very much disposed to convince him of the regard which he paid to  both  that till of late he did not know the nature of his expectations   neither had he the power of creating posts for those whom he was  inclined to serve  but if Mr  Pickle would chalk out any feasible method  by which he could manifest his sentiments of friendship  he should not  be backward in executing the plan   Peregrine  laying hold on this declaration  mentioned several places  which he knew to be vacant  But the old evasion was still used  one of  them was not in his department of business  another had been promised to  the third son of a certain earl before the death of the last possessor   and a third was encumbered with a pension that ate up a good half of  the appointments  In short  such obstructions were started to all his  proposals as he could not possibly surmount  though he plainly perceived  they were no other than specious pretexts to cover the mortifying side  of a refusal  Exasperated  therefore  at this lack of sincerity and  gratitude   I can easily foresee   said he   that such difficulties will  never be wanting  when I have anything to ask  and for that reason  will save myself the trouble of any further application   So saying  he  withdrew in a very abrupt manner  breathing defiance and revenge  But  his patron  who did not think proper to drive him to extremities  found  means to persuade his honour to do something for the pacification of  the young man s choler  and that same evening our adventurer received a  message from his lordship  desiring to see him immediately   In consequence of this intimation  Pickle went to his house  and  appeared before him with a very cloudy aspect  which signified to whom  it might concern  that his temper was at present too much galled to  endure reproof  and therefore the sagacious peer forbore taking him to  task for his behaviour during the audience he had obtained  but gave him  to understand  that the minister  in consideration of his services  had  sent him a bank note of three hundred pounds  with a promise of the like  sum yearly  until he could be otherwise provided for  This declaration  in some measure appeased the youth  who condescended to accept the  present  and  next levee day  made his acknowledgment to the donor   who favoured him with a smile of infinite complacency  which entirely  dissipated all the remains of his resentment  for  as he could not  possibly divine the true cause of his being temporized with  he looked  upon this condescension as an undoubted proof of Sir Steady s sincerity   and firmly believed that he would settle him in some place with the  first opportunity  rather than continue to pay this pension out of his  own pocket  In all probability  his prediction would have been verified   had not an unforeseen accident in a moment overwhelmed the barque of his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   interest at court   Meanwhile  this short gleam of good fortune recalled the ideas of pride  and ambition which he had formerly cherished  His countenance was again  lifted up  his good humour retrieved  and his mien reexalted  Indeed  he  began to be considered as a rising man by his fellow dependents  who saw  the particular notice with which he was favoured at the public levee   and some of them  for that reason  were at pains to court his good  graces  He no longer shunned his former intimates  with whom a good  part of his fortune had been spent
