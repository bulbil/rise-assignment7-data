guilty of some absurdity   You know that I am not less than him a despiser of the multitude  you know that I equally detest flattery to the great  yet so many circumstances have concurred to give a lustre to the latter part of the present English monarch s reign  that I cannot withhold my contribution of praise  I cannot avoid the acknowledging the crowd for once just  in their unanimous approbation   Yet think not that battles gained  dominion extended  or enemies brought to submission  are the virtues which at present claim my admiration  Were the reigning monarch only famous for his victories  I should regard his character with indifference  the boast of heroism in this enlightened age is justly regarded as a qualification of a very subordinate rank  and mankind now begin to look with becoming horror on these foes to man    160 the virtue in this aged monarch which I have at present in view  is one of a much more exalted nature  is one of the most difficult of attainment  is the least praised of all kingly virtues  and yet deserves the greatest praise  the virtue I mean is JUSTICE  a strict administration of justice  without severity and without favour   Of all virtues this is the most difficult to be practised by a king who has a power to pardon  All men  even tyrants themselves  lean to mercy when unbiassed by passions or interest  the heart naturally persuades to forgiveness and pursuing the dictates of this pleasing deceiver  we are led to prefer our private satisfaction to public utility  what a thorough love for the public  what a strong command over the passions  what a finely conducted judgment must he possess who opposes the dictates of reason to those of his heart  and prefers the future interest of his people to his own immediate satisfaction   If still to a man s own natural biass for tenderness  we add the numerous solicitations made by a criminal s friends for mercy  if we survey a king not only opposing his own feelings  but reluctantly refusing those he regards  and this to satisfy the public  whose cries he may never hear  whose gratitude he may never receive  this surely is true greatness  Let us fancy ourselves for a moment in this just old man s place  surrounded by numbers  all soliciting the same favour  a favour that nature disposes us to grant  where the inducements to pity are laid before us in the strongest light  suppliants at our feet  some ready to resent a refusal  none opposing a compliance    161 let us  I say  suppose ourselves in such a situation  and I fancy we should find ourselves more apt to act the character of good natured men than of upright magistrates   What contributes to raise justice above all other kingly virtues is  that it is seldom attended with a due share of applause  and those who practise it must be influenced by greater motives than empty fame  the people are generally well pleased with a remission of punishment  and all that wears the appearance of humanity  it is the wise alone who are capable of discerning that impartial justice is the truest mercy  they know it to be difficult very difficult at once to compassionate  and yet condemn an object that pleads for tenderness   I have been led into this common place train of thought by a late striking instance in this country of the impartiality of justice  and of the king s inflexible resolution of inflicting punishment where it was justly due  A man of the first quality in a fit either of passion  melancholy  or madness  murdered his servant  it was expected that his station in life would have lessened the ignominy of his punishment  however  he was arraigned  condemned  and underwent the same degrading death with the meanest malefactor  It was well considered that virtue alone is true nobility  and that he whose actions sink him even beneath the vulgar  has no right to those distinctions which should be the rewards only of merit  it was perhaps considered that crimes were more heinous among the higher classes of people  as necessity exposes them to fewer temptations     162Over all the east  even China not excepted  a person of the same quality guilty of such a crime  might  by giving up a share of his fortune to the judge  buy off his sentence  there are several countries even in Europe  where the servant is entirely the property of his master  if a slave kills his lord  he dies by the most excruciating tortures  but if the circumstances are reversed  a small fine buys off the punishment of the offender  Happy the country where all are equal  and where those who sit as judges have too much integrity to receive a bribe  and too much honour to pity from a similitude of the prisoner s title or circumstances with their own  Such is England  yet think not that it was always equally famed for this strict impartiality  There was a time even here when titles softned the rigours of the law  when dignified wretches were suffered to live  and continue for years an equal disgrace to justice and nobility   To this day in a neighbouring country  the great are often most scandalously pardoned for the most scandalous offences  A person is
