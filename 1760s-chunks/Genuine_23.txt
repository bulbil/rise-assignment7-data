an interview with her new lover  by means of a pretended indisposition  when her parents went to pay a visit  and Mr  JOHNSON S gaining over to his interest a neighbouring farmer and his wife  so as to connive at their house being made the scene of their first joys   They met by appointment at the house of assignation  and were received by the farmer s wife  who after she had served them with tea  directly left the room  and consequently the lovers by themselves  I shall not be very particular with respect to what passed at this interview  but content myself with observing  that Mr  JOHNSON said and did so many obliging things  that the young lady was quite enchanted with him  and at parting longed for a repetition of his kindnesses  They could not procure such interviews so often as she desired  for fear of creating a suspicion  which Mr  JOHNSON most cautiously avoided  But some few more such   110 they had  However  she soon found that love is more cloying to men than women  as cool indifference soon discovered itself in young Johnson  who grew tired of her father s house  and pretending business in London  that required his immediate attendance took his leave  and left his charmer    to think on what was passed  and sigh alone   She began now to entertain a relish for variety  and therefore did not much regret the loss of Mr  Johnson  This passion  which she had in process of time in as great a degree as any of the sex  was soon gratified with another gallant  who had equal influence over her     Not long after the departure of Mr  Johnson  she was invited to a ball in the house of a neighbouring gentleman  where it fell out that a young lieutenant was her partner   A handsome fellow  and a red coat  could not fail of pleasing her  as she discovered  not only by his looks  but several squeezes of the hand  unperceived by   111 the rest of the company  that he saw her in as favourable a light as she did him   The dance had not continued long  when se was seized with an odd indisposition  which made her declare a resolution of going home immediately  Her partner  after having expressed his concern  offered to see her home  which she with seeming reluctance accepted   It was a very fine evening  and as they walked through a solitary path  she perceived that he had his arms about her waist  but did not expostulate with him on the liberty he took  or endeavour to disengage herself   Indeed she then wanted some body to support her  and therefore leaned on her conductor s arm  and thus they proceeded  till they came to the house of the farmer above mentioned  upon which  she desired to go in  and take something to revive her spirits  they accordingly entered  and were immediately conducted into the room that had been the scene of her former stolen delights  by the woman of   112 the house  and the young lady soon after received a cordial from the hands of the young officer  that entirely dispelled her indisposition   If curiosity should excite in any reader a desire to know what this cordial was  information is given  that it was a glass of ratafia  and a dram is allowable to the most delicate lady for the preservation or health  or expulsion of disorders  As she did not think it adviseable to go any farther with the young officer  she signified her intention  and he immediately took his leave  The farmer s son was hereupon dispatched with an account of the accident that had befallen Miss  and the chaise was sent to convey her home  She acted her part so well on this occasion  that her parents entertained not the least suspicion  but from a concern for her health  did all in their power to relieve her  though all their efforts had not half the efficacy as the glass of ratafia administered to her by the lieutenant at the farmer s house     113After a variety of adventures  she at last came to London  where  after meeting with several vicissitudes  she was at length taken into keeping by Captain R—rts  of whom  as we have before observed  Miss ELLIOT had made a conquest   Her new lover s other mistress saw  with the greatest indignation  her rival clasped in the arms of her admirer  and resolved to take ample revenge on her for it  She invented several ways to effect her design  but none met with success  At length  tired with disappointments  she took the wicked resolution of seeking to take away the life of our heroine  by administering to her deadly poison  which she endeavoured to do in the following manner   As our heroine and she could not be supposed to be very intimate  as they were rivals  she one day sent Miss ELLIOT a very polite card  desiring her to forget all animosities that might have passed between them on account of Captain R—rts  and furthermore told her  that she was willing to give up all her right in him to   114 the more prevailing charms of Miss ELLIOT
