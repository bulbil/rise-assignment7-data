ever seeing        more  My brother has just given me an account of the death of        honest Mr  Goodman  and  as I doubt not but you are very much        concerned  as indeed we all have reason to be  for the loss of so        sincere and valuable a friend  I am very impatient to see you  and        give you what consolation is in my power  but the fatigue of my        journey  after so long an illness  requires my taking some        immediate repose  I shall  however  wait on you to morrow morning         till when  believe me  as ever  with the greatest sincerity  dear        sister  your affectionate brother  and humble servant            F  THOUGHTLESS            P S  My brother purposes to come with me  but if any thing should        happen to prevent his visit  you may depend on one from me  Once        more  my dear sister  good night        In the present situation of Miss Betsy s mind  she could not have   received a more sensible satisfaction  than what she felt on this young   gentleman s arrival  but what ensued upon it will in due time and place   appear                CHAPTER II       Contains only some few particulars of little moment in themselves  but   serve to usher in matters of more importance          Mr  Goodman  who  both living and dying  had sincerely at heart the   welfare of all with whom he had any concern  could not content himself   to leave the world without giving to those who had been under his care   such advice as he thought necessary for their future happiness       Accordingly  the day preceding that which happened to be his last  he   sent for Mr  Thoughtless  and on his being come  and seated by his   bedside  he took his hand  and began to remonstrate to him in the most   pathetick  though very gentle  terms  how unjustifiable to the eyes of   Heaven  how disreputable to those of the world  it was to avow and   indulge  in the publick manner he did  an unwarrantable flame        I never was severe   said he   in censuring the frailties of youth and   nature  but think the claim they have to pardon consists chiefly in an   endeavour to conceal them  when gloried in  they lose the name of   frailties  and become vices  besides  others by our example might be   emboldened to offend  and  if so  what are we but accessary to their   faults  and answerable for them  as well as for our own  You are at   present   continued he   the head of your family  have a large estate    are young  handsome  accomplished  in fine  have all the requisites to   make a shining character in life  and to be a service and an honour to   your country  How great a pity would it be  that such a stock of   fortune s blessings  such present benefits  and such glorious   expectations  should all be squandered in the purchase of one guilty   pleasure        He then proceeded to a short discussion of the difference between a   lawful and an unlawful communication between the sexes  he expatiated on   the wife and laudable institution of marriage  the solid comforts   arising from that state  in the choice of a worthy partner  the many   advantages of an honourable alliance  the serene and lasting pleasures   to be found in the society of a faithful  discreet  and endearing   companion   A wife   said he  with a sigh  which the memory of his own   hard fate drew from him   may sometimes be bad  but a mistress we are   sure is never good  her very character denies all confidence to be   reposed in her  it is the interest of a wife to secure the honour of her   husband  because she must suffer in his disgrace  a mistress  having no   reputation of her own  regards not that of her keeper  It is the   interest of a wife to be frugal of her husband s substance  because she   must be a sharer in those misfortunes which the want of economy creates    but is the interest of a mistress to sell her
