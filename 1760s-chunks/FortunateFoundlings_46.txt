have trusted him with the dearest secrets of his   life  provided they related to himself alone  but he had given his word    his oath  his honour to Charlotta  and durst not violate them on any   consideration  yet  loth to refuse or to deceive his friend  he found   himself in the most perplexing dilemma  As often as the other spoke of   Charlotta  he answered with something of de Coigney  but all his   artifice was ineffectual  and the baron at last saw thro  it  and   assuming a very grave countenance  I perceive  Horatio  said he  you do   not think me worthy your confidence  and I was to blame to press you to   reveal what you resolve to make a mystery of       These words made a very deep impression on the grateful soul of him they   were addressed to  and equally distressed between the necessity of   either disobliging a person whose generosity he had experienced  or   falsifying the promise he had made to Charlotta  at last an expedient   offered to his mind how to avoid both  and yet not be guilty of injuring   the truth       Alas  my lord  answered he  you little know the heart of Horatio  if you   imagine there be any thing there that would hide itself from you   I   freely confess  the charms of mademoiselle Charlotta had such an effect   on me  that  had I been in circumstances which in the least could have   flattered me with success  I should long ago have avowed myself her   lover  but when I reflected on the disparity between us  the humour of   her father  and a thousand other impediments  I endeavoured to banish so   hopeless a passion from my breast  and was the more confirmed in my   resolution to do so by the ill treatment monsieur de Coigney   received   besides  her removal from St  Germains  depriving me in a   great measure of those opportunities I had before of entertaining her    might very well contribute to wean off a passion  not settled either by   time or expectation  of ever being gratified  and I hope  continued he    I shall always have so much command over myself as not to become   ridiculous by aiming at impossibilities       Whether the baron gave any credit to what he said on this account or   not  he had too much politeness to press him any farther  and the   discourse soon after taking another turn  Horatio was very well pleased   to think he had got off so well       De la Valiere having related to him some particulars of the late   campaign  which the public accounts had been deficient in  they passed   from that to some talk of the brave young king of Sweden  a topic which   filled all Europe with admiration  but the French being a people in whom   the love of glory is the predominant passion  were more than any other   nation charmed with the greatness of that prince s soul       What indeed has any hero of antiquity to boast of in competition with   this northern monarch  who conquered and gave away kingdoms for the   benefit of others  disdaining to receive any other reward for all his   vast fatigues  than the pleasure of giving a people that person whom he   judged most worthy to reign over them       The baron  who had attended the Count de Guiscard when he was   residentiary ambassador from his most christian majesty at the Swedish   court  had an opportunity of seeing more of this monarch than any other   that Horatio was acquainted with  he therefore  on his requesting it    informed him how  at the age of eighteen  he threw off all magnificence    forsook the pomp and delicacies of a court he had been bred in  and   undertook  and compleated the delivery of his brother in law  the duke   of Holstein  from the cruel incursions of the Danes  who had well nigh   either taken or ravaged the greatest part of his territories  He also   set forth  in its proper colours  the base part which Peter Alexowitz    czar of Muscovy  and Augustus  king of Poland  acted against a prince   who was then employing his arms in the cause of justice  the latter of   these bringing a powerful army to take from him one part of his   dominions  and the former  at the head of an 100 000 men  were   plundering the other  but when he concluded his little narrative  by   reciting how this young conqueror  with a handful of brave Swedes    animated by the example of their king  put entirely to route all that   opposed him  Horatio felt his soul glow with an ardour superior even to
