wound on my heart  which not even the hand of time itself has been able to heal     Page  155  What have thy misfortunes been  said Cozro  that are not common to all the race of man  Oh  I have had innumerable griefs  said ← Nourjahad →   After a short enjoyment  during my fatal slumbers  the grave robbed me of Mandana  whilst she was yet in the bloom of youth and beauty  I lamented her death  tears and heaviness of heart were my portion for many days  Yet remembering that sorrow would not recall the dead  I suffered myself to be comforted  and sought for consolation in the society of my other women  and the fond and innocent caresses of an infant son  whom Mandana left me  Joy and tranquillity revisited my dwelling  and new pleasures courted my acceptance  but they again  Page  156  eluded my grasp  and in one night  for so it appeared to me  my son like an unnatural viper  forgetting all my tenderness  plundered and deserted me  The two faithful friends in whom I most confided  had closed their eyes for ever  and the beauties of my seraglio  whom I had last beheld fresh and charming as the lillies of the field  I now saw deformed with wrinkles and bending under the infirmities of age     Yet these afflictions I surmounted  and resolved once more to be happy  And wert thou so  interrupted Cozro  No  replied ← Nourjahad →   the treacherous joys deceived me  yet I still looked forward with hope  but now awake  Page  157  to fresh disappointment  I find myself abandoned by those whose false professions of love had lulled me into security  and I rouse myself like a savage beast in the desart  whose paths are shunned by all the children of men     ← Nourjahad → could not conclude this speech without a groan  that seemed to rend his heart     As thou art  said Cozro  exempt from punishment hereafter  dost thou think also to escape the miseries of this life  Mistaken man  know  that the righteous Being  whose ordinances thou defyest  will even here take vengeance on thy crimes  And if thou wilt look back on  Page  158  thy past life  thou wilt find  for I have heard thy story  that every one of those several ills of which thou complainest  were sent as scourges to remind thee of thy duty  and inflicted immediately after the commission of some notorious breach of it     The death of Mandana was preceded by a brutal fit of drunkenness  by which  contrary to the laws of our prophet  thou sufferedst thyself to be overtaken  Then it was thy good genius  to punish thee  plunged thee into that temporary death  from which thou didst awake to grief and disappointment  But thou madest no use of the admonition  but didst permit thyself to be again swallowed  Page  159  up by intemperance  and not content to tread the ordinary paths of vice  thou turnedst out of the road  to the commission of a crime  to which thou couldst have no temptation  but the pride and licentiousness of thy heart  Thy profanation of our holy religion  in presuming to personate our great prophet  and make thy concubines represent the virgins of paradise  was immediately chastised as it deserved  by a second time depriving thee of those faculties  which thou didst prostitute to such vile purposes     The ills with which thou foundest thyself surrounded on awaking from thy trance  served to no other purpose than  Page  160  to stir up thy resentment against the power who governed thy life  And instead of reforming thy wickedness  thou soughtest out new ways of rendering thyself still more obnoxious to the wrath of Heaven  In the wantonness of thy cruelty  thou stainedst thy hand in blood  and that same night  were thy eyelids sealed up by the avenging hand of thy watchful genius  and thy depraved senses consigned for twenty years to oblivion  See then  continued Cozro  if a life which is to be a continued round of crimes and punishments in alternate succession  is a gift worthy to be desired by a wise man  for assure thyself  Oh ← Nourjahad →   that by the immutable laws of heaven one is to be a constant concomitant  Page  161  of the other  and that either in this world or the next  vice will meet its just reward     Alas  replied ← Nourjahad →   thou hast awakened in me a remorse of which I was never sensible before  I look back with shame on the detested use I have made of those extraordinary gifts vouchsafed me by my guardian spirit     What shall I do  Oh Cozro  to expiate the offences I have committed  For though I have no dread of punishment hereafter  yet does that aetherial spark within  inspire me with such horror for my former crimes  that all the vain delights which this world can afford me   Page  162  will not restore my mind to peace  till by a series of good actions I have atoned
