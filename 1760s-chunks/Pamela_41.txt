had three   lyings in  it seems  in his house  in three months past  one by himself    and one by his coachman  and one by his woodman  and yet he has turned   none of them away  Indeed  how can he  when they but follow his own vile   example  There is he  and two or three more such as he  within ten miles   of us  who keep company  and hunt with our fine master  truly  and I   suppose he is never the better for their examples  But  Heaven bless me    say I  and send me out of this wicked house       But  dear father and mother  what sort of creatures must the womenkind   be  do you think  to give way to such wickedness  Why  this it is that   makes every one be thought of alike  And  alack a day  what a world we   live in  for it is grown more a wonder that the men are resisted  than   that the women comply  This  I suppose  makes me such a sauce box  and   bold face  and a creature  and all because I won t be a sauce box and   bold face indeed       But I am sorry for these things  one don t know what arts and stratagems   men may devise to gain their vile ends  and so I will think as well as   I can of these poor undone creatures  and pity them  For you see  by my   sad story  and narrow escapes  what hardships poor maidens go through    whose lot it is to go out to service  especially to houses where there   is not the fear of God  and good rule kept by the heads of the family       You see I am quite grown grave and serious  indeed it becomes the   present condition of Your dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER XXVIII         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       John says you wept when you read my last letter  that he carried  I am   sorry you let him see that  for they all mistrust already how matters   are  and as it is no credit that I have been attempted  though it is   that I have resisted  yet I am sorry they have cause to think so evil of   my master from any of us       Mrs  Jervis has made up her accounts with Mr  Longman  and will stay in   her place  I am glad of it  for her own sake  and for my master s  for   she has a good master of him  so indeed all have  but poor me  and he   has a good housekeeper in her       Mr  Longman  it seems  took upon him to talk to my master  how faithful   and careful of his interests she was  and how exact in her accounts    and he told him  there was no comparison between her accounts and Mrs    Jewkes s  at the Lincolnshire estate       He said so many fine things  it seems  of Mrs  Jervis  that my master   sent for her in Mr  Longman s presence  and said Pamela might come along   with her  I suppose to mortify me  that I must go while she was to stay    But as  when I go away  I am not to go with her  nor was she to go with   me  so I did not matter it much  only it would have been creditable to   such a poor girl  that the housekeeper would bear me company  if I went       Said he to her  Well  Mrs  Jervis  Longman says you have made up your   accounts with him with your usual fidelity and exactness  I had a good   mind to make you an offer of continuing with me  if you can be a little   sorry for your hasty words  which  indeed  were not so respectful as   I have deserved at your hands  She seemed at a sad loss what to say    because Mr  Longman was there  and she could not speak of the occasion   of those words  which was me       Indeed  said Mr  Longman  I must needs say before your face  that since   I have known my master s family  I have never found such good management   in it  nor so much love and harmony neither  I wish the Lincolnshire   estate was as well served   No more of that  said my master  but Mrs    Jervis may stay  if she will  and here  Mrs  Jervis  pray accept of
