    43Well  Harriot  and what do you think now—had not I an astonishing command of myself never once to interrupt him during so long an address —I really think I had—but  some how  he was so respectful  and so manly  so delicately timid  yet so generously importunate  that  for the life of me  I could not say a syllable by way of reply —A man of less breeding would have been insolent at seeing me so confused  would have rudely stared me in the face  and endeavoured to read the sentiments of my heart in the various changes of my countenance—perhaps too he would have expected one of my best curt sies  and imagined that I ought to bid him go  in polite terms  to my father  Sir Robert Harold  my dear Harriot  is a lover of quite a different stamp—the more encouragement he meets  the more respectful he appears  and interprets your silence into a meaning so refined    44 as prevents the least violence from reaching your sensibility —Pray Heaven  Harriot  I do not prove too fond of him—But  my dear girl  adieu for the present—and believe me to be  with the most unalterable attachment   Your own LOUISA MILDMAY     45  LETTER IV  Sir ROBERT HAROLD to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    WELL  Charles  I am just this instant come from the old gentleman—he and I came to an agreement in a moment  and he was so highly delighted with my proposal  that he even threw in a much greater addition to the girl s fortune than I could in conscience have expected—He has been a saving close fisted codger  he tells me  these thirty years  and has had some considerable windfalls from his wife s family  he therefore can afford to give his daughter a good forty thousand pounds  as he has no other child but his son  who will be amply provided for by the family estate  and other valuable contingencies—and thus  Charles  is your friend in the high road to matrimony  a month from this day is set   46 apart for the celebration of the nuptials—and the old gentleman has insisted upon my passing the last fortnight of that term at his house in Oxfordshire   When we had thus agreed about setting the lawyers immediately to work  and providing the wedding cloaths  I was introduced in form to Louisa  who  to do her justice  was scarce a remove from a divinity—Her naturally fine complexion was deepened with a most enchanting glow of consciousness  and the delicious sensibility that swam in her charming black eyes  gave her  in my opinion  an air which rendered her wholly irresistable —She received my salute with dignity  yet with condescension  and the obliging old people  very properly judging their absence would be infinitely more agreeable than their company  withdrew in a little time  and gave me an opportunity of thanking   47 her in the most passionate terms for making me the happiest of mankind —She was pleased  I could plainly see  with my emotion—yet she laboured under all that distress which a delicate woman is sure to feel upon the prospect of so important a change in her condition—I therefore took my leave as soon as possible  to give her an opportunity of recovering her spirits  but not before I had previously obtained her permission to drink tea with her in the evening   And now  Charles  that the affair is thus far adjusted  let me honestly open my whole heart to you—I scarcely care a single sixpence whether or no it be ever brought to a conclusion —My marriage with this young lady is rather the result of my conviction than the consequence of my choice—and I find my vanity infinitely more gratified in running away with such a prize from a   48 crowd of contending admirers  than my happiness promoted in obtaining it for myself  With all my turn for dissipation  I am nevertheless thoroughly satisfied that  till a man becomes domesticated  he never can enjoy an hour of real content —The pleasures which arise from an unlimitted course of amour  even where a man is best received  never compensates for the trouble he is obliged to undergo in the prosecution  and he has this constant mortification to check the tide of his transport  that the woman to whom he is most strenuously attached is frequently entitled to his abhorrence  and always to his contempt—In proportion as she adds to his pleasure she must sink in his esteem  for before she can manifest a compliance to his wishes  she must burst through every restraint of decorum and delicacy  and sacrifice all regard to her own character and the honour of her family —A   49 woman thus lost to sentiment is below the consideration of any sensible man—therefore the sooner we get out of this uncomfortable track  the sooner we lay a probable foundation for our own happiness —I am now eight and twenty years old  Melmoth  and it is high time for me to think of getting sons and daughters for myself  instead of wasting my time to increase the families of other people—Besides  I am weary of venturing my life every moment to gratify the licentious disposition of a pack of women  who are more despicable in my opinion  and less attached to my person  than many of the mercenary poor creatures  whom I can purchase for
