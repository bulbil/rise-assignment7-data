your ladyship s esteem       Did I not tell you  Jackey  said she  that I should have a wit to talk   to   He  who swears like a fine gentleman at every word  rapped out an   oath  and said  drolling  I think  Mrs  Pamela  if I may be so bold as   to say so  you should know you are speaking to Lady Davers   Sir  said   I  I hope there was no need of your information  and so I can t thank   you for it  and am sorry you seem to think it wants an oath to convince   me of the truth of it       He looked more foolish than I  at this  if possible  not expecting such   a reprimand   And said  at last  Why  Mrs  Pamela  you put me half out   of countenance with your witty reproof   Sir  said I  you seem quite a   fine gentleman  and it will not be easily done  I dare say       How now  pert one  said my lady  do you know whom you talk to   I think   I do not  madam  replied I  and for fear I should forget myself more    I ll withdraw  Your ladyship s servant  said I  and was going  but she   rose  and gave me a push  and pulled a chair  and  setting the back   against the door  sat down in it       Well  said I  I can bear anything at your ladyship s hands  but I was   ready to cry though  And I went  and sat down  and fanned myself  at the   other end of the room       Her woman  who stood all the time  said softly  Mrs  Pamela  you should   not sit in my lady s presence  And my lady  though she did not hear her    said  You shall sit down  child  in the room where I am  when I give you   leave       So I stood up  and said  When your ladyship will hardly permit me to   stand  one might be indulged to sit down  But I ask you  said she    Whither your master is gone  To one Mr  Carlton  madam  about eighteen   miles off  who is very sick  And when does he come home   This evening    madam  And where are you going  To a gentleman s house in the town    madam   And how was you to go  In the chariot  madam   Why  you must   be a lady in time  to be sure   I believe you d become a chariot mighty   well  child   Was you ever out in it with your master       Pray  your ladyship  said I  a little too pertly  perhaps  be pleased to   ask half a dozen such questions together  because one answer may do for   all   Why  bold face  said she  you ll forget your distance  and bring   me to your level before my time       I could no longer refrain tears  but said  Pray your ladyship  let me   ask what I have done  to be thus severely treated  I never did your   ladyship any harm  And if you think I am deceived  as you was pleased to   hint  I should be more entitled to your pity  than your anger       She rose  and took me by the hand  and led me to her chair  and then sat   down  and still holding my hand  said  Why Pamela  I did indeed pity   you while I thought you innocent  and when my brother seized you  and   brought you down hither  without your consent  I was concerned for you    and I was still more concerned for you  and loved you  when I heard of   your virtue and resistance  and your laudable efforts to get away from   him  But when  as I fear  you have suffered yourself to be prevailed   upon  and have lost your innocence  and added another to the number   of the fools he has ruined   This shocked me a little   I cannot help   shewing my displeasure to you       Madam  replied I  I must beg no hasty judgment  I have not lost my   innocence   Take care  take care  Pamela  said she  don t lose your   veracity  as well as your honour   Why are you here  when you are at   full liberty to go whither you please   I will make one proposal to you
