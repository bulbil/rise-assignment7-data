conversation could have made  my life agreeable    I often expostulated with him on his malignant behaviour  protesting  my desire of living peaceably with him  and begging he would not lay  me under the necessity of changing my measures  He was deaf to all  my remonstrances  though I warned him more than once of the event   persisted in his maxims of persecution  and  after repeated quarrels  I  again left his house fully determined to suffer all sorts of extremity   rather than subject myself to the tyranny of his disposition    This year was productive of one fatal event  which I felt with  the utmost sensibility of sorrow  and I shall always remember with  regret   I mean the death of Mr  B    with whom I had constantly  maintained an intimate correspondence since the first commencement of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   our acquaintance  He was one of the most valuable men  and promised  to be one of the brightest ornaments that this or any other age had  produced  I enjoyed his friendship without reserve  and such was the  confidence he reposed in my integrity  from long experience of my truth   that he often said he would believe my bare assertion  even though it  should contradict the evidence of his own senses  These being the terms  upon which we lived  it is not to be supposed that I bore the loss of  him without repining  Indeed  my grief was unspeakable  and  though the  edge of it be now smoothed by the lenient hand of time  I shall never  cease to cherish his memory with the most tender remembrance    During the last period of my living with my lord  I had agreed to the  expediency of obtaining an act of parliament  which would enable him to  pay his debts  on which occasion there was a necessity of cancelling a  deed that subsisted between us  relating to a separate maintenance  to  which  on certain provisions  I was entitled  and this was to be set  aside  so far as it interfered with the above mentioned scheme  while  the rest of it should remain in force  When this affair was about to  be transacted  my lord very generously insisted upon my concurrence in  annulling the whole settlement  and  when I refused to comply with this  demand  because this was the sole resource I had against his ill usage   he would not proceed in the execution of his plan  though  by dropping  it  he hurt nobody but himself  and he accused me of having receded from  my word  after I had drawn him into considerable expense    This imputation of breaking my word  which I defy the whole world to  prove I ever did  incensed me the more  as I myself had proposed the  scheme for his service  although I knew the accomplishment of it would  endanger the validity of my own settlement  and my indignation was still  more augmented by the behaviour of Mr  G    who had always professed  a regard for my interest  and upon my last accommodation with my lord   undertaken to effect a reconciliation between my father and me  but   when he was questioned about the particulars of this difference  and  desired to declare whether his lordship or I was to blame  he declined  the office of arbitrator  refused to be explicit upon the subject  and  by certain shrewd hums and ha s  signified his disapprobation of my  conduct  Yet this very man  when I imparted to him  in confidence  my  intention of making another retreat  and frankly asked his opinion of  my design  seemed to acquiesce in the justice of it in these remarkable  words   Madam  if I thought or had hopes of my lord growing better  I  would down on my knees to desire you to stay  but  as I have not  I say  nothing     If he connived at my conduct in this particular  why should he  disapprove of it when all I asked was but common justice  But he was  a dependant  and therefore I excuse his phlegmatic  not to call it  unfriendly  behaviour  Indeed  he could not be too cautious of giving  offence to his lordship  who sometimes made him feel the effects of that  wrath which other people had kindled  particularly in consequence of a  small adventure which happened about this very period of time    A very agreeable  sprightly  good natured young man  a near relation of  my lord  happening to be at our house one evening  when there was a fire  in the neighbourhood  we agreed to go and sup at the tavern en famille   and  having spent the evening with great mirth and good humour  this  young gentleman  who was naturally facetious  in taking his leave   saluted us all round  My lord  who had before entertained some jealousy    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of his kinsman  was very much provoked by
