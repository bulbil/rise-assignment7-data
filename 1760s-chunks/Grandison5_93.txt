your pleasure  No man loves his country better than I do  But you will induce me to love it still better  if by your compliance with my earnest request  you shall be able to obtain either health or pleasure from a twelvemonth s residence in it  Oblige me  my dear Lords  oblige me  madam  were it but to give yourselves a new relish to your own country and palace on your return  Our summers have not your fervid sun  Our commerce gives us  in the highest perfection  all your justly boasted autumnal fruits  Nor are our winters so cold as yours  Oblige me  for the approaching winter only  and stay longer  as you shall find inclination   Dearest Grandison  said Jeronymo  I will accept of your invitation the moment I am told that I may undertake the journey—  The journey  my Lord  interrupted I —Your cabin shall be made near as convenient to you  as your chamber  You shall be set ashore within half a league of my house in London  God give us a pleasant voyage  and in a few days time  you will not know  except by amended health and spirits  that you are not in this your own chamber   Surely  said the General  my sister was right in her apprehensions  that she should not be able to continue a Catholic  had she been this man s  I wish you  my Lord  you  madam  and Jeronymo  would go  You have had a long course of fatigues and troubles  You love the Chevalier  Winter with him  however  I have heard much of the efficacy of the English baths  Clementina must not go  My wife and I will make her as happy as possible in your absence  And take Grandison at his word  Bring him  and his sisters  back with you  Their Lords  I understand  have been among us  They will not be sorry to visit Italy a second time  as  no doubt  they are men of taste—But when  Chevalier  do you think of going   Page  233 The sooner the better  were it but to take advantage of the fine season  It will be but what mariners call a trip to England  You will make me very happy  You can have no other way of discharging the obligations you are so sollicitous about  I will return with you  The health of Lady Clementina  I flatter myself  will be quite confirmed by that time  Signor Jeronymo  I hope  will be restored likewise  What joy shall we be enabled to give one another —  They took only till the morning to consult  and give me an answer   LETTER XXXVIII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   MR  Lowther and his collegues  having been consulted  gave it as their opinion  that Jeronymo might be removed by litter to the nearest sea port  and there embark for England  but that it is most eligible to stay till the next spring  by which time they hope the two old wounds may be safely cicatrized  and the new one only kept open   But they all engaged  that then not only Jeronymo  and the two young Lords  but some others of the family  will be my guests in England  and  in the mean time  that the Bishop and Father Marescotti will in turn correspond with me  and acquaint me with all that passes here   Clementina drank chocolate with us  She had been made acquainted with their determination  and approved of the promises of a visit to be made me next year  by some of the principals of the family  What a hard circumstance is it  whispered she  as she sat next me  that the person who would be most willing to go  and I flatter myself  would not be the least welcome  must not be of the company  I should have been glad to have made one visit to the country where the Chevalier Grandison was born   Page  234 And what a perverseness  thought I  is there in custom  that would not permit this kind explicitness in Lady Clementina  were she not determined to consider the brother  in the man before her  rather than a still nearer relation  By how many ways  my dear Dr  Bartlett  may delicate minds express a denial —Negatives need not to be frowningly given  nor affirmatives blushingly pronounced   Jeronymo and I being left alone  he challenged me on the visible concern which he  and every one  as he said  saw in my countenance  on the turn his sister had taken  Had it not been in my heart  he was sure it would not have been there   Can you wonder at it  my dear friend  said I  When I came over  greatly as I thought of your sister  I did not think she had been so great  as she has shewn herself  I admired her ever  but I now more than admire her  Taught to hope  as I was  and so unexpectedly disappointed  as I have been  I must have been more than man  were I not very much affected   No doubt but you must  and I am
