 My mother is now more than ever confirmed in her opinion  that the poor young creature has been deceived  and she prays  that Mr Faulkland may not be overtaken with a judgment  which she thinks nothing but his marrying the girl can avert   November 10  We have at length fixed upon a house to our liking  a handsome convenient one in St James’s street  We are preparing to get it furnished as fast as we can  that we may go into it  for if my brother should come to town  I know our being with my mother will be an objection    to his lodging in her house  this I should be sorry for  as she told him he might make use of it while it remained in her hands   November 15  Thank my stars  I have got over the fatigue of receiving and paying a second round of bridal visits  and I am really so tired of it  that  uninviting as the season is  I could wish myself in quiet at Arnold abbey  but I cannot think of leaving London while my mother continues in it  and she is now resolved to do so till Miss Burchell  or rather  on this occasion  Mrs Jefferis  is brought to bed  You can’t imagine how sollicitous she is about her  every time she sees her she seems more and more pleased with her  I am very glad it has happened so  for the poor young woman’s sake  my mother is as warm in her attachments as in her resentments  She visits her almost every second day  for the poor thing it seems is ill at present  and can’t leave her chamber  She tells me she is extremely melancholy  and seems much to dread the approaching hour  I greatly honour my mother for her humanity towards her  in her terrifying situation she must want the tenderness of a well bred as well as a sensible friend  for it must be a melancholy thing  in such circumstances  to have no one about her but servants  and those strangers too   She told my mother  that her altered looks  and frequent sicknesses  gave her aunt  who was privy to the cause of it  a pretence for asking her uncle’s permission for Miss to go to Bath  which she told him would do her more good than any thing  He consented  and supposed she was actually gone thither under the care of a lady  whom her aunt named  who was really going there in order to settle for life  and to whose house she went for a day or two to give a colour to this story  Her aunt contrived that she should not take any servant with her  giving it for a reason  that as she might be as well attended by the lady’s servants with whom she lodged  and be considered by her as one of the family  a maid would only be an unnecessary incumbrance  She added  that her uncle was so afflicted with the gout  that he never stirred abroad  and saw very little company  so that it was not likely he should ever be undeceived   November 20  We have just received a very odd piece of news  that I own has a little alarmed me  It is  that the widow of Mr Arnold’s brother is found to be with child  There was no mention of this at the time her husband    died  nor indeed any cause to suspect it  but the strongest presumptions in the world to the contrary  as her husband and she lived a part  It has not been even whispered  till since our arrival in town  The lady pretends that she was not conscious of it herself till within this fortnight  yet her husband has been dead four months  This I am told is very possible  though not very common  She has herself wrote a letter to Mr Arnold  to inform him of it  at the same time declaring  that she and her late husband had been reconciled a little before his death  and that  had he recovered  she was to have lived with him again  All this is very strange  The elder Mr Arnold killed himself with excessive drinking  His death approached him by slow degrees  but as he could never be persuaded to think it near  he took not the least care either of his spiritual or temporal concerns  His brother was in the country when he was seized with his last illness  which he had precipitated by some extravagant excess  He was almost at the last extremity before he could be prevailed on to let a physician attend him  or suffer his brother to be sent for  In regard to the latter  he told those about him  that as he was his heir  of course he had made no will  He mentioned not his wife  The jointure which had been settled on her  he allowed her for a separate maintenance  They had for a long time pursued separate pleasures  and none of his friends knew that they had ever met  or so much as seen one another from the time they parted  My Mr Arnold arrived in town just time enough to close his brother’s eyes  he was speechless when he came  and expired in less than an
