gratitude  which at length broke out in acknowledgments of my own unworthiness  and encomiums on his benevolence —I could not even help shedding tears  at the goodness of this noble lord  who no sooner perceived them  than he caught me in his arms  hugged and kissed me with a seemingly paternal affection —Consounded at this uncommon instance of fondness for a stranger  I remained a few moments silent and ashamed  then got up and took my leave  after he had assured me that he would speak to the Minister in my favour  that very day  and desired that I would not for the future give myself the trouble of attending at his levée  but come at the same hour every day  when he was at leisure  which was three times a week     Though my hopes were now very sanguine  I determined to conceal my prospect from every body  even from Strap  until I should be more certain of success  and in the mean time  give my patron no respite from my sollicitations —When I renewed my visit  I found the street door opened to me as if by enchantment  but in my passage towards the presence room  I was   162 met by the valet de chambre  who cast some furious looks at me  the meaning of which I could not comprehend  The Earl saluted me at entrance with a tender embrace  and wished me joy of his success with the Premier  who  he said  had preferred his recommendation to that of two other noblemen very urgent in behalf of their respective friends  and absolutely promised that I should go to a certain foreign court in quality of secretary to an embassador and plenipotentiary  who would set out in a few weeks  on an affair of vast importance to the nation  I was thunder struck with my good fortune  and could make no other reply  than kneel and attempt to kiss my benefactor s hand  which he would not permit  but raising me up  pressed me to his breast with surprizing emotion  and told me he had now taken upon himself the care of making my fortune —What inhanced the value of the benefit still the more  was his making light of the favour  and shifting the conversation to another subject  Among other topicks of discourse  that of the Belle Lettre was introduced  upon which his lordship held forth with great taste and erudition  and discovered an intimate knowledge of the authors of antiquity —   Here s a book  said he  taking one from his bosom  written with great elegance and spirit  and though the subject may give offence to some narrow minded people  the author will always be held in esteem by every person of sense and learning    So saying  he put into my hand Petronius Arbiter  and asked my opinion of his wit and manner —I told him  that in my opinion  he wrote with great ease and vivacity  but was withal so lewd and indecent  that he ought to find no quarter or protection   163 among people of morals and taste —   I own  replied the Earl  that his taste in love is generally decried  and indeed condemned by our laws  but perhaps that may be more owing to prejudice and misapprehension  than to true reason and deliberation —The best man among the ancients is said to have entertained that passion  one of the wisest of their legislators has permitted the indulgence of it in his commonwealth  the most celebrated poets have not scrupled to avow it at this day  it prevails not only over all the east  but in most parts of Europe  in our own country it gains ground apace  and in all probability will become in a short time a more fashionable vice than simple fornication —Indeed there is something to be said in vindication of it  for notwithstanding the severity of the law against offenders in this way  it must be confessed that the practice of this passion is unattended with that curse and burthen upon society  which proceeds from a race of miserable deserted bastards  who are either murdered by their parents  deserted to the utmost want and wretchedness  or bred up to prey upon the commonwealth  And it likewise prevents the debauchery of many a young maiden  and the prostitution of honest men s wives  not to mention the consideration of health  which is much less liable to be impaired in the gratification of this appetite  than in the exercise of common venery  which by ruining the constitutions of our young men  has produced a puny progeny that degenerates from generation to generation  Nay  I have been told  that there is another motive perhaps more powerful than all these    164 that induces people to cultivate this inclination  namely  the exquisite pleasure attending its success      From this discourse  I began to be apprehensive that his lordship finding I had travelled  was afraid I might have been infected with this spurious and sordid desire abroad  and took this method of sounding my sentiments on the subject —Fired at this supposed suspicion  I argued against it with great warmth  as an appetite unnatural  absurd  and of pernicious consequence  and declared my utter detestation and abhorrence of it in these lines of the satyrist    Eternal infamy the wretch confound
