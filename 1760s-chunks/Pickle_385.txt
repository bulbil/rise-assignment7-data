 Hatchway  in his great penetration  discovered   that the young gentleman s obstinacy proceeded from the advice of the  misanthrope  whom  for that reason  it was their business to chastise   Pipes entered into this opinion the more willingly  as he had all along  believed the senior to be a sort of wizard  or some cacodaemon  whom  it was not very creditable to be acquainted with  Indeed  he had been  inspired with this notion by the insinuations of Hadgi  who had formerly  dropped some hints touching Crabtree s profound knowledge in the magic  art  mentioning  in particular  his being possessed of the philosopher s  stone  an assertion to which Tom had given implicit credit  until his  master was sent to prison for debt  when he could no longer suppose  Cadwallader lord of such a valuable secret  or else he would have  certainly procured the enlargement of his most intimate friend   With these sentiments  he espoused the resentment of Hatchway  They  determined to seize the supposed conjurer  with the first opportunity   on his return from his visit to Peregrine  and  without hesitation   exercise upon him the discipline of the pump  This plan they would have  executed that same evening  had not the misanthrope luckily withdrawn  himself  by accident  before it was dark  and even before they had  intelligence of his retreat  But  next day  they kept themselves upon  the watch till he appeared  and Pipes lifting his hat  as Crabtree  passed   O d   ye  old Dunny   said he   you and I must grapple by and  by  and a gad I shall lie so near your quarter  that your ear ports will  let in the sound  thof they are double caulked with oakum    The misanthrope s ears were not quite so fast closed  but that they  received this intimation  which  though delivered in terms that he did  not well understand  had such an effect upon his apprehension  that he  signified his doubts to Peregrine  observing  that he did not much like  the looks of that same ruffian with the wooden leg  Pickle assured him   he had nothing to fear from the two sailors  who could have no cause of  resentment against him  or  if they had  would not venture to take  any step  which they knew must block up all the avenues to that  reconcilement  about which they were so anxious  and  moreover  give  such offence to the governor of the place as would infallibly induce him  to expel them both from his territories   Notwithstanding this assurance  the young gentleman was not so confident  of the lieutenant s discretion  as to believe that Crabtree s fears were  altogether without foundation  he forthwith conjectured that Jack had  taken umbrage at an intimacy from which he found himself excluded  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   imputed his disgrace to the insinuations of Cadwallader  whom  in all  likelihood  he intended to punish for his supposed advice  He knew his  friend could sustain no great damage from the lieutenant s resentment   in a place which he could immediately alarm with his cries  and  therefore wished he might fall into the snare  because it would furnish  him with a pretence of complaint  in consequence of which  the sailors  would be obliged to shift their quarters  so as that he should be rid of  their company  in which he at present could find no enjoyment   Everything happened as he had foreseen  the misanthrope  in his retreat  from Peregrine s chamber  was assaulted by Hatchway and his associate   who seized him by the collar without ceremony  and began to drag him  towards the pump  at which they would have certainly complimented him  with a very disagreeable bath  had not he exalted his voice in such a  manner  as in a moment brought a number of the inhabitants  and Pickle  himself  to his aid  The assailants would have persisted in their  design  had the opposition been such as they could have faced with any  possibility of success  nor did they quit their prey  before a dozen  at  least  had come to his rescue  and Peregrine with a menacing aspect and  air of authority  commanded his old valet to withdraw  Then they thought  proper to sheer off  and betake themselves to close quarters  while our  hero accompanied the affrighted Cadwallader to the gate  and exhibited  to the warden a formal complaint against the rioters  upon whom he  retorted the charge of lunacy  which was supported by the evidence of  twenty persons  who had been eye witnesses of the outrage committed  against the old gentleman  The governor  in consequence of this  information  sent a message to Mr  Hatchway  warning him to move  his lodging next day  on pain of being expelled  The lieutenant  contumaciously refusing to comply with this intimation  was in the  morning  while he amused himself in walking upon the Bare  suddenly  surrounded by the
