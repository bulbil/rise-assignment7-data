hear his charming song        But now I wish  I wish I had him        Though this was a song at that time much in vogue  and Miss Betsy had   casually heard it an hundred times  yet  in the humour she now was  it   beat an alarm upon her heart  It reminded her how inconsiderate she had   been  and shewed the folly of not knowing how to place a just value on   any thing  till it was lost  in such strong colours before her eyes  as   one could scarce think it possible an incident in itself so merely   bagatelle could have produced       Again she fell into very deep reveries  and  divesting herself of all   passion  pride  and the prejudice her vanity had but too much inspired   her with  she found  that though Mr  Trueworth had carried his   resentment farther than became a man who loved to that degree he   pretended to have done  yet she could no way justify herself to her   brother Frank  Lady Trusty or any of those friends who had espoused his   cause  for having given him the provocation       To heighten the splenetick humour she was in  Mr  Goodman  who  having   been taken up with his own affairs  had not mentioned Mr  Trueworth to   her for some days  happened this morning  as they sat at breakfast  to   ask her how the courtship of that gentleman went on  and whether there   was like to be a wedding or not  Perceiving she blushed  hung down her   head  and made no answer   Nay  nay   said he   I told you long ago I   would not interfere in these matters  and have less reason now than ever   to do so  as your eldest brother is in town  and who is doubtless   capable of advising you for the best   Miss Betsy was in a good deal of   confusion  she knew not as yet whether it would be proper for her to   acquaint Mr  Goodman with what had passed between Mr  Trueworth and   herself  or to be silent on that head  till she should see what a little   time might bring about  As she was thinking in what manner she should   reply  Mr  Goodman s lawyer  luckily for her relief  came in  and put an   end to a discourse which  in the present situation of her mind  she was   very unfit to bear a part in       But  as if this was to be a day of continued admonitions to Miss Betsy    she was no sooner dressed  and ready to quit her chamber  than she heard   Miss Mabel s voice upon the stairs  As that young lady was not   accustomed to make her any morning visits  she was a little surprized    she ran  however  to meet her  saying   This is a favour I did not   expect  and therefore have the more cause to thank you     I do not   know   replied the other  as she entered the room   whether you will   think I deserve thanks or no  when you hear the business that brought   me  for I assure you I am come only to chide you     I think   said Miss   Betsy  with a sigh   that all the world takes the liberty of doing so   with me  but  pray  my dear   continued she   how am I so unhappy as to   deserve it from you         Why  you must know   replied Miss Mabel   that I have taken upon me   to be the champion of distressed love  you have broken a fine   gentleman s heart  and I am come to tell you  that you must either   make it whole again  as it was before he saw you  or repair the   damage he has sustained by giving him your own     I plead Not Guilty     said Miss Betsy  in a tone more sprightly than before   but  pray    who has gained so great an influence over you  as to send you on so   doughty an errand     No  my dear  you are quite mistaken in the   matter   replied the other   I assure you I am not sent  I am only   led by my own generosity  and the sight of poor Mr  Trueworth s   despair     Trueworth   cried Miss Betsy hastily   What do you   mean     I mean   replied the other   to engage you  if the little   rhetorick I am mistress of can prevail on you to consider
