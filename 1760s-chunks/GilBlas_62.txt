that he haunted me in every tree and bush  my heart was in my mouth for fear at every foot fall  But I took courage again at the distance of about a league  and went on more gently towards Madrid  whither I proposed directing my steps  I had no attachment to Valladolid  All my regret was at tearing myself from Fabricio  my dear Pylades  of whom I had not so much as taken my leave  It was no grievance to give up physic  on the contrary  I prayed heaven to forgive me for having tampered with it  Yet I did not count over the contents of my purse with less pleasure  because they were the wages of murder  In this I took after those ladies who retire with a fortune to lead pious lives  and think it hard if they may not fatten religiously on the hard earnings of their libertine profession  I had  in rials  somewhere about the value of five ducats  and this was the sum total of my property  With these I designed repairing to Madrid  where I had no doubt of finding a good service  Besides  I wished above all things to be in that magnificent city  the boasted epitome of the world and all its wonders   While I was recollecting what I had heard of it  and enjoying beforehand the pleasures it affords  I heard the voice of a man coming after me  and singing till he had scraped his throat  He had a wallet on his back  a guitar suspended from his neck  and a long sword by his side  He got on at such a rate  as soon to overtake me  Who should it be but one of the two journeymen barbers with whom I had been in gaol for the adventure of the ring  We knew one another at once  though we had shifted our dresses  and were in a thousand marvels at meeting so unexpectedly on the highway  If I testified my delight at having such a fellow traveller  he seemed on his side to feel an excess of rapture at the renewal of our acquaintance  I told him why I had left Valladolid  and he trusted his own secret to me in return  by stating himself to have had a little brush with his master  on which they had taken an everlasting leave of one another  Had it been my pleasure  continued he  to have taken up my abode longer in Valladolid  ten shops would take me in for one that would have turned me out  since  vanity apart  I may safely say there is not a barber in all Spain better qualified to shave all sorts of beards  with the grain or against the grain  and to curl a pair of whiskers  But I could no longer fight against a hankering after my native place  whence I departed full ten years since  I wish to inhale a little of my own country air  and to learn the present situation of my family  I shall be among them the day after to morrow  at a place called Olm√©do  a populous village on this side of Segovia   I resolved on accompanying this barber home  and going to Segovia for the chance of a cast to Madrid  We began entertaining one another with indifferent subjects as we went along  The young fellow was perfectly good humoured  with a ready wit  After an hour s conversation  he asked me if I was hungry  I referred him to the first house of call for my answer  To stop dilapidations till we get there  said he  we may renew our term by a little breakfast from my wallet  When I am on a journey I am always my own caterer  None of your woollen drapery  nor linen drapery  nor any of your frippery or trumpery  I hate ostentation  My wallet contains nothing but a little exercise for my grinders  my razors  and a wash ball  I extolled his discretion  and agreed with all my heart to the bargain he proposed  My appetite was keen and sharp set for a comfortable meal  after what he had said  I could expect no less  We drew aside a little from the high road  and sat down upon the grass  There my little journeyman barber laid out his provisions  consisting of five or six onions  with some scraps of bread and cheese  but the best lot in the auction was a little leathern bottle  full  as he said  of choice  delicate wine  Though the solids were not very relishing  the calls of hunger did not allow either of us to be dainty  and we emptied the bottle too  containing about two pints of a wine one could not recommend without some remorse of conscience  We then rose from table and set out again on the tramp in high glee  The barber  who had heard some little snatches of my story from Fabricio  entreated me to furnish him with the whole from the best authority  It was impossible to refuse so munificent a host  I therefore gave him the satisfaction he required  In my turn I called on him  as an acknowledgement of my frankness  to communicate the leading circumstances of his terrestrial peregrinations  Oh  as for my adventures  exclaimed he  they are scarcely worth re cording
