 imreasonable fellow   not to be content with his own   extravagant profits  without hindering everybody else of coming   in for the least advantage with him   but he has neither shame nor   conscience  or else he would be satisfied with plimdering the ponds    and selling the fish  and hiring out the grass as he does  without   putting the parish to the expense of fencing in the common to pre    vent the people even from walking over the grass  But I may    some time or other  find a way to be even with him  He stands   but badly in his master s favour  who despises such avarice  and   would turn him out of his place directly  but that  unluckily  he   has it under his hand for life  However  I shall watch every oppor    tunity to return him the compliment   that I can assure him  Let         156 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     him take such liberties with his equals   I ll have him to know that   he shall treat me with more respect          That is true  Has your grace heard how cavalierly he behaved     lately to the young Lord   I forget his name  The great     beau that made such a noise by dangling after the gentleman s   wife          I know whom you mean  No  I have heard nothing about him    What has been the matter           Ha   ha   ha   I do not believe I shall be able to tell it for   laughing  Why  your grace must know that the beau was walking   one morning in a very plain dress  across the upper part of the   common  where  happening to meet a farmer s maid going to drive   home her cows  he entered into chat with her  and prevailed upon   her to quit the path and walk with him to an unfrequented part of   the field  where they sat down under a clump of trees  for the sake   of a little very iimocent conversation  to be sure  Well  they had   not been there long  when one of the under bailifis  whom this in    solent fellow keeps to watch the grass  seeing them go out of the   road followed them  and  coming upon them in a very unseasonable   minute  not only interrupted their conversation  but also asked   the lord  whose quality he never suspected  in an imperious manner    how he dared to trample the grass  and threatened to take him and   his whore before a justice and have them directly sent to BridewelL   This insult aggravated the offence of his intrusion to such a height    that the lord in a rage bade the scoundrel instantly get out of his   sight  or he would break his head  Such words  from a person of   his appearance  raised the insolence of office so high  that the bailifE    without any more ado  lifted liis staff and knocked his lordship   down  where he belaboured him severely  repeating the word   scoundrel between every blow  till the poor battered beau was in a   most doleful plight  though he had often told him who he was  and   roared out his quality with all his might   but the enraged fellow   either did not  or pretended that he did not  believe him    I   When he had beaten him as much as he thought he could  without   danger of the gallows  he dragged him along to the highway  where    fortunately  a coach happened to come by  the owner of which   knew his lordship  and took him up  ordering his servants to appre    hend the bailifi  But he was too nimble for them  and made his   escape   and now  finding his mistake and the danger into which   he had fallen  he went directly to his master  and telling him the   story in the most favourable manner for himself  prevailed upon him   to promise to stand by him  particularly as he alleged that the affair   had proceeded from his great care of his master s grass  which could   never be kept  if he should be left to suffer for defending it        In the meantime  the poor lord was in so very bad a taking that   all the physicians and surgeons in town were gathered about him    by whose assistance he was confined to his bed for near a week  As   soon as he was permitted to speak and see his friends  he sent directly   to the head bailiff  to let him know how his man had used him
