procedure of those who should fly to assert her cause  No  messenger of deliverance appeared  no voice of comfort did she receive   but on the morning of that day  which Raymond had presumptuously  proclaimed his marriage day  she still found herself the helpless and  joyless prisoner of her false guest                  SECT  IV     RAYMOND  now on the point of executing his bold purpose  trembled with  anxiety  doubt  and sollicitude  Grey himself felt an inward agitation   although he laboured to encourage and confirm his Lord  The Monk alone  stood stupidly insensible of the importance or of the baseness of the  design  The attendants were disposed in their appointed stations  and  joy and festivity seemed prepared  The apartments of the Countess alone  were sad and solitary  where Elinor was still suffered to perform all  kind offices to her afflicted Lady  At the appointed hour  Raymond  appeared before her  and first in gentle terms reproached her unkind  coldness and severity  but urged his love in a manner more bold and  peremptory  She was silent  he renewed his instances  she breathed a  deep sigh  and looked up to heaven as if  complaining of her unmerited distress  her helpless state  which exposed  her to these insolent and hateful sollicitations  He seized her hand   she struggled to disengage herself  whilst her eyes darted fiery  disdain  In that moment the brothers entered  At sight of Reginhald she  shuddered with horror and dismay  though yet unacquainted with the  purpose of his appearance  A solemn pause of silence ensued  the  Countess trembling  Raymond confounded  and the brothers  who could not  behold this disorder without some faint emotion  collecting new force   and arming themselves against the assaults of pity     An encouraging glance from Grey  at length  emboldened his Lord to  break silence  He conjured the Countess by all her hopes of peace  all  the tenderness she felt for her darling son  no longer to delay her own  happiness  no longer to continue thus perversely insensible of his just  pretensions to her love  He now stood before her  he declared  to claim  those rights which the royal favour had conferred upon him  that neither  his honour nor his love  permitted him  any longer  to flatter her  pride  or to indulge her weak scruples — She fell upon her knees  and  began to utter an earnest and passionate vow  that she never would  consent to accept his hand  but Raymond and his associates quickly  interrupted and raised her from the ground  Nor was her great spirit yet  subdued by this rude violence  she turned upon them with looks of  astonishment and disdain  Raymond entreated  Grey reproved her pride   and Reginhald denounced the vengeance of heaven against her obstinacy   whilst the tender mind of Elinor  wounded deeply by the distress of her  dear mistress  thus surrounded with cruelty and oppression  eased itself  in unavailing tears  Raymond still held the hand of Ela  and the impious  Monk  who had waited for the signal from Grey  suddenly began to  pronounce the marriage rites  but was instantly interrupted by loud and  piercing shrieks frequently and violently repeated both by the Countess  and her attendant  The unhappy Lady could not long  support this violent emotion  she sunk down upon her couch  and Raymond  hung over her with a mixture of tenderness and vexation  After a long  interval of faint and breathless depression  she seemed to revive  and  prepared to speak  Reginhald seized the moment of her recovery  and  again began the holy office —But in that instant a new and unexpected  interruption checked his profane purpose  and confounded the base  attempt of usurpation and cruel oppression  The sound of haste and  trepidation seemed to approach the chamber  Raymond started  the  brothers shook at the alarm  a voice was heard calling loudly on Grey   He issued forth  Raymond and the Monk followed  they saw a domestic pale  and breathless with haste  who just found words to declare that Lord  William was on his way  and would speedily reach the castle     Not the condemned criminal when he receives his final sentence  not the  sinner  yet unconfirmed in guilt  when the sudden crash of thunder  appalls his spirit  ever shrunk into such abject consternation  as  Raymond now experienced from this shocking intelligence  Grey was  scarcely less confounded  although he feared only for his safety  and  had no sense of wounded honour  They hastened into an adjacent  apartment  where Reginhald alone was sufficiently composed to examine  this messenger of terror  who informed them  that his appointed duty had  led him to some distance from the castle  where he had discovered a  small company of travellers  who  on his nearer approach  appeared in  disorder and perplexity  that they had demanded his condition and place  of residence  and on their part informed him  that they were the  attendants and
