his letters by every post    My admirer being thus detached from me  my thoughts were entirely  employed in concerting some private method of conveying myself to him   As I would not trust myself in the common packet  for fear of being  discovered  after having revolved divers schemes  I determined to  transport myself in one of the Dutch fishing boats  though I knew the  passage would be hazardous  but  in a case of such interesting concern   I overlooked all danger and inconvenience  Before I put this resolution  in practice  I was so fortunate as to hear of a small English vessel   that arrived in Calais with a prisoner of war  in which I embarked   with my companion and another lady  who lived with me for some time  afterwards  and  when we came on board  discovered that the ship was no  other than a light collier  and that her whole company amounted to no  more than three men  Nevertheless  though the sea was so rough  and the  weather so unpromising  that no other boat would venture to put to sea   we set sail  and  between two storms  in about three hours arrived in  safety in Dover    From hence my first companion went to her friends in the stage coach   while the other lady and I hired an open post chaise  though it snowed  very hard  and  without any accident  performed our journey to London   where I met with my lover  who flew to my arms in all the transports  of impatient joy  and  doubtless  I deserved his affection for the  hardships  perils  and difficulties I had undergone to be with him   for I never scrupled to undertake anything practicable  in order to  demonstrate the sincerity of what I professed  In consequence of our  plan  I assumed a fictitious name  and never appeared in public  being  fully satisfied and happy in the company and conversation of the man  I loved  and  when he went into the country  contented myself with his  correspondence  which he punctually maintained  in a series of letters   equally sensible  sincere  and affectionate     6 22 15  3 45 PM    Upon his return to town for the remainder of the season  he devoted  the greatest part of his time to our mutual enjoyment  left me with  reluctance  when he was called away by indispensable business  and the  civility which was due to his acquaintance  and very seldom went to any  place of public entertainment  because I could not accompany and share  with him in the diversion  nay  so much did I engross his attention   that one evening  after he had been teased into an agreement of meeting  some friends at a play  he went thither precisely at the appointed hour   and  as they did not arrive punctually at the very minute  he returned  to me immediately  as much rejoiced at his escape as if he had met with  some signal deliverance  Nor was his constancy inferior to the ardour  of his love  We went once together to a ball in the Haymarket  where   in the midst of a thousand fine women  whose charms were enhanced by the  peculiarity of the dresses they wore  he remained unshaken  unseduced   preserving his attachment for me in spite of all temptation    In the summer  he provided me with a house in the neighbourhood of his  own  but the accommodations being bad  and that country affording no  other place fit for my residence  he brought me home to his own seat   and  by that step  raised such a universal clamour  though I saw no  company  and led such a solitary life  that nothing but excessive love  could have supported my spirits  Not but that he gave me as much of his  time as he could possibly spare from the necessary duties of paying and  receiving visits  together with the avocations of hunting  and other  country amusements  which I could not partake  Formerly  indeed  I used  to hunt and shoot  but I had left off both  so that I was now reduced to  the alternative of reading and walking by myself  but love made up for  all deficiencies to me  who think nothing else worth the living for  Had  I been blessed with a partner for life  who could have loved sincerely   and inspired me with a mutual flame  I would have asked no more of fate   Interest and ambition have no share in my composition  love  which is  pleasure  or pleasure  which is love  makes up the whole  A heart so  disposed cannot be devoid of other good qualities  it must be subject  to the impressions of humanity and benevolence  and enemy to nothing but  itself  This you will give me leave to affirm  in justice to myself  as  I have frankly owned my failings and misconduct    Towards the end of summer  my heart was a little alarmed by a report
