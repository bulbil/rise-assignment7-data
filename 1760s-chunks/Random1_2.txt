to which a friendless orphan is exposed  from his own want of experience  as well as from the selfishness  envy  malice  and base indifference of mankind —To secure a favourable prepossession  I have allowed him the advantages of birth and education    ix which in the series of his misfortunes  will  I hope  engage the ingenuous more warmly in his behalf  and though I foresee  that some people will be offended at the mean scenes in which he is involved  I persuade myself the judicious will not only perceive the necessity of describing those situations to which he must of course be confined  in his low estate  but also find entertainment in viewing those parts of life  where the humours and passions are undisguised by affectation  ceremony  or education  and the whimsical peculiarities of disposition appear as nature has implanted them —But I believe I need not trouble myself in vindicating a practice authorized by the best writers in this way  some of whom I have already named   Every intelligent reader will  at first sight  perceive I have not deviated from nature  in the facts  which are all true in the main  although the circumstances are   x altered and disguised to avoid personal satire   It now remains  to give my reasons for making the chief personage of this work a North Briton  which are chiefly these  I could at a small expence bestow on him such education as I thought the dignity of his birth and character required  which could not possibly be obtained in England  by such slender means as the nature of my plan would afford  In the next place  I could represent simplicity of manners in a remote part of the kingdom  with more propriety  than in any place near the capital  and lastly  the disposition of the Scots  addicted to travelling  justifies my conduct in deriving an adventurer from that country   That the delicate reader may not be offended at the unmeaning oaths which proceed from the mouths of some persons in these memoirs  I beg leave to premise    xi that I imagined nothing could more effectually expose the absurdity of such miserable expletives  than a natural and verbal representation of the discourse with which they are commonly interlarded     xiii  THE CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME   CHAP  I  Of my birth and parentage   1  CHAP  II  I grow up—am hated by my relations—sent to school—neglected by my grandfather—maltreated by
