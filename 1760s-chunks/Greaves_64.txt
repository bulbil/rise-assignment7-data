with any regard to the dictates of gratitude  refuse complying with the request of Sir Launcelot  but  in the first hurry of her emotion  she directed Dolly to beg  in her name  that she might be excused for wearing a mask at the interview which he desired  as she had particular reasons  which concerned her peace  for retaining that disguise  Our adventurer submitted to this preliminary with a good grace  as he had nothing in view but the injunction of his order  and the duties of humanity  and he was admitted without further preamble   When he entered the room  he could not help being struck with the presence of Aurelia  Her stature was improved since he had seen her  her shape was exquisitely formed  and she received him with an air of dignity  which impressed him with a very sublime idea of her person and character  She was no less affected at the sight of our adventurer  who  though cased in armour  appeared with his head uncovered  and the exercise of travelling had thrown such a glow of health and vivacity on his features  which were naturally elegant and expressive  that we will venture to say  there was not in all England a couple that excelled this amiable pair in personal beauty and accomplishments  Aurelia shone with all the fabled graces of nymph or goddess  and to Sir Launcelot might be applied what the divine poet Ariosto says of the Prince Zerbino        Natura il fece e poi ruppe la stampa       When Nature stamp d him  she the die destroy d   Our adventurer having made his obeisance to this supposed Miss Meadows  told her  with an air of pleasantry  that although he thought himself highly honoured in being admitted to her presence  and allowed to pay his respects to her  as superior beings are adored  unseen  yet his pleasure would receive a very considerable addition  if she would be pleased to withdraw that invidious veil  that he might have a glimpse of the divinity which it concealed  Aurelia immediately took off her mask  saying with a faltering accent   I cannot be so ungrateful as to deny such a small favour to a gentleman who has laid me under the most important obligations    The unexpected apparition of Miss Aurelia Darnel  beaming with all the emanations of ripened beauty  blushing with all the graces of the most lovely confusion  could not but produce a violent effect upon the mind of Sir Launcelot Greaves  He was  indeed  overwhelmed with a mingled transport of astonishment  admiration  affection  and awe  The colour vanished from his cheeks  and he stood gazing upon her  in silence  with the most emphatic expression of countenance   Aurelia was infected by his disorder  She began to tremble  and the roses fluctuated on her face   I cannot forget   said she   that I owe my life to the courage and humanity of Sir Launcelot Greaves  and that he at the same time rescued from the most dreadful death a dear and venerable parent  — Would to Heaven she still survived   cried our adventurer  with great emotion   She was the friend of my youth  the kind patroness of my felicity  My guardian angel forsook me when she expired  Her last injunctions are deep engraver on my heart    While he pronounced these words  she lifted her handkerchief to her fair eyes  and  after some pause  proceeded in a tremulous tone   I hope  sir  —I hope you have—I should be sorry—Pardon me  sir  I cannot reflect upon such an interesting subject unmoved —Here she fetched a deep sigh  that was accompanied by a flood of tears  while the knight continued to bend his eyes upon her with the utmost eagerness of attention   Having recollected herself a little  she endeavoured to shift the conversation   You have been abroad since I had the pleasure to see you —I hope you were agreeably amused in your travels  — No  madam   said our hero  drooping his head   I have been unfortunate   When she  with the most enchanting sweetness of benevolence  expressed her concern to hear he had been unhappy  and her hope that his misfortunes were not past remedy  he lifted up his eyes  and fixing them upon her again  with a look of tender dejection   Cut off   said he   from the possession of what my soul held most dear  I wished for death  and was visited by distraction  I have been abandoned by my reason—my youth is for ever blasted    The tender heart of Aurelia could bear no more—her knees began to totter  the lustre vanished from her eyes  and she fainted in the arms of her attendant  Sir Launcelot  aroused by this circumstance  assisted Dolly in seating her mistress on a couch  where she soon recovered  and saw the knight on his knees before her   I am still happy   said he   in being able to move your compassion  though I have been held unworthy of your esteem  — Do me justice   she replied   my best esteem has been always inseparably connected with the character of Sir Launcelot Greaves
