I told him he was a  little dirty fellow  and would have left the house immediately  had not  his lawyer  and others  who were in the room  interposed  and by dint of  argument and importunity diverted me from my purpose  By the bye  I have  been informed by a person of rank  that my lord discovered exactly the  same disposition in his father s lifetime  and only changed the subject  of his complaint from the word father to that of wife  Indeed  he takes  all opportunities of plaguing my dear parent  as he has just sagacity  enough to know  that this is the most effectual way he can take to  distress me    After repeated trials  I have given up all hopes of making him happy   or of finding myself easy in my situation  and live with him at present  to avoid a greater inconvenience  Not that his ill nature is all the  grievance of which I complain  exclusive of the personal disgust I  entertain for him  his folly is of that species which disobliges rather  than diverts  and his vanity and affectation altogether intolerable   for he actually believes himself  or at least would impose himself upon  mankind  as a pattern of gallantry and taste  and  in point of business   a person of infinite sagacity and penetration  But the most ridiculous  part of his character is his pretended talent for politics  in which he  so deeply concerns himself  that he has dismissed many a good servant   because he suspected him of having wrong connections  a theme upon which  he has often quarrelled with me  even almost to parting  accusing me  with holding correspondence with the earls of B   and C    and Mr   H   V    though I never had the least acquaintance with any of these  gentlemen  except the earl of C    to whom I have not spoken these ten  years past    In short  I have often been at a loss to know  whether he was more mad  and malicious in those fits of enthusiasm  wherein he seemed transported  with zeal for the commonwealth  and tormented me with his admonitions  out of all temper and patience  At length  however  I contrived an  expedient which freed me from these troublesome expostulations  and  silenced him effectually on the score of politics  This was no other  than an open avowal of being connected with all those people whom I have  named  Indeed  I knew him too well to believe there was anything solid  in his intention or professions  even when he carried himself so far  as to demand a private audience of the k    in order to communicate a  scheme for suppressing the rebellion  and that being denied  solicited  the duke of D   s interest  for permission to raise and head a regiment  of Kentish smugglers  Nay  to such a pitch did his loyalty soar  that he  purchased a firelock of particular mechanism  calculated for the safety    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of the bearer  in case he had been placed sentinel at his Majesty s  door  and kept his horses ready caparisoned  with a view of attending  his sovereign to the field  Notwithstanding all these pompous  preparations  had he been put to the proof  he would have infallibly  crept out of his engagements  through some sneaking evasion  his  imagination being very fertile in such saving pretences  Yet he will  talk sometimes so fervently  and even sensibly  on the subject  that a  stranger would mistake him for a man of understanding  and determined  zeal for the good of his country    Since my last return to his house  that act of parliament passed  by  which he was enabled to pay his debts  and  among the rest  a thousand  pounds of my contracting  the only burden of that kind I ever entailed  upon him  exclusive of my pin money  which was never regularly paid  nor  would he have been subject to this  had he not  by his persecution and  pursuit  exposed me to an extraordinary expense  I have also had it  in my power to reward some of my faithful Abigails  in particular   to relieve from extreme distress that maid to whom  as I have already  observed  Lord B   granted an annuity  which she had sold  so that she  was reduced to the most abject poverty  and I found her in a dismal  hole  with two infants perishing for want  a spectacle which drew tears  from my eyes  and indeed could not but make deep impression upon a heart  like mine  which the misery of my fellow creatures never failed to melt    Nor did I upon this occasion forget the attachment and fidelity of my  other woman Mrs  S    who  hearing I was robbed in my passage through  Flanders  had generously relinquished the allowance I had settled upon  her at parting  The exercise of such acts of humanity
