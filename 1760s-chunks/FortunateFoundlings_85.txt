with the   greatest gratitude  and your withdrawing them   as the worst misfortune could have befallen       MADAM        From the prison   at Padua       Your most faithful  and   Most humble servant        LOUISA           These letters were sent away by special messengers  who had orders to be   as expeditious as possible in the delivery of them       But while these accidents happened at Padua  Melanthe was not without   her share of inquietudes at Venice  she had not seen her beloved count   in two whole days  and  tho  she sent several times to his lodgings    could hear nothing but that he was not yet come home  As her vanity   would not suffer her to think herself neglected  without having received   some glaring proofs of it  she feared some misfortune had befallen him    and exposed herself not a little in the enquiries she made after him    among all those who she could imagine were able to inform her any thing   concerning him       At length some person  who happened to see him take boat  told her he   was gone to Padua  which being the rout she knew Louisa had taken  and   she had also informed him  a sudden thought darted into her head that he   was gone in pursuit of her   It now seemed not impossible  but that all   he had said concerning his dislike of her might be artifice  and that   the love of variety might prevail on him at last to comply with the   advances he pretended she had made him   The privacy with which he went    none of his acquaintance knowing any thing of his journey  seemed to   favour this opinion  and never was a heart more racked with jealousy and   suspence  than that of this unhappy  and too easily deceived lady       She had sometimes an inclination to go to Padua in person  and endeavour   to find out what business had carried him thither  and her impatience   had doubtless got the better of her prudence in this particular  if    sending once more to his lodgings  she had not heard he was   returned   On this she expected to see him in the evening  and flattered   herself with his being able to make some reasonable excuse for his   absence  but finding he came not  she was all distraction  and sent a   billet to him next morning  requiring him to come to her immediately on   the receipt of it  but as he was at that time in too ill a humour to   think of entertaining her  sent her an answer by word of mouth  that he   was indisposed  and would wait on her on his recovery   This message   seemed so cold  and so unlike the passion he had hitherto professed for   her  that it threw her into almost convulsive agonies   A masquerade   was to be that night at the house of a person of quality  she sent again   to know if he intended to be there  and  if he did  what habit he would   wear  it being customary with them  ever since their amour  to acquaint   each other with their dresses  that they might not mistake  by   addressing to wrong persons  His reply was  that he would go if health   permitted  but as to what he should wear he had not as yet thought   of it       What  if he hat not thought of it  cried she haughtily  when she heard   these words   the knowledge that I shall be there  ought now to make him   think of it   Pride  love  and the astonishment at this sudden change in   his behaviour  rendered her wholly forgetful of what she owed her sex   and rank  and she was just going to his lodgings  in order to upbraid   him with his indifference  and prove what it was she now had to depend   on from him  when the messenger from Louisa arrived and delivered her   the letter  which contained a sad eclaircisement of all she wanted to be   informed of       At first reading it  she seemed like one transfixed with a sudden clap   of thunder   she had indeed been jealous  suspicious  fearful of her   fate  but so glaring  so impudent a treachery had never entered her   head  that any man could be guilty of  much less one whom her too fond   passion had figured to her imagination  as possessed of all the virtues   of his sex  It seemed too monstrous to be true  and she had accused the   innocent Louisa as the inventor of this falshood
