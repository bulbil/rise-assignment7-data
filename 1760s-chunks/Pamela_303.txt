to become as useful to my dear benefactor  as my small   abilities will let me       If you think a couple of guineas will be of use to Mrs  Mumford  who    I doubt  has not much aforehand  pray give them to her  from me   and   I will return them to you   as for a pair of gloves on my nuptials  And   look through your poor acquaintances and neighbours  and let me have a   list of such honest industrious poor  as may be true objects of charity    and have no other assistance  particularly such as are blind  lame    or sickly  with their several cases  and also such poor families and   housekeepers as are reduced by misfortunes  as ours was  and where   a great number of children may keep them from rising to a state of   tolerable comfort  And I will choose as well as I can  for I long to   be making a beginning  with the kind quarterly benevolence my dear good   benefactor has bestowed upon me for such good purposes       I am resolved to keep account of all these matters  and Mr  Longman has   already furnished me with a vellum book of white paper  some sides of   which I hope soon to fill with the names of proper objects  And though   my dear master has given me all this without account  yet shall he see    but nobody else  how I lay it out  from quarter to quarter  and I will    if any be left  carry it on  like an accomptant  to the next quarter    and strike a balance four times a year  and a general balance at   every year s end   And I have written in it  Humble RETURNS for DIVINE   MERCIES  and locked it up safe in my newly presented cabinet       I intend to let Lady Davers see no farther of my papers  than to her own   angry letter to her brother  for I would not have her see my reflections   upon it  and she ll know  down to that place  all that s necessary for   her curiosity  as to my sufferings  and the stratagems used against me    and the honest part I have been enabled to act  And I hope  when she has   read them all  she will be quite reconciled  for she will see it is all   God Almighty s doings  and that a gentleman of his parts and knowledge   was not to be drawn in by such a poor young body as me       I will detain John no longer  He will tell you to read this last part   first  and while he stays  And so  with my humble duty to you both  and   my dear Mr  B     s kind remembrance  I rest                             Your ever dutiful and gratefully happy DAUGHTER          Wednesday evening       HONOURED FATHER AND MOTHER       I will now proceed with my journal       On Tuesday morning  my dear sir rode out  and brought with him to   dinner  Mr  Martin of the Grove  and Mr  Arthur  and Mr  Brooks  and one   Mr  Chambers  and he stept up to me  and said he had rode out too far   to return to breakfast  but he had brought with him some of his old   acquaintance  to dine with me  Are you sorry for it  Pamela  said he  I   remembered his lessons  and said No  sure  sir  I cannot be angry at any   thing you are pleased to do  Said he  You know Mr  Martin s character    and have severely censured him in one of your letters  as one of my   brother rakes  and for his three lyings in       He then gave me the following account  how he came to bring them  Said   he   I met them all at Mr  Arthur s  and his lady asked me  if I was   really married  I said  Yes  really  And to whom  said Mr  Martin  Why    replied I  bluntly  to my mother s waiting maid  They could not tell   what to say to me hereupon  and looked one upon another  And I saw I had   spoiled a jest  from each  Mrs  Arthur said  You have  indeed  sir  a   charming creature  as ever I saw  and she has mighty good luck  Ay  said   I  and so have I  But I shall say the less
