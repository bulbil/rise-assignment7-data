 that I relented  and accepted  with a bow of graciousness  his present  only calling him an odd creature—And that he is  you know  my dear   We live very whimsically  in the mean  Not above four quarrels  however  and as many more chidings  in a day  What does the man stay at home for then so much  when I am at home  Married people  by frequent absences  may have a chance for a little happiness  How many debatings  if not direct quarrels  are saved by the good man s and his meek wife s seeing each other but once or twice a week  In what can men and women  who are much together  employ themselves  but in proving and defending  quarrelling and making▪up  Especially if they both chance to marry for Love  which  thank Heaven  is not altogether my case   for then both honest souls  having promised more happiness to each other than they can possibly meet with  have nothing to do but reproach each other  at least tacitly  for their disappointment —A great deal of Free masonry in Love  my dear  believe me  The secret  like that  when found out  is hardly worth the knowing   Well  but what silly rattle is this  Charlotte     257 methinks you say  and put on one of your wisest looks   No matter  Harriet  There may be some wisdom in much folly  Every one speaks not out so plainly as I do  But when the novelty of an accuisition or change of condition is over  be the change or the acquisition what it will  the principal pleasure is over  and other novelties are hunted after  to keep the pool of life from stagnating  This is a serious truth  my dear  and I expect you to praise me for it  You are very sparing of your praise to poor me  and yet I had rather have your good word  than any woman s in the world  Or man s either  I was going to say  but I should then have forgot my brother  As for Lord G  were I to accustom him to obligingness  I should destroy my own consequence  for then it would be no novelty  and he would be hunting after a new folly—Very true  Harriet   Well  but we have had a good serious falling out  and it still subsists  It began on Friday night  present Lord and Lady L  and Emily  I was very angry with him for bringing it on before them  The man has no discretion  my dear  none at all  And what about  Why  we have not made our appearance at court  forsooth   A very confident thing  this same appearance  I think  A compliment made to fine cloaths and jewels  at the expence of modesty  Lord G  pleads decorum—Decorum against modesty  my dear —But if by decorum is meant fashion  I have in a hundred instances found decorum beat modesty out of the house  And as my brother  who would have been our principal honour on such an occasion  is gone abroad  and as ours is an elderly novelty  as I may say   our fineries were not ready  you know  before my brother went  I was servent against it      I was the only woman of condition  in England  who would be against it        258 I told my Lord  that was a reflexion on my Sex  But Lord and Lady L  who had been spoken to  I believe  by Lady Gertrude  were both on his side  I shall have this man utterly ruined for a husband among you —When there were three to one  it would have looked cowardly to yield  you know  I was brave  But it being proposed for Sunday  and that being at a little distance  it was not doubted but I would comply  So the night past off  with prayings  hopings  and a little mutteration  Allow me that word  or find me a better   The entreaty was renewed in the morning  but  no —   I was ashamed of him   he said  I asked him  If he really thought so —He should think so  if I refused him    Heaven forbid  my Lord  that I  who contend for the liberty of acting  should hinder you from the liberty of thinking  Only one piece of advice  honest friend  said I  Don t imagine the worst against yourself  And another  If you have a mind to carry a point with me  don t bring on the cause before any body else  For that would be to doubt either my duty  or your own reasonableness     As sure as you are alive  Harriet  the man made an exception against being called honest friend  as if  as I told him  either of the words were incompatible with quality  So  once  he was as froppish as a child  on my calling him the man  a higher distinction  I think  than if I had called him a king  or a
