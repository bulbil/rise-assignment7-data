distance  terminated the prospect  in a manner which was inchanting       I die to build a house on this island  it is pity such a sweet spot should be uninhabited  I should like excessively to be Queen of Bic       Fitzgerald has carved my name on a maple  near the shore  a pretty piece of gallantry in a husband  you will allow  perhaps he means it as taking possession for me of the island        We are going to cards  Adieu  for the present   Aug  18        Tis one of the loveliest days I ever saw  we are fishing under the Magdalen islands  the weather is perfectly calm  the sea just dimpled  the sun beams dance on the waves  the fish are playing on the surface of the water  the island is at a proper distance to form an agreable point of view  and upon the whole the scene is divine       There is one house on the island  which  at a distance  seems so beautifully situated  that I have lost all desire of fixing at Bic  I want to land  and go to the house for milk  but there is no good landing place on this side  the island seems here to be fenced in by a regular wall of rock       A breeze springs up  our fishing is at an end for the present  I am afraid we shall not pass many days so agreably as we have done this  I feel horror at the idea of so soon losing sight of land  and launching on the vast Atlantic       Adieu  yours   A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXXIV   174   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Aug  26  at Sea   WE have just fallen in with a ship from New York to London  and  as it is a calm  the master of it is come on board  whilst he is drinking a bottle of very fine madeira  which Fitzgerald has tempted him with on purpose to give me this opportunity  as it is possible he may arrive first  I will write a line  to tell my dear Lucy we are all well  and hope soon to have the happiness of telling her so in person  I also send what I scribbled before we lost sight of land  for I have had no spirits to write or do any thing since       There is inexpressible pleasure in meeting a ship at sea  and renewing our commerce with the human kind  after having been so absolutely separated from them  I feel strongly at this moment the inconstancy of the species  we naturally grow tired of the company on board our own ship  and fancy the people in every one we meet more agreable       For my part  this spirit is so powerful in me  that I would gladly  if I could have prevailed on my father and Fitzgerald  have gone on board with this man  and pursued our voyage in the New York ship  I have felt the same thing on land in a coach  on seeing another pass       We have had a very unpleasant passage hitherto  and weather to fright a better sailor than your friend  it is to me astonishing  that there are men found  and those men of fortune too  who can fix on a sea life as a profession       How strong must be the love of gain  to tempt us to embrace a life of danger  pain  and misery  to give up all the beauties of nature and of art  all the charms of society  and separate ourselves from mankind  to amass wealth  which the very profession takes away all possibility of enjoying       Even glory is a poor reward for a life passed at sea       I had rather be a peasant on a sunny bank  with peace  safety  obscurity  bread  and a little garden of roses  than lord high admiral of the British fleet       Setting aside the variety of dangers at sea  the time passed there is a total suspension of one s existence  I speak of the best part of our time there  for at least a third of every voyage is positive misery       I abhor the sea  and am peevish with every creature about me       If there were no other evil attending this vile life  only think of being cooped up weeks together in such a space  and with the same eternal set of people       If cards had not a little relieved me  I should have died of meer vexation before I had finished half the voyage       What would I not give to see the dear white cliffs of Albion       Adieu  I have not time to say more   Your affectionate  A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXXV   175   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Dover  Sept  8   WE are this instant landed  my dear  and shall be in town to morrow       My father stops one day on the road  to introduce Mr  Fitzgerald to a relation of ours  who lives a few
