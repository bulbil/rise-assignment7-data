my grateful sentiments  It is on the   text   Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace  for mine eyes have   seen thy salvation       That text  said I  will be a very suitable one for me  Not so  Pamela    said my master  because I don t let you depart in peace  but I hope you   will stay here with content       O but  sir  said I  I have seen God s salvation   I am sure  added I    if any body ever had reason  I have to say  with the blessed virgin  My   soul doth magnify the Lord  for he hath regarded the low estate of his   handmaiden  and exalted one of low degree       Said my good father  I am sure  if there were time for it  the book of   Ruth would afford a fine subject for the honour done my dear child       Why  good Mr  Andrews  said my master  should you say so   I know that   story  and Mr  Williams will confirm what I say  that my good girl here   will confer at least as much honour as she will receive       Sir  said I  you are inexpressibly generous  but I shall never think so    Why  my Pamela  said he  that s another thing  It will be best for me to   think you will  and it will be kind in you to think you shan t  and then   we shall always have an excellent rule to regulate our conduct by to one   another       Was not this finely  nobly  wisely said  my dear mother   O what a   blessed thing it is to be matched to a man of sense and generosity   How   edifying  How   But what shall I say   I am at loss for words       Mr  Williams said  when we came out of the little chapel  He would go   home  and look over his discourses  for one for the next day  My master   said  I have one thing to say before you go  When my jealousy  on   account of this good girl  put me upon such a vindictive conduct to you    you know I took a bond for the money I had caused you to be troubled   for  I really am ashamed of the matter  because I never intended  when   I presented it to you  to have it again  you may be sure  But I knew not   what might happen between you and her  nor how far matters might have   gone between you  and so I was willing to have that in awe over you  And   I think it is no extraordinary present  therefore  to give you up your   bond again cancelled  And so he took it from his pocket  and gave it   him  I think  added he  all the charges attending it  and the trouble   you had  were defrayed by my attorney  I ordered that they should  They   were  sir  said he  and ten thousand thanks to you for this goodness    and the kind manner in which you do it   If you will go  Mr  Williams    said he  shall my chariot carry you home  No  sir  answered he  I thank   you  My time will be so well employed all the way  in thinking of your   favours  that I choose to meditate upon them  as I walk home       My dear father was a little uneasy about his habit  for appearing at   chapel next day  because of Misses Darnford and the servants  for fear    poor man  he should disgrace my master  and he told me  when he was   mentioning this  of my master s kind present of twenty guineas for   clothes  for you both  which made my heart truly joyful  But oh  to be   sure  I can never deserve the hundredth part of his goodness   It is   almost a hard thing to be under the weight of such deep obligations on   one side  and such a sense of one s own unworthiness on the other   O    what a Godlike power is that of doing good   I envy the rich and the   great for nothing else       My master coming to us just then  I said  Oh  sir  will your bounty   know no limits  My dear father has told me what you have given him   A   trifle  Pamela  said he  a little earnest only of my kindness   Say   no more of it  But did I not hear the good man expressing some sort
