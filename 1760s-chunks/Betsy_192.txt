 with the most tender and respectful air   How often  Madam  have I   languished for an opportunity  such as this  of telling you how much my   soul adores you  My dear friend  Sir Bazil  has assured me he has   prepared you to forgive the boldness of my flame  and that  for his   sake  you will vouchsafe to listen to my vows  but it is from myself   alone you can be convinced of the ardency of the love you have   inspired         My brother  Sir   answered she  blushing   has  indeed  informed me   that I have obligations to you of a nature which I was as far from   expecting as I am far from deserving   Here Mr  Trueworth began to run   into some praises on the charms which had subdued his heart  which    though no more than dictated by his real sentiments  seemed to her too   extravagant  and beyond what her modesty would suffer her to endure     Hold  Sir   cried she  interrupting him   if you would have me believe   your professions are sincere  forbear  I beseech you  to talk to me in   this manner  It is an ill judged policy  methinks  in you men  to   idolize the women too much you wish would think well of you  If our sex   are  in reality  so vain as you generally represent us  on whom but   yourselves can the fault be laid  And if we prove so weak as to imagine   ourselves such as either the flattery or the partial affection of the   lover paints us  we shall be apt to take every thing as our due  and   think little gratitude is owing for the offering he makes us of his   heart        Mr  Trueworth was perfectly ravished at hearing her speak thus  but   durst not express himself with too much warmth on the occasion   It must   be confessed  Madam   replied he   that the beauties of the person  when   not accompanied by those of the mind  afford but a short lived triumph   to the fair possessor  they dazzle at first sight  and take the senses    as it were  by surprize  but the impression soon wears off  and the   captivated heart gains it s former liberty  nay  perhaps  wonders at   itself for having been enslaved  whereas those darts which fly from the   perfections of the mind  penetrate into the soul  and fix a lasting   empire there  But when both these charms shall happen to be united  as   in the lovely Harriot   continued he  taking one of her hands and   kissing it   when in the most enchanting form that nature ever made  is   found a soul enriched with every virtue  every grace  how indissoluble   is the chain  how glorious the bondage         Love is a theme I have never made my study   answered she   but    according to my notions of the matter  those gentlemen who pretend to be   affected by it  give themselves more trouble than they need  As that   passion is generally allowed rather to be the child of fancy  than of   real merit in the object beloved  I should think it would be sufficient   for any man  in his addresses to a lady  to tell her that she happens to   hit his taste  that she is what he likes  without dressing her up in   qualities which  perhaps  have no existence but in his own imagination         Where love is founded on beauty alone  as I have already said   resumed   Mr  Trueworth   the instructions you give  Madam  are certainly very   just  for  indeed  no farther could be warranted by sincerity  but   where reason directs the lover s choice  and points out those   excellences which alone can make him happy in the possession of his   wishes  ideas more sublime will naturally arise  and we can never too   much admire  or praise  what is immediately from the divine source of   perfection  It is not  O charming Harriot   pursued he  looking on her   with the utmost tenderness   it is not these radiant eyes  that lovely   mouth  nor that sweet majesty that shines through all your air  but it   is the heaven within that I adore  to that I pay my present worship  and   on that build all my hopes of future bliss        Miss Harriot was about to make some reply  but his looks  the vehemence   with which he uttered these last words  and the passionate gesture which   accompanied them  made her relapse into her
