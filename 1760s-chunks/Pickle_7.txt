ordered our grapplings to be got ready  but monsieur  perceiving what we  were about  filled his topsails and sheered off  leaving us like a log  upon the water  and our scuppers running with blood    Mr  Pickle and the landlord paid such extraordinary attention to the  rehearsal of this exploit  that Trunnion was encouraged to entertain  them with more stories of the same nature  after which he observed  by  way of encomium on the government  that all he had gained in the service  was a lame foot and the loss of an eye  The lieutenant  who could not  find in his heart to lose any opportunity of being witty at the expense  of his commander  gave a loose to his satirical talent once more   saying    I have heard as how you came by your lame foot  by having  your upper decks over stowed with liquor  whereby you became crank  and  rolled  d ye see  in such a manner  that by a pitch of the ship your  starboard heel was jammed in one of the scuppers  and as for the matter  of your eye  that was knocked out by your own crew when the Lightning  was paid off  there s poor Pipes  who was beaten into all the colours of  the rainbow for taking your part  and giving you time to sheer off  and  I don t find as how you have rewarded him according as he deserves    As the commodore could not deny the truth of these anecdotes  however  unseasonably they were introduced  he affected to receive them with good  humour  as jokes of the lieutenant s own inventing  and replied   Ay   ay  Jack  everybody knows your tongue is no slander  but  howsomever   I ll work you to an oil for this  you dog   So saying  he lifted up one  of his crutches  intending to lay it gently across Mr  Hatchway s pate   but Jack  with great agility  tilted up his wooden leg  with which he  warded off the blow  to the no small admiration of Mr  Pickle  and utter  astonishment of the landlord  who  by the bye  had expressed the same  amazement  at the same feet  at the same hour  every night  for three  months before  Trunnion then  directing his eye to the boatswain s mate    You  Pipes   said he   do you go about and tell people that I did not  reward you for standing by me  when I was bustled by these rebellious  rapscallions  D   you  han t you been rated on the books ever since    Tom  who indeed had no words to spare  sat smoking his pipe with  great indifference  and never dreamed of paying any regard to these  interrogations  which being repeated and reinforced with many oaths   that  however  produced no effect  the commodore pulled out his purse   saying   Here  you b   baby  here s something better than a smart  ticket   and threw it at his silent deliverer  who received and pocketed  his bounty  without the least demonstration of surprise or satisfaction   while the donor  turning to Mr  Pickle   You see  brother   said he   I  make good the old saying  we sailors get money like horses  and spend  it like asses  come  Pipes  let s have the boatswain s whistle  and be  jovial    This musician accordingly applied to his mouth the silver instrument  that hung at the button hole of his jacket  by a chain of the same  metal  and though not quite so ravishing as the pipe of Hermes  produced  a sound so loud and shrill  that the stranger  as it were instinctively   stopped his ears  to preserve his organs of hearing from such a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   dangerous invasion  The prelude being thus executed  Pipes fixed his  eyes upon the egg of an ostrich that depended from the ceiling  and  without once moving them from that object  performed the whole cantata  in a tone of voice that seemed to be the joint issue of an Irish bagpipe  and a sow gelder s horn  the commodore  the lieutenant  and landlord   joined in the chorus  repeating this elegant stanza         Bustle  bustle  brave boys         Let us sing  let us toil         And drink all the while         Since labour s the price of our joys   The third line was no sooner pronounced  than the can was lifted to  every man s mouth with admirable uniformity  and the next word taken  up at the end of their draught with a twang equally expressive and  harmonious  In short  the company began to understand one another   Mr  Pickle seemed to relish the entertainment  and a correspondence  immediately commenced between
