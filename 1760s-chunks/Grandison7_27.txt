ever warmed a virgin heart   O madam  how you express yourself  What words you have  They go to my heart —I don t know how it is  But every day I reverence more and more my guardian  Reverence  Yes  that is the proper word  I thank you for it  Filial reverence  Just the thing  And let me say  that I never reverenced him so much as now  that I see what a polite  what a kind  what an affectionate husband he makes my dear Lady Grandison  Yet  let me tell you truth  madam  I should  I am afraid  be such a little minded poor creature  that if I were married  and had not a husband that was very like him  I should envy you  I should be at least unhappy     68 If you could be envious  my dear  you would be unhappy  But you must never encourage the addresses of a man  who you think loves you not better than any other woman  Who is not a good man upon principle  Who is not a man of sense  and that has seen something of the world   And where  madam  can such a man be found   Leave it to your guardian  my dear  He if anybody  will find you a man that you may be happy with  if your eye be not aforehand with your judgment   That  madam  I hope it will not be  First  because the reverence I have for my guardian  and his great qualities  will make all other men look little in my eye  and next  as I have such a confidence in his judgment  that if he points his finger  and says  That s the man  Emily  I will endeavour to like him  But I believe I never now shall like any man on earth   It is early days  my Love  but is there not some one man  that  were you of age to marry  you would think better of than of any other   I don t know what to say to that  It is early days  as you say  I am but a girl  But girls have thoughts  I will tell you  madam  that the man who has passed some years in the company of Sir Charles Grandison  who is beloved by him  on proof  on experience  as I may say  of his good heart—She stopt   Beauchamp  my dear   Why yes Him  I mean  He is the most to be liked of any man but my guardian  But he now is a great man  and I suppose may have seen the woman he could love   I fansy not  my dear   Why do you fansy not  madam   Because  if I must speak as freely to you  as I would have you do always to me  I think he shews great and uncommon respect to you  tho  you are so young a creature     69 That s for my guardian s sake  But be that as it will  let me be secure of my guardian s Love and yours  and I shall have nothing to wish for   Her guardian  my guardian  my friend  my Lover  my HUSBAND  every sweet word is one  coming in  put an end to the subject  I leave this conversation to your own reflexions  my dear grandmamma  Lady L  Lady G  But I have hopes from it   LETTER XIII  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Saturday  Sunday  Jan  20  21   ANOTHER long silence  Lucy will supply all my defects  She will tell you how much I have been engaged  She has sent you a charming Letter  filled with observations on the good order established here before our arrival by Dr  Bartlett and Mrs  Curzon  with accounts of some particular charities  both public and private  that deserve to be imitated by all who have ability  and of our visit made last Wednesday at Mansfield house   The Lady of it would not part with us  till Thursday  the days being short  and the weather unfavourable Mr  Dobson and his Lady were guests there  He is a credit to his cloath  his wife to him  They are greatly beloved by all who know them  Lady Mansfield and Miss Mansfield are all that is polite and good  The three brothers were there  The eldest  who was once a melancholy man  is now one of the chearfullest  With what pleasure did I meditate  as I looked upon them  the restoration of such a worthy and antient family to affluence  They were born to it  Yet when they were deprived of it  how glorious was the resignation of mother and daughters  And now  how easy sits the prosperity upon them  Never saw I eyes more expressive of gratitude to a benefactor    70 than those both of Ladies and Gentlemen  as they were often cast upon my dear Sir Charles   I heartily wish Mr  Orme may find his expectations answered in the second voyage Nancy tells me he is preparing for to Lisbon  She will make
