victorious commanders  at the same time that   they protected the persons of the vanquished from licentious outrage      There is no instance in which the customs of mankind are more   changed than this  Formerly  when nations waged war everythiag   the victorious soldier could lay hold on was his own  the persons   as well as the property of the vanquished   and this more especi    ally at the taking of a town  which was the harvest of his hopes    The excesses committed on these occasions most certainly required   a  remedy   but it were well if that remedy  as in other cases  had   not been abused  and the care of restraining the excess of the   common soldiers made a pretext for depriving them of the reward   of all their toils and dangers  to emioh their commanders  The   injustice of making slaves of the people  for the ambition or avarice   of their prince  is so flagrant  that the practice has been universally   discontinued among civilized nations  who also affect to show   moderation in stripping them of their property  particularly in this   instance of towns taken by capitulation  But at whose expense is   this moderation   Why  at that of the inferior officers and soldiers    who receive a pittance of their own earnings that only insults   their necessities  while the bulk is shared between their superiors    The injustice of this is evident  Either all such composition   should be abolished entirely  and the property as well as liberty   of the vanquished be preserved to them  or the prize be more   equitably divided with those from whom plunder is taken  who   struggle with distress  and brave death for a morsel of bread  with    out any more hope of mending their condition even by success   than the ox has of eating the corn for which he labours to plough   the ground   and this loss of hope is the reason why soldiers are   not animated with the same ardour now as in former days  But    grating as so flagrant a partiality must be to a generous mind    there is one circumstance  not obvious perhaps  to you  that aggra    vates the pain of it still higher   this is the necessity which the   sufferers are under of submitting to the insolence and extortions   of a set of clerks and agents who fatten on their spoils  without   even pretending to any merit in the acquisition   a reflection that   exasperates them against their commanders  by whose favour   those wretches are introduced and supported  and on whom they   father all their villanies      Much as the cares of his situation engrossed the attention of   my master he did not forget his promise to the Spanish youth     but  ordering him a guard of soldiers  bade him go  as soon as the   gates should be delivered up  and secure the convent where his   Olivia was confined from any accident which might happen on   such an occasion in spite of all their care  giving him  at the same         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 319     time  a purse of gold  in which I was  to answer any present neces    sities  with directions to apply to him again if he should have any   further need of his assistance      My new master did not want to have such a commission repeated    He kissed the hand of his benefactor in a rapture of gratitude  and   encouraging the guard  assigned him the most liberal promises    flew  the moment the gates of the city were opened  to the convent    and demanded his Olivia with the peremptory voice of a conqueror    where the sight of the guard removed every objection  and she was   instantly delivered to him  The meeting of these young lovers   was most affecting  They flew into each other s arms  and em    bracing in ecstacy too big for utterance  gave vent to the fulness   of their hearts by a flood of tears  Recovering himself at length      Come  my Olivia    said Alphonso  taking her hand    let us leave   this place  Let us go          Oh  whither    interrupted she  starting wildly    whither shall   I go   I have no home â€” no father to receive me           My home is yours    answered Alphonso  embracing her most   tenderly     we will go to the house of my father  who cannot persist   in his cruelty  when he is informed how signally Heaven has inter    fered in our favour  and there we will consult on the means proper
