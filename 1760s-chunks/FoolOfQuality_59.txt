Mr  Meekly  that  at times of   my despondence  I dared to call the justice and wisdom of Omni    potence into question  Take this world  said I to myself   con    sider it as it seems to stand  independent of any other  and no   one living can assign a single end or purpose for which it could be   made  Men are even as their fellow insects  they rise to life    exert their lineaments  and flutter abroad during the summer of   their little seasons   then droop  die away  and are succeeded  and   succeeded in insignificant rotation  Even the firmest human esta    blishments  the best laboured systems of policy  can scarce boast   a nobler fate or a longer duration   the mightiest states and   nations perish like individuals   in one leaf we read their his    tory  we admire their achievements  we are interested in their   successes  but  proceed to the next  and no more than a name is   left  the Ninevehs and Babylons of Asia are fallen  the Sparta   and Athens of Greece are no more  and the monuments that   promised to endure to eternity  are erased like the mount of sand    which yesterday the children cast up on the shore      When I behold this stupendous expanse  so sumptuously fur    nished with a profusion of planets and luminaries  revolving in   appointed courses  and diversifying the seasons  I see a work that   is altogether worthy of a God  Again  when I descend to earth    and look abroad upon the infinite productions of nature  upon   provisions so amply answering to the wants of every living being    and on objects and organs so finely fitted to each other  I trace   a complicated maze of wisdom  bounty  and benevolence  But   when I see all these beauties and benefits counteracted by some   adverse and destructive principle   when the heavens gather their   clouds and roll their thunders above  and the earth begins to quake   and open beneath us   when the air  that seemed so late to be the   breath and balm of life  grows pregnant with a variety of pests    plagues  and poisons   when life itself is found to be no other than   the storehouse or habitation of death  and that all vegetable and   animal systems include  within their frame  the principles of in    evitable distemper and dissolution  when  additional to all these   natural mischiefs  I consider the extent and empire of moral evil   upon earth  when I behold the wretched perishable short lived   animal  called man  for the value of some matter of property as   transient as himself  industrious and studious of the destruction of   his species   when  not content Avith the evils that nature has en    tailed upon him  man exerts all his talents for multiplying and               30 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      speeding the means of perdition to man   when I see half the   world employed in pushing the other half from the verge of exist    ence  and then dropping after in an endless succession of male    volence and misery  I cannot possibly reconcile such contrasts   and contradictions to the agency  or even permission  of the one   over ruling principle of goodness called God      Could not Omniscience foresee such consequences at creation    Unquestionably  said Mr  Meekly      Might he not have ordered matters so  as to have prevented   the possibility of any degree of natural or moral evil in his uni    verse  I think he might  my lord  Why did he not then pre    vent them  to what end could he permit such multiplied male    volence and misery among his creatures  For ends  certainly    my lord  infinitely worthy both of his wisdom and his goodness    I am desirous it should be so   but cannot conceive  cannot reach   the way or means of compassing such an intention      Can you not suppose  said Mr  Meekly  that evil may be admitted   for accomplishing the greater and more abundant good  May   not partial and temporary malevolence and misery be finally pro    ductive of universal  durable  and unchangeable beatitude   May   not the universe  even now  be in the pangs of travail  of labour   for such a birth  such a blessed consummation       It were  rejoined the earl  as our Shakespeare says it were   indeed a consummation devoutly to be wished   But might not   Omnipotence have brought about a consummation equally good   without any intervention of preceding
