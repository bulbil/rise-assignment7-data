me  was one of the first men  high in favour with the Duke of Lerma  and consequently in the direct road to fortune  his heart  too  was cast in the mould of generosity  by doing his business  you most assuredly did your own  The opportunity was too good to be neglected I went and offered myself to Signor Gil Blas  to whom I felt my heart grow from the first  for my sentiments were fixed by the turn of his physiognomy  There could be no question about leaving the royal and most catholic nurse for him  and it is to be hoped  I shall never have any other master   Here ended Scipio s story  But he continued speaking  and addressed himself to me  Signor de Santillane  do me the favour to assure those ladies that you have always known me for a faithful and zealous servant  Your testimony will stand me in good stead  and vouch for a sincere reformation in the son of Coselina   Yes  ladies  said I  it is even so  Though Scipio in his childhood was a very scape grace  he has been born anew  and is now the exact model of a trusty domestic  Far from having any complaints to make against him  my debt is infinite  On the fatal night when I was earned off to the tower of Segovia  he saved my effects from pillage  and refunded what he might have taken to himself with impunity  not contented with rescuing my worldly pelf  he came out of pure friendship and shut himself up with me in my prison  preferring the melancholy sympathies of adverse fortune to all the charms of lusty  buoyant liberty       BOOK THE ELEVENTH       CH  I     Containing the subject of the greatest joy that Gil Blas ever felt  followed up  as our greatest pleasures too generally are  by the most melancholy event of his life  Great changes at court  producing  among other important revolutions  the return of Santillane   I HAVE observed already that Antonia and Beatrice understood one another perfectly well  the latter falling meekly and modestly into the trammels of an humble attendant on her lady  and the former taking very kindly to the rank of a mistress and superior  Scipio and myself were husbands too rich in nature s gifts and in the affections of our spouses  not very soon to have the satisfaction of becoming fathers  our lasses were as women wish to be who love their lords  almost at the same moment  Beatrice s time was up first  she was safely delivered of a daughter  and in a few days afterwards Antonia completed the general joy  by presenting me with a son  I sent my secretary to Valencia with the welcome tidings  the governor came to Lirias with Seraphina and the Marchioness de Pliego  to be present at the baptismal ceremony  for he made it his pleasure to add this testimony of affection to all his former kindnesses  As that nobleman stood godfather  and the Marchioness godmother to my son  he was named Alphonse  and the governor s lady  wishing to draw the bonds of sponsorship still closer in this friendly party  stood for Scipio s daughter  to whom we gave the name of Seraphina   The rejoicings at the birth of my son were not confined to the mansion house  the villagers of Lirias celebrated the event by festivities  which were meant as a grateful token  to prove how much the little neighbourhood partook in all the satisfactions of their landlord  But  alas  our carousals were of short continuance  or  to speak more suitably to the subject  they were turned into weeping  wailing  and lamentation  by a catastrophe which more than twenty years have not been sufficient to blot from my memory  nor will future time  however distant  make me think of it but with the bitterest retrospect  My son died  and his mother  though perfectly recovered from her confinement  very soon followed him  a violent fever carried off my dear wife  after we had been married fourteen months  Let the reader conceive  if he is equal to the task  the grief with which I was overwhelmed  I fell into a stupid insensibility  and felt my loss so severely  as to seem not to feel it at all  I remained in this condition for five or six days  in an obstinate determination to take no nourishment  and I verily believe that  had it not been for Scipio  I should either have starved myself  or my heart would have burst  but my secretary  well knowing how to accommodate himself to the turnings and windings of the human heart  contrived to cheat my sorrows by fitting in with their tone and tenor  he was artful enough to reconcile me to the duty of taking food  by serving up soups and lighter fare with so disconsolate an arrangement of features that it looked as if he urged me to the revolting employment  not so much to preserve my life  as to perpetuate and render immortal my affliction   This affectionate servant wrote to Don Alphonso  to let him know of the misfortune which had happened to me  and my lamentable condition in consequence  That tender hearted and compassionate nobleman
