might indeed humble the Vanity of it  but would not lessen the Pleasure  for I take this Opportunity to assure you  that  tho  your Letters should come even  thro  the Press  to my Hands  I do not know any Thing could give me a more agreeable Entertainment  and I should then only chide you  as Alexander did Aristotle  for publishing his Works  because what was before his   124 particular Study  and the highest of his retired Pleasures  more estimable than all his Conquests  was then become common to all the World   It is the Nature of Man to render himself often miserable  merely for the Vanity of being thought happy  but I declare  I would rather rejoice at being thought unhappy  than even suspected to be otherwise  at your least Expence  If my Love  my Friendship  did not incline me to this  Honour  nay common Manhood  would require it from me  in the nice Circumstances of our Loves  at present  My Character is Libertine  your Fortunes are small  your Experience of the World but little  your Age young  and your Guardian old  In such a Situation  you should take Care  not to trust to the charitable Opinion of the World  who will hardly be brought to believe  that either our Conversation  or our Correspondence  are upon such innocent Subjects  as in Truth they are  and if any Surmises should arise to the contrary  as I fear this Indiscretion with Regard to —  whose Notions are not much out of the common Road of Things  may give Occasion for  it would not be in my Power to justify you  nor indeed can any Thing a Man may say  or swear  upon such Occasions  either condemn  or acquit a Woman  in my Opinion  for  if he traduces her Character  I should think he might do so as well out of Falshood as Baseness  and  if he vindicates it  I   125 might apprehend that he should do so as well out of Honour as Truth  When I say  I am displeased with your writing to —  I am not jealous of your Love  but your Character  which I have very honest Reasons to be careful of  If you understand me right  in any Reproof I ever gave you  it would but improve your Love and Esteem for me  which will be a fair Return for that warm Passion and sincere Friendship  I  at present  feel toward my Heart s dearest Fanny   Adeiu   LETTER LXXIII   Dear FANNY   THE Alliances you mention from the public Prints  either by Marriage  or political Treaty  cannot give us that Security for a general Peace  which you so piously wish for  No Tyes  but its own State Policy  govern even the best  and no Principle  but Ambition  sways the worst of Princes  It is certain  that political Morals  and private  may easily be evinced the same  and the Obligations between State and State  the same as between Man and Man  Nay  much stronger the Reason may seem upon   126 the former  yet  it is astonishing  that an Opinion so obvious should still be new  for there are few Authors who confine political Maxims  or what they term Reasons of State  to the same Strictness they do private Morals  I hope it is more owing to a wrong Judgment upon this Subject  than to the Depravity of human Nature  that so much Injustice  and cruel Havock  is made in the World  by the lawless Ambition of Princes  that Liberty  Property  or Life  are safe  no longer than our stronger Neighbour is pleased to be at rest  and that the Sons of the Earth  like the Army of Cadmus  rise up  only to destroy each other   The last Article of the French Paragraphs is really so ridiculous  that I cannot determine whether the Publisher is in jest or earnest   Adeiu   LETTER LXXIV   My dear FANNY   MRS  — s Behaviour will certainly confirm the World s Opinion of her for some Time past  True Virtue is modest in its Defence  but Frailty  like Cowardice  puts on the Air of a Bully  to disguise its Weakness     127There is nothing which Women resent so highly  as the free Manner  with which the World judge and speak of their Actions  I own that I have often myself joined with them  in condemning such hasty Censures  but  upon more general Reflection  I can t help agreeing with the World  that few Women ever lose their Reputation   till they have  at least  deserved to do so  for  tho  some may escape the actual Guilt  who have suffered the Imputation of it  yet their Indiscretions must have justly drawn upon them the Censure of the World  and  having gone so far  they have done their Part  and  to speak like a Man of Gallantry  it is the Lover s Fault  if they go no farther   As I have really a great Tenderness for the fair Sex  it often provokes me to hear some People  either ignorantly
