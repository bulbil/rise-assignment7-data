put in irons  and the same method  was practised by Mr  Thomson who copied mine  —   A very likely story   cried Mackshane  what occasion was there for using Greek characters  if you were not afraid of discovering what you had wrote —but  what d ye talk of Greek characters —D ye think I am so ignorant of the Greek language  as not to distinguish its letters from these  which are no more Greek than Chinese  No  no  I will not give up my knowledge of the Greek for you  nor none that ever came from your country    So saying  with an unparalleled effronterie  he repeated some gibberish  which by the sound seemed to be Irish  and made it pass for Greek with the captain  who looking at me with a contemptible sneer  exclaimed    Ah ha  have you caught a tartar    I could not help smiling at the consummate assurance of this Hibernian  and offered to refer the dispute to any body on board  who understood the Greek alphabet  Upon which Morgan was brought back  and being made acquainted with the affair  took the book and read a whole  in English  without hesitation  deciding the controversy in my   275 favour —The doctor was so far from being out of countenance at this  that he affirmed Morgan was in the secret  and repeated from his own invention —Oakhum said    Ay  ay  I see they are both in a story    and dismissed my fellowmate to his cock loft  although I proposed that he and I should read and translate separately  any chapter or verse in the Greek testament in his possession  by which it would appear whether we or the surgeon spoke truth —Not being endued with eloquence enough to convince the captain that there could be no juggle nor confederacy in this expedient  I begged to be examined by some unconcerned person on board  who understood Greek  Accordingly the whole ship s company  officers and all  were called upon deck  among whom it was proclaimed  that if any of them could speak Greek  he or they so qualified  should ascend the quarter deck immediately —After some pause two fore mast men came up and professed their skill in that language  which  they said  they acquired during several voyages to the Levant  among the Greeks of the Morea  The captain exulted much in this declaration  and put my journal book into the hands of one of them  who candidly owned he could neither read nor write  the other acknowledged the same degree of ignorance  but pretended to speak the Greek lingo with any man on board  and addressing himself to me  pronounced some sentences of a barbarous corrupted language  which I did not understand —I asserted that the modern Greek was as different from that spoke and written by the ancients  as the English used now from the old Saxon spoke in the time of Hengist  and as I had only learned the true original tongue  in   276 which Homer  Pindar  the evangelists and other Great men of antiquity wrote  it could not be supposed that I should know any thing of an imperfect Gothic dialect that rose on the ruins of the former  and scarce retained any traces of the old expression —But if doctor Mackshane  who pretended to be master of the Greek language  could maintain a conversation with these seamen  I would retract what I had said  and be content to suffer any punishment he should think proper to inflict —I had no sooner uttered these words  than the surgeon knowing one of the fellows to be his countryman  accosted him in Irish  and was answered in the same brogue  then a dialogue ensued between them  which they affirmed to be Greek  after having secured the secrecy of the other tar  who had his cue in the language of the Morea from his companion  before they would venture to assert such an intrepid falshood —   I thought  said Oakhum  we should discover the imposture at last —Let the rascal be carried back to his confinement —I find he must dangle  —  Having nothing further to urge in my own behalf  before a court so prejudiced with spite  and fortified with ignorance against truth  I suffered myself to be reconducted peaceably to my fellow prisoner  who hearing the particulars of my trial  lifted up his hands and eyes to heaven  and uttered a dreadful groan  and not daring to disburthen his thoughts to me by speech  lest he might be overheard by the centinel  burst forth into a Welch song  which he accompanied with a thousand contortions of face and violent gestures of body       277  CHAP  XXXI   I discover a subornation against me  by means of a quarrel between two of the evidences  in consequence of which  I am set at liberty  and prevail upon Morgan to accept of his freedom on the same terms—Mackshane s malice—we arrive at Jamaica  from whence in a short time we beat up to Hispaniola  in conjunction with the West Indian squadron—we take in water  sail again  and arrive at Carthagena—reflections on our conduct there   MEAN while  a quarrel happening between the two modern Greeks  the one to be revenged of the
