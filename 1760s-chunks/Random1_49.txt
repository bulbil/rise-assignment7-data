ours  a journeyman baker  run away with a great lady of this town  and now keeps his coach—Ecod  I say nothing  but yesterday morning as I was shaving a gentleman at his own house  there was a young lady in the room—a fine buxom wench  i  faith  and she threw so many sheep s eyes at a certain person  whom I shall not name  that my heart went knock  knock  knock  like a fulling mill  and my hand sh—sh—shook so much that I sliced a piece of skin off the gentleman s nose  whereby he swore a deadly oath  and was going to horsewhip me  when she prevented him  and made my peace —Omen haud malum  Is not a journeyman barber as good as a journeyman baker  The only difference is  the baker uses flour for the belly  and the barber uses it for the head  and as the head is a more noble member than the belly  so is a barber more noble than a baker—for what s the belly without the head —Besides  I am told he could neither read nor write  now you know I can do both  And moreover speak Latin —But I will say no more  for I despise vanity—nothing is more vain than vanity  —  With these words he pulled out of his pocket a wax candle s end  which he applied to his forehead  and upon examination  I found he had combed his own hair over the toupee of his wig  and was indeed in his whole dress become a very smart shaver —I congratulated him on his prospect with a satirical smile  which he understood very well  and shaking his head  observed I had very little faith  but the truth would come to light in spite of my incredulity       134  CHAP  XVII   I go to Surgeon s hall  where I meet with Mr  Jackson—I am examined—a fierce dispute arises between two of the examiners—Jackson disguises himself to attract respect—is detected—in hazard of being sent to Bridewell—he treats us at a tavern—carries us to a night house a troublesome adventure there—we are committed to the Round house—carried before a justice—his behaviour   WITH the assistance of this faithful adherent  who gave me almost all the money he earned  I preserved my half guinea entire  till the day of examination  when I went with a trembling heart to Surgeon s hall  in order to undergo that ceremony —Among a croud of young fellows who walked in the outward hall  I perceived Mr  Jackson  to whom I immediately went up  and enquiring into the state of his amour  understood it was still undetermined by reason of his friend s absence  and the delay of the recal at Chatham  which put it out of his power to bring it to a conclusion —I then asked what his business was in this place  to which he replied  he was resolved to have two strings to his bow  that in case the one …iled he might use the other  and with this view  he was to pass that night for a higher qualification —At that instant   136 a young fellow came out from the place of examination  with a pale countenance  his lip quivering  and his looks as wild as if he had seen a ghost —He no sooner appeared  than we all flocked about him with the utmost eagerness to know what reception he had met with  which  after some pause  he described  recounting all the questions they had asked  with the answers he made  In this manner  we obliged no less than twelve to recapitulate  which  now the danger was past  they did with pleasure  before it fell to my lot  At length the beadle called my name  with a voice that made me tremble  as much as if it had been the last trumpet  However  there was no remedy  I was conducted into a large hall  where I saw about a dozen of grim faces sitting at a long table  One of whom bid me come forward in such an imperious tone  that I was actually for a minute or two bereft of my senses —The first question he put to me was     Where was you born    To which I answered  In Scotland —   In Scotland  said he  I know that very well—we have scarce any other countrymen to examine here—you Scotchmen have overspread us of late as the locusts did Egypt —I ask you in what part of Scotland was you born  —  I named the place of my nativity  which he had never before heard of  He then proceeded to interrogate me about my age  the town where I served my time  with the term of my apprenticeship  and when I had informed him that I served three years only  he fell into a violent passion  swore it was a shame and a scandal to send such raw boys into the world as surgeons  that it was great presumption in me  and an affront upon the English  to pretend to   136 sufficient skill in my business  having served so short a time  when every apprentice in England was bound seven years at least —that my friends had done better if they had made me a weaver or shoemaker  but their pride would
