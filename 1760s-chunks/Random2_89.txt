of  and passed the night with her at her lodgings  so much to her satisfaction  that early in the morning  after a good deal of sniveling and sobbing  she owned  that so far from being an heiress of a great fortune  she was no other than a common woman of the town  who had decoyed me into matrimony  in order to enjoy the privilege of a semme couverte  and that  unless I made my escape immediately  I should be arrested for a debt of her contracting  by bailiffs employed and instructed for that purpose —Startled at this intimation  I got up in a twinkling  and taking leave of my spouse with several hearty damns  got safe into the verge of the court  where I kept snug  until I was appointed surgeon s mate of a man of war at Portsmouth  for which place I set out on a Sunday  went on board of my ship  in which I sailed to the Straits  where I had the good fortune to be made surgeon of a sloop that came home in a few months after  and was put out of commission  whereupon I came to London  imagining myself forgotten and freed from my wife and her creditors  but had not been in town a week before I was arrested for a debt her s  amounting to 20l  and brought to this place  where I have been fixed by another action since that time —However  you know my disposition  I defy care and   268 anxiety  and being on the half pay list  make shift to live here tolerably easy  —  I congratulated him on his philosophy  and remembring that I was in his debt  repay d the money he formerly lent me  which  I believe  was far from being unseasonable  I then enquired about the oeconomy of the place  which he explained to my satisfaction  and after we had agreed to mess together  he was just going to give orders for dinner when Strap arrived     I never in my life saw sorrow so extravagantly expressed in any countenance  as in that of my honest friend  which was  indeed  particularly adapted by nature for such impressions —Being left by ourselves  I communicated to him my disaster  and endeavoured to console him with the same arguments he had formerly used to me  withal representing the fair chance I had of being relieved  in a short time  by Mr  Bowling —But his grief was unutterable  he seemed to give attention without listening  and wrung his hands in silence  so that I was in a fair way of being infected with his behaviour  when Jackson returned  and perceiving the deference I payed to Strap  altho  in a footman s habit  distributed his crumbs of comfort with such mirth  jollity and unconcern  that the features of the distressed squire relaxed by degrees  he recovered the use of speech  and begun to be a little more reconciled to this lamentable event —We dined together on beiled beef and greens  brought from a cook s shop in the neighbourhood  and altho  this meal was served up in a manner little corresponding with the sphere of life in which I had lately lived  I made a virtue of necessity  eat with good appetite  and treated   269 my friends with a bottle of wine  which had the desired effect  of increasing the good humour of my fellow prisoner  and exhilarating the spirits of Strap  who now talked of my misfortune en Cavalier   After dinner Jackson lest us to our private affairs  when I desired my friend to pack up all our things  and carry them to some cheap lodging he should chuse for himself in the neighbourhood of the Marshalsea  after he had discharged my lodging  for which I gave him money —I likewise recommended to him the keeping my misfortune secret  and saying to my landlord  or any other who should enquire for me  that I was gone into the country for a few weeks  at the same time I laid strong injunctions upon him to call every second day upon Banter  in case he should receive any letters for me from Narcissa  by the canal of Freeman  and by all means to leave a direction for himself  at my uncle s lodgings in Wapping  by which I might be found when my kinsman should arrive   When he departed to execute these orders   which  by the bye  were punctually perform d that very night  I found myself so little seasoned to my situation  that I dreaded reflection  and sought shelter from it in the company of the beau  who  promising to regale me with a lecture upon taste  conducted me to the common side  where I saw a number of naked miserable wretches assembled together —We had not been here many minutes  when a figure appeared  wrapp d in a dirty rug  tied about his loins with two pieces of list  of different colours  knotted together  having a black bushy beard  and his head covered with a huge mass of brown periwig  which   270 seemed to have been ravished from the crown of some scare crow —This apparition  stalking in with great solemnity  made a profound bow to the audience  who signified their approbation by a general response of
