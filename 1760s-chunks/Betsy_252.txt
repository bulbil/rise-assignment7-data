he has the approbation of   all my friends  shall no longer attempt to trifle with his pretensions         You will marry him  then   cried Lady Trusty   Yes  Madam   answered   Miss Betsy  and added  though not without some hesitation   Since my   marriage is a thing so much desired by those to whose will I shall   always be ready to submit  Mr  Munden has certainly a right to expect I   should decide in his favour        She said no more  but hung down her head  and Lady Trusty was going to   make some reply  perhaps to ask how far her heart acquiesced in the   consent her tongue had given  but was prevented by Sir Ralph  who    pushing open the door of the room where they were  told her she   engrossed his fair charge too long  that it was now time for himself and   her brothers to have some share in their conversation        Some polite wives  Sir Ralph   said Lady Trusty  laughing   would not   have excused so abrupt a breaking in upon their privacy  and I assure   you  if you had interrupted us a moment sooner  you might have spoiled   all  for Miss Betsy has but just given me her promise to marry Mr    Munden         I should have been heartily sorry indeed   said he   if my over zeal   had rendered me a Marplot on this occasion  but come   continued he     since the young lady has at last resolved  let us carry the joyful news   to her brothers        In speaking these words he gave one of his hands to Lady Trusty  and the   other to Miss Betsy  and led them into the dining room  where the Mr    Thoughtlesses were   Well  gentlemen   said he   your sister has at last   consented to give you a brother  pray  thank her for the addition she is   going to make to your family         I hope   said the elder Mr  Thoughtless   she will find her own   happiness in doing so   The younger added something to the same purpose    After this the conversation turned chiefly on the solid satisfaction of   a married life  in which Miss Betsy took but little part  only saying to   her two brothers   Well  since both of you have so high an opinion of   matrimony  and will needs have me  who am by some years younger than   either of you  lead the way  I hope I shall soon see you follow the   example         Our elder brother   said Mr  Francis   may  doubtless  marry whenever   he pleases  and  as for my part  when it can be proved that I have an   offer made me equally advantageous to what you have rejected  and I   should refuse it  I could not be angry with the world for condemning my   want of judgment         No more of that   cried Sir Ralph   you see she hears reason at last     Lady Trusty would fain have persuaded the gentlemen to stay dinner   there  but they excused themselves  as expecting company at home  and   said  if possible they would return toward evening  she would not    however  permit Miss Betsy to take leave  and her continuing there that   whole day happened to bring things somewhat sooner a conclusion  than   perhaps they otherwise would have been       Mr  Munden  as soft and complaisant as he carried it to Miss Betsy  was   very much disgusted in his mind at her late behaviour  he found she   loved him not  and was far from having any violent inclination for her   himself  but the motives which had made him persevere in his courtship    after being convinced of the indifference she had for him  made him also   impatient to bring the affair to as speedy a result as possible  Sir   Ralph was the last person to whom she had referred the matter  he had   heard by accident of that gentleman s arrival  and went to her lodgings    in order to see in what manner she would now receive him  but not   finding her at home  called at the house of Mr  Thoughtless  who had   always been very propitious to his suit       On the two brothers returning from Sir Ralph s  they met him just coming   out of the house  the elder desired him to walk in  told him  with a   great deal of freedom  that Sir Ralph was come to town
