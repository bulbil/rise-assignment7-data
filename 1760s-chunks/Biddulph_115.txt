Mr Faulkland  determined me  If strict prudence might on so extraordinary an occasion have dispensed with this promise  which  as I had made it to my own heart  I thought amounted almost to a vow  I could not however answer it to that decorum  which I had  as an inviolable law  determined to guide myself by  in so critical a situation  And I resolved to have it in my power to say  in case Mr Arnold and I were ever to unite again  that I had not in the smallest article departed from it   I told Miss Burchell there was but one reason which could prevent me from complying with her request  but it was one of so much weight with me  that  after my informing her of it  I hoped she would be so good as not to urge me farther  I did  said I  upon my parting with my husband  make a firm resolution  not only never to see Mr Faulkland  but never to receive from  or write a line to him  nor in any manner whatsoever to keep up the least intercourse with him     I did not know but that Mr Faulkland  if he should learn the truth  considering himself to be  as he really was  though innocently  the cause of that unfortunate separation  might  either with a design of consoling me  or of vindicating himself from any suspicion of blame  have endeavoured to see me or write to me  In this I was mistaken  his prudence  or his respect for me  prevented him from attempting either  The resolution I had made  however  I thought due to my husband’s honour  as well as my own  The same cause still subsists  the weight of it perhaps more in my own imagination than in reality  but if it even be so  indulge me  dear Madam  to my mother   and dear Miss Burchell  in this singularity  I have  not improbably  the happy prospect of being restored to Mr Arnold’s esteem  let me then be able to assure him  that these eyes  these ears  these hands  have been as guiltless as my heart  and all equally estranged from Mr Faulkland  This is a declaration I think due to that punctilio  or  give me leave to call it  that delicacy  I have endeavoured to preserve in all my conduct  Mother  you always taught me to avoid even the shadow of reproach   Very true  my dearest  answered my mother  I believe you are in the right  Miss Burchell  I think my daughter cannot  conformably to that discretion by which she has always been governed  undertake your cause at present  it did not appear to me at first in the light wherein Sidney has now put it   Miss Burchell made no answer  but by her tears  we were both affected  and I wished sincerely to have had it in my power to serve her  I told her  if Mr Arnold and I should ever be re united  that I would endeavour to draw him so far over to our party  as to obtain his permission to correspond with Mr Faulkland  that I was sure he would join with me in wishing her the reparation she hoped for  and that I would make no scruple of engaging warmly for her in such a case  But then  Madam  said she  with what face can you interest yourself for me  so long as Mr Arnold shall think that my aunt has been criminal with Mr Faulkland  That thought  said I  did not occur to me before  and is indeed a difficulty  for should Mr Arnold know that the elopement of Mrs Gerrarde was against her will  and the letter she wrote him extorted from her by Mr Faulkland  it might perhaps injure me as much in his opinion  as Mrs Gerrarde’s false suggestions had done before  Those intricacies  dear Miss Burchell  must be left to time  which I hope may unravel them favourably for us all  The attempt to disclose this affair to Mr Arnold must not be    sudden  indeed I must be well assured of his restored confidence and affection before I can venture upon it at all  Whenever that joyful event happens  assure yourself of my best endeavours to serve you  if I have really any influence over Mr Faulkland  and circumstances should so happily concur as to put it in my power to make use of it   Be contented  good Miss Burchell  said my mother  with this promise which my daughter has made you  if Mr Arnold and she should live together again  Mr Faulkland may probably return to England  as nothing I believe now keeps him abroad  but to avoid giving Mr Arnold umbrage in the present unhappy disunion between him and his wife   December 18  My brother continues sullen  he seldom visits us  and when he does  the meeting on his part is cold  He has made himself master of many particulars relating to poor Mr Arnold’s unhappy connection with Mrs Gerrarde  for since her elopement the affair has been more talked of than it was before  and her whole history traced out  She was the daughter of an innkeeper in a country
