and determination of life and property      Our ancestors  unquestionably  were at that time unblessed by   the liberal and learned profession of the long robe   they would not   otherwise have committed the disposition of property  a matter   held so much more valuable than that of life  to a few men  who   could have no virtue under heaven to recommend them  save the   two illiterate qualities of common sense and common honesty      Those were ages of mental darkness  and no way illumined  as   we are  by those immense and immaculate volumes of refined and   legal metaphysics that now press the shelves of the learned  and   are read with such delight  A man in those times had no play for   his money  he was either stripped or enriched of a sudden    Whereas now  in the worst cause  hope is left during life   and hope   is said to be the greatest cordial in this vale of human controversy      It is greatly to be lamented that the learned in our laws are not   as immortal as the suits for which they are retained  It were         150 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      therefore to be wished that an act of parliament might be especially   passed for that purpose   a matter no way impracticable  considering   the great interest those gentlemen have in the House  In truth  it   seems highly expedient that an infinity of years should be assigned   to each student of the belles lettres of our laws  to enable them to read   over that infinity of volumes which have already been published     to say nothing of the infinity that are yet to come  which will be   held equally necessary for understanding the profession  of critically   distinguishing and oratorically expatiating on law against law  case   against case  authority against authority  precedent against pre    cedent  statute against statute  and argument against reason      In matters of no greater moment than life and death  juries  as   at the beginning  are still permitted to enter directly on the hearing   and decision   but in matters so sacred as that of property  our   courts are extremely cautious of too early an error in judgment    In order  therefore  to sift and boult them to the very bran  they   are delivered over to the lawyers  who are equally the amrmers and   disputers  the pleaders and impleaders  representers and misrepre    sented  explainers and confounders of our laws   our lawyers  there    fore  maintain their right of being paid for their ingenuity in putting   and holding all properties in debate  Debated properties conse    quently become the properties of the lawyers  as long as answers   can be given to bills  or replies to answers  or rejoinders to replies    or rebutters to rejoinders   as long as the battledores can strike and   bandy  and till the shuttlecock falls of itself to the ground      Soberly and seriously speaking  English property  when once   debated  is merely a carcase of contention  upon which interposing   lawyers fall as customary prize and prey during the combat of the   claimants  While any flesh remains on a bone  it continues a bone   of contention   but so soon as the learned practitioners have picked   it quite clean  the battle is over  and all again is peace and settled   neighbourhood      It is worthy of much pleasantry and shaking of sides to observe   that  in intricate  knotty  and extremely perplexing cases  where the   sages of the gown and coif are so puzzled as not to know what to   make of the matter  they then bequeath it to the arbitration and   award of two or three plain men   or  by record  to the judgment of   twelve simple honest fellows  who  casting aside all regard to the   form of writs and declarations  to the lapse of monosyllables  verbal   mistakes and misnomers  enter at once upon the pith and marrow   of the business  and in three hours determine  according to equity   and truth  what had been suspending in the dubious scales of   ratiocination  quotation  altercation  and pecuniary consideration    for three and twenty years      Neither do I see any period to the progress of this evil   the   avenue still opens  and leads on to further mischiefs   for the dis    tinctions in law are  like the Newtonian particles of matter  divisible   ad infinitum  They have been dividing and subdividing for some   centuries past  and the subdivisions are as likely to be subdividing   for ever   insomuch that law  thus divisible  debateable  and de
