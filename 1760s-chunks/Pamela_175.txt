thanked me   How   times are altered          Thursday       This morning my master came up to me  and talked with me on various   subjects  for a good while together  in the most kind manner  Among   other things  he asked me  if I chose to order any new clothes against   my marriage   O how my heart flutters when he mentions this subject so   freely   I said  I left every thing to his good pleasure  only repeated   my request  for the reasons aforegiven  that I might not be too fine       He said  I think  my dear  it shall be very private  I hope you are not   afraid of a sham marriage  and pray get the service by heart  that you   may see nothing is omitted  I glowed between shame and delight  O how I   felt my cheeks burn       I said  I feared nothing  I apprehended nothing  but my own   unworthiness  Said he  I think it shall be done within these fourteen   days  from this day  at this house  O how I trembled  but not with   grief  you may believe  What says my girl  Have you to object against   any day of the next fourteen  because my affairs require me to go to my   other house  and I think not to stir from this till I am happy with you       I have no will but yours  said I  all glowing like the fire  as I could   feel   But  sir  did you say in the house  Ay  said he  for I care not   how privately it be done  and it must be very public if we go to church    It is a holy rite  sir  said I  and would be better  methinks  in a holy   place       I see  said he  most kindly  my lovely maid s confusion  and your   trembling tenderness shews I ought to oblige you all I may  Therefore   I will order my own little chapel  which has not been used for two   generations  for any thing but a lumber room  because our family seldom   resided here long together  to be cleared and cleaned  and got ready for   the ceremony  if you dislike your own chamber or mine       Sir  said I  that will be better than the chamber  and I hope it will   never be lumbered again  but kept to the use for which  as I presume  it   has been consecrated  O yes  said he  it has been consecrated  and that   several ages ago  in my great great grandfather s time  who built that   and the good old house together       But now  my good girl  if I do not too much add to your sweet confusion    shall it be in the first seven days  or the second of this fortnight  I   looked down  quite out of countenance  Tell me  said he       In the second  if you please  sir  said I   As you please  said he most   kindly  but I should thank you  Pamela  if you would choose the first    I d rather  sir  if you please  said I  have the second  Well  said he    be it so  but don t defer it till the last day of the fourteen       Pray sir  said I  since you embolden me to talk on this important   subject  may I not send my dear father and mother word of my   happiness   You may  said he  but charge them to keep it secret  till   you or I direct the contrary  And I told you  I would see no more of   your papers  but I meant  I would not without your consent  but if you   will shew them to me  and now I have no other motive for my curiosity    but the pleasure I take in reading what you write   I shall acknowledge   it as a favour       If  sir  said I  you will be pleased to let me write over again one   sheet  I will  though I had relied upon your word  and not written them   for your perusal  What is that  said he  though I cannot consent to it   beforehand  for I more desire to see them  because they are your   true sentiments at the time  and because they were not written for my   perusal  Sir  said I  what I am loath you should see  are very severe   reflections on the letter I received
