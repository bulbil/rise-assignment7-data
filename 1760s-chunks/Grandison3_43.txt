good  madam  to fortify this worthy child s heart  by your prudence and judgment  while she reads the mother  in the only instance that I have ever known it visible in this unhappy woman   He bowed  and gave me the Letter  I was proud of his compliment  and Emily and I withdrew into the next room  and there the good girl read the Letter  but it was long in reading  her tears often interrupting her  And more than once  as wanting a refuge  she threw her arms about my neck  in silent grief   I called her twenty tender names  but I could not say much  What could I  The Letter in some places affected me  It was the Letter of a mother who seemed extremely sensible of hardships  Her guardian had promised observations upon it  I knew not then all the unhappy woman s wickedness  I knew not but the husband might be in some fault —What could I say  I could not think of giving comfort to a daughter at the expence of even a bad mother   Miss Grandison came to us  She kissed the sobbing girl  and with tenderness  calling us her two loves  led us into the next room   Sir Charles  it seems  had owned  in our absence  that Mr  and Mrs  O Hara  and Captain Salmonet  had made him a visit in town  on their return from Colnebrooke  and expressed himself to be vexed at his own behaviour to them   Miss Jervois gave the Letter to her guardian  and went behind his chair  on the back of which she leaned  while he looked into the Letter  and made observations upon what he read  as nearly in the following words as I can remember   An unhappy mother  whose fau ts have been barbarously  106aggravated —My Emily s father was an indulgent husband  He forgave this unhappy woman crimes  which very few men would have forgiven  She was the wife of his choice  He doted on her  His first forgiveness of an atrocious crime hardened her   When he could not live with her  he removed from place to place  to avoid her  At last  afraid of her private machinations  which were of the blackest nature  he went abroad  in order to pursue that traffick in person  which he managed to great advantage by his agents and factors  having first  however  made an handsome provision for his wife   Thither  after some time passed in riot and extravagance  she followed him   I became acquainted with him at Florence  I found him to be a sensible and honest man  and every one whom he could serve  or assist  experienced his benevolence  Not a single soul who knew him  but loved him  this wife excepted   She at that time insisted upon his giving up to her management  his beloved Emily  and solemnly promised reformation  on his compliance  She knew that the child would be a great fortune   I was with Mr  Jervois  on her first visit to him at Leghorn  and  tho  I had heard her character to be very bad  was inclined to befriend her  She was specious  I hoped that a mother  whatever wife she made  could not out be a mother  and poor Mr  Jervois had not been forward to say the worst of her  But she did not long save appearances  The whole English factory at Leghorn were witnesses to her flagrant enormities  She was addicted to an excess that left her no guard  and made her a stranger to that grace which is the glory of a woman   I am told  that she is less frequently intoxicated than heretofore  I should be glad of the least shadow of reformation in her  That odias vice led her int   107 every other  and hardened her to a sense of shame  Other vices  perhaps  at first  wanted that to introduce them  but the most flagitious have been long habitual to her   Nothing but the justice due to the character of my departed friend  could have induced me to say what I have said of this unhappy woman  Forgive me  my Emily  But shall I not defend your father —I have not said the worst I could say of his wise   Yet she writes  That her faults have been barbarously aggravated  in order to justify the ill usage of an husband  who  she says  was not saultless  Ill usage of an husband  Wretched woman  She knew I must see this Letter  How could she write thus  She knows that I have authentic proofs in my custody  of his unexceptionable goodness to her  and confessions  under her own hand  of her guilt  and ingratitude to him   But  my Emily—and he arose  and took her hand  her face over whelmed with tears  You may rejoice in your father s character  He was a good man  in every sense of the word  With regard to her  he had but one fault  and that was  his indulgence —Shall I say  That after repeated elopements  after other men had cast her off  he took her back
