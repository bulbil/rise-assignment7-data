he takes my grandmamma s hint  that I knew how by experience to account for a double  a divided Love  as she is pleased to call it—and the preference my aunt  and herself  and I  have given to the claim of Lady Clementina    You  my dear  know our sincerity in this particular  There is some merit in owning a truth when it makes against us  To do justice in another s case against one s self  is  methinks  making at least a second merit for one s self    He asks my leave to attend me at Selby house    —I should rejoice to see him—But I could wish  methinks  that he had first received Letters from abroad  But how can I hint my wishes to him without implying either doubt or reserve —Reserve in the delay of his visit implied by such hint  doubt  of his being at liberty to pursue his intentions  That would not become me to shew  as it might make him think that I wanted protestations and assurances from him  in order to bind him to me  when  if the situation be such as obliges him to balance but in thought  and I could know it  I would die before I would accept of his hand  He has confirmed and established  as I may say  my pride  I had always some  by the distinction he has given   40 me  Yet I should despise myself  if I found it gave me either arrogance  or affectation    He is so considerate as to despense with my answering his Letters    for he is pleased to say    That if I do not forbid him to come down  by my aunt Selby  or my grandmamma  he will presume upon my leave      My uncle set out for Peterborough  in order to bring Mr  Deane with him to Selby house  Poor Mr  Deane had kept his chamber for a week before  yet had not let us know he was ill  He was forbid to go abroad for two days more  but was so overjoyed at what my uncle communicated to him  that he said  he was not sensible of alling any thing  and he would have come with my uncle next day  but neither he nor the doctor would permit it  But on Tuesday he came —Such joy —Dear good man —Such congratulation —How considerable  to their happiness  do they all make that of their too too much obliged Harriet   They have been in consultation often  but they have excluded me from some particular ones  I guess the subject  and beg of them  that I may not be too much obliged  What critical situations have I been in  When will they be at an end   Mr  Deane has written to Sir Charles  I am not to know the contents of his Letter  The hearts of us women  when we are urged to give way to a clandestine and unequal address  or when inclined to favour such a one  are apt  and are pleaded with  to rise against the notions of bargain and sale  Smithfield bargains  you Londoners call them  But unjust is the odium  if preliminaries are necessary in all treaties of this nature  And surely previous stipulations are indispensably so among us changeable mortals  however promising the sunshine may be at our setting out on the journey of life  a journey too that will not be ended but with the life of one of the travellers   If I ever were to be tempted to wish for great   41 wealth  it would be for the sake of Sir Charles Grandison  that I might be a means of enlarging his power  Since I am convinced  that the necessities of every worthy person within the large circle of his acquaintance  would be relieved  according to his ability   My dear Emily —Ah Lady G   Was it possible for you to think  that my pity for the amiable Innocent should not increase my love of her  I will give you leave indeed to despise me  if you ever find any thing in my behaviour to Emily  let me be circumstanced as I will  that shall shew an abatement of that tender affection which ever must warm my heart in her favour  Whenever I can promise any thing for myself  then shall Emily be a partaker of my felicity  in the way her own heart shall direct  I hope  for her own sake  that the dear girl puts the matter right  when she attributes her sudden burst of tears to the weakness of her spirits occasioned by her mother s remorse  But let me say one thing  It would grieve me as much as it did Sir Charles  in the Count of Belvedere s case  to stand in the way of any body s happiness  It is not  you see  your brother s fault  that he is not the husband of Lady Clementina  She wishes him to marry an Englishwoman —Nor is even the hope of Lady Olivia frustrated by me  You know I always pitied her  and that before I knew  from Sir Charles s Letter to Signor Jeronymo  that she thought kindly of me —Lady Anne S   Do you
