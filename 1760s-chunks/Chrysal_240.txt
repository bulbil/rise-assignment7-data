me  I took   the purse  and retired T  ithout making any reply   nor did I close   my eyes in sleep  till I had bade adieu to that inhospitable shore    On my return  I went to wait upon my former patron  but was   denied admission  and ordered never to go there any more  the account   of my disgrace in England having  as I learned afterwards  been trans    mitted to him in the very ship that brought me over        Though these miscarriages mortified my pride  they did not   deject my spirits  The gold given me by the English minister   enabled me to support myself in a state of independence for some time    during which I successively offered to accept every proposal that I   had formerly rejected   but I had missed my opportunity  and was now   rej ected myself in my turn  At length  when I was almost reduced to   despair  the employment I hold here was offered to me  which    though far beneath my former hopes  I thought it not prudent to   refuse  especially as it opened me an opportunity of venting my   rage vidtli impunity upon all who had ever offended me  I am   literally hired to wage open war with truth  honour  and justice    by inventing false news to support the exhausted spirits of the   people   by defaming the enemies of my employers  to give a colour   to the iniquitous designs of the latter  and by varnishing over the   most flagrant acts of oppression  cruelty  and deceit  with the   specious colours of authority  justice  and religion  To a man who   retained any of the prejudices of the world  and did not examine   things in the simplicity of nature  such a task must be most dis    agreeable  But to me all things are indifferent  as I know all things    are alike        Here my master s friend concluded his history  the enormity of   which would prevent its obtaining credit  had it been related by   anybody but himself  though  as I told you before  I have omitted   the blackest particulars  and softened the colours of the rest      In a few days after this interview my master left Brussels  and   proceeded on his journey to Lisbon  during the remainder of which    nothing occurred worth relating          CHAPTER XXXVII     CHEYSAL COMES  AT LISBON  INTO THE POSSESSION OF A PORMEB   ACQUAINTANCE â€” HIS MASTER MAKES THE GEBAT ATTEMPT VTITH    OtTT SUCCESS â€” SEVERAL OF THE NOBILITY AEB SACRIFICBD TO   OTHER MOTIVES  ON PRETENCE OE BEING GUILTY OP THIS FACT â€”   CHRYSAL S master is at length taken up  and he CHANGES    HIS SERVICE     If I was formerly surprised at meeting a Peruvian acquaintance at   Vienna  I was no less so when I found that the person to whom he   sent me in Lisbon was the very captain  of whose miraculous con    version  after the rape and murder of his brother s wife  I gave   you an account in the beginning of this relation  whom I found to          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 277     lie a man chosen for the great attempt  the proof which he had   given of his capacity in that affair having raised their opinion of   him so high  as to make them think him the only proper person   for this      I did not remain long in a state of speculation in the possession   of this master   the orders  which were brought along with me    were all that were waited for  to accelerate the execution of the   design  Accordingly  the blow was struck a few nights after    but in the confusion inseparable from such attempts  without   effect      The kingi was shot in his coach as he returned one night from a   love assignation  at some distance from his palace  by my master    who had waylaid him at a proper place  and fired a blunderbuss    loaded with sroall balls  at him  through the back of the coach    By an instantaneous stupefaction of fear  which is often taken for   resolution and presence of mind  the king fell down in the coach    and spoke not a word  which made my master conclude the work   done  and so prevented a repetition of the blow  But what was   his confusion the next morning  when he found that the king    though severely wounded  was likely to recover   The opportunity   was lost  nor was it probable that another would offer  till it would   be too late  However
