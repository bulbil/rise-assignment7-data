in a very comfortless situation  with scarcely the means of subsistence  A retired life was best suited to my circumstances  with a single female servant  I passed my hours in lamenting  not an indigence  which I bore patiently  but the absence of a beloved husband  of whom I received no accounts  He had indeed pledged himself  in the melancholy moments of our parting  to be punctual in acquainting me with his destiny  to whatever part of the world his evil star might conduct him  And yet seven years roiled on without my hearing of him  My suspense respecting his fate afflicted me most deeply  At last I heard of his falling in battle  under the Portuguese banner  in the kingdom of Fez  A man newly returned from Africa brought me the account  with the assurance that he had been well acquainted with Don Alvar de Mello  had served with him in the army  and had seen him drop in the action  To this narrative of facts he added several collateral circumstances  which left me no room to doubt of my husband s premature death   About this time Don Ambrosio Mesia Carillo  Marquis de la Guardia  arrived at Valladolid  He was one of those elderly noblemen who  with that good breeding acquired by long experience in courts  throw their years into the background  and retain the faculty of making themselves agreeable to our sex  One day he happened by accident to hear the story of Don Alvar  and  from the part I bore in it and the description of my person  there arose a desire of being better acquainted  To satisfy his curiosity  he made interest with one of my relations to invite me to her house  The gentleman was one of the party  This first interview made not the less impression on his heart for the traces of sorrow which were too obvious on my countenance  He was touched by its melancholy and languishing expression  which gave him a favourable forecast of my constancy  Respect  rather than any warmer sentiment  might perhaps be the inspirer of his wishes  For he told me more than once what a miracle of good faith he considered me  and my husband s fate as enviable in this respect  however lamentable in others  In a word  he was struck with me at first sight  and did not wait for a review of my pretensions  but at once took the resolution of making me his wife   The intervention of my kinswoman was adopted as the means of inducing me to accept his proposal  She paid me a visit  and in the course of conversation  pleaded  that as my husband had submitted to the decree of Providence in the kingdom of Fez  according to very credible accounts  it was no longer rational to coop up my charms  I had shed tears enough over a man to whom I had been united but for a few moments as it were  and I ought to avail myself of the present offer  and had nothing to do but to step into happiness at once  In furtherance of these arguments  she set forth the old marquis s pedigree  his wealth  and high character  but in vain did her eloquence expatiate on his endowments  for I was not to be moved  Not that my mind misgave me respecting Don Alvar s death  nor that the apprehension of his sudden and unwelcome appearance hereafter  checked my inclinations  My little liking  or rather my extreme repugnance  to a second marriage  after the sad issue of the first  was the sole obstacle opposed to my relation s urgency  Neither was she disheartened  on the contrary  her zeal for Don Ambrosio resorted to endless stratagems  All my family were pressed into the old lord s service  So beneficial a match was not to be trifled with  They were eternally besetting  dunning  and tormenting me  In fact  my despondency  which increased from day to day  contributed not a little to my yielding   As there was no getting rid of him  I gave way to their eager suit  and was wedded to the Marquis de la Guardia  The day after the nuptials  we went to a very fine castle of his near Burgos  between Grajal and Rodillas  He conceived a violent love for me  the desire of pleasing was visible in all his actions  the anticipation of my slenderest wishes was his earliest and his latest study  No husband ever regarded his wife more tenderly  no lover could pour forth more devotion to his mistress  Nor would it have been possible for me to steel my heart against a return of passion  though our ages were so disproportioned  had not every soft sentiment been buried in Don Alvar s grave  But the avenues of a constant heart are barred against a second inmate  The memory of my first husband threw a damp on all the kind efforts of the second  Mere gratitude was a cold retribution for such tenderness  but it was all I had to give   Such was my temper of mind  when  taking the air one day at a window in my apartment  I perceived a peasant looking man in the garden  viewing me with fixed attention  He appeared to be a common labourer  The circumstance soon passed out of my
