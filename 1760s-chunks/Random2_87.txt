by reflecting upon the infamy that attends detection   The apartment I formerly lived in being unengaged  I took possession of it  and next day went in quest of Banter  who received me with open arms  in expectation of having his bond discharged to his liking  But when he understood what had happened  his countenance changed of a sudden  and he told me  with a dryness of displeasure peculiar to himself  that if he was in my place  he would put it out of fortune s power to play him such another trick  and be avenged of his own indiscretion at once —When I desired him to explain his meaning  he pointed to his neck  raised himself on his tip toes  and was going away without any further ceremony  when I put him in mind of my indigence  and demanded the five guineas I had formerly lent him     Five guineas   cried he  Zounds  had you acted with common prudence you might have had twenty thousand in your pocket by this time —I depended upon five hundred from you  as much as if I had had notes for it in the bank  and by all the rules of equity  you are indebted to me for that sum  —  I was neither pleased nor convinced by this computation  and insisted on my right with such determined obstinacy  that he was fain to alter his tone  and appease my clamour  by assuring me  that he was not master of five shillings —Society in distress  generally promotes good understanding among people  from being a dun  I descended to be a client  and asked his advice about repairing my losses —He counselled me to have recourse again to the gaming table  where I had succeeded   261 so well before  and to put myself in a condition  by selling my watch —I followed his directions  and having accommodated him with a few pieces  went to the place  where I lost every shilling     I returned to my lodgings full of desperate resolution  and having made Strap acquainted with my fate  ordered him to pawn my sword immediately  that I might be enabled to make another effort —This affectionate creature no sooner understood my purpose  than seized with insuppressible sorrow at the prospect of my misery  he burst into tears  and asked what I proposed to do after the small sum he could raise on the sword should be spent     On my own account  said he  I am quite unconcerned  for while God spares me health and these ten fingers  I can earn a comfortable subsistence any where  but what must become of you  who have less humility to stoop  and more appetites to gratify  —  Here I interrupted him  by saying  with a gloomy aspect  I could never want a resource while I had a loaded pistol in possession —Stupified with horror  at this dreadful insinuation  he stood mute for some time  and then broke out into   God of his infinite mercy enable you to withstand that temptation of the devil —consider your immortal soul—there s no repentance in the grave —O Lord  that ever it should come to this—Are we not enjoined to resign ourselves to the will of heaven —where is your patience —Durum patientia frango—you are but a young man—there may be many good things in store for you—accidit in puncto  quid non speratur in anno—remember your   262 uncle  Mr  Bowling  perhaps he is now on his voyage homeward  pleasing himself with the hopes of finding and relieving you—nay  peradventure he is already arrived  the ship was expected about this time  —  A ray of hope shot athwart the darkness of my soul  at this suggestion  I thanked my friend for his seasonable recollection  and after having promised to take no resolution till his return  dismissed him to Wapping for intelligence     In his absence I was visited by Banter  who being informed of my bad luck at play  told me  that fortune would probably be one day weary of persecuting me     In the mean time   said he  here s a letter for you  which I received just now inclosed in one from Freeman  —  I snatched it with eagerness  and knowing the superscription to be of Narcissa s hand writing  kissed it with transport  and having opened it  read    IT is with great difficulty  that I have stolen from the observation of those spies who are set over me  this opportunity of telling you  that I was suddenly carried away from Bath  by my brother  who was informed of our correspondence by Lord Quiverwit  whom  I since understand  you have wounded in a duel on my account —As I am fully convinced of your honour and love  I hope I shall never hear of such desperate proofs of either for the future —I am so strictly watched  that it will be impossible for you to see me  until my brother s suspicion shall abate  or heaven contrive some other unforeseen   263 event in our behalf —In the mean time  you may depend on the constancy and affection of  Your own NARCISSA   P  S  Miss Williams  who is my fellow prisoner  desires to be remembered to you—We are
