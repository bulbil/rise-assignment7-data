  Woodstock  But when I came thither  I found a letter instead of my   lady  and when I opened it  it was to beg my pardon for deceiving me    expressing her concern for her past fault  her affection for me  and   the apprehension she had  that she should be unable to keep her good   resolves  if she met me  that she had set out on the Thursday for her   embarkation  for that she feared nothing else could save her  and had   appointed this meeting on Saturday  at the place of her former guilt    that I might be suitably impressed upon the occasion  and pity and allow   for her  and that she might get three or four days start of me  and be   quite out of my reach  She recommended again  as upon the spot where the   poor little one owed its being  my tenderness to it  for her sake  and   that was all she had to request of me  she said  but would not forget   to pray for me in all her own dangers  and in every difficulty she was   going to encounter       I wept at this moving tale  And did not this make a deep impression upon   you  sir  said I  Surely such an affecting lesson as this  on the very   guilty spot too   I admire the dear lady s pious contrivance   must have   had a great effect upon you  One would have thought  sir  it was enough   to reclaim you for ever  All your naughty purposes  I make no doubt    were quite changed       Why  my dear  said he  I was much moved  you may be sure  when I came to   reflect  But  at first  I was so assured of being a successful tempter    and spoiling her voyage  that I was vexed  and much out of humour    but when I came to reflect  as I said  I was quite overcome with this   instance of her prudence  her penitence  and her resolution  and more   admired her than I ever had done  Yet I could not bear she should so   escape me neither  so much overcome me  as it were  in an heroical   bravery  and I hastened away  and got a bill of credit of Lord Davers    upon his banker in London  for five hundred pounds  and set out for that   place  having called at Oxford  and got what light I could  as to where   I might hear of her there       When I arrived in town  which was not till Monday morning  I went to a   place called Crosby square  where the friends of the two ladies lived    She had set out in the flying coach on Tuesday  got to the two ladies   that very night  and  on Saturday  had set out with them for Gravesend    much about the time I was expecting her at Woodstock       You may suppose that I was much affected  my dear  with this  However    I got my bill of credit converted into money  and I set out with my   servant on Monday afternoon  and reached Gravesend that night  and there   I understood that she and the two ladies had gone on board from the very   inn I put up at  in the morning  and the ship waited only for the wind    which then was turning about in its favour       I got a boat directly  and went on board the ship  and asked for Mrs    Godfrey  But judge you  my dear Pamela  her surprise and confusion  when   she saw me  She had like to have fainted away  I offered any money to   put off the sailing till next day  but it would not be complied with    and fain would I have got her on shore  and promised to attend her  if   she would go over land  to any part of England the ship would touch at    But she was immovable       Every one concluded me her humble servant  and were touched at the   moving interview  the young ladies  and their female attendants    especially  With great difficulty  upon my solemn assurances of honour    she trusted herself with me in one of the cabins  and there I tried    what I could  to prevail upon her to quit her purpose  but all in   vain  She said  I had made her quite unhappy by this interview  She had   difficulties enough upon her mind before  but now I had embittered all   her voyage  and given her the deepest distress       I could prevail upon her but for one favour  and that
