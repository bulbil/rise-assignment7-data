but the King  in the mean time  found means to escape  Thus  at length  after inexpressible hardships  and having experienced the fidelity of forty different persons of all ranks  who had power to betray him  he embarked at Brighthelmsted  and landed safely in Normandy     Cromwell  in the mean time  returned to London in triumph  where he was met by the speaker of the house  accompanied by the mayor and magistrates in their formalities  His first care  upon his return  was to take the advantage of his successes  by depressing the Scotch  An act was passed for abolishing royalty in Scotland  and annexing it as a conquered province to the English commonwealth  impowering it  however  to send a certain number of representatives to the British parliament  It was now seen with astonishment  that a parliament composed of obscure and weak members could govern at once with unanimity and success  Without any acknowledged subordination they levied armies  maintained fleets  and gave laws to their neighbours  Never was England more powerful than at this period  The finances were managed with oeconomy and exactness  No   49 private person became rich by public extortions  The revenues of the crown  the lands of the Bishops  and a tax of an hundred and twenty thousand pounds each month  supplied the wants of the government  and invigorated all their proceedings   Having reduced the British dominions to perfect obedience  the parliament next resolved to chastise the Dutch  who had given but very slight causes of complaint  Dorislaus  one of the late King s Judges  being sent thither by the commons as envoy  was assassinated by the royal party that had taken refuge there  St  John  appointed English ambassador  was also insulted by the friends of the Prince of Orange  These were grounds sufficient to incense the republic of England to a war  Its success  however  was doubtful  Blake commanded the English  and Van Tromp was Admiral of Holland  both equally experienced  courageous  and active  Several engagements served only to shew the excellence of the Admirals  without determining the balance of naval power  The parliament  however  was willing to continue the war  rightly judging that  when the force of the nation was exerted by sea  it would diminish Cromwell the general s power upon land   Cromwell was not behind them in penetration  he saw they dreaded his growing power  and wished to diminish it  all his measures were conducted with a bold intrepidity that marked his character  and he was now resolved to make another daring effort  He persuaded his officers to present a petition for payment of arrears and redress of grievances  which he knew would be rejected with disdain  The house  upon receiving it  appointed a committee to prepare an act  that all persons who presented such petitions for the future should be deemed guilty of high treason  This was what Cromwell wished for  He was sitting in council with his officers  when informed of the subject on which the house was deliberating    50 Turning to major general Vernon    I am compelled  cried he  to do a thing that makes the very hair of my head stand on end    and  starting up with marks of violent indignation in his countenance  he hastened to the parliament  with a body of three hundred soldiers  Upon entering the house  he took his place  and sat some time to hear the debates  and  when the speaker was about to put the question  he suddenly rose up  and  reviling them for their ambition and cruelty  he stamped with his foot  and instantly the house was filled with armed men  Then addressing himself to the members   Get you gone  said he  give place to honest men  you are no longer a parliament  I tell you  you are no longer a parliament  the Lord has done with you    He then accused one as a drunkard  another as a whoremaster  a third of adultery  and a fourth of extortion   It is you  added he  that have forced me upon this  I have sought the Lord night and day  that he would rather slay me than put me upon this work    Then pointing to the mace   Take away  cried he  that bauble    and  turning out all the members  he ordered the door to be locked  and  putting the key in his pocket  retired to Whitehall  Thus by one daring exploit the new republic was abolished  and the whole power  civil and military  centered in him alone  The present unsteady form of the English government  is the strongest proof of a late philosopher s opinion  that every country is possessed of a set of laws and constitutions best adapted to the nature of the inhabitants  the climate  and the soil  which when once broken through  the government must continue weak and unsteady  until the natural constitution is restored  as in mechanics all bodies continue to waver till their center of gravity is supported     I am   c     51  LETTER VII   THAT parliament  which had long gloried in resisting violence
