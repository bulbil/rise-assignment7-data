s arm was just lifted to strike his father  had not William called out  and Robert immediately recollected his father s voice  At once  stung with a consciousness of his crime  and his duty  he leaped from his horse  and raised the fallen Monarch from the ground  then  prostrating himself in his presence  he asked pardon for his offences  and promised  for the future  an adherence to his duty  The King  moved by the impulse of nature  took once more his long lost son to his arms  and the armies  spectators of this moving scene  participated in their joy and reconciliation   But this submission of Robert was of no long continuance  he once had tasted the sweets of power  and knew not how to submit to subordination  again  therefore  he revolted  and again was pardoned by his indulgent father  But the French  who inspired him to these acts of disobedience  and were at best insidious allies  particularly felt the vehemence of William s displeasure  After he had adjusted the government of England  to which he was returned some time before  he again led over a brave army of Englishmen into Normandy  intent to make the storm fall upon those who were primarily the disturbers of his tranquillity  The King of France rightly considered  that this armament could only be designed against himself  and attempted to divert it by a truce  which was   67 agreed on  but a jest of the French King s served to renew hostilities  William had been confined to his bed by an indisposition  which  added to his natural corpulency  threatened the most dangerous consequences  This was a situation which it was cruelty to ridicule  however  the Frenchman  with a levity natural to his nation  observed  that the King of England was lying in of a big belly  This raised William s indignation to such a pitch  that he immediately took the field  where  leaping a ditch  the pomel of the saddle bruised his belly  and gave him a rupture  This  added to his former bad habit of body  brought on a mortification  of which he died   The characters of Princes are best seen in their actions  nor is it necessary to give an outline at the end of what the historian has painted more strongly in his narration  There is scarce a great quality which this Monarch does not seem eminently to have possessed  and  considering the morality of the times  scarce a good one in which he was entirely deficient  The only objections of any weight  are his avarice and his depopulating a part of this country  in order to make a forest to hunt in for his amusement  The avarice of Kings  at that time  was different from what it is now  Kings acquired money then for the uses of the public  Kings acquire fortunes now only for themselves  the wars of the state were then supplied by treasures of the crown  the wars of the state at present are supplied by finances appropriated to that purpose by the people  His making so extensive a forest can be vindicated only from the barbarity of the times  a method rather of making his guilt general  than of wiping it away  Upon the whole  however  England seemed to improve   68 by the conquest  and lost neither its name nor its language  It increased in strength and naval power  its laws became more numerous and rational  the manner of living  among the natives  more elegant and expensive  and the superstition of the clergy less gross and absurd   I am   c   LETTER XI   Dear Charles   FEW nations have gone through more revolutions  few governments have appeared more unsteady  or fluctuated more  between prerogative and privilege  than this of Great Britain  The English have been surprized  betrayed  forced into situations little preferable to downright slavery  but those convulsions  though they have disordered the frame  yet could not destroy the principles of a free constitution   We have seen the Norman alter the whole model of government  but he was unable to extinguish the Saxon spirit of freedom  which formed its ground work  on the contrary  the Normans  and other strangers who settled here  were soon seized with a spirit of liberty themselves  instead of being able to communicate their native principles of slavery   William left three sons  Robert  to whom he bequeathed his Dukedom of Normandy  William Rufus  who had the newly acquired kingdom of England  and Henry  who was put in possession of the greatest part of his personal treasures   William Rufus  upon coming to the crown  had two very powerful parties to oppose and to humble    69 The nobility  who still aspired to the same degree of freedom which they possessed under the Saxon Kings  and the clergy  who desired to erect themselves into a distinct government  independent of Secular power  One or the other of these claims  gave rise to the insurrections and discontents of this reign  Nothing can be more easy than to imagine  how ill a people  who thought themselves free  must brook a Monarch who looked upon them as his property  by a succession originally founded in conquest
