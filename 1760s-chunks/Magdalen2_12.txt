the house  and to peep in at the windows with a degree of breeding much below the elegance of his appearance—Notwithstanding these unpromising accounts  I nevertheless sat up till four o clock  rather hoping than expecting the unfortunate young   67 lady s return  but  alas  I might have sat up till this moment  without reaping the least advantage from my anxiety or my fatigue  she never once approached the house  and which way she has gone I am by no means able to conjecture     And this  Sir Robert  is the end of all our expectations  For my own part  strenuously solicitous as I was but a few hours ago in her favour  I now sincerely congratulate with you on your fortunate escape  I now begin to think you were right in rejecting her from the first  and am perfectly satisfied that the error  which I thought the effect of her partiality for you  was nothing more than the result of her own constitution  Lady Haversham  however  will not subscribe to my opinion of her levity  tho  she knows not any cause to which   68 her elopement can be so probably attributed—Nevertheless  she thinks all enquiry after her needless  and almost wishes that she had not taken the journey into Oxfordshire—   For this new disappointment  Mr  Melmoth   says she   will come with additional weight upon her family  and  if it does not entirely kill the poor mother  it will certainly drive her distracted     Mrs  Darnel  who appears to be a decent well behaved woman  notwithstanding your suspicions  is to send down an account of Louisa s elopement to Mildmay Hall  What consequences it may produce there I know not  but of this I am certain  that you have every reason in nature to be happy in the timely discovery of her levity—Had such a discovery been made after your marriage with her  I suppose the result would   69 have been her immediate death  and your certain execution—You would have sacrificed her instantly to your fury  and your life would have been the penalty of your rashness  Return thanks  therefore  to Providence for having such a fortunate escape  and do not meanly regret the loss of a woman whom you know to be guilty  when you could so readily give her up at a time that you thought her innocence  in a manner  unquestionable  But you see  Harold  that innocence  like contrition  may be easily affected  and that those may seem the most strenuous votaries of virtue  who are in fact the least unhappy at its loss   If any thing new should occur before you think of returning home  you need not doubt of my readiness to communicate it  Lady Haversham is extremely affected with Louisa s behaviour  but   70 attempts very little  if any thing  in her defence  she sends her best wishes to you by this letter  and desires me to assure you  that she is as much your affectionate sister as I am  Your faithful Friend  C  MELMOTH     71  LETTER XVII  Miss HARRIOT BEAUCLERK to her Mother   Dear MAMA   A DISTRESS of a more piercing nature than ever has fallen upon this unhappy family  You will scarcely conceive  and I have scarcely power to inform you  but my wretched friend Miss Mildmay  while lady Haversham was down here  as I told you in my last letter  settling every thing to our wishes  and restoring every body to peace  eloped from Mrs  Darnel s  in London  with a strange gentleman  in a chariot and six  while her cousin was at church  and where she is gone there is no likelihood of discovering  Mrs  Darnel s account of this affair reached us this morning    72 and from the pain which I know your own worthy heart will feel on this melancholy occasion  you may easily imagine what an effect it had on her poor father and mother  upon her brother and myself  I would  if possible  have kept it from the colonel  as I thought the knowledge of so fatal an accident might materially retard his recovery—But Mr  Mildmay s rage was too violent  and the venerable lady s anguish too excessive  to admit of such a salutary secrecy  so that  in less than five minutes  he was made acquainted with the minutest circumstances  and the agitation of his mind has been so prodigious ever since  that his physicians begin to be apprehensive about the consequences   Indeed  my dear mama  I am  inexpressibly wretched from the part which I am to act in the general calamity—every body turns to me for consolation —   73 when my own bosom is torn with a thousand distresses—and expects that I should be able to administer comfort  when I am equally  if not more  miserable myself  You  my dearest mama  must sooth my afflictions—You must enable me  by the magnanimity of your example  and the wisdom of your advice  to bear up against this unexpected stroke of misfortune  which now falls on me with an aggravated heaviness  as it comes in the hour of my utmost security  and invades me in the most unsuspecting moment of my hopes—I was feasting my
