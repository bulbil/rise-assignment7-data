 to tag all his stupid observations with a very true  to praise his stable  and descant upon his claret and cookery   The pitiful humiliations of the gentlemen you are now describing  said I  puts me in mind of a custom among the Tartars of Koreki  not entirely dissimilar to this we are now considering   The Russians  who trade with them carry thither a kind of mushrooms  which they exchange for furrs of squirrels  ermins  sables  and foxes  These mushrooms the rich Tartars lay up in large quantities for the winter  and when a nobleman makes a mushroom feast  all the neighbours around are invited  The mushrooms are prepared by boiling  by which the water acquires an intoxicating quality  and is a sort of drink which the Tartars prize beyond all other  When the nobility and ladies are assembled  and the ceremonies usual between people of distinction over  the mushroom broth goes freely round  they laugh  talk double entendre  grow fuddled  and become excellent company  The poorer sort  who love mushroom broth to distraction as well as the rich  but cannot afford it at the first hand  post themselves on these occasions round the huts of the rich  and watch the opportunity of the ladies and gentlemen as they come down to pass their liquor  and holding a wooden bowl  catch the delicious fluid  very little altered by filtration    134 being still strongly tinctured with the intoxicating quality  Of this they drink with the utmost satisfaction  and thus they get as drunk and as jovial as their betters   Happy nobility  cries my companion  who can fear no diminution of respect  unless by being seized with a strangury  and who when most drunk are most useful  though we have not this custom among us  I foresee  that if it were introduced  we might have many a toad eater in England ready to drink from the wooden bowl on these occasions  and to praise the flavour of his lordship s liquor  As we have different classes of gentry  who knows but we might see a lord holding the bowl to a minister  a knight holding it to his lordship  and a simple  squire drinking it double distilled from the loins of knighthood  For my part  I shall never for the future hear a great man s flatterers haranguing in his praise that I shall not fancy I behold the wooden bowl  for I can see no reason why a man  who can live easily and happily at home  should bear the drudgery of decorum and the impertinence of his entertainer  unless intoxicated with a passion for all that was quality  unless he thought that whatever came from the great was delicious  and had the tincture of the mushroom in it  Adieu   LETTER XXXII  From the same   I AM disgusted  O Fum Hoam  even to sickness disgusted  Is it possible to bear the presumption   135 of those islanders  when they pretend to instruct me in the ceremonies of China  They lay it down as a maxim  that every person who comes from thence must express himself in metaphor  swear by Alla  rail against wine  and behave  and talk and write like a Turk or Persian  They make no distinction between our elegant manners  and the voluptuous barbarities of our eastern neighbours  Where ever I come  I raise either diffidence or astonishment  some fancy me no Chinese  because I am formed more like a man than a monster  and others wonder to find one born five thousand miles from England  endued with common sense  Strange  say they  that a man who has received his education at such a distance from London  should have common sense  to be born out of England  and yet have common sense  impossible  He must be some Englishman in disguise  his very visage has nothing of the true exotic barbarity   I yesterday received an invitation from a lady of distinction  who it seems had collected all her knowledge of eastern manners from fictions every day propagated here  under the titles of eastern tales  and oriental histories  she received me very politely  but seemed to wonder that I neglected bringing opium and a tobacco box  when chairs were drawn for the rest of the company  I was assigned my place on a cushion on the floor  It was in vain that I protested the Chinese used chairs as in Europe  she understood decorums too well to entertain me with the ordinary civilities   I had scarce been seated according to her directions  when the footman was ordered to pin   136 a napkin under my chin  this I protested against  as being no way Chinese  however  the whole company  who it seems were a club of connoisseurs  gave it unanimously against me  and the napkin was pinned accordingly   It was impossible to be angry with people  who seemed to err only from an excess of politeness  and I sat contented  expecting their importunities were now at an end  but as soon as ever dinner was served  the lady demanded whether I was for a plate of Bear s claws  or a slice of Birds nests  As these were dishes with which I was utterly unacquainted  I was desirous of eating only what I knew
