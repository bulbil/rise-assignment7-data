may do something in my favour  I will not desire you to tell me so  but do not forbid it  Lady Bidulph knows I respect her  but she is still obdurate  If she relented  would not you madam  do so too   I am   c   How this man distresses me  my dear  What a difficult task have I undertaken  yet I will go through with it  I am fearful of letting Miss Burchell see his answer  so discouraging as it is for her  yet how can I withhold it from her sight  ’Tis necessary I should conceal nothing from her on this occasion  she confides in me  and I must not give her cause for suspicion  She has no right to his vows  This he always said  It is necessary the lady should be quite explicit with me  I doubt she has not been altogether sincere in what she has said to my mother on this subject  I shall see her presently  and discourse with her more particularly on this head than I have ever yet done      I have had a conference with Miss Burchell  a long one  and in private  for I told my mother I wished to talk with her alone   I began with shewing her Mr Faulkland’s last letter  It had the effect I expected  She was exceedingly shocked  I laid my finger on that paragraph  She has no right to my vows  It is necessary  my dear madam  said I  that you should be perfectly open and candid with me on this head  I have entered the lists for you  and will not give up your cause  but it depends on you to furnish me with every possible argument in your favour  If you mislead me by wrong insinuations  instead of putting it in my power to serve you  you will only create to yourself fresh obstacles   It is a nice subject  madam  and what I have ever been cautious of touching upon to you  but in the present situation of your affairs  it is of the utmost importance to you  that you should have no reserves to me  When Mr Faulkland first recommended you to my mother’s acquaintance  he referred her to your honour  for an explanation of certain points  of so delicate a nature  that I am loath to touch upon them  But pardon me  dear Miss Burchell  you must be open with me  Mr Faulkland was obliged to declare  in his own justification  that he never sought to gain your affections  and was so far from    endeavouring to take advantage of the kind sentiments you had for him  that he avoided all opportunities of improving them  that he was even surprized into the fatal step  which has since made you so unhappy  by the artifices of that vile woman  who had the care of you   Mr Faulkland relied so intirely on your candour  that  as I told you before  he referred my mother to you  for a confirmation of the truth of what he advanced  imagining that your testimony would in some measure extenuate his fault  My mother  I have reason to believe  has heard the story from you in a light less favourable to Mr Faulkland  I was married before she received any information on this subject from you  and as any extenuation on Mr Faulkland’s side was then become a matter of indifference to me  I enquired not into particulars  but by what I could judge from my mother’s discourse then  and from hints which she has many times dropped since  I am inclined to believe  that either Mr Faulkland concealed some particulars  or that you  from a delicacy very natural to a young lady in such circumstances  chose to draw a veil over some parts of your story  But  dear madam  all disguises must now be thrown aside  depend upon it  your candour will more effectually recommend you to Mr Faulkland’s esteem  than any thing else  and  perhaps  your justifying him to me  may be no immaterial circumstance in your favour   Variety of passions discovered themselves on her face while I spoke  but shame was predominant  She was mute  and hung down her head  I took her by the hand  Do not think  my dear  I mean to ensnare you  far be such perfidy from my heart  Have I not promised you my assistance  I declare  by every thing that is sacred  you shall have it to the utmost stretch of my power  but do not let a false bashfulness stand between you and sincerity  you will stop up the way to your own happiness if you do  Speak  dear madam  has Mr Faulkland been just in his representations   She burst into a flood of tears  Oh  madam  you read my very soul  what disguise can I make use of  before such penetrating eyes as yours  Yes  Mr Faulkland has spoke the truth  shameful as the confession is for me  I own it  Mrs Gerrarde  base woman  betrayed me  my own mad passion did the rest  Mr Faulkland told me  a few days after the fatal meeting  that he was the most miserable man on
