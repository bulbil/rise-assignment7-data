 perhaps  for Want of that Philosophy    277 and calm Composure  which you have so happily acquired   I am  this Moment  going to dine with Lady —  I have spent much of my Time with her  since I saw you  she is indeed a true practical Philosopher  her Life and Manners furnish as a noble Lesson  as any to be found in the Volumes of Socrates  or Plato —yet not even her prevailing Example  nor all the little Arguments  which my distracted Thoughts can muster  have been able to reduce my Mind  even to its wonted Calm  But I flatter myself that a few Days  by putting an End to some Part of my Anxiety  will abate my Uneasiness  and  for the rest  Time and Time only must be my Physician   I again earnestly intreat  that you write to me much  and often  You cannot conceive the Pleasure  I receive from your Letters  nor the Mortification your missing a Post gives me  Adieu  my Heart s dear Harry  I am  and ever shall be sincerely and affectionately   Your s   P  S  You have got a very sprightly Correspondent  if one may judge of her Letter  by her Countenance  for she fits by me writing  and smiling without Ceasing     268  LETTER CXXXVIII   My dearest FANNY   I CANNOT give up to you the Point about natural Affection  tho  you have disputed it closely with me  You say Reflection cannot make us feel  tho  it may make us act as if we did  which is extremely just  therefore I did not make Reflection the Cause of this Feeling  but Habit   See my first Letter  which  I said  steals so imperceptibly upon us  that we mistake it for Nature  and it is so near it  that it is called a second Nature   I cannot think with you  that the substituting innate Ideas  instead of Reason and Reflection  would be more for the Honour of human Nature  tho  perhaps it would be for the Dignity of it  as a Work made perfect is more valuable than a Work to be perfected  The Dignity lying in the simple Nature of a Thing  but the Honour in the Perfection of it  And surely Socrates  reformed from Vice  or Passion  by the Force of Philosophy  is a nobler Subject for the Honour of Mankind  than Diogenes  who was said never to have been addicted or inclined to any Humour  except that of railing  It was from this Way of thinking  that I said something to you in my last Letter  which  I am afraid  has given you some Offence  I considered you as a Work  capable of Perfection  in order to rouze you to exert yourself  I said  I   269 often tempted you to try your Strength  or found your Depth  Was this Sarcasm  to allow you both Strength and Depth  In short  let this Reflection always prevent any Mistake of this Kind for the Future  that I love you so sincerely  and like you so extremely  that I can never think or mean any Thing  which might give you offence  And  whenever I say or do any Thing which you feel yourself picqued at  you may reprehend my Manners  which are  I confess  liable to Censure  But blame not my Sentiments  which are faultless  with Regard to you   I did attribute your not Writing to the Hurry of Business  and would have wrote to you last Post  but for Fear of pressing you too much  at this Time  as the Fatigue of writing every Post must be too much for you  unless you had more retired Leisure  therefore  I will not be so exact with you for the Future  I will write to you every Post  and  if you answer two  three  or four of my Letters at once  I shall be satisfied  being well convinced that you will not neglect it  on Account of any Employment more pleasant  but from Business more necessary  This is what I have refused you  ever since we were Correspondents  but have thought  at last  that taking off the Constraint of a regular Correspondence would give a freer Air and brisker Spirit to it  The first savoured of Duty  this of Love  —I am▪ my dearest Fanny   Your s only     270  LETTER CXXXIX   MY dear Harry s promised Indulgence shall not make me less sollicitous to express the Pleasure I receive from his charming Correspondence  than if imagined that my Thanks were the Purchase of that Pleasure  I confess that  from the first  I have been incapable of making any other Return  and now find myself  if possible  less capable than ever  for  as the Value of your Letters increases every Day  or  at least  my Esteem for them  conscious as I am of their Worth  it would appear a high Proof of Confidence in me  to attempt any Thing more  than bare Acknowledgments  Accept then  my dearest Love  of the warmest Gratitude  which that Heart  you first taught to
