one o  um gave a zingle vote for the court since the Revolution  Vor my own peart  I value not the ministry three skips of a louse  as the zaying is—I ne er knew but one minister that was an honest man  and vor all the rest  I care not if they were hanged as high as Haman  with a pox to  un  I am  thank God  a vree born  true hearted Englishman  and a loyal  thof unworthy  son of the Church—vor all they have done vor H——r  I d vain know what they have done vor the Church  with a vengeance—vor my own peart  I hate all vorreigners and vorreign measures  whereby this poor nation is broken backed with a dismal load of debt  and the taxes rise so high that the poor cannot get bread  Gentlemen vreeholders of this county  I value no minister a vig s end  d ye see  if you will vavour me with your votes and interest  whereby I may be returned  I ll engage one half of my estate that I never cry yea to your shillings in the pound  but will cross the ministry in everything  as in duty bound  and as becomes an honest vreeholder in the ould interest—but  if you sell your votes and your country for hire  you will be detested in this here world  and damned in the next to all eternity  so I leave every man to his own conscience    This eloquent oration was received by his own friends with loud peals of applause  which  however  did not discourage his competitor  who  confident of his own strength  ascended the rostrum  or  in other words  an old cask  set upright for the purpose  Having bowed all round to the audience  with a smile of gentle condescension  he told them how ambitious he was of the honour to represent this county in parliament  and how happy he found himself in the encouragement of his friends  who had so unanimously agreed to support his pretensions  He said  over and above the qualifications he possessed among them  he had fourscore thousand pounds in his pocket  which he had acquired by commerce  the support of the nation  under the present happy establishment  in defence of which he was ready to spend the last farthing  He owned himself a faithful subject to his Majesty King George  sincerely attached to the Protestant succession  in detestation and defiance of a popish  an abjured  and outlawed Pretender  and declared that he would exhaust his substance and his blood  if necessary  in maintaining the principles of the glorious Revolution   This   cried he   is the solid basis and foundation upon which I stand    These last words had scarce proceeded from his mouth  when the head of the barrel or puncheon on which he stood  being frail and infirm  gave way  so that down he went with a crash  and in a twinkling disappeared from the eyes of the astonished beholders  The fox hunters  perceiving his disaster  exclaimed  in the phrase and accent of the chase   Stole away  stole away   and with hideous vociferation  joined in the sylvan chorus which the hunters halloo when the hounds are at fault   The disaster of Mr  Vanderpelft was soon repaired by the assiduity of his friends  who disengaged him from the barrel in a trice  hoisted him on the shoulders of four strong weavers  and  resenting the unmannerly exultation of their antagonists  began to form themselves in order of battle   An obstinate fray would have undoubtedly ensued  had not their mutual indignation given way to their curiosity  at the motion of our knight  who had advanced into the middle between the two fronts  and waving his hand as a signal for them to give attention  addressed himself to them  with graceful demeanour  in these words — Countrymen  friends  and fellow citizens  you are this day assembled to determine a point of the utmost consequence to yourselves and your posterity  a point that ought to be determined by far other weapons than brutal force and factious clamour  You  the freemen of England  are the basis of that excellent constitution which hath long flourished the object of envy and admiration  To you belongs the inestimable privilege of choosing a delegate properly qualified to represent you in the High Court of Parliament  This is your birthright —inherited from your ancestors  obtained by their courage  and sealed with their blood  It is not only your birthright  which you should maintain in defiance of all danger  but also a sacred trust  to be executed with the most scrupulous care and fidelity  The person whom you trust ought not only to be endued with the most inflexible integrity  but should likewise possess a fund of knowledge that may enable him to act as a part of the legislature  He must be well acquainted with the history  the constitution  and the laws of his country  he must understand the forms of business  the extent of the royal prerogative  the privilege of parliament  the detail of government  the nature and regulation of the finances  the different branches of commerce  the politics that prevail  and the connexions that subsist among the different powers of Europe
