a little  and to permit me to send for my brother  Sir George you know has an intire affection for you  said I  you may trust him with your life in safety   I had forgot him  said he  poor Bidulph  he will be afflicted when he hears my story   I instantly wrote a line to my brother requesting to see him immediately  By good fortune he was home  and came to me directly   In the mean time  as I saw Mr Faulkland’s mind was exceedingly disturbed  I endeavoured  by giving him an account of my own situation  to divert his thoughts from the trouble that preyed on them  for I was apprehensive of his relapsing into the same phrenzy that had so much terrified me  if I touched on the cause  and therefore chose to defer enquiring into the particulars of his misfortune  till my brother should be present   Sir George was equally astonished with me at the sight of Mr Faulkland  they embraced tenderly  poor Mr Faulkland wept upon my brother’s neck  It was easy to discover he laboured under some extraordinary affliction   My brother looked at me as if for an explanation  he seemed to guess at least part of the fatal truth  Are you come to England alone  Faulkland  said he  I prevented the reply  he is alone  said I  he has a    dreadful story to relate to you  Mrs Faulkland is dead  I durst not ask the manner of her death  till you were by  to calm the transports of your friend   My heart forebodes  answered my brother  addressing himself to Mr Faulkland  that the ungrateful woman you married has betrayed you  She did  replied Mr Faulkland  but I did not mean to stain my hands with her blood  perfidious as she was  her death be on her own head   Sir George looked astonished  that she is dead I rejoice said he  but how my dear Faulkland  were you accessary to it   We were that instant interrupted  Mr Warner passing by  called to ask me how I did  and as my brother’s chariot stood at the door  I could not be denied to him  though I had ordered that nobody should be let in   I was called down to him  and indeed was not sorry to have an excuse for absenting myself a while  for my spirits were quite overpowered   Mr Warner quickly observed that something extraordinary had happened  and as he was already acquainted with the greatest part of Mr Faulkland’s history  some particulars relative to his wife excepted  I made no scruple  relying on his prudence and secrecy  of telling him the cause of my present distress  in which he seemed to take a friendly and even paternal share   When he was gone  I returned to the room where I had left my brother and his friend  They both seemed in extreme agitation  they were walking about   This is an unfortunate affair  said my brother  and may be attended with dreadful consequences  if Faulkland does not shew more regard to his own safety  than he seems inclined to do  I have been persuading him to retire to a place which I can provide for him  where he may lye concealed for a day or two  till he is recovered from the fatigue of his journey  for he has travelled night and day for these three days without sleeping   Sir George looked at me  and by a sorrowful sign which he made  I apprehended he feared his unhappy friend’s head was disturbed   For heaven’s sake  Sir  said I  be advised by my brother  who loves you  suffer him to conduct you to some place of security  when you have had a little repose we will both come to you  and concert such measures as shall be best for your safety   He snatched my hand  Sir George is my true friend  said he  take    care that you do not deceive me  I find myself giddy for want of rest  I am satisfied to be disposed of for to night how you please  But give me your word of honour that I shall see you in the morning   You shall indeed  Sir  I replied   Depend upon it  answered Sir George  I’ll bring her to you myself   He looked irresolute  and as if he knew not what to say  then turning to my brother  and leaning on his shoulder  Do  dear Bidulph  carry me to some place where I may lie down  for my spirits can hold out no longer   Come  said Sir George  taking him under the arm  my chariot is at the door  I will bring you to a house where you may be quiet at home   Mr Faulkland rivetted his eyes on me  as my brother led him out of the room  but he did not speak   Sir George whispered me that he would return again  They went into the chariot together and drove away   It was ten o’clock before my brother returned  He told me he had lodged Mr Faulkland safely at a friend’s house in whom he could confide  as he
