married  and  to add to all this  he was loved by his subjects  whom he had won by his virtues and address     2 But this was but a flattering prospect  the spirit of liberty was rouzed  and was resolved to oppose the ancient claims of Monarchs  who usurped their power in times of ignorance or danger  confirmed it by laws  and continued it by long prescription  Charles had been  from his infancy  taught to consider the royal privileges as sacred pledges  which it was his duty to defend  his father had implanted the doctrines of hereditary and indefeasible right early upon his mind  James only defended those doctrines by words  and it was soon the fate of Charles to assert them by action  It is the duty of every Sovereign to consider the genius and disposition of his people  as a father does that of his children  and to adapt his government to each conjuncture  Charles mistook that genius  he wanted to govern a people who had  for some time  learned to be free by maxims and precedents  that had their origin in times of ignorance and slavery   He therefore began his reign with two of the most difficult projects that could be conceived  the one to succour the Protestants in Germany against the Emperor and Duke of Bavaria  the other to keep the royal prerogatives entire  without a national standing army  In order to effect these purposes  the house of commons was to be managed  who  as I have already described  from being the oppressed party  were now willing  in turn  to become oppressors  who  from a detestation of Popery  had now overshot the mark  and were become Puritans  His first demand for the necessary supplies to carry on the war of the Palatinate in Germany  though undertaken at their own request  was answered with a petition for punishing Papists  and for an examination into the grievances of the nation  Buckingham  who had been the late King s favourite  and who was still more caressed by the present Monarch  did not escape their censures  instead of granting the   3 sums requisite  they employed the time in vain disputations and complaints  till the season for prosecuting the intended campaign was elapsed  The King  therefore  at length wearied with their delays  and offended at their contempt of his demands  thought proper to dissolve a parliament which he could not bring to reason  In fact  the commons  at this time  complained of imaginary grievances  but the time was approaching when their complaints were to become real   The ministers of the King had not yet forgot that kind of tax which was called a benevolence  and which had been often exacted from the subject in former reigns  Charles thought to avail himself of this method of procuring money  but at the same time coloured it over with a greater appearance of justice than any of his predecessors  He therefore determined to borrow money of such persons as were best able to lend  to whom  for this purpose  he directed letters  mentioning the sum  With this the people reluctantly complied  it was  in fact  a grievance  though authorised by a thousand precedents  but no precedent can give sanction to injustice  With this money a fleet was equipped and sent against Spain  but which returned without procuring either glory or advantage   This ineffectual expedition demanded to be repaired by a new supply greater than what extorted loans could produce  and another parliament was called for this purpose  The new parliament  upon this occasion  seemed even more refractory than the former  and appeared more willing to make or to complain of grievances than to grant money  but chiefly their resentment was directed against Buckingham  the royal favourite  Whenever the subjects attack the royal prerogative  they begin with the favourites of the crown  and wise Princes  sensible of this  seldom have any  Charles was not possessed of the   4 art of making a distinction between friends and ministers  whoever was his favourite him he always entrusted with the administration of affairs  he loved Buckingham  and undertook to defend him  to defend this nobleman was to share his reproach  two members of the house of commons  Diggs and Elliot  undertook to accuse him  The purport of the charge amounted to little more than that he had engrossed too much power for himself and his relations  and that he had applied a plaister to the late King s side which was supposed to be poisonous  They inveighed against the Duke from this frivolous accusation  and the King  in a passion  ordered them both to the Tower  This was an open act of violence  and should have been supported  or ever performed  The commons exclaimed  that their privileges were infringed  they protested that neither of the members had spoken any thing disrespectful of his Majesty  and began to publish their vindication  The King  who was ever ready to enter upon harsh measures  but not to support them  released the two members  and this compliance confirmed that obstinacy which his former injury had contributed to raise  The Earl of Arundel  for being guilty of the same offence in the house of Lords  was imprisoned and dismissed in the same manner by the King
