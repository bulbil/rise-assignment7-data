At length    however  he said  not without some hesitation   Is there no one    Abdallah  who will thank me for the preservation of thy daughter  with a   zeal equal to thy own    Yes   replied Abdallah   that daughter whom   thou hast preserved   This reply  though it was unexpected was pleasing    for HAMET was not only gratified to hear  that ALMEIDA had expressed   herself warmly in his behalf  at least as a benefactor  but he judged    that if any man had been interested in her life as a lover  the answer   which Abdallah had given him would not so readily have occurred to his   mind       As this reflection kept HAMET a few moments silent  Abdallah withdrew    and HAMET  as he observed some marks of haste and confusion in his   countenance  was unwilling longer to continue him in a situation  which   he had now reason to think gave him pain  But Abdallah  who had   conceived a sudden thought that HAMET S question was an indirect   reproach of ALMEIDA  for not having herself solicited admission to his   presence  went in haste to her apartment  and ordered her immediately   to make ready to attend him to the king       ALMEIDA  from whose mind the image of HAMET had not been absent a moment   since she first saw him  received this order with a mixture of pain and   pleasure  of wishes  hopes  and apprehensions  that filled her bosom   with emotion  and covered her face with blushes  She had not courage to   ask the reason of the command  which she instantly prepared to obey  but   the tenderness of Abdallah  who perceived and pitied her distress    anticipated her wish  In a short time  therefore  he returned to the   chamber of presence  and having received permission  he entered with   ALMEIDA in his hand  HAMET rose in haste to receive her  with a glow of   pleasure and impatience in his countenance  and having raised her from   the ground  supported her in his arms  waiting to hear her voice  but   though she made many attempts  she could not speak  HAMET  who knew not   to what he owed this sudden and unexpected interview  which  though he   wished  he could contrive no means to obtain  imagined that ALMEIDA had   some request  and therefore urged her tenderly to make it  but as she   still remained silent  he looked at Abdallah  as expecting to hear it   from him   We have no wish   said Abdallah   but to atone for our   offence  nor any request  but that my lord would now accept the thanks   of ALMEIDA for the life which he has preserved  and impute the delay    not to ingratitude  but inadvertence  let me now take her back  as thy   gift  and let the light of thy favour be upon us    Take her then   said   HAMET   for I would give her only to thee        These words of HAMET did not escape the notice either of Abdallah or   ALMEIDA  but neither of them mentioned their conjectures to the other    ALMEIDA  who was inclined to judge of HAMET S situation by her own  and   who recollected many little incidents  known only to herself  which   favoured her wishes  indulged the hope  that she should again hear of   HAMET  with more confidence than her father  nor were her expectations   disappointed  HAMET reflected with pleasure  that he had prepared the   way for a more explicit declaration  and as his impatience increased   with his passion every hour  he sent for Abdallah the next morning  and   told him  that he wished to be more acquainted with his daughter  with a   view to make her his wife   As neither you nor your daughter are my   subjects   says HAMET   I cannot command you  and if you were  upon this   occasion I would not  I do not want a slave  but a friend  not merely a   woman  but a wife  If I find ALMEIDA such as my fancy has feigned her    if her mind corresponds with her form  and if I have reason to think    that she can give her heart to HAMET  and not merely her hand to the   king  I shall be happy   To this declaration  Abdallah replied with   expressions of the profoundest submission and gratitude  and HAMET   dismissed him  to prepare ALMEIDA to receive him in the afternoon of the   same day                CHAP  VII          As eight moons only had passed since
