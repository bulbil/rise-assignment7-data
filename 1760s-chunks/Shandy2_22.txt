into their hands to my disadvantage —I consider that honesty serves the purposes of this life —I know their success in the world depends upon the fairness of their characters —In a word —I m persuaded that they cannot hurt me  without hurting themselves more    But put it otherwise  namely  that interest lay  for once  on the other side  that a case should happen  wherein the one  without stain to his reputation  could secrete my fortune  and leave    me naked in the world —or that the other could send me out of it  and enjoy an estate by my death  without dishonour to himself or his art —In this case  what hold have I of either of them —Religion  the strongest of all motives  is out of the question —Interest  the next most powerful motive in the world  is strongly against me —What have I left to cast into the opposite scale to balance this temptation —Alas  I have nothing —nothing but what is lighter than a bubble—I must lay at the mercy of HONOUR  or some such capricious principle —Strait security for two of my most valuable blessings —my property and my life    As  therefore  we can have no dependence upon morality without religion —so  on the other hand  there is    nothing better to be expected from religion without morality —nevertheless   tis no prodigy to see a man whose real moral character stands very low  who yet entertains the highest notion of himself  in the light of a religious man    He shall not only be covetous  revengeful  implacable —but even wanting in points of common honesty  yet  inasmuch as he talks aloud against the infidelity of the age —is zealous for some points of religion —goes twice a day to church —attends the sacraments —and amuses himself with a few instrumental parts of religion —shall cheat his conscience into a judgment that  for this  he is a religious man  and has discharged truly his duty to God     And you will find that such a man  through force of this delusion  generally looks down with spiritual pride upon every other man who has less affectation of piety —though  perhaps  ten times more moral honesty than  himself    This likewise is a sore evil under the sun  and  I believe there is no one mistaken principle  which  for its time  has wrought more serious mischiefs —For a general proof of this —examine the history of the Romish church  — Well  what can you make of that  cried Dr  Slop  — see what scenes of cruelty  murders  rapines  blood shed    They may thank their own obstinacy  cried Dr  Slop   have all been sanctified by a religion not strictly governed by morality      In how many kingdoms of the world    Here Trim kept waving his right hand from the sermon to the extent of his arm  returning it backwards and forwards to the conclusion of the paragraph     In how many kingdoms of the world has the crusading sword of this misguided saint errant spared neither age  or merit  or sex  or condition —and  as he fought under the banners of a religion which set him loose from justice and humanity  he shew d none  mercilessly trampled upon both —heard neither the cries of the unfortunate  nor pitied their distresses     I have been in many a battle  an  please your Honour  quoth Trim  sighing  but never in so melancholy a one as this —I would not have drawn a tricker    in it  against these poor souls —to have been made a general officer —Why  what do you understand of the affair  said Dr  Slop  looking towardsTrim with something more contempt than the Corporal s honest heart deserved —What do you know  friend  about this battle you talk of —I know  replied Trim  that I never refused quarter in my life to any man who cried out for it —but to a woman or a child  continued Trim  before I would level my musket at them  I would lose my life a thousand times —Here s a crown for thee  Trim  to drink with Obadiah to night  quoth my uncle Toby and I ll give Obadiah another too —God bless your Honour  replied Trim —I had rather these poor women and children had it —Thou art an honest fellow  quoth my uncle Toby —My father nodded his    head —as much as to say —and so he is —  But pri thee Trim  said my father  make an end —for I see thou hast but a leaf or two left    Corporal Trim read on    If the testimony of past centuries in this matter is not sufficient —consider at this instant  how the votaries of that religion are every day thinking to do service and honour to God  by actions which are a dishonour and scandal to themselves    To be convinced of this  go with me for a moment into the prisons of the inquisition    God help my poor brother Tom  — Behold Religion with    Mercy and Justice chained down under her feet —there sitting ghastly upon a black tribunal  propp d up
