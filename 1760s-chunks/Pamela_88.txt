    And thee  too  from the D   l          Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday       I write now with a little more liking  though less opportunity  because   Mr  Williams has got a large parcel of my papers  safe in his hands    to send them to you  as he has opportunity  so I am not quite uselessly   employed  and I am delivered besides  from the fear of their being   found  if I should be searched  or discovered  I have been permitted to   take an airing  five or six miles  with Mrs  Jewkes  But  though I know   not the reason  she watches me more closely than ever  so that we   have discontinued  by consent  for these three days  the sunflower   correspondence       The poor cook maid has had a bad mischance  for she has been hurt much   by a bull in the pasture  by the side of the garden  not far from the   back door  Now this pasture I am to cross  which is about half a mile    and then is a common  and near that a private horse road  where I hope   to find an opportunity for escaping  as soon as Mr  Williams can get me   a horse  and has made all ready for me  for he has got me the key  which   he put under the mould  just by the door  as he found an opportunity to   hint to me       He just now has signified  that the gentleman is dead  whose living he   has had hope of  and he came pretendedly to tell Mrs  Jewkes of it  and   so could speak this to her before me  She wished him joy  See what the   world is  One man s death is another man s joy  Thus we thrust out   one another   My hard case makes me serious  He found means to slide   a letter into my hands  and is gone away  He looked at me with such   respect and solemness at parting  that Mrs  Jewkes said  Why  madam    I believe our young parson is half in love with you   Ah  Mrs  Jewkes    said I  he knows better  Said she   I believe to sound me   Why  I can t   see you can either of you do better  and I have lately been so touched   for you  seeing how heavily you apprehend dishonour from my master  that   I think it is pity you should not have Mr  Williams       I knew this must be a fetch of hers  because  instead of being troubled   for me  as she pretended  she watched me closer  and him too  and so I   said  There is not the man living that I desire to marry  If I can   but keep myself honest  it is all my desire  And to be a comfort and   assistance to my poor parents  if it should be my happy lot to be so  is   the very top of my ambition  Well  but  said she  I have been thinking   very seriously  that Mr  Williams would make you a good husband  and as   he will owe all his fortune to my master  he will be very glad  to be   sure  to be obliged to him for a wife of his choosing  especially  said   she  such a pretty one  and one so ingenious  and genteelly educated       This gave me a doubt  whether she knew of my master s intimation of that   sort formerly  and I asked her  if she had reason to surmise that that   was in view  No  she said  it was only her own thought  but it was very   likely that my master had either that in view  or something better for   me  But  if I approved of it  she would propose such a thing to   her master directly  and gave a detestable hint  that I might take   resolutions upon it  of bringing such an affair to effect  I told her I   abhorred her vile insinuation  and as to Mr  Williams  I thought him a   civil good sort of man  but  as on one side  he was above me  so  on   the other  I said of all things I did not love a parson  So  finding   she could make nothing of me  she quitted the subject  I will open his   letter by and by  and give you the contents of it  for she is up and   down so much  that I am afraid of her surprising me       Well  I see Providence
