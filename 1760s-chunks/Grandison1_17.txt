think himself under obligation to one who had taken notice of him  when nobody else would  Bachelors wives  Maids children  These old saws always mean something   Mr  Fowler saw me at my cousin Reeves s the first time  I cannot say he is disagreeable in his person  But he seems to want the mind I would have a man bless d with  to whom I am to vow love and honour  I purpose  whenever I marry  to make a very good and even a dutiful wife  Must I not vow obedience  And shall I break my marriage vow    I would not  therefore  on any consideration  marry a man  whose want of knowlege might make me stagger in the performance of my duty to him  and who would perhaps command  from caprice or want of understanding  what I should think unreasonable to be complied with  There is a pleasure and a credit in yielding up even one s judgment in things indifferent  to a man who is older and wiser than one s self  But we are apt to doubt in one of a contrary character  what in the other we should have no doubt about  And doubt  you know  of a person s merit  is the first step to disrespect  And what  but disobedience  which lets in every evil  is the next   I saw instantly that Mr  Fowler beheld me with a distinguished regard  We women  you know  Let me for once be aforehand with my uncle  are very quick in making discoveries of this nature  But everybody   38 at table saw it  He came again next day  and besought Mr  Reeves to give him his interest with me  without asking any questions about my fortune  tho  he was even generously particular as to his own  He might  since he has an unexceptionable one  Who is it in these cases that forgets to set foremost the advantages by which he is distinguished  While fortune is the last thing talk d of by him who has little or none  And then Love  Love  Love  is all his cry   Mr  Reeves  who has a good opinion of Mr  Fowler  in answer to his enquiries  told him  that he believed I was disengaged in my affections  Mr  Fowler rejoiced at that  That I had no questions to ask  but those of duty  which indeed  he said  was a stronger tie with me than interest  He praised my temper  and my frankness of heart  the latter at the expence of my Sex  for which I least thank d him  when he told me what he had said  In short  he acquainted him with every thing that was necessary  and more than was necessary  for him to know  of the favour of my family  and of my good Mr  Deane  in referring all proposals of this kind to myself  mingling the detail with commendations  which only could be excused by the goodness of his own heart  and accounted for by his partiality to his cousin   Mr  Fowler expressed great apprehensions on my cousin s talking of these references of my grandmother  aunt  and Mr  Deane  to myself  on occasions of this nature  which  he said  he presumed had been too frequent for his hopes   If you have any hope  Mr  Fowler  said Mr  Reeves  it must be in your good character  and that much preferably to your clear estate and great expectations  Altho  she takes no pride in the number of her admirers  yet is it natural to suppose  that it has made her more difficult  and her difficulties are enhanced  in proportion to the generous confidence which all her friends have in her discretion  And   39 when I told him  proceeded Mr  Reeves  that your fortune exceeded greatly what Sir Rowland required in a wife for him  and that you had  as well from inclination  as education  a serious turn  Too much  too much  in one person  cried he out  As to fortune  he wish d you had not a shilling  and if he could obtain your favour  he should be the happiest man in the world   O my good Mr  Reeves  said I  how have you over rated my merits  Surely  you have not given Mr  Fowler your interest  If you have  should you not  for his sake  have known something of my mind before you had set me out thus  had I even deserved your high opinion  or Mr  Fowler might have reason to repent the double well meant kindness of his friend  if men in these days were used to break their hearts for Love   It is the language I do and must talk of you in  to every body  return d Mr  Reeves  Is it not the language that those most talk who know you best   Where the world is inclined to favour  replied I  it is apt to over rate  as much as it will under rate where it disfavours  In this case  you should not have proceeded so far as to engage a gentleman s hopes
