for the constable to Belmonte on that very day  and the marriage ceremony was performed privately in the chapel of the castle  What a crisis for Blanche  It was not enough to renounce a crown  to lose a lover endeared to her by every tie  and to yield herself up to the object of her hatred  In addition to all this  she must put a constraint on her sentiments before a husband  naturally jealous  and long occupied with the most ardent admiration of her charms  The bridegroom  delighted in the possession of her  was all day long in her presence  He did not leave her to the miserable consolation of pouring out her sorrows in secret  When night arrived  Leontio s daughter felt all her disgust and terror redoubled  But what seemed likely to become of her when her women  after having undressed her  left her alone with the constable  He enquired respectfully into the cause of her apparent faintness and discomposure  The question was sufficiently embarrassing to Blanche  who affected to be ill  Her husband was at first deceived by her pretences  but he did not long remain in such an error  Being  as he was  sincerely concerned at the condition in which he saw her  but still pressing her to go to bed  his urgent solicitations  falsely construed by her  offered to her wounded mind an image so cruel and indelicate  that she could no longer dissemble what was passing within  but gave a free course to her sighs and tears  What a discovery for a man who thought himself at the summit of his wishes  He no longer doubted but the distressed state of his wife was fraught with some sinister omen to his love  And yet  though this knowledge reduced him to a situation almost as deplorable as that of Blanche  he had sufficient command over himself to keep his suspicions within his own breast  He redoubled his assiduities  and went on pressing his bride to lay herself down  assuring her that the repose of which she stood in need should be undisturbed by his interruption  He offered of his own accord even to call her women  if she was of opinion that their attendance could afford any relief to her indisposition  Blanche  reviving at that proposal  told him that sleep was the best remedy for the debility under which she laboured  He affected to think so too  They accordingly partook of the same bed  but with a conduct altogether different from what the laws of love  sanctioned by the rites of marriage  might authorize in a pair mutually delighted and delighting   While Siffredi s daughter was giving way to her grief  the constable was hunting in his own mind for the causes which might render the nuptial office so contemptible a sinecure in his hands  He could not be long in conjecturing that he had a rival  but when he attempted to discover him he was lost in the labyrinth of his own ideas  All he knew with certainty  was the peculiar severity of his own fate  He had already passed two thirds of the night in this perplexity of thought  when an undistinguishable noise grew gradually on his sense of hearing  Great was his surprise when a footstep seemed audibly to pace about the room  He fancied himself mistaken  for he recollected shutting the door himself after Blanche s women had retired  He drew back the curtain to satisfy his senses on the occasion of this extraordinary noise  But the light in the chimney corner had gone out  and he soon heard a feeble and melancholy voice calling Blanche with anxious and importunate repetitions  Then did the suggestions of his jealousy transport him into rage  His insulted honour obliging him to rush from the bed to which he had so long aspired  and either to prevent a meditated injury  or take vengeance for its perpetration  he caught up his sword and flew forward in the direction whence the voice seemed to proceed  He felt a naked blade opposed to his own  As he advanced  his antagonist retired  The pursuit became more eager  the retreat more precipitate  His search was vigilant  and every corner of the room seemed to contain its object  but that which he momentarily occupied  The darkness  however  favoured the unknown invader  and he was nowhere to be found  The pursuer halted  He listened  but heard no sound  It seemed like enchantment  He made for the door  under the idea that this was the outlet to the secret assassin of his honour  yet the bolt was shot as fast as before  Unable to comprehend this strange occurrence  he called those of his retinue who were most within reach of his voice  As he opened the door for this purpose  he placed himself so as to prevent all egress  and stood upon his guard  lest the devoted victim of his search should escape   At his redoubled cries  some servants ran with lights  He laid hold of a taper  and renewed his search in the chamber with his sword still drawn  Yet he found no one there  nor any apparent sign of any person having been in the room  He was not aware of any private door  nor could he discover any practicable mode of escape  yet for all this  he could not shut his eyes against the
