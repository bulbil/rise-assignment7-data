of taking refuge at the court of France  where he was sure of finding   79 assistance and protection  Thus instructed  he first sent away his Queen  who arrived safely at Calais  and soon after  disguising himself in a plain dress  he went down to Feversham  and embarked on board a small vessel for France  His misfortunes still continued to follow him  the vessel was detained by the common people  who not knowing their Sovereign  robbed  insulted  and abused him  He was now persuaded by the Earl of Winchelsea to return to London  where he was once more received amidst the acclamations of the people   The return of James was by no means agreeable to William  though he well knew how to dissemble  It was his interest and his design to increase the forsaken Monarch s apprehensions  so as to induce him to fly  He therefore received the news of his return with a haughty air  and ordered him to leave Whitehall  and retire to Richmond  The King remonstrated against Richmond  and desired that Rochester might be appointed as the place of his abode  The Prince perceived his intention was to leave the kingdom  nor did one wish for flight more ardently than did the other desire him away  The King soon concurred with his designs  after staying but a short time at Rochester  he fled to the sea side  attended by his natural son the Duke of Berwick  where he embarked for France  and arrived in safety  to enjoy  for the rest of life  the empty title of a King  and the appellation of a Saint  a title which still flattered him more  Here he continued to reside among a people who pitied  ridiculed  and despised him  He inrolled himself in the order of Jesuits  and the court of Rome  for whom he had lost all  repaid him only with indulgences and pasquinades   From this moment the constitution of England  that had fluctuated for so many ages  was fixed  The nation  represented by its parliament  determined   80 the long contested limits between the King and the people  they prescribed to the Prince of Orange the terms by which he was to rule  they chose him for King  jointly with Mary  who was the next Protestant heir to the crown  They were crowned with titles of William III  and Mary  King and Queen of England  The Prince saw his ambition  at length  gratified  and his wisdom was repaid with that crown which the folly of his predecessor had given away   I am   c   LETTER X   THOUGH William was chosen King of England  his power was limited on every side  and the opposition he met with from his parliaments still lessened the regal authority  His sway in Holland  where he was but the Stadtholder  was far more arbitrary  so that he might  with greater propriety  have been called the King of the United Provinces  and the Stadtholder of England  He was not sufficiently acquainted with the difficulty of governing the nation by which he was elected  he expected in them a people ready to second the views of his ambition in humbling France  but he found them more apt to fear for the invasion of their domestic liberties from himself   His reign commenced  however  with the same attempt which had been the principal cause of all the disturbances in the preceding reign  and had excluded the Monarch from the throne  William was a Calvinist  and naturally averse to persecution  He therefore began by attempting to repeal those laws that enjoined uniformity of worship  and  though he could not entirely succeed in his design  yet a toleration   81 was granted to such Dissenters as should take the oaths of allegiance  and hold no private conventicles  The Papists also enjoyed the lenity of his government  and  though the laws against them continued to subsist  yet they were seldom put into rigorous execution  What was criminal in James was virtuous in his successor  James only wanted to introduce persecution by pretending to disown it  William was averse to persecution from principle  and none suffered for religious opinions during his reign   But  though William was acknowledged in England  Scotland was still undetermined  The parliament of that country  however  soon recognized his authority  and took that opportunity to abolish episcopacy  which had been long disagreeable to the nation  Nothing now remained to the deposed Monarch  of all his former dominions  but Ireland  His cause was espoused by all the Catholics of that country  who were much more numerous there than those of the Protestant persuasion  The King of France  either touched with compassion for his sufferings  or willing to weaken a rival kingdom by internal dissensions  granted James a fleet and some troops  to assert his claims there  On the seventh day of May this unhappy Monarch embarked at Brest  and on the twenty second arrived at Kinsale  He was received by the Catholics of Ireland with open arms  The Protestants  who were unanimously attached to King William  had been previously disarmed by Tyrconnel  their Lord lieutenant  and a Papist  James made his public entry into Dublin amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants  He was met by a Popish procession
