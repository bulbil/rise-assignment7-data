advanced to the  injured party  and begged pardon for the share he had in giving him  such disturbance  He declared  in the most solemn manner  that he had no    6 22 15  3 45 PM   other intention than that of contributing towards his welfare  and that  his behaviour was the result of the physician s prescription  which he  affirmed was absolutely necessary for the recovery of his health   The painter  who had very little gall in his disposition  was satisfied  with this apology  but his resentment  which was before divided  now  glowed with double fire against his first fellow traveller  whom he  looked upon as the author of all the mischances he had undergone   and marked out for his vengeance accordingly  Yet the doors of  reconciliation were not shut against the doctor  who  with great  justice  might have transferred this load of offence from himself  to Peregrine  who was  without doubt  the source of the painter s  misfortune  but  in that case  he must have owned himself mistaken in  his medical capacity  and he did not think the friendship of Pallet  important enough to be retrieved by such condescension  so that he  resolved to neglect him entirely  and gradually forget the former  correspondence he had maintained with a person whom he deemed so  unworthy of his notice   CHAPTER LVIII   Peregrine  almost distracted with his Disappointment  conjures the  fair Fleming to permit his Visits at Brussels  She withdraws from his  Pursuit   Things being thus adjusted  and all the company dressed  they went to  breakfast about five in the morning  and in less than an hour after were  seated in the diligence  where a profound silence prevailed  Peregrine   who used to be the life of the society  was extremely pensive and  melancholy on account of his mishap  the Israelite and his dulcinea  dejected in consequence of their disgrace  the poet absorbed in lofty  meditation  the painter in schemes of revenge  while Jolter  rocked by  the motion of the carriage  made himself amends for the want of rest he  had sustained  and the mendicant  with his fair charge  were infected  by the cloudy aspect of our youth  in whose disappointment each of  them  for different reasons  bore no inconsiderable share  This general  languor and recess from all bodily exercise disposed them all to receive  the gentle yoke of slumber  and in half an hour after they had embarked   there was not one of them awake  except our hero and his mistress   unless the Capuchin was pleased to counterfeit sleep  in order to  indulge our young gentleman with an opportunity of enjoying some private  conversation with his beauteous ward   Peregrine did not neglect the occasion  but  on the contrary  seized  the first minute  and  in gentle murmurs  lamented his hard hap in  being thus the sport of fortune  He assured her  and that with great  sincerity  that all the cross accidents of his life had not cost him one  half of the vexation and keenness of chagrin which he had suffered last  night  and that now he was on the brink of parting from her  he should  be overwhelmed with the blackest despair  if she would not extend her  compassion so far as to give him an opportunity of sighing at her feet  in Brussels  during the few days his affairs would permit him to spend    6 22 15  3 45 PM   in that city  This young lady  with an air of mortification  expressed  her sorrow for being the innocent cause of his anxiety  said she hoped  last night s adventure would be a salutary warning to both their souls   for she was persuaded  that her virtue was protected by the intervention  of Heaven  that whatever impression it might have made upon him  she was  enabled by it to adhere to that duty from which her passion had begun to  swerve  and  beseeching him to forget her for his own peace  gave him to  understand  that neither the plan she had laid down for her own conduct   nor the dictates of her honour  would allow her to receive his visits   or carry on any other correspondence with him  while she was restricted  by the articles of her marriage vow   This explanation produced such a violent effect upon her admirer  that  he was for some minutes deprived of the faculty of speech  which he no  sooner recovered  than he gave vent to the most unbridled transports of  passion  He taxed her with barbarity and indifference  told her  that  she had robbed him of his reason and internal peace  that he would  follow her to the ends of the earth  and cease to live sooner than cease  to love her  that he would sacrifice the innocent fool who had been the  occasion of all this disquiet  and murder every man whom he considered  as an obstruction to his views  In a word  his passions  which had  continued so long in a state of the
