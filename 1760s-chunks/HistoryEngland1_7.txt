languages and customs were super induced over the ancient Celtic  All those countries  most accessible to strangers  or most subject to invasions  were first changed  those which lay surrounded by mountains  or were in some measure retired by their situation  such as Wales  the Highlands of Scotland  Ireland  Biscay  Crim Tartary   c  all preserved their primitive manners  It is even found  that these countries still adhere to many of the ancient Druidical customs  as far as the alteration of religion will admit  We have  as yet  an opportunity of viewing many of their ancient  and  in some measure  venerable superstitions  still in Ireland  these are  however  wearing out by degrees  and another century will entirely efface every vestige of barbarous antiquity  I am   Dear Charles   c     19  LETTER IV   IT is  in some measure  happy for a barbarous people to be conquered by a country more polite than themselves  Whatever evils the ambition of heroes generally produces  it is attended with one advantage  that of disseminating arts  and making humanity more extensive  The Britons  savage and rude as they were  in some measure  called for more polite instructors  and the Romans  of all the conquerors history can produce  were at once the most polite  the most generous  and humane   A country  divided like Britain into a variety of small principalities  must necessarily have been separated into various  and often opposite  interests  Its princes must have been frequently at war  merely for the sake of plunder  to keep their troops in exercise  or to gratify vanity and ambition  We may easily  therefore  form an idea of the miseries of a rude people  who had nothing but fear to keep them from war with each other  and who could build no longer on a lasting peace  than while they avoided giving an opportunity of plunder to their enemies   To complete the picture of the calamities of this people  all the trading and maritime towns  next the continent  were in possession of foreign invaders long before the Romans entered the island  These were a people who had been received from motives of hospitality  and who  under the character of exiles in distress  having got footing and shelter amongst the natives  afterwards made war upon them  as enemies  This  added to their frequent tumults and massacres among each other    20 rendered them  not only internally unhappy  but an easy prey to every invader  Besides  they were ill supplied with arms  and those they had were only such as were no longer in use among the refined nations of the continent  They fought in chariots armed with scythes  applied to the wheels  These were terrible without execution  and made rather to astonish the rude and ignorant  than to break such ranks  as were not to be daunted by the mere appearance of danger  Their defensive armour only consisted of a wicker shield  and they approached an enemy shouting  clashing their arms  and sounding their trumpets  as if they had a design rather to terrify than destroy  Their chariots generally attacked the enemy s cavalry  and from these they would frequently leap  and fight on foot  till  being fatigued or overpowered  they would resume their seats and make the best retreat possible  Unpolished nations  though they have more fierceness in the onset  never act with that cool presevering resolution  which almost ever ensures victory  This can be acquired  only where discipline and subordination have long prevailed  and a nation  however brave  levied in haste  will probably never make a figure against veteran troops  hardened by contention  or elated by long success  This was the nature of the inhabitants  but the face of the country rendered them still more open to every invader  It was plain and open  without towns  fortresses  or any place of retreat to secure them from an enemy  except what their forests might happen to afford  in a word  they were destitute of all means of defence  but what their native courage was able to supply  or a love of liberty might inspire     21 Such were the people and customs of Britain  when the Romans first invaded their island  under the ensigns of Julius Caesar  the greatest commander that ever led an army  When I consider this great man  who had already been the conqueror of Gaul  when I reflect on his courage  his conduct  and perseverance  when I take into my view the troops he headed  inured to discipline  and fighting in a manner with which barbarous nations were entirely unacquainted  when I consider these circumstances  and compare them with those of the Britons in the same period  I feel a more than usual share of surprize at the bravery and conduct with which these poor barbarians opposed him   It was an established maxim  in the politics of Rome  to deem all auxiliaries as principals  and to allow none to assist the enemies of the state with impunity  This was the pretence Caesar laid hold of to justify his invasion of England  which was not only looked upon as an ally  but likewise as an asylum to
