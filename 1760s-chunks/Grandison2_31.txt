with her  In short  I was a perfect Abigail to her in the affair  And  let me tell you  two sisters  agreed to manage a love affair  have advantages over even a Lady and her woman   Lady L  Mad creature   Miss Gr  All this I did for her without fee or reward  only from the dear delight of promoting the good work  and upon the christian principle of Do as you would be done by —Is not all this true  Lady L   Deny it if you can   Lady L  And have you done  Charlotte  Ah  my dear Miss Byron  you ll never do any thing with this girl  except you hear all she has to say  And if you have a secret   tis better to let her know it at first  Charlotte is a generous girl  after all  But sometimes  as now  a very impertinent one—  What could these ladies mean by this  I wonder  If they suspect me to love somebody  surely this is not the way  that two such Ladies  in generosity  should take  when they think I have no engagement  and   77 know that the doubt must lie on their brother s side  whom  with all their roundabouts  as they call them  they cannot fathom   I would give any thing  methinks  to know if Sir Charles was ever in love   Just then a rapping at the door made us suppose it was the Countess  It was  After compliments to Mrs  Reeves and me  she embraced Lady L  very affectionately  and Miss Grandison kindly  asking the first after Lord L  s health  and the other after her Brother  He is the man of all men  Miss Grandison  said she  that I want to see  We shall be in town soon  for a month or two  and then you must make me known to one  whom every body calls the best of men  As here  said she  coming up again to me  I have longed to be acquainted with one of the best of women   Lady L  Miss Byron is  indeed  an excellent young woman  We do ourselves the honour of calling her sister   Lady D  What an encouragement is that to be good  Even in this age  bad as it is  true merit will never want admirers  And let me say  that where beauty and goodness meet  as here  they adorn each other   Agreeable Lady D   thought I  My heart will not suggest a thought in favour of your son  but I shall easily be in love with you  The heart hardly deserves praise  my Lucy  that is not fond of it from the worthy   Her Ladyship took Lady L  aside  and said something to her  Lady L  answered with a No  as I suppose  To which Lady D  replied  I am glad of that  adding  I am not afraid of saying any thing to a person of Lady L  s known prudence   Ah  my Lucy  She asked Lady L  I dare say  whether the acknowleged sisterhood extended to the brother  as a brother  or as—something else—And    78 by her chearful and condescending court to me afterwards  and to Mrs  Reeves  was satisfied by Lady L  s answer  I make no doubt  that there is room for Lord D  s address  for any thing on Sir Charles s part   I will not be mean  Lucy  Greatly as I admire somebody  these excellent sisters shall not find me entangled in an hopeless passion   Her Ladyship took my hand  and led me to the window  I was brought to town  said she  on an extraordinary occasion  two days ago  and must set out on my return in the morning  I thought I would not miss the opportunity of paying my compliments to a young Lady  of whom I had heard every body speak with great commendation  I make no doubt but your good aunt Selby has—There she stopt   My aunt has sent me up two of your Ladyship s letters  and copies of her answers   I am pleased with your frankness  my dear  It was that part of your character that engaged me  Young women  in these cases  are generally either so affected  so starched  as if they thought there were something shameful in a treaty of this kind  or they are so aukward  that I have not patience with them  You have all the modesty—Indeed  my dear  your goodness of heart shines out in every feature of your face   Your Ladyship does me high honour   I am pleased even with that acknowlegement  The discretion of a person is often most seen in minutenesses  Another would have made disqualifying speeches—But compliments made to the heart by one who is not accustomed to flatter  such compliments  I mean  as it would be culpable for a person not to be able to verify  should not be disclaimed  To say truth  my dear  I did not intend to mention one word of the matter to you
