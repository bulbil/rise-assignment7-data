Country  for it is composed of an infinite Number of green Hills  lying so close to each other  that it resembles a Codlin Pye in a Bowl dish  So that the Nurse s Story of Giants  of old  stepping from one Hill to another  round the Country  would not appear an improbable Tale here  It is much the same Way at Hermitage too  and  in general  thro  all those Parts of this Country  I have yet seen   I hope you are reading Brown upon the Characteristics  and writing Notes upon it  I am sure you are  because I desired it  I should be glad to have your Opinion upon the Definition of Virtue  given in the last Lines of the third Section of the second Essay  upon the moral Obligations of Man to Virtue  I give you fair Play  by telling you that I think this Definition false and imperfect  and only ask you  how it is so  Read the first  second  and third Sections carefully  before you give your Opinion  not that you will discover the Error from them  but they will help you to judge the better   This is a severe Trial of my dear Pupil  for  I own  when first I read the Book  I was fully satisfied with the Definition  And  to give you some Help in this Matter  I agree that he has shewn the Imperfection of the other Page  311 three Definitions of Virtue  but yet I say  he has given a more imperfect and dangerous one himself   Adieu   my Life   Henry   LETTER CCCIX   IN the disagreeable and embarrassed Situation I am at present  I know nothing could tempt me to write  but the Fear of your thinking I poorly declined the Task you have assigned me  without being ingenuous enough to confess myself unequal to it  I had gone through the whole Essay on the Obligations of Man to Virtue  before I received your Letter  and had remarked the Definition  you mention  to be as imperfect as any of those  he terms so  For which Reason  I had contented myself with thinking that Virtue is not to be defined  and had taken up so much of Dr  Clarke s Opinion  as to believe  that though  like the Certainty of an Almighty Being  it cannot be reduced to Terms  or fully proved and explained by Words  yet is it self evident to every rational Creature  Brown says  Virtue consists   in the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good  and the voluntary Production of the greatest Happiness▪  If  by the Public  he means all Page  312 human Kind  he might have explained it by universal Benevolence  which is so far from excluding the natural or moral Ties  that it certainly strengthens them   Friends  Parents  Neighbours first it will embrace   It s Country next  — and next all human Race   But  if he confines his Idea of the Public to a particular Nation or People  he doubtless makes Virtue of a variable and indeterminate Nature  and  at once  destroys his own System  and it s Existence  For  tho  the Love of our Country is certainly a very noble and proper Principle  yet  as the Interests of every Nation and People vary  what may be virtuous with regard to the Advantages of one  may be highly criminal by becoming prejudicial to another  This therefore cannot be the true Criterion of Virtue  It s Effects must be uniform  independent of Time or Place  as it is itself the same in the Vale of Santone  or the Palace of Versailles     I am still more displeased at the latter Part of his Definition    the voluntary Production of the greatest Happiness   As this may be understood  poorly confining Virtue to the particular Stations of Affluence or Power  I cannot think this was the Author s Meaning  yet  as it may be wrested to this Point  I think it is dangerously expressed  for it may tend to discourage Page  313 the Exercise of Virtue in those  who have it not in their Power to do great or generous Actions     I have now given my dear Preceptor the highest Proof of my Obedience to his Commands  and  as we are told in Scripture  that  Obedience is better than Sacrifice   I hope he will accept the Will for the Deed  Believe me  my dearest Life  I have never been so much hurt at the Consciousness of my own Weakness  as at this Moment  I know I have exposed it  but I know I have an indulgent Master  who will forgive and instruct me  From the first of our Correspondence  I have ever declined writing  tho  I was vain enough of my Capacity in that Way before  but the Perfection of your Letters has shewn me my Insufficiency in such a glaring Light  that I never sit down to answer a Letter of your s  without blushing  You say  I am now   at an Age  and in a State of Life  to admit Improvement   My Age is doubtless on your Side  but my Situation much
