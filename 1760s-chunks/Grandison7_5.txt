 two  three blessings  and  less generously in the purport  tho  not in the intent  judging from her own present happiness  that there is still something worth wishing for to be met with in this world  praying to God to preserve the over ripened fruit still on the withered tree  In which we all joined  But O how much less generously  as I hinted  because it was altogether for our own sakes —But I know not whose pen I must have borrowed  to have done justice to Sir Charles Grandison s behaviour on this occasion   Excuse this serious conclusion  my dear Lady G  My cousin shall not see it  May she know nothing but felicity  In hers is bound up that of Sir Charles Grandison  and in his that of hundreds  I long  tho  we parted so lately  to throw myself at your feet  and to assure you  that whatever defects there are in my pen  there are none in the Love borne you  by  Your Ladyship s Most sincere admirer  and humble Servant  LUCY SELBY     12  LETTER IV  Lady GRANDISON  To Mrs  SHIRLEY    Thursday  December 7   LUCY  my ever honoured grandmamma  has given you the particulars of the rapturous reception I met with on Saturday  from my dear Lady L  on the visit we made her in her chamber  She  as well as her Lord  welcomed and congratulated us  and herself  with such a grace —They are a charming pair —We all rejoiced with her  on the addition she had made to two families so worthy   Mrs  Eleanor Grandison received us also in raptures   How did the tenderly kind notice which Sir Charles took of the lovely little infant  It is a fine child   delight the happy mother  and every body   Lord and Lady G  met us at Lady L s  Emily  and the Earl of G  and Lady Gertrude  with them  How affectionately did the dear girl welcome us  after a few tears  which she endeavoured to hide  and which we passed over as tears of joy  But Lucy has given you all particulars  a   and the noble manner also  in which Sir Charles gave me possession of his house  on our first arrival  Every body was charmed with it  It cost my aunt some tears   The Christening was delayed till Monday  because Sir Charles was desirous it should be performed at church  He had some few difficulties to get over  before he carried his point  and this was the substance of his reasonings on the subject  People of fashion  he said  should consider themselves as examples to the lower orders of people  They should shew a conformity to the laws of their country  both ecclesiastical and civil  where they can do it with a good conscience  In the present case  Baptism  said   13 he  is one of our two sacraments  and shall it not be performed  when it can  as the church directs  the child in full health   I will give you  my dear grandmamma  journalwise  I think  an account of our proceedings  still referring myself to my Lucy for such particulars as now I shall not have time to give  For you know  my dear grandmamma  that my time is not now my own  as it used to be  tho  I shall think myself very ungrateful  and undutiful too  if I permit my new duties so wholly to engross me  as to furnish an excuse for the neglect of those which from my very birth I owe to you   I think Lucy has not mentioned to you the lively conversations that passed in the evening  after the christening  between Sir Charles and Lady G  she choosing to single out her brother  as she had threatned  unknown to him  to do  in order to try once more her strength with him  in vivacity and raillery  She delighted every body with her wit  For it was not so rapid and so unguarded as sometimes it is  He condescended  was Lucy s just observation  to return wit for her wit  in order to follow her lead  as he saw the company was delighted with their conversation  and was exceedingly brilliant  She complimented herself on the merit of having drawn him out  tho  to her own disadvantage  Finding herself overmatched  she shifted her attacks  and made one upon me  but with so much decorum and complaisance  as shewed she intended to do me honour  rather than herself   Tuesday evening   Sir Charles is just returned from visiting Sir Harry Beauchamp  The poor man numbers his hours  and owned  that the three the best of men gave him  as by his own watch  tho  Sir Charles intended to be back in one  were more happy ones than he had promised himself in this life  O madam  How easy sits my Sir Charles s piety upon   14 him  He can pity a dying friend  without saddening his own heart  for he lives the life of duty as he goes along  and fears not the inevitable lot   Wednesday
