the lid —The gentleman left many other things of value  which my friend had converted into cash before I met with him  so that over and above these particulars  our stock in ready money amounted to something more than two hundred pounds   Thus equipt  I put on the gentleman of figure  and attended by my honest friend  who was contented with the station of my valet  I visited the Louvre  examined the gallery of Luxemburgh  and appeared at Versailles  where I had the honour of seeing his Most Christian Majesty eat a considerable quantity of olives —During the month I spent at Paris  I went several times to court  the Italian opera  and play house  danced at a masquerade  and in short saw every thing remarkable in and about that capital —After which we set out for England by the way of Flanders  passed through Brussels  Ghent  and Bruges  and took shipping at Ostend  from whence in fourteen hours we arrived at Deal  hired a post chaise  and in twelve hours more got safe to London  having disposed of our heavy baggage in the waggon     80  CHAP  XLV    I enquire about my uncle  and understand he is gone to sea—take lodgings at Charingcross—go to the play  where I meet with an adventure—I go to an ordinary  the guests described—become acquainted with Medlar and doctor Wagtail   AS soon as we alighted at the Inn  I dispatched Strap to enquire about my uncle  at the Samson and Lion in Wapping  and he returned in a little time  with an account of Mr  Bowling s having gone to sea  mate of a merchant ship  after a long and unsuccessful application and attendance at the admiralty  where  it seems  the interest he depended upon  was not sufficient to reinstate him  or recover the pay that was due to him when he quitted the Thunder   Next day I hired very handsome lodgings not far from Charing cross  and in the evening  dressed myself in a plain suit of the true Paris cut  and appeared in a front box at the play  where I saw a good deal of company  and had vanity enough to make me believe  that I was observed with an uncommon degree of attention and applause  This silly conceit intoxicated me so much  that I was guilty of a thousand ridiculous coquetries  and I dare say  how favourable soever the thoughts of the company might be at my first appearance  they were soon changed by my   81 absurd behaviour  into pity or contempt —I got up and sat down  covered and uncovered my head twenty times between the acts  pulled out my watch  clapped it to my ear  wound it up  set it  gave it the hearing again —displayed my snuff box  affected to take snuff  that I might have an opportunity of shewing my brilliant  and wiped my nose with a perfumed handkerchief —then dangled my cane  and adjusted my swordknot  and acted many more fooleries of the same kind  in hopes of obtaining the character of a pretty fellow  in the acquiring of which  I found two considerable obstructions in my disposition  namely  a natural reserve  and jealous sensibility —Fain would I have entered into conversation with the people around me  but was restrained by the fear of being censured for my assurance  as well as by reflecting that I was more entitled to a compliment of this kind from them than they to such condescension from a stranger like me —How often did I redden at the frequent whispers and loud laughter of my fellow beaus  which I imagined were excited by me  and how often did I envy the happy indifference of those choice spirits who beheld the distress of the scene  without discovering the least symptom of approbation or concern  My attention was engaged in spite of myself  and I could not help weeping with the heroine of the stage  though I practised a great many shifts to conceal this impolite piece of weakness —When the play was ended  I sat waiting for an opportunity of handing some lady to her coach  but every one was attended by such a number of officious gallants  that for a long time I was baulked in my expectation —At length  however  I perceived a very handsome creature    82 genteelly dressed  sitting by herself in a box  at some distance from me  upon which I went up to her  and offered my service —She seemed to to be in some confusion  thanked me for my complaisance  and with a tender look declined giving me the trouble  looking at her watch  and testifying her surprize at the negligence of her footman  whom she had ordered to have a chair ready for her at that hour —I repeated my intreaty with all the eloquence and compliment I was master of  and in the event  she was prevailed upon to accept of a proposal I made  to send my servant for a chair or coach  Accordingly  Strap was detached for that purpose  and returned without success  there being none to be found  by this time the play house was quite empty  and we were obliged to retire  As I led her through the passage  I observed five or six young fellows of fashion  standing in a
