it is I  alas  who am the Exile —I hope to hear  by To morrow s Post  that you have quite got the better of your Cold  I shall always receive the utmost Pleasure from your Letters  but as you may easily perceive I cannot write  therefore hope you will excuse me  You would pity me  if you knew how I am plagued with Conversation —Adieu  my dear Harry  I am  as usual  your sincerely affectionate  Friend and Servant     239  LETTER CXXV   My dear FANNY   I AM heartily concerned at the bad Account you give me of your Health  and must intreat you will act by me in that Affair as I did by you  for when I found you were fondly alarmed at my Disorder  I used all the Methods I could think of  to get myself well against the next Post  that I might ingenuously give you an Account of my Recovery  which I partly feigned in my last Letter  to make you easy—but I shall make no Oblations to Hygea for the Cure  if she has neglected your Health to take Care of mine   There is really something unaccountable in the Turn of Mind  you seem to have been in  for some Time past  You say  you fear we shall some Time or other part  therefore desire to do it now    so run into the Danger  to avoid the Apprehension   Such Caprice as this would make us banish Friends  Children  and every Blessing of Life  from our Enjoyment  because  perhaps  one Day or other we may be deprived of them  What Reason in the World have you to apprehend any Separation in our Loves  I declare  upon my Honour  that I am not the least sensible of any Decay in my Regard  Affection  Assiduity  Love  or Friendship for you  nor am I conscious of any Engagement  Scheme  Policy  or Ambition  which should make it honourable  or honest  even to wish my Attachment   240 less to you  Surely the fond Expostulation I make with you  at present  ought to convince you of the Sincerity and Ingenuousness of this Declaration  for  if my Fickleness or Caprice had given me other Sentiments toward you  what a vast and lucky Relief would your present and late Behaviour be to me  How readily should I then take you at your Word  happy to have my Inconstancy accounted for to the World  and justified even by the Person I was willing to forsake  Indeed  my dearest Fanny  if ever you mention this Subject to me again  there will be no Way left of accounting for it  but supposing that you find something in your own Heart  which may make you apprehend that my Constancy  Love  and Attachment to you  may some Time or other be a Reproach to you     There is another Passage in your last Letter  which I absolutely interdict you for the future  How can you be so disingenuous  as to say  you cannot write  For no body  who writes well  can be ignorant of it  nor can any body ever write well  who does not think they do  I declare  I never met with Writings in any Language more sensible  more delicate  or more correct  than most of your Letters  and  if I do not  upon every Occasion  express my just Sense of them  it is because I really think their Merit is above my Praise  and whenever I do mention them  in the Manner I do now  it is more from the Vanity of shewing you my own Taste  than to pay any Compliment to your s     241We have had the most disingenous Weather I ever remember  since I came down to the Country  It promises and threatens by Turns  but fulfils neither  and keeps one in a State of Uncertainty  both with Regard to Business or Pleasure  which is very perplexing  I cannot undertake any Business at home  nor can I amuse myself with going abroad  My Corn is growing too rank  and my Sheep are dying of the red Water  Write me a Lapland Ode  my dear Muse  to invite over some Frost and Snow immediately  or we poor Farmers will be undone  I forget whether I told you before  that I have set the last Acre of —  since I came down  which has made my Mind very easy  and therefore I am pleased at mentioning it to you   I wish my dearest Fanny Joy of every Advantage of mine in Life —Farewel  my charming Girl  and believe  nay be certain  that I am ever your s   Henry   LETTER CXXVI   THE kind Concern my dear Harry expressed in his last Letter for my Health  would  I think render me unpardonable  if I did not feel as much Pleasure in acquainting him with my Recovery  as  I flatter myself  he will receive from the Account  I am indeed much better  Thanks to my Regard for you  for  were I not   242 persuaded that my Life is of Moment to your Happiness  how earnestly should I wish to abandon it  That
