moment bathed with her tears  Her sorrow sat heavily on my feelings  My spirits were greatly disturbed  and  as if it were a forewarning of the blow impending over my head  a death like shudder crept through my frame  and my faculties were all benumbed  Madam  said I  in accents half choked with apprehension  may I ask of what dire events that letter brings the tidings  Take it  sir  answered Seraphina most dolefully  while she held out the letter to me  Read for yourself what my father has written  Alas  you are but too deeply concerned in the contents   At these words  which made my blood run cold  I took the letter with a trembling hand  and found in it the following intelligence   Your brother  Don Gaspard  fought yesterday at the Prado  He received a small sword wound  of which he died this day  and declared  before he breathed his last  that his antagonist was the son of Baron Steinbach  an officer of the German guard  As misfortunes never come alone  the murderer has eluded my vengeance by flight  but wherever he may have concealed himself  no pains shall be spared to hunt him out  I am going to write to the magistrates all round the country  who will not fail to take him into custody  if he passes through any one of the towns in their jurisdiction  and by the notices I am going to circulate  I hope to cut off his retreat in the country or at the sea ports     THE COUNT DE POLAN    Conceive into what a ferment this letter threw all my thoughts  I remained for some moments motionless and without the power of speech  In the midst of my confusion  I too plainly saw the destructive bearing of Don Gaspard s death on the passion I had imbibed  My despair was unbounded at the thought  I threw myself at Seraphina s feet  and offering her my naked sword  Madam  said I  spare the Count de Polan the necessity of seeking further for a man who might possibly withdraw himself from his resentment  Be yourself the avenger of your brother  offer up his murderer as the victim of your own hand  now  strike the blow  Let this very weapon which terminated his life  cut short the sad remnant of his adversary s days  Sir  answered Seraphina  a little softened by my behaviour  I loved Don Gaspard  so that though you killed him in fair and manly hostility  and though he brought his death upon himself  you may rest assured that I take up my father s quarrel  Yes  Don Alphonso  I am your decided enemy  and will do against you all that the ties of blood and friendship require at my hands  But I will not take advantage of your evil star  in vain has it delivered you into my grasp  if honour arms me against you  the same sentiment forbids to pursue a cowardly revenge  The rights of hospitality must be inviolable  and I will not repay such service as you have rendered me with the treachery of an assassin  Fly  make your escape  if you can  from our pursuit and from the rigour of the laws  and save your forfeit life from the dangers that beset it   What  then  madam  returned I  when vengeance is in your own hands  do you turn it over to the laws  which may  perhaps  be too slow for your impatience  Nay  rather stab a wretch who is not worthy of your forbearance  No  madam  maintain not so noble and so generous a proceeding with one like me  Do you know who I am  All Madrid takes me for Baron Steinbach s son    yet am I nothing better than a foundling  whom he brought up from charity  I know not even who were guilty of my existence  No matter  interrupted Seraphina  with precipitation  as if my last words had given her new uneasiness  though you were the lowest of mankind I would do what honour bids  Well  madam  said I  since a brother s death is insufficient to excite your thirst after my blood  I will exasperate your hatred still further by a new offence  of which I trust you will never pardon the boldness  I dote on you  I could not behold your charms without being dazzled by them  and  in spite of the cloud in which my destiny was enveloped  I had cherished the hope of being united to you  I was so infatuated by my passion  or rather by my pride  as to flatter myself that heaven  which perhaps conceals from me my birth in mercy  might discover it one day  and enable me without a blush to acquaint you with my real name  After this injurious avowal  can you hesitate a moment about punishing me   This rash declaration  replied the lady  would doubtless prove offensive at any other season  but I forgive it in consideration of the trouble which bewilders you  Besides  my own condition so engrosses me  as to render me deaf to any strange ideas that may escape you  Once more  Don Alphonso  added she  shedding tears  begone far
