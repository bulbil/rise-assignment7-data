and   when he had read it  I said  You see how things stand  I am resolved to   return to our master  and as he is not so well as were to be wished  the   more haste you make the better  and don t mind my fatigue  but consider   only yourselves  and the horses  Robin  who guessed the matter  by his   conversation with Thomas   as I suppose   said  God bless you  madam    and reward you  as your obligingness to my good master deserves  and may   we all live to see you triumph over Mrs  Jewkes       I wondered to hear him say so  for I was always careful of exposing my   master  or even that naughty woman  before the common servants  But yet   I question whether Robin would have said this  if he had not guessed    by Thomas s message  and my resolving to return  that I might stand well   with his master  So selfish are the hearts of poor mortals  that they   are ready to change as favour goes       So they were not long getting ready  and I am just setting out  back   again  and I hope I shall have no reason to repent it       Robin put on very vehemently  and when we came to the little town  where   we lay on Sunday night  he gave his horses a bait  and said  he would   push for his master s that night  as it would be moon light  if I should   not be too much fatigued because there was no place between that and   the town adjacent to his master s  fit to put up at  for the night  But   Monsieur Colbrand s horse beginning to give way  made a doubt between   them  wherefore I said   hating to be on the road   if it could be done    I should bear it well enough  I hoped  and that Monsieur Colbrand   might leave his horse  when it failed  at some house  and come into the   chariot  This pleased them both  and  about twelve miles short  he left   the horse  and took off his spurs and holsters  etc  and  with abundance   of ceremonial excuses  came into the chariot  and I sat the easier   for it  for my bones ached sadly with the jolting  and so many miles   travelling in so few hours  as I have done  from Sunday night  five   o clock  But  for all this  it was eleven o clock at night  when we came   to the village adjacent to my master s  and the horses began to be very   much tired  and Robin too  but I said  It would be pity to put up only   three miles short of the house       So about one we reached the gate  but every body was a bed  But one of   the helpers got the keys from Mrs  Jewkes  and opened the gates  and the   horses could hardly crawl into the stable  And I  when I went to get out   of the chariot  fell down  and thought I had lost the use of my limbs       Mrs  Jewkes came down with her clothes huddled on  and lifted up her   hands and eyes  at my return  but shewed more care of the horses than   of me  By that time the two maids came  and I made shift to creep in  as   well as I could       It seems my poor master was very ill indeed  and had been upon the bed   most part of the day  and Abraham  who succeeded John  sat up with him    And he was got into a fine sleep  and heard not the coach come in  nor   the noise we made  for his chamber lies towards the garden   on the   other side of the house  Mrs  Jewkes said  He had a feverish complaint    and had been blooded  and  very prudently  ordered Abraham  when he   awaked  not to tell him I was come  for fear of surprising him  and   augmenting his fever  nor  indeed  to say any thing of me  till she   herself broke it to him in the morning  as she should see how he was       So I went to bed with Mrs  Jewkes  after she had caused me to drink   almost half a pint of burnt wine  made very rich and cordial  with   spices  which I found very refreshing  and set me into a sleep I little   hoped for          Tuesday morning       Getting up pretty early  I
