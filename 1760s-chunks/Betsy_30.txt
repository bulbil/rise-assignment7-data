they met the ladies  and the manner in which they went into   the house  protesting  that neither himself  nor  according to the best   of his belief  the gentleman commoner  had at that time any designs in   view but mere complaisance and gallantry        How then  came you to separate yourselves   cried Mr  Francis  with   some earnestness   That also was accidental   replied the other   your   sister s companion telling me she liked the garden better than the room   we were in  I thought I could do no less than attend her thither  I   confess I did not consult whether those we left behind had any   inclination to follow us or not        The air with which he spoke of this part of the adventure  had something   in it which did not give Mr  Francis the most favourable idea of Miss   Flora s conduct  but that not much concerning him  and finding nothing   wherewith he could justly reproach the student  he soon after quitted   him  and went to the gentleman commoner  having been told he might find   him in his rooms       Had any one been witness of the manner in which these two accosted each   other  they would not have been at a loss to guess what would ensue  the   brother of Miss Betsy came with a mind full of resentment  and   determined to repair the affront which had been offered to him in the   person of a sister  who was very dear to him  by calling the other to a   severe account for what he had done  The gentleman commoner was   descended of a noble family  and had an estate to support the dignity of   his birth  and was too much puffed up and insolent on the smiles of   fortune  he was conscious the affront he had given demanded   satisfaction  and neither doubted of the errand on which Mr  Francis was   come  nor wondered at it  but could not bring himself to acknowledge he   had done amiss  nor think of making any excuse for his behaviour  Guilt    in a proud heart  is generally accompanied with a sullen obstinacy  for    as the poet says             Forgiveness to the injur d does belong        But they ne er pardon who have done the wrong        He therefore received the interrogatories Mr  Francis was beginning to   make  with an air rather indignant than complying  which the other not   being able to brook  such hot words arose between them as could not but   occasion a challenge  which was given by Mr  Francis  The appointment to   meet was the next morning at six o clock  and the place  that very field   in which the gentleman commoner and his friend had so unluckily happened   to meet the ladies in their morning s walk       Neither of them wanted courage  nor communicated their rendezvous to any   one person  in hopes of being disappointed without danger of their   honour  but each being equally animated with the ambition of humbling   the arrogance of the other  both were secret as to the business  and no   less punctual as to the time       The agreement between them was sword and pistol  which both having   provided themselves with  they no sooner came within a proper distance    than they discharged at each other the first course of this fatal   entertainment  that of the gentleman commoner was so well aimed  that   one of the bullets lodged in the shoulder  and the other grazing on the   fleshy part of the arm of his antagonist  put him into a great deal of   pain  But these wounds rather increased than diminished the fury he was   possessed of  he instantly drew his sword  and ran at the other with so   well directed a force  that his weapon entered three inches deep into   the right side of the gentleman commoner  Both of them received several   other hurts  yet still both continued the fight with equal vehemence    nor would either of them  in all probability  have receded  till one or   other of them had lain dead upon the place  if some countrymen  who by   accident were passing that way  had not  with their clubs  beat down the   swords of both  and carried the owners of them  by mere force  into the   village they were going to  where they were no sooner entered  than   several people who knew them  seeing them pass by in this manner    covered all over with their own blood  and guarded by a pack of   rusticks  ran out to enquire what had happened  which being informed of
