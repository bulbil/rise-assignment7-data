with a mighty sound        She cries  Down with her chastity          Down to the very ground       Sure  sir  said I  this might have been spared  But the ladies and Mr    Williams said  No  by no means  And I see the poor wicked woman has no   favourers among them       Now  said my master  read the Psalmist s heavy curses  and Mr  Williams   read                       IX           Ev n so shalt thou  O Babylon          At length to dust be brought        And happy shall that man be call d          That our revenge hath wrought                        X           Yea  blessed shall the man be call d         That takes thy little ones        And dasheth them in pieces small         Against the very stones       Thus he said  very kindly  has my Pamela turned these lines                       IX           Ev n so shalt thou  O wicked one          At length to shame be brought        And happy shall all those be call d          That my deliv rance wrought                        X           Yea  blessed shall the man be call d         That shames thee of thy evil        And saves me from thy vile attempts          And thee  too  from the d   l          I fancy this blessed man  said my master smiling  was  at that time    hoped to be you  Mr  Williams  if the truth was known  Sir  said he    whoever it was intended for then  it can be nobody but your good self   now       I could hardly hold up my head for the praises the kind ladies were   pleased to heap upon me  I am sure  by this  they are very partial in   my favour  all because my master is so good to me  and loves to hear me   praised  for I see no such excellence in these lines  as they would make   me believe  besides what is borrowed from the Psalmist       We all  as before  and the cook maid too  attended the prayers of the   church in the afternoon  and my dear father concluded with the following   stanzas of the cxlvth psalm  suitably magnifying the holy name of God   for all mercies  but did not observe  altogether  the method in which   they stand  which was the less necessary  he thought  as he gave out the   lines              The Lord is just in all his ways          His works are holy all        And he is near all those that do         In truth upon him call           He the desires of all them         That fear him  will fulfil        And he will hear them when they cry          And save them all he will           The eyes of all do wait on thee          Thou dost them all relieve        And thou to each sufficient food          In season due  dost give           Thou openest thy plenteous hand          And bounteously dost fill       All things whatever  that do live          With gifts of thy good will           My thankful mouth shall gladly speak         The praises of the Lord        All flesh  to praise
