reduced to his primitive complexion and indigence   After some time  being freed from gaol  he was now grown wiser  and instead of making himself a wonder  was resolved only to make wonders  He learned the art of pasting up mummies  was never at a loss for an artificial lusus naturae  nay  it has been reported  that he has sold seven petrified lobsters of his own manufacture to a noted collector of rarities  but this the learned Cracovius Putridus has undertaken to refute in a very elaborate dissertation   His last wonder was nothing more than an halter  yet by this halter he gained more than by all his former exhibitions  The people  it seems  had got it in their heads  that a certain noble criminal was to be hanged with a silken rope  Now there was nothing they so much desired to see as this very rope  and he was resolved to gratify their curiosity  he therefore got one made  not only of silk  but to render it the more striking  several threads of gold were intermixed  The people paid their money only to see silk  but were highly satisfied when they found it was mixed with gold into the bargain  It is scarce necessary   193 to mention  that the projector sold his silken rope for almost what it had cost him  as soon as the criminal was known to be hanged in hempen materials   By their fondness of sights  one would be apt to imagine  that instead of desiring to see things as they should be  they are rather solicitous of seeing them as they ought not to be  A cat with four legs is disregarded  though never so useful  but if it has but two  and is consequently incapable of catching mice  it is reckoned inestimable  and every man of taste is ready to raise the auction  A man  though in his person faultless as an aerial genius  might starve  but if stuck over with hideous warts like a porcupine  his fortune is made for ever  and he may propagate the breed with impunity and applause   A good woman in my neighbourhood  who was bred an habit maker  though she handled her needle tolerably well  could scarcely get employment  But being obliged by an accident to have both her hands cut off from the elbows  what would in another country have been her ruin  made her fortune here  she now was thought more fit for her trade than before  business flowed in apace  and all people paid for seeing the mantua maker who wrought without hands   A gentleman shewing me his collection of pictures  stopped at one with peculiar admiration  there  cries he  is an inestimable piece  I gazed at the picture for some time  but could see none of those graces with which he seemed enraptured  it appeared to me the most paltry piece of the   194 whole collection  I therefore demanded where those beauties lay  of which I was yet insensible  Sir  cries he  the merit does not consist in the piece  but in the manner in which it was done  The painter drew the whole with his foot  and held the pencil between his toes  I bought it at a very great price  for peculiar merit should ever be rewarded   But these people are not more fond of wonders than liberal in rewarding those who shew them  From the wonderful dog of knowledge at present under the patronage of the nobility  down to the man with the box  who professes to shew the most imitation of nature that was ever seen  they all live in luxury  A singing woman shall collect subscriptions in her own coach and six  a fellow shall make a fortune by tossing a straw from his toe to his nose  one in particlar has found that eating fire was the most ready way to live  and another who gingles several bells fixed to his cap  is the only man that I know of who has received emolument from the labours of his head   A young author  a man of good nature and learning  was complaining to me some nights ago of this misplaced generosity of the times  Here  lays he  have I spent part of my youth in attempting to instruct and amuse my fellow creatures  and all my reward has been solitude  poverty  and reproach  while a fellow  possessed of even the smallest share of fidling merit  or who has perhaps learned to whistle double  is rewarded  applauded  and caressed  Prythee  young man  says I to him  are you ignorant  that in so large a city as this    195 it is better to be an amusing than an useful member of society  Can you leap up  and touch your feet four times before you come to the ground  No  Sir  Can you pimp for a man of quality  No  Sir  Can you stand upon two horses at full speed  No  Sir  Can you swallow a pen knife  I can do none of these tricks  Why then  cried I  there is no other prudent means of subsistence left but to apprize the town that you speedily intend to eat up your own nose  by subscription   I have frequently regretted that none
