hazard of doing it when it would not half so well become them       A propos to playing the fool  I am strongly inclined to believe I shall marry       Fitzgerald is so astonishingly pressing Besides  some how or other  I don t feel happy without him  the creature has something of a magnetic virtue  I find myself generally  without knowing it  on the same side the room with him  and often in the next chair  and lay a thousand little schemes to be of the same party at cards       I write pretty sentiments in my pocket book  and carve his name on trees when nobody sees me  did you think it possible I could be such an ideot       I am as absurd as even the gentle love sick Emily       I am thinking  my dear  how happy it is  since most human beings differ so extremely one from another  that heaven has given us the same variety in our tastes       Your brother is a divine fellow  and yet there is a sauciness about Fitzgerald which pleases me better  as he has told me a thousand times  he thinks me infinitely more agreable than Emily       Adieu  I am going to Quebec   Yours    A  FERMOR     LETTER CXL   140   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   May 20  Evening   IO triumphe  A ship from England  You can have no idea of the universal transport at the sight  the whole town was on the beach  eagerly gazing at the charming stranger  who danced gaily on the waves  as if conscious of the pleasure she inspired       If our joy is so great  who preserve a correspondence with Europe  through our other colonies  during the winter  what must that of the French have been  who were absolutely shut up six months from the rest of the world       I can scarce conceive a higher delight than they must have felt at being thus restored to a communication with mankind       The letters are not delivered  our servant stays for them at the post office  we expect him every moment  if I have not volumes from you  I shall be very angry       He comes  Adieu  I have not patience to wait their being brought up stairs   Yours   A  FERMOR       They are here  six letters from you  I shall give three of them to Emily to read  whilst I read the rest  you are very good  Lucy  and I will never call you lazy again     LETTER CXLI   141   To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Pall Mall  April 8   WHILST I was sealing my letter  I received yours of the 1st of February       I am excessively alarmed  my dear  at the account it gives me of Miss Montague s having broke with her lover  and of my brother s extreme affection for her       I did not dare to let my mother see that letter  as I am convinced the very idea of a marriage which must for ever separate her from a son she loves to idolatry  would be fatal to her  she is altered since his leaving England more than you can imagine  she is grown pale and thin  her vivacity has entirely left her  Even my marriage scarce seemed to give her pleasure  yet such is her delicacy  her ardor for his happiness  she will not suffer me to say this to him  lest it should constrain him  and prevent his making himself happy in his own way  I often find her in tears in her apartment  she affects a smile when she sees me  but it is a smile which cannot deceive one who knows her whole soul as I do  In short  I am convinced she will not live long unless my brother returns  She never names him without being softened to a degree not to be expressed       Amiable and lovely as you represent this charming woman  and great as the sacrifice is she has made to my brother  it seems almost cruelty to wish to break his attachment to her  yet  situated as they are  what can be the consequence of their indulging their tenderness at present  but ruin to both       At all events  however  my dear  I intreat  I conjure you  to press my brother s immediate return to England  I am convinced  my mother s life depends on seeing him       I have often been tempted to write to Miss Montague  to use her influence with him even against herself       If she loves him  she will have his true happiness at heart  she will consider what a mind like his must hereafter suffer  should his fondness for her be fatal to the best of mothers  she will urge  she will oblige him to return  and make this step the condition of preserving her tenderness       Read this letter to her  and tell her  it is to her affection for my brother  to her generosity  I trust for the life of a parent who is dearer to me
