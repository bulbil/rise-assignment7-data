 Mildmay relative to some expressions which Louisa had dropped in your sister s last interview with her  indicating the most positive determination of never seeing you more  Mrs  Mildmay is to write to her on this subject  and therefore she can but little doubt of Louisa s altering her determination  the resolution of her family in your favour was the principal point to gain  and since we could work upon their pride  there can be no doubt of influencing   61 her sensibility  A woman  Harold  can forgive every thing where she really loves  the ladies have a softness about them which turns even contempt into kindness  and gives the tenderness of their hearts a constant superiority over the goodness of their understandings  I should be sorry  however  that all coxcombs were for reducing this precept into practice  as we have already but too many fools among the fair who are desirous of stamping their weakness with the immediate image of destiny  and solicitous to call that an absolute decree of fate which arises from their own apparent want of resolution   I have been this moment at a consultation of colonel Mildmay s surgeons  and have the very great pleasure of informing you that he is entirely out of danger —You may therefore  by the next Helvoetsluys packet  make a trip   62 to Harwich  since at the utmost it can t be above twelve hours from Rotterdam to Helvoet  If you should stop at the Hague  pray call at Fitzpatrick s in the Hoogstraat  who is as modest  as sensible  and as well behaved a man as I ever saw at the head of a tavern  and who  without mentioning any body s name  will treat you with the utmost civility  if you know the man already my character will be needless  if you do not  you will find a very good house  and so far be obliged to me for this accommodation   As we have done our business at Mildmay Hall  your sister and I shall set out for London  in order to wait upon Louisa  and acquaint her with the determination of her father  Mrs  Mildmay has a letter to send by us to her daughter  which will put a finishing hand to the reconciliation  so that  Bob  you   63 may look upon the whole affair as concluded to your wish  yet it is ten to one that  now happiness is again within your reach  but what you strive to start difficulties  and endeavour to destroy all that lady Haversham and I have been labouring to bring about with such an unremitting degree of fedulity   Take care  however  dear Harold  how you act at this time  and do not idly play the prodigal with your own happiness—Youth can never excuse a bad action  though it may extenuate the indiscretion of a foolish one  and the man who is twice guilty of the same crime  is in much more danger of making himself abhorred  than in rendering others wretched or contemptible  take the hint therefore  Bob  and believe me  with the utmost cordiality   Your real Friend  C  MELMOTH     64  LETTER XVI  Mr  MELMOTH  in Continuation  to Sir ROBERT HAROLD   Dear HAROLD   IF you have not yet set out from Rotterdam  you may as well continue where you are  or go to any other part of the continent which is best adapted to your inclination  England is not a place which I would have you return to yet awhile  if you really love Miss Mildmay  and would be concerned to find her actually allied to infamy and prostitution   Your sister and I arrived in town this morning  and  unable to contain the satisfaction with which our bosoms naturally swelled at your approaching felicity    65 we immediately drove to Louisa s  with a view of dispelling her unhappiness  by acquainting her with the fortunate reconciliation effected between her and her family—But judge our astonishment  when  instead of meeting with her  Mrs  Darnel came down stairs with an air of the utmost affliction  and informed us that Miss Mildmay had eloped in a post chaise and six  with a gentleman richly dressed  the preceding evening—   Having no authority to watch her motions   said Mrs  Darnel   and imagining from her specious air of penitence  if I even had  that every attention of that nature would be utterly unnecessary  I went to hear a lecture at our parish church after tea  never once dreaming that during my absence she would think of running away from a house into which she had entered a voluntary visitor  and in which there was no likelihood of her   66 receiving the smallest disgust—You may  however  easily guess my consternation  when my maid Jenny  the moment I came home  ran up and informed me that Miss Mildmay had gone off with a gentleman in a postchaise  I naturally concluded  that  had it been any relation  I should have received some notice of her intended departure  and therefore  as she went away in so unaccountable a manner  I as naturally ascribed her flight to some preconcerted design  especially as Jenny informed me  that a gentleman in brown and gold had for two or three nights been seen to hang about
