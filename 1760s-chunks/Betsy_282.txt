 your feet  not altogether without hope  in spite of the        circumstances you are in  of being  in some measure  acceptable to        you  at least it shall be so  if the most ardent and perfect        passion that ever was  joined with the power of rendering you all        manner of services  can give it merit in your eyes            A very short time  I flatter myself  will explain to you what at        present may seem a mystery  benignant Love will furnish the most        faithful of his votaries with the means of declaring himself at        full  and the flame with which he is inspired  instruct him also to        give you such testimonies of his everlasting attachment  as the        good understanding you are mistress of you will not permit you to        reject  till when  I only beseech you to think  with some share of        tenderness  on your concealed adorer        Utterly impossible is it to describe the situation of Mrs  Munden s   mind  after having several times read over this epistle  and well   examined the purport of it  she doubted not  one moment  but that it was   dictated by the noble lord she had seen the day before  and whose   behaviour to her had  in some degree  corresponded with the sentiments   contained in it  If her vanity was delighted with the conquest she had   made  her pride was shocked at that assurance which the daring lover   seemed to flatter himself with of gaining her  and her virtue much more   alarmed at the attempts which his rank and fortune might embolden him to   make for that end       At first she was resolved to shew the letter to her husband the moment   he came home  and acquaint him with her sentiments on the matter  that   he might take proper precautions to prevent her from being exposed to   any future attacks from this dangerous nobleman       But  on more mature deliberation  her mind changed  Mr  Munden was  at   present  in tolerable good humour with her  she was willing  if   possible  to preserve it in him  and  as she could not but think an   information of this kind would give him a great deal of uneasiness  so   she had also reason to apprehend the effects of it might  in some   measure  innocent as she was  fall upon herself       He had never yet discovered the least emotions of jealousy  and she knew   not what suspicions her having received such a letter from one person   might raise in him in relation to others   He may  possibly   said she   to herself   look upon every man that visits me as an invader of his   right  and  consequently  I shall be debarred from all conversation with   the sex        Besides   continued she   I am not certain that this letter was sent me   by the noble lord  or that he has in reality entertained any designs to   the prejudice of my virtue  there is  indeed  a strong probability of   it  even by his behaviour towards me yesterday  yet it may not be so    appearances often deceive us  and I might take that for the effect of   love which proceeded only from complaisance  but  whatever his   intentions are  it would certainly be the extremest folly and madness in   me to inflame Mr  Munden against a person on whom his interest so much   depends        It is no matter  therefore   went she still on   whether it be the   noble lord in question  or any other person who presumes to think so   meanly of me as to address me in this audacious manner  it is    doubtless  in my power to keep out of the way of receiving any farther   insults from him  and I am sufficiently capable myself of being guardian   of my own honour  without disturbing a husband s peace about it        Thus ended the debate she had with herself on this occasion  she   committed her letter to the flames  and resolved  that if ever the   author was hardy enough to discover himself  to treat him with all the   contempt due to him from affronted virtue                CHAPTER XIII       Contains what every reader of an ordinary capacity may  by
