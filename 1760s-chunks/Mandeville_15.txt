advantages one possesses one self  my Lord  whose nobility is but of the third generation  but whose ancestry loses itself in          1 74       the clouds  pays much greater respect to a long line of illustrious ancestors than to the most lofty titles  and I am sorry to say my dear Fondville s pedigree will not stand the test  he owes his fortune and rank to the iniquity of his father  who was deep in the infamous secret of the South Sea bubble       Tis however a good natured  inoffensive  lively  showy animal  and does not flatter disagreeably  He owns Belmont not absolutely shocking  and thinks Lady Julia rather tolerable  if she was so happy as to have a little of my spirit and enjouement     Adio  A  Wilmot      O Ciel  what a memory  this is not post day  You may possibly gain a line or two by this strange forgetfulness of mine            1 75       Saturday      Nothing new  but that La Signora Westbrook  who visited here yesterday  either was  or pretended to be  taken ill before her coach came  and Harry  by her own desire  attended her home in Lady Julia s post chaise  He came back with so grave an air  that I fancy she had been making absolute  plain  down right love to him  her ridiculous fondness begins to be rather perceptible to every body  really these city girls are so rapid in their amours  they won t give a man time to breathe     Once more  Adieu           1 76         To George Mordaunt  Esq   June 13th      I Have just received a letter which makes me the most unhappy of mankind   tis from a lady whose fortune is greatly above my most sanguine hopes  and whose merit and tenderness deserve that heart which I feel is not in my power to give her  The general complacency of my behaviour to the lovely sex  and my having been accidentally her partner at two or three balls  has deceived her into an opinion that she is beloved by me  and she imagines she is only returning a passion  which her superiority of fortune has prevented my declaring  How much is she to be pitied  my heart knows too well the pangs of disappointed love  not to feel most tenderly for the sufferings of another  without the additional motive to compassion of being the undesigned cause of those sufferings  the severest of          1 77       which human nature is capable  I am embarrassed to the greatest degree  not what resolution to take  that required not a moment s deliberation  but how to soften the stroke  and in what manner  without wounding her delicacy  to decline an offer  which she has not the least doubt of my accepting with all the eager transport of timid love  surprised by unexpected success      I have wrote to her  and think I shall send this answer  I enclose you a copy of it  her letter is already destroyed  her name I conceal  The honor of a lady is too sacred to be trusted  even to the faithful breath of a friend            1 78         To Miss             NO words  Madam  can express the warmth of my gratitude for your generous intentions in my favor  tho  my ideas of probity will not allow me to take advantage of them        To rob a gentleman  by whom I have been treated with the utmost hospitality  not only of his whole fortune  but of  what is infinitely more valuable  a beloved and amiable daughter  is an action so utterly inconsistent with those sentiments of honor which I have always cultivated  as even your perfections cannot tempt me to be guilty of  I must therefore  however unwillingly  absolutely decline the happiness you have had the goodness to permit me          1 79       to hope for  and beg leave to subscribe myself   Madam  with the utmost gratitude and most lively esteem  your most obliged and devoted servant  H  Mandeville      I ought perhaps to be more explicit in my refusal of her  but I cannot bring myself to shock her sensibility  by an appearance of total indifference  Surely this is sufficiently clear  and as much as can be said by a man sensible of  and grateful for  so infinite an obligation        You will smile when I own that  in the midst of my concern for this Lady  I feel a secret  and  I fear  an ungenerous  pleasure  in sacrifising her to Lady Julia s friendship  tho
