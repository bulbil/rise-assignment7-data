his former misconduct  From thence he went to Windsor  where  reflecting upon the rashness of his former proceeding  he wrote to the parliament  informing them    that he desisted from his proceedings aginst the accused members  and assuring the parliament  that upon all occasions he would be as careful of their privileges as of his life or his crown   His violence  as a fine writer remarks  had first rendered him hateful to his common s and his submission now contemptible     The commons had already stripped the King of almost all his privileges  the power of appointing governors  generals  and levying armies  still remained  They therefore proceeded to petition  that the Tower might be put into their hands  that Hull  Portsmouth  and the fleet  should be commanded by persons of their chusing  These requests were  at first  contested  and then complied with  at last the commons desired to have a militia raised  and governed by such officers and commanders as they should nominate  under a pretext of securing them from the Irish Papists  whom they affected to be in dread of  This was depriving the King of even the shadow of his former power  but they had gone too far now to recede  and feared leaving him any power  as knowing themselves the first objects on which its vengeance might be exercised  He was willing to grant the raising a militia  but insisted upon giving it commanders  the parliament desired to command it for an appointed time  but the King  at last provoked to resentment  cried  they should not command it    no not for an hour   This peremptory refusal   22 broke off all further treaty  and both sides were now to have recourse to arms     Charles retired to York  and the Queen went over to Holland  to raise money upon the crown jewels  and provide ammunition and forces  The parliament  in the mean time  were not idle  they knew their strength and popularity  and published proposals for bringing in money or plate for the defence of the kingdom  But  though each side were prepared for war  yet they took every precaution to lay the blame of the first infraction of peace on each other  The King offered proposals to the commons which he knew they would not accept  and they  in return  offered him nineteen propositions  which  if complied with  would render him entirely subservient to their commands  Their import was  that the privy council  the principal officers of state  the governors of the King s children  forts  castles  fleet  armies  should be all appointed or governed by parliament  that Papists should be punished by thei authority  that the church and liturgy should be reformed by their discretion  and that such member as had been displaced for former offences should b restored  These proposals  which  if they had bee accepted  would have moulded the government int an aristocratical form  were  happily for posterity rejected  and the King and his parliament continue to reproach each other for a civil war  of which bot were actually guilty   I am   c   LETTER IV   IN this detail of public calamities you are not 〈◊〉 expect any great strokes  either in politics 〈◊〉 war  each party was too sincere to give much a¦tention to any thing but the dictates of passion  e¦thusiasm    23 or zeal  The parliament was convinced that it drew the sword in defence of liberty  and the King was equally stedfast in believing  that he had the authority of Heaven for opposing their pretensions  They therefore took the field with little conduct  and courage alone in the troops generally decided the fortune of the day   The parliament  from its own authority  constituted Sir John Hotham  a sitting member of the house of commons  governor of Hull  In this city there was a large magazine of arms  ammunition  and provisions  The King  sensible of the importance of the place  was desirous of securing it for himself  he therefore approached the gates with three hundred horse  and demanded entrance  Hotham still preserved some appearance of respect to his sovereign  land  on his knees  refused to admit him  Disloyalty is ever timid in the beginning   Manifestoes  on one side and the other  were now dispersed through the whole kingdom  and the people were universally divided into two factions  that went by the names of Royalists and Round heads  The King ordered the Nobility to attend his person  he procured the great seal from London  and erected his standard at Nottingham  The people  in general  seemed to have lost all respect to his person and government  the laws promulgated by parliament  without the sanction of the great seal  were observed with due obedience  and the royal standard was scarce followed by any except a few militia  At length  however  with the succours furnished by his Queen  and the presents of the university of Oxford  and his Clergy  he raised an army of about fourteen thousand men  commanded by Prince Rupert  a man of courage and some experience  The parliament
