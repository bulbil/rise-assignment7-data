  one of the principal objections of Mole      God was never made man  my Harry  God cannot be debased    He could not degrade himself by any change into manhood  though   he could exalt and assume humanity into God  Neither could God   die or suffer  To this  Christ himself  who was God and man  bears   testimony  where he cries out  in the agonies of his suffering   humanity   My God  my God  why hast thou forsaken me     And again  where  crying with a loud voice  he said    Father  into   thy hands I commend my spirit   But you are leading me some    thing deeper than I choose to go for the present      From eternity  God saw that  should he produce any creatures   in his own image  to be glorious by his likeness  and happy by his   communication  he must of necessity create them intelligent and   free   and that consequently  as creatures  they must be finite   and   that  as creatures who were free  they should also be fallible      He therefore saw that all might fall  and he also foresaw that   some would fall  But his graciousness had provided two infallible   remedies for this evil of fallibility  He had provided a Saviour    and he had also provided suffering  The Saviour was to restore   them by an inward redemption  by a reinfusion and new birth of   his own nature in their essence   and suffering was to prepare and   open his way  by humbling their pride  by mortifying their lust    and thus compelling them to unfold their hearts to their own   happiness      Indeed  had no creature ever fallen  God could not have been   duly glorified to all eternity  Millions of his infinitely amiable   qualities must have lain an inscrutable secret to worlds upon   worlds  While all his creatures were happy in him  and parti    cipated of him  no distinction could be duly made between them   and their Creator  Had evil never been  goodness would have sunk   unspeakably in the sense of its value  which is now infinitely height    ened and glorified by the contrast  Free grace and free mercy on   the part of our God  and penitence and thanksgiving on the part of         328 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      humbled sinners  would have been prevented of their thousand   endearing connections  And all the amities and charities through    out the brotherhood of man   all the melting and fond relations   which the vine Christ infuses throughout his ingrafted branches    bearing blossoms and fruits of divine fragrance and flavour    must ever have remained unblessing  and as dead  from eternity to   eternity      But our God  my child  is as powerful as he is gracious and wise    to bring light out of darkness  and life out of death  and infinite and   ever enduring good out of the limited and short state of transitory   evil      To prove that no being beneath himself could stand of their own   sufficiency  God permitted his two principal creatures the most   immediate and most glorious representatives of his divine perfec    tions to fall off from their allegiance  and consequently from their   happiness  with all their progeny  The first was the angel Lucifer   who fell through pride  and the second was the man Adam who fell   through lust  These two capital sins of pride and of lust are the   genuine parents of all moral and natural evil  of all the guilt or   misery that ever did  or ever can  rise throughout duration   and our   heavenly Father  in his love  hath appointed intense suffering to   abate and abase the one  to mortify and slay the other  that trans    gressors may finally be capable of his mercy  through the salvation   and grace of his Christ      The first of these arch felons deemed himself worthy of Deity    and being inexperienced in the power with whom he had to con    tend  he attempted to arrogate all worship to himself  and to rob   his divine benefactor of glory and godhead      The second of these felons was tempted by the first to aspire    through his own merits  at a godlike independence   to cast off his   allegiance to the author of his being   and to expect intelligence and   knowledge from the sensual fruits of this world  after which he   lusted  He accordingly took and eat of the tree that was pregnant   with all the goods and all the evils of this external  elementary  and   transient system
