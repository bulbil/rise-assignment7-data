multiplying taxes  would  at length  become intolerable to the people  Whatever reason there might be in such arguments  they were notwithstanding constantly over ruled  and every demand granted with pleasure and profusion   All these treaties and alliances  however  in which the kingdom had been lately involved  seemed noway productive of the general tranquility expected from them  The Spaniards  who had never been thoroughly reconciled  still continued their depredations  and plundered the English merchants upon the southern coasts of America  as if they had been pirates  This was the reign of negotiations  and  from these alone  the ministry promised themselves and the nation redress  Still  however  the enemy went on to insult and seize  regardless of our vain ex postulations  The British merchants complained  by petition  of the losses sustained by the Spaniards  and the house of commons deliberated upon this subject  They examined the evidence  and presented an address to his Majesty  He promised them all possible satisfaction  and negotiations were begun as formerly  And a new treaty was signed at Vienna between the Emperor and the Kings of Great Britain and Spain  tending to confirm the former  Though such transactions did not give the security that was xpected from them  yet they  in some measure  put off the troubles of Europe for a time  An interval of eace succeeded  in which scarce any events hapened that deserve the remembrance of an historian  …ch intervals are  however  the periods of happiness 〈◊〉 a people  for history is too often but the register f human calamities  By this treaty at Vienna the …ing of England conceived hopes  that the peace of urope was established upon the most lasting foundation    146 Don Carlos  upon the death of the Duke o Parma  was  by the assistance of an English fleet  pu in peaceable possession of Parma and Placentia  Six thousand Spaniards were quietly admitted  and quartered in the Duchy of Tuscany  to secure for him the reversion of that Dukedom  Thus we see Europe  in some measure  resembling a republic  putting Monarchs into new kingdoms  and depriving others of their succession by an universal concurrence  But this amicable disposition among the great powers can never continue long  and the republic of Europe will be but an empty name  until there be some controlling power set up by universal consent  to enforce obedience to the law of nations   During this interval of profound peace  nothing remarkable happened  except the constant disputations in the house of commons  where the contests between the Court and Country party were carried on with the greatest acrimony  the speeches  on either side  being dictated less by reason than resentment  A calm uninterested reader is now surprized at the heat with which many subjects of little importance in themselves  were discussed at that time  he now smiles at those denunciations of ruin with which their orations are replete  The truth is  the liberty of a nation is better supported by such an opposition  than by what is said in the opposition   In times of profound tranquility the slightest occurrences become objects of universal attention  A society of men  intitled  The charitable Corporation  excited the indignation of the public  Their professed intention was  to lend money at legal interest to the poor  upon small pledges  and to persons of better rank  upon proper security  Their capital was at first limited to thirty thousand pounds  but they afterwards increased it to six hundred thousand  This money was granted in by subscription  and the care of conducting the capital was intrusted to a pro  147 number of directors  This company  having continued for more than twenty years  the cashier  George Robinson  and the warehouse keeper of the company  disappeared in one day  Five hundred thousand pounds of the capital appeared to be sunk  and embezzled
