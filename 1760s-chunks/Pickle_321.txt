Garden as the Grand  Turk of wit and humour  began to find his admirers melt away  and a  certain petulant physician  who had shone at almost all the port clubs  in that end of the town  was actually obliged to import his talents into  the city  where he was now happily taken root   Nor was this success to be wondered at  if we consider that  over and  above his natural genius and education  our adventurer still had the  opportunity of knowing everything which happened among the great  by  means of his friend Cadwallader  with whom he still maintained his  former intimacy  though it was now chequered with many occasional tiffs   owing to the sarcastic remonstrances of the misanthrope  who disapproved  of those schemes which miscarried with Peregrine  and now took  unseasonable methods of valuing himself upon his own foresight  Nay  he  was between whiles like a raven  croaking presages of more ill luck from  the deceit of the minister  the dissimulation of his patron  the folly  of the projector  for whom he was bound  the uncertainty of the seas   and the villainy of those with whom he had entrusted his cash  for  Crabtree saw and considered everything through a perspective of spleen   that always reflected the worst side of human nature  For these reasons  our young gentleman began to be disgusted  at certain intervals  with  the character of this old man  whom he now thought a morose cynic  not  so much incensed against the follies and vices of mankind  as delighted  with the distress of his fellow creatures  Thus he put the most  unfavourable construction on the principles of his friend  because he  found himself justly fallen under the lash of his animadversion  Thus  self accusation very often dissolves the closest friendship  A man   conscious of his own indiscretion  is implacably offended at the  rectitude of his companion s conduct  which he considers as an insult  upon his failings  never to be forgiven  even though he has not tasted  the bitterness of reproof  which no sinner can commodiously digest  The  friendship  therefore  subsisting between Crabtree and Pickle  had of  late suffered several symptomatic shocks  that seemed to prognosticate  a total dissolution  a great deal of smart dialogue had passed in their  private conversations  and the senior began to repent of having placed  his confidence in such an imprudent  headstrong ungovernable youth     6 22 15  3 45 PM   It was in such paroxysms of displeasure that he prophesied misfortune  to Peregrine  and even told him one morning  that he had dreamed of the  shipwreck of the two East Indiamen  on board of which he had hazarded  his money  But this was no other than a false vision  for in a few  weeks  one of them arrived at her moorings in the river  and he received  a thousand in lieu of eight hundred pounds which he had lent upon bond  to one of the mates  At the same time he was informed  that the other  ship  in which he was concerned  had  in all probability  lost her  passage for the season  by being unable to weather the Cape  He was  not at all concerned at that piece of news  knowing  that the longer he  should be out of his money  he would have the more interest to receive   and  finding his present difficulties removed by this supply  his heart  began to dilate  and his countenance to resume its former alacrity  This  state of exultation  however  was soon interrupted by a small accident   which he could not foresee  He was visited one morning by the person  who had lent his friend a thousand pounds on his security  and given  to understand  that the borrower had absconded  in consequence of a  disappointment  by which he had lost the whole sum and all hopes of  retrieving it  so that our hero was now liable for the debt  which he  besought him to discharge according to the bond  that he  the lender   might not suffer by his humanity  It may be easily conceived that  Peregrine did not receive this intelligence in cold blood  He cursed his  own imprudence in contracting such engagements with an adventurer  whom  he did not sufficiently know  He exclaimed against the treachery of the  projector  and having for some time indulged his resentment in threats  and imprecations  inquired into the nature of the scheme which had  miscarried   The lender  who had informed himself of the whole affair  gratified his  curiosity in this particular  by telling him that the fugitive had been  cajoled by a certain knight of the post  who undertook to manage the  thousand pounds in such a manner as would  in a very little time  make  him perfectly independent  and thus he delineated the plan   One half  of the sum   said he   shall be laid out in jewels  which I will pawn to  certain persons of credit and fortune  who lend money upon such pledges  at an exorbitant
