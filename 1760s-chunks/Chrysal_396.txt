generosity         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 477     to them  in so affecting a manner  that the gentleman directly gave him   a considerable sum of money for their present relief  with a promise   of providing for them himself  if he could not prevail upon those   in power to do it  Pleased with a success which he knew would   be so pleasing to his friend  my master took leave of his patron    and set out to trace his own fame from one coffee house to another    and enjoy the applauses which the popularity and boldness of his   attempt procured him from the multitude  wherever he went  after   which he repaired to his usual haTmt  where he dined  and spent   the evening in the usual manner          CHAPTER LI     OHEYSAL s master EECBIVES AH  UNWELCOME VISIT AT AN TIN    SEASONABLE TIME â€”  HIS EXTRAOEDINABY BEHAVIOUR BEFORE   HIS SUPERIORS â€” HE IS SENT TO PRISON â€” CHRYSAL MAKES SOME   UNPOPULAR REMARKS ON CERTAIN rNTEBESTING SUBJECTS â€”   CONSEQUENCES OE HIS MASTER S IMPRISONMENT  WITH AN ACCOUNT   OF HIS BEHAVIOUR IN IT     Confident as my master was of his safety  he soon found that the   fears of his patron were too just  He had scarce laid him down   to sleep  when his bed was surrounded  and himself made a prisoner   by a num ber of fellows  who  under the sanction of authority  com    mitted all the outrages of lawless ruffians  breaking open his looks    rifling his effects  and searching into all his secrets  It was in vain   for him to expostulate with such people against so flagrant injustice    or claim the protection of the laws  They derided him and all   he could say   and having finished their work  dragged him   away  with insults and abuse  to a magistrate   where he had the   comfort of waiting a considerable time in such agreeable company    before his worship was at leisure to see him  But this  though   designed as an indignity  was of real advantage to him  as it gave   him time to recover his spirits  and collect presence of mind for   an interview of such importance  Accordingly  when at length   he was admitted to the dread tribunal  instead of showing any de    jection at the danger which seemed to hang over him  he behaved   in a manner worthy of a better man and a better cause  He asserted   the violation of the laws in his person with so much resolution and   appearance of reason  and returned the insolence of office with   such contempt  answering illusively to the insidious questions put   to him  and boldly demanding that right of being restored to his   liberty which was assured to every individual of the community       Lord Halifax  Davis s Olio  one of the Secretaries of State who issued   the general warrant  Lord Temple  in Wilkes  name  subsequently   brought an action against Halifax and Under Secretary Wood  who   seized Wilkes  papers  Wood had to pay Â£1000 damages  but Halifax   managed to delay the case against himself for six years  at the end of   which his opponent obtained a verdict for Â£4000 damages          478 ADVENTURES OF A OVINE A     by the essential principles of the constitution  that his judges   were   startled  and more than once wished they had left him unmolested      However  as there was no receding now  they concluded it to be their   best way to go through with what they had begun  and bear down   opposition with a high hand  with which intent they sent him   directly to prison  in defiance of all he could say  where he was   treated with uncommon severity  and the method which the law   provided for his being restored to liberty eluded as long as possible    by finesses which power only could support      I see your indignation at such an infringement of laws procured   by the blood of myriads  and established by the most solemn en    gagements  human and divine  for the security of the common rights   of mankind  The part which every man feels in such sufferings    on a supposition that they may possibly one day fall upon himself    naturally interests you  as it did the multitude  in my master s   cause  But when you come to examine coolly the maimer of his   being taken into confinement  which is what gives you such ofience    it win not appear so contrary to reason and justice  the foundation    and  as I may say  soul of all laws  as popular opinion may presume
