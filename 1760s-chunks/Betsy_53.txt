  he easily heard of him  but brought me the vexatious intelligence that   he was gone to Tunbridge  and it was not known when he would return    This was a very great misfortune to me  and the more so as I had very   little money  I thought it best  however  to follow him thither  which I   did the same week        But oh  my dear Betsy  how unlucky every thing happened  he had left   that place the very morning before I arrived  and gone for London  I had   nothing now to do but return  but was so disordered with the fatigues I   had undergone  that I was obliged to stay four days to compose myself    When I came back  I sent immediately to the coffee house  but how shall   I express the distraction I was in  when I was told he had lain but one   night in town  and was gone to Bath        This second disappointment was terrible indeed  I had but half a crown   remaining of the little stock I brought from the boarding school  and   had no way to procure a supply but by selling my watch  which I did to a   goldsmith in the neighbourhood  for what he was pleased to give me  and   then set out for Bath by the first coach        Here I had the good fortune to meet him  he was strangely surprized at   the sight of me in that place  but much more so when I told him what had   brought me there  he seemed extremely concerned at the accident  But   when I mentioned marriage  he plainly told me I must not think of such a   thing  that he was not in circumstances to support a family  that    having lost the small fortune left him by his friends at play  he was   obliged to have recourse  for his present subsistence  to the very   means by which he had been undone  in short  that he was a gamester  The   name startled me  treated as I had always heard it  with the utmost   contempt  I could not reconcile how such a one came to be the guest and   companion of a lord  though I have since heard that men of that   profession frequently receive those favours from the nobility  which are   denied to persons of more unblemished characters        Wildly however  it is certain  had some notions of honour and   good nature  he assured me he would do all in his power to protect me    but added  that he had been very unfortunate of late  and that I must   wait for a lucky chance  before he could afford me any supply        I staid at Bath all the time he was there  he visited me every day  but   I lived on my own money till we came to town  when my time being very   near  he brought me to the place you find me in  having  it seems    agreed with the woman of the house for a certain sum of money to support   me during my lying in  and keep the child as long as it should live  The   miseries I have sustained during my abode with this old hag  would be   too tedious to repeat  The only joy I have is  that the wretched infant   died in three days after it s birth  so has escaped the woes which   children thus exposed are doomed to bear  Wildly has taken his last   leave of me  and I have wrote to an aunt  entreating her to endeavour to   obtain my father s forgiveness  I pretended to her that I left L    e for   no other reason than because I had an ardent desire to see London  and   as I think nobody can reveal to him the true cause  have some hopes of   not being utterly abandoned by him        Here this unfortunate creature finished her long narrative  and Miss   Betsy saw her in too much affliction to express any thing that might   increase it  she only thanked her for reposing a confidence in her     Which   said she   may be of great service to me some time or other        Before they parted  Miss Forward said she had gone in debt to Mrs    Nightshade  for some few things she wanted  over and above what is   generally allowed in such cases  and had been affronted by her for not   being able to discharge it  therefore intreated Miss Betsy to lend her   twenty shillings  on which the generous and sweet tempered young lady   immediately drew her purse  and after giving her the sum she demanded    put two guineas more into her hand
