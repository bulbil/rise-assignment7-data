you do it    There s no danger of that  said she  but to be sure I would not  for   then I should be hanged  for that would be murder  Well  said I  and   suppose he should resolve to ensnare a poor young creature  and ruin   her  would you assist him in that  For to rob a person of her virtue is   worse than cutting her throat       Why now  says she  how strangely you talk  Are not the two sexes made   for one another  And is it not natural for a gentleman to love a pretty   woman  And suppose he can obtain his desires  is that so bad as cutting   her throat  And then the wretch fell a laughing  and talked most   impertinently  and shewed me  that I had nothing to expect from her   virtue or conscience  and this gave me great mortification  for I was in   hopes of working upon her by degrees       So we ended our discourse here  and I bid her shew me where I must   lie   Why  said she  lie where you list  madam  I can tell you  I must   lie with you for the present  For the present  said I  and torture then   wrung my heart   But is it in your instructions  that you must lie with   me  Yes  indeed  said she   I am sorry for it  said I  Why  said she    I am wholesome  and cleanly too  I ll assure you  Yes  said I  I don t   doubt that  but I love to lie by myself  How so  said she  Was not Mrs    Jervis your bed fellow at t other house       Well  said I  quite sick of her  and my condition  you must do as you   are instructed  I think  I can t help myself  and am a most miserable   creature  She repeated her insufferable nonsense  Mighty miserable    indeed  to be so well beloved by one of the finest gentlemen in England          I am now come down in my writing to this present SATURDAY  and a deal I   have written       My wicked bed fellow has very punctual orders  it seems  for she locks   me and herself in  and ties the two keys  for there is a double door to   the room  about her wrist  when she goes to bed  She talks of the house   having been attempted to be broken open two or three times  whether to   fright me  I can t tell  but it makes me fearful  though not so much as   I should be  if I had not other and greater fears       I slept but little last night  and got up  and pretended to sit by the   window  which looks into the spacious gardens  but I was writing all   the time  from break of day  to her getting up  and after  when she was   absent       At breakfast she presented the two maids to me  the cook and house maid    poor awkward souls  that I can see no hopes of  they seem so devoted to   her and ignorance  Yet I am resolved  if possible  to find some way to   escape  before this wicked master comes       There are  besides  of servants  the coachman  Robert  a groom  a   helper  a footman  all but Robert   and he is accessary to my ruin     strange creatures  that promise nothing  and all likewise devoted to   this woman  The gardener looks like a good honest man  but he is kept at   a distance  and seems reserved       I wondered I saw not Mr  Williams the clergyman  but would not ask after   him  apprehending it might give some jealousy  but when I had beheld the   rest  he was the only one I had hopes of  for I thought his cloth would   set him above assisting in my ruin   But in the afternoon he came  for   it seems he has a little Latin school in the neighbouring village  which   he attends  and this brings him in a little matter  additional to my   master s favour  till something better falls  of which he has hopes       He is a sensible sober young gentleman  and when I saw him I confirmed   myself in my hopes of him  for he seemed to take great notice of my   distress and grief   for I could not hide it   though he appeared   fearful of Mrs  Jewkes  who watched all our motions
