such black   ingratitude  replied she  heaven knows with what sincere and humble duty   I regard you  and that I would sooner die than wilfully offend you  but   if I am so unfortunate as not to be able to obey you in this last   command  impute it  I beseech you  to my ill fate  and rather pity than   condemn me       You cannot love me then  cried he  somewhat feircely  No otherwise than   I have ever done  answered she  My heart is filled with duty  reverence   and gratitude  of which your goodness is the only source  as for any   other sort of love I know not what it is  were it a voluntary emotion    believe me  sir  I gladly would give it entrance into my soul  but I   well see it is of a far different nature       Yet is your person at your own disposal  resumed he  and when possessed   of that  the flame which burns so fiercely in my breast  in time may   kindle one in yours  In speaking these words he took her in his arms    and kissed her with a vehemence which the prodigious respect she bore to   him  as the patron and benefactor of herself and brother  could alone   have made her suffer   Her eyes however sparkled with indignation  tho    her tongue was silent  and at last bursting from his embrace  this  sir    cried she  is not the way to make me think as you would have me  As in   this action he had no way transgressed the rules of decency  he could   ill brook the finding her so much alarmed at it  and would have   testified his resentment  had not the excess of his love  which is ever   accompanied with an adequate share of respect  obliged him to stifle it    Well  Louisa  said he  looking earnestly upon her  ungenerously do you   requite what I have done for you  but I  perhaps  may bring myself to   other sentiments   None  interrupted she  emboldened by the too great   freedom she thought he had taken with her  can be so dreadful to me as   those you now seem to entertain       The look he gave her on hearing her speak in this manner  made her   immediately repent having been so open  and in the same breath  because    pursued she  I look on it as the worst evil could befal me that I am   compelled to oppose them       Come  said he  again softened by these last words  you will not always   oppose them  the fervor and constancy of my passion  joined with a   little yielding on your side  will by degrees excite a tender impulse in   you  and whatever is disagreeable at present  either in my person or   behaviour  will wear of   Permit me at least to flatter myself so far    and refuse me not those innocent endearments I have been accustomed to   treat you with  before you knew me as a lover  or I indeed suspected I   should be so       He then kissed her again  but tho  he constrained himself within more   bounds than before  those caresses which she received with pleasure    when thinking them only demonstrations of friendship  were now irksome    as knowing them the effects of love  she suffered him however to embrace   her several times  and hold one of her hands close pressed between his    while he endeavoured to influence her mind by all the tender arguments   his passion  backed with an infinity of wit  inspired  to all which she   made as few replies as possible  but he contented himself  as love is   always flattering  with imagining she was less refractory to his suit   than when he first declared it       Every day  and almost the whole day  did he entertain her on no other   subject  but gained not the least ground on her inclinations  and all he   could get from her was the wish of being less insensible  without the   least indication of ever being so       In this manner did they live together near three weeks  and how much   longer he would have been able to restrain his impatience  or she to   conceal the extreme regret in being compelled to listen to him  is   uncertain  a law suit required his presence to town  and Louisa was in   hopes of being relieved for some time  but his passion was arrived at   such a height that he could not support the least absence from her  and   therefore brought her to London with him  so that her persecution ceased   not  he never stirring from her
