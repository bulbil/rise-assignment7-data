tantalise him  eluded all  his inquiries  with such appearance of industry and art  as heightened  his curiosity  while it disappointed his aim  and inflamed him to such  a degree of impatience  that his wits began to be unsettled  then  Peregrine was fain to recompose his brain  by telling him in confidence   that he had been arrested as a spy  This secret he found more  intolerable than his former uncertainty  He ran from one apartment to  another  like a goose in the agonies of egg laying  with intention of  disburdening this important load  but Jolter being engaged with the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   pupil  and all the people of the house ignorant of the only language  he could speak  he was compelled  with infinite reluctance  to address  himself to the doctor  who was at that time shut up in his own chamber   Having knocked at the door to no purpose  he peeped through the  key hole  and saw the physician sitting at a table  with a pen in one  hand  and paper before him  his head reclined upon his other hand  and  his eyes fixed upon the ceiling  as if he had been entranced  Pallet   concluding that he was under the power of some convulsion  endeavoured  to force the door open  and the noise of his efforts recalled the doctor  from his reverie   This poetical republican  being so disagreeably disturbed  started up  in a passion  and  opening the door  no sooner perceived who had  interrupted him  than he flung it in his face with great fury  and  cursed him for his impertinent intrusion  which had deprived him of the  most delightful vision that ever regaled the human fancy  He imagined   as he afterwards imparted to Peregrine  that  as he enjoyed himself in  walking through the flowery plain that borders on Parnassus  he was met  by a venerable sage  whom  by a certain divine vivacity that lightened  from his eyes  he instantly knew to be the immortal Pindar  He was  immediately struck with reverence and awe  and prostrated himself before  the apparition  which  taking him by the hand  lifted him gently from  the ground and  with words more sweet than the honey of the Hybla  bees  told him  that  of all the moderns  he alone was visited by  that celestial impulse by which he himself had been inspired  when he  produced his most applauded odes  So saying  he led him up the sacred  hill  persuaded him to drink a copious draught of the waters of the  Hippocrene  and then presented him to the harmonious Nine  who crowned  his temples with a laurel wreath   No wonder that he was enraged to find himself cut off from such sublime  society  He raved in Greek against the invader  who was so big with  his own purpose  that  unmindful of the disgrace he had sustained  and  disregarding all the symptoms of the physician s displeasure  he applied  his mouth to the door  in an eager tone   I ll hold you any wager   said  he   that I guess the true cause of Mr  Pickle s imprisonment   To this  challenge he received no reply  and therefore repeated it  adding   I  suppose you imagine he was taken up for fighting a duel  or affronting a  nobleman  or lying with some man s wife  or some such matter  but  egad   you was never more mistaken in your life  and I ll lay my Cleopatra  against your Homer s head  that in four and twenty hours you shan t  light on the true reason    The favourite of the muses  exasperated at this vexatious perseverance  of the painter  who he imagined had come to tease and insult him   I  would   said he   sacrifice a cock to Esculapius  were I assured that  any person had been taken up for extirpating such a troublesome Goth as  you are from the face of the earth  As for your boasted Cleopatra  which  you say was drawn from your own wife  I believe the copy has as much of  the to kalon as the original  but  were it mine  it should be hung up  in the Temple of Cloacina  as the picture of that goddess  for any  other apartment would be disgraced by its appearance     Hark ye  sir    replied Pallet  enraged in his turn at the contemptuous mention of his  darling performance   you may make as free with my wife as you think  proper  but  ware my works  those are the children of my fancy   conceived by the glowing imagination  and formed by the art of my own  hands  and you yourself are a Goth  and a Turk  and a Tartar  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   an impudent pretending jackanapes  to treat with such disrespect a  production which  in the opinion of all the connoisseurs of
