and Emily not with me  I die for amusement  Fitzgerald ventures still at the hazard of his own neck and his horses legs  for the latter of which animals I have so much compassion  that I have ordered both to stay at home a few days  which days I shall devote to study and contemplation  and little pert chit chats with papa  who is ten times more fretful at being kept within doors than I am  I intend to win a little fortune of him at piquet before the world breaks in upon our solitude  Adieu  I am idle  but always  Your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER CXXX   130   To the Earl of —   Silleri  April 20    TIS indeed  my Lord  an advantage for which we cannot be too thankful to the Supreme Being  to be born in a country  whose religion and laws are such  as would have been the objects of our wishes  had we been born in any other       Our religion  I would be understood to mean Christianity in general  carries internal conviction by the excellency of its moral precepts  and its tendency to make mankind happy  and the peculiar mode of it established in England breathes beyond all others the mild spirit of the Gospel  and that charity which embraces all mankind as brothers       It is equally free from enthusiasm and superstition  its outward form is decent and respectful  without affected ostentation  and what shews its excellence above all others is  that every other church allows it to be the best  except itself  and it is an established rule  that he has an undoubted right to the first rank of merit  to whom every man allows the second       As to our government  it would be impertinent to praise it  all mankind allow it to be the master piece of human wisdom       It has the advantage of every other form  with as little of their inconveniences as the imperfection attendant on all human inventions will admit  it has the monarchic quickness of execution and stability  the aristocratic diffusive strength and wisdom of counsel  the democratic freedom and equal distribution of property       When I mention equal distribution of property  I would not be understood to mean such an equality as never existed  nor can exist but in idea  but that general  that comparative equality  which leaves to every man the absolute and safe possession of the fruits of his labors  which softens offensive distinctions  and curbs pride  by leaving every order of men in some degree dependent on the other  and admits of those gentle and almost imperceptible gradations  which the poet so well calls     Th  according music of a well mix d state           The prince is here a centre of union  an advantage  the want of which makes a democracy  which is so beautiful in theory  the very worst of all possible governments  except absolute monarchy  in practice       I am called upon  my Lord  to go to the citadel  to see the going away of the ice  an object so new to me  that I cannot resist the curiosity I have to see it  though my going thither is attended with infinite difficulty       Bell insists on accompanying me  I am afraid for her  but she will not be refused       At our return  I will have the honor of writing again to your Lordship  by the gentleman who carries this to New York       I have the honor to be  my Lord   Your Lordship s   c   WM  FERMOR     LETTER CXXXI   131   To the Earl of —   Silleri  April 20  Evening   WE are returned  my Lord  from having seen an object as beautiful and magnificent in itself  as pleasing from the idea it gives of renewing once more our intercourse with Europe       Before I saw the breaking up of the vast body of ice  which forms what is here called the bridge  from Quebec to Point Levi  I imagined there could be nothing in it worth attention  that the ice would pass away  or dissolve gradually  day after day  as the influence of the sun  and warmth of the air and earth increased  and that we should see the river open  without having observed by what degrees it became so       But I found the great river  as the savages with much propriety call it  maintain its dignity in this instance as in all others  and assert its superiority over those petty streams which we honor with the names of rivers in England  Sublimity is the characteristic of this western world  the loftiness of the mountains  the grandeur of the lakes and rivers  the majesty of the rocks shaded with a picturesque variety of beautiful trees and shrubs  and crowned with the noblest of the offspring of the forest  which form the banks of the latter  are as much beyond the power of fancy as that of description  a landscape painter might here expand his imagination  and find ideas which he will seek in vain in our comparatively little world
