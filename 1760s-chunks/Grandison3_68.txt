had hopes of meeting with encouragement  and doubted not  if he did  of making a merit with her  by his affection and gratitude  And now  madam  give me your opinion—Do you think Charlotte can be won  I hope she can  by indulgence  by Love  Let me caution her by you  madam  that it is fit she should still more restrain herself  if she marry a man to whom she thinks she has superior talents  than she need do if the difference were in his favour   Permit me to add  That if she should shew herself capable of returning slight for tenderness  of taking such liberties with a man who loves her  after she had given him her vows  as should depreciate him  and  of consequence  herself  in the eye of the world  I should be apt to forget that I had more than one sister  For  in cases of right and wrong  we ought not to know either relation or friend     167 Does not this man  Lucy  shew us  that goodness and greatness are synonymous words   I think  Sir  replied I  that if Lord G  prove the good natured man he seems to be  if he dislike not that brilliancy of temper in his Lady  which he seems not to value himself upon  tho  he may have qualities  at least  equally valuable  I have no doubt but Miss Grandison will make him very happy  For has she not great and good qualities  Is she not generous  and perfectly good natured  You know  Sir  that she is  And can it be supposed  that her charming vivacity will ever carry her so far beyond the bounds of prudence and discretion  as to make her forget what the nature of the obligation she will have entered into  requires of her   Well  madam  then I may rejoice the heart of Lord G  by telling him  that he is at liberty to visit my sister  at her coming to town  or  if she come not soon  for he will be impatient to wait on her  at Colnebrooke   I dare say you may  Sir   As to articles and settlements  I will undertake for all those things  But be pleased to tell her  that she is absolutely at her own liberty  for me  If she shall think  when she sees farther of Lord G  s temper and behaviour  that she cannot esteem him as a wife ought to esteem her husband  I shall not be concerned  if she dismiss him  provided that she keeps him not on in suspence  after she knows her own mind  but behaves to him according to the example set her by the best of women   I could not but know to whom he designed this compliment  and had like to have bowed  but was glad I did not   Well  madam  and now I think this subject is concluded  I have already written a Letter to Sir Walter  as at the request of my sister  to put an end  in the civillest terms  to his hopes  My Lord G  will be   168 impatient for my return to town  I shall go with the more pleasure  because of the joy I shall be able to give him   You must be very happy  Sir  since  besides the pleasure you take in doing good for its own sake  you are intitled to partake  in a very high manner  of the pleasures of every one you know   He was so nobly modest  Lucy  that I could talk to him with more confidence than  I believed  at my entrance into my Lord s study  would fall to my share  And I had  besides  been led into a presence of mind  by being made a person of some consequence in the Love case of another  But I was soon to have my whole attention engaged in a subject still nearer to my heart  as you shall hear   Indeed  madam  said he  I am not very happy in myself  Is it not right then  to endeavour  by promoting the happiness of others  to intitle myself to a share of theirs   If you are not happy  Sir—and I stopt  I believe sighed  I looked down  I took out my handkerchief  for fear I should want it   There seems  said he  to be a mixture of generous concern  and kind curiosity  in one of the loveliest and most intelligent faces in the world  My sisters have  in your presence  expressed a great deal of the latter  Had I not been myself in a manner uncertain  as to the event that must  in some measure  govern my future destiny  I would have gratified it  especially as my Lord L  has  of late  joined in it  The crisis  I told them  however  as perhaps you remember  was at hand   I do remember you said so  Sir  And indeed  Lucy  it was more than perhaps  I had not thought of any words half so often  since he spoke them   The
