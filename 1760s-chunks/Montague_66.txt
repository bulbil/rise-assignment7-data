hope to return her impertinence on Thursday night at the governor s  I will never forgive Fitzgerald if he takes the least notice of her       Emily has read my letter  and says she did not think I had so much of the woman in me  insists on my being civil to Madame La Brosse  but if I am  Lucy       These Frenchwomen are not to be supported  they fancy vanity and assurance are to make up for the want of every other virtue  forgetting that delicacy  softness  sensibility  tenderness  are attractions to which they are strangers  some of them here are however tolerably handsome  and have a degree of liveliness which makes them not quite insupportable       You will call all this spite  as Emily does  so I will say no more  only that  in order to shew her how very easy it is to be civil to a rival  I wish for the pleasure of seeing another French lady  that I could mention  at Quebec       Good night  my dear  tell Temple  I am every thing but in love with him       Your faithful   A  FERMOR       I will however own  I encouraged Fitzgerald by a kind look  I was so pleased at his return  that I could not keep up the farce of disdain I had projected  in love affairs  I am afraid  we are all fools alike     LETTER CVI   106   To Miss FERMOR   Saturday noon   COME to my dressing room  my dear  I have a thousand things to say to you  I want to talk of my Rivers  to tell you all the weakness of my soul       No  my dear  I cannot love him more  a passion like mine will not admit addition  from the first moment I saw him my whole soul was his  I knew not that I was dear to him  but true genuine love is self existent  and does not depend on being beloved  I should have loved him even had he been attached to another       This declaration has made me the happiest of my sex  but it has not increased  it could not increase  my tenderness  with what softness  what diffidence  what respect  what delicacy  was this declaration made  my dear friend  he is a god  and my ardent affection for him is fully justified        I love him no words can speak how much I love him       My passion for him is the first and shall be the last of my life  my bosom never heaved a sigh but for my Rivers       Will you pardon the folly of a heart which till now was ashamed to own its feelings  and of which you are even now the only confidante       I find all the world so insipid  nothing amuses me one moment  in short  I have no pleasure but in Rivers s conversation  nor do I count the hours of his absence in my existence       I know all this will be called folly  but it is a folly which makes all the happiness of my life       You love  my dear Bell  and therefore will pardon the weakness of your   EMILY     LETTER CVII   107   To Miss MONTAGUE   Saturday   YES  my dear  I love  at least I think so  but  thanks to my stars  not in the manner you do       I prefer Fitzgerald to all the rest of his sex  but I count the hours of his absence in my existence  and contrive sometimes to pass them pleasantly enough  if any other agreable man is in the way  in short  I relish flattery and attention from others  though I infinitely prefer them from him       I certainly love him  for I was jealous of Madame La Brosse  but  in general  I am not alarmed when I see him flirt a little with others  Perhaps my vanity was as much wounded as my love  with regard to Madame La Brosse       I find love is quite a different plant in different soils  it is an exotic  and grows faintly  with us coquets  but in its native climate with you people of sensibility and sentiment       Adieu  I will attend you in a quarter of an hour   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER CVIII   108   To Miss FERMOR   NOT alarmed  my dear  at his attention to others  believe me  you know nothing of love       I think every woman who beholds my Rivers a rival  I imagine I see in every female countenance a passion tender and lively as my own  I turn pale  my heart dies within me  if I observe his eyes a moment fixed on any other woman  I tremble at the possibility of his changing  I cannot support the idea that the time may come when I may be less dear to my Rivers than at present  Do you believe it possible  my dearest Bell  for any heart  not prepossessed  to be insensible
