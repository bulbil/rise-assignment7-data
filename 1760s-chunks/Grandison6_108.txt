ever found out—He can court without speech  He can take one s heart  and say never a word  Hay  Harriet  looking archly   MR  Deane is come—In charming health and spirits—Thank God  With what cordiality did Sir Charles and he embrace each other   Sir Charles attended my grandmamma home  So we had not his company at supper  Now convenience without its contrary  He is her own son  She is his own parent  Such an unaffected love on both sides —Such a sweetly easy  yet respectful  familiarity between them  What additional pleasures must a young woman in my situation have  when she can consider herself as the bond of union between the family she   269 is of  and that she is entering into  How dreadful  on the contrary  must be her case  who is the occasion of propagating dissention  irreconcilable hatred  and abhorrence between her own relations and those of the man to whom she for life engages herself   My grandmother and Sir Charles were no sooner gone  than my uncle began to talk with Mr  Deane on the subject that is nearest all our hearts  I was afraid the conversation would not be managed to my liking  and having too just an excuse to ask leave to withdraw  from bad  or rather no rest  last night  I made use of it  and here in my closet  preparing now  however  for it  am I  Your ever affectionate HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XLIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Wednesday Morning  Nov  8   SIR Charles let my grandmother come hither by herself  He is gone to visit that Greville  We are all in pain for him  But Mr  Deane comforts us   After breakfast  thus began my uncle upon me   Here  Dame Selby  are we still at a fault  Harriet knows not what she would be at  and you uphold her in her nonsenses  Delicacy  Delicacy  The duce take me  if I have any notion of it —What a pize are you about   Dear Sir  why am I blamed  said I  What would you have me do  that I have not done   Do  why I would have you give him his Day  and keep to it  that I would have you do  And not shillyshally for ever—and subject the best of men to insults  All your men will be easy and quiet  when the ceremony is over  and they know there is no remedy   My good Mr  Selby  said my grandmamma  you   270 now blame without reason  Sir Charles was full hasty  Harriet was a little more nice  perhaps  her Lover considered  than she needed to be  Yet I don t know  but I  in her case  should have done as she did  and expected as much time as she was willing to take  It was not a very long one  Mr  Selby  from the declaration he made  and he is a man himself of great delicacy  Harriet very readily acknowleged to him the preference she gave him to all them  and when she found him very earnest for a short day  she  by her last Letter  threw herself generously into his power  He is full of acknowlegements upon it  and so he ought to be  To me he has said all that a man should say of his gratitude  upon the occasion  and he declared to me last night  that it was with difficulty he forbore taking advantage of her goodness to him  But that he checked himself  and led to other subjects  seeing how much the dear creature was disordered  and being apprehensive  that if he had begun upon one so interesting  or even wished to talk with her alone  he should have increased her disorder   Oy  Oy  Sir Charles is considerate  and Harriet should be grateful  But indeed my Dame Selby is as silly  to the full  as Harriet  She is for having Harriet keep her in countenance in the dance she led me  so many years ago—Lady G  for my money  She finds you all out in your Masonry   Mr  Selby  said my aunt  I only refer myself to what our venerable parent just said   And so don t think it worth while to hold an argument with me  I suppose   I did not know  my dear  that you wanted to hold an argument   Your servant  madam—with that sly leer—So like Harriet  and Harriet so like you   But  Mr  Selby  said my grandmamma  will you be pleased to tell the dear child  if you think her wrong  what is the next step she should take     271 Think her wrong —Next step —Why the next step is  as she has promised to oblige him  and to be directed by him  to keep her word  and not hum nor haw about the matter   Mr  Deane  who had been shewn and told everything that had passed since we saw him last  said  You don t know that my daughter Byron will make unnecessary parade  Mr  Selby  Sir Charles you
