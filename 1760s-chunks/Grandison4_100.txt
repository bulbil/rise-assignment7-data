of both  and leapt down  and  drawing his sword  made towards the two men who were so cruelly exercising their whips  and who  on his approach  retired to some little distance  drawing their hangers   The four men on horseback joined the two on foot  just as they were quitting the objects of their fury  and one of them said  Forbear  for the present  further   249 violence  brother  the gentleman  shall be told the cause of all this —Murder  Sir  said he  is not intended  nor are we robbers  The men whom you are solicitous to save from our vengeance  are villains   Be the cause what it will  answered Sir Charles  you are in a country noted for doing spee•• justice  upon proper application to the magistrates  In the same instant he raised first one groaning man  then the other  Their heads were all over bloody  and they were so much bruised  that they could not extend their arms to reach their wigs and hats  which l•y near them  nor put them on without Sir Charles s help   The men on foot by this time had mounted their horses  and all fix stood upon their defence  but one of them was so furious  crying out  that his vengeance should be yet more complete  that two of the others could hardly restrain him   Sir Charles asked Sir Hargrave and Mr  Merceda  Whether they had reason to look upon themselves as injured men  or injurers  One of the assailants answered  That they both knew themselves to be villains   Either from consciousness  or terror  perhaps from both  they could not speak for themselves  but by groans  nor could either of them stand or sit upright   Just then came up  in the chaise  Mr  Lowther and his servant  each a pistol in his hand  He quitted the chaise  when he came near the suffering men  and Sir Charles desired him instantly to examine whether the gentlemen were dangerously hurt  or not   The most enraged of the assailants  having slipt by the two who were earnest to restrain him  would again have attacked Mr  Merceda  offering a stroke at him with his hanger  But Sir Charles  his drawn sword still in his hand  caug•t hold of his hand and  turning his horse s head aside  diverted a 〈◊〉  250 which  in all probability  would otherwise have been a finishing one   They all came about Sir Charles  bidding him  at his peril  use his sword upon their friend  And Sir Charles s servants were coming up to their master s support  had there b en occasion  At that instant Mr  Lowther  assisted by his own servant  was examining the wounds and bruises of the two terrified men  who had yet no reason to think themselves safe from further violence   Sir Charles repeatedly commanded his servants not to fire  nor approach nearer  without his orders  The persons  said he  to the assailants  whom you have so cruelly used  are Englishmen of condition I will protect them  Be the provocation what it will  you must know that your attempt upon them is a criminal one  and if my friend last come up  who is a very skilful surgeon  shall pronounce them in danger  you shall find it so  Still he held the horse of the furious one  and three of them  who seemed to be principals  were beginning to express some resentment at this cavalier treatment  when Mr  Lowther gave his opinion  that there was no apparent danger of death  And then Sir Charles  quitting the man s bridle  and putting himself between the assailants and sufferers  said  That as they had not either offered to fly  or to be guilty of violence to himself  his friend  or servants  he was afraid they had some reason to think themselves ill used by the gentlemen  But  however  as they could not suppose they were at liberty  in a civilized country  to take their revenge on the persons of those who were intitled to the protection of that country  he should expect  that they would hold themselves to be personally answerable for their conduct at a proper tribunal   The villains  one of the men said  knew who they were  and what the provocation was  which had merited a worse treatment than they had hitherto met   251 with  You  Sir  proceeded he  seem to be a man of honour  and temper  We are men of honour  as well as you  Our design  as we told you  was not to kill the miscreants  but to give them reason to remember their villainy as long as they lived  and to put it out of their power ever to be guilty of the like  They have made a vile attempt  continued he  on a Lady s honour at Abbeville  and  finding themselves detected  and in danger  had taken round about ways  and shifted from one vehicle to another  to escape the vengeance of her friends  The gentleman whose horse you held  and who has reason to be in a passion  is the husband
