 When the treasurer went to divide the money  among which I   lay  according to his master s orders  I was greatly alarmed for fear   I should be torn so soon from the presence of this prince   but my   anxiety was relieved when he took that bag in which I was and   gave it to one of his master s s to lay upon his table      The many things I had heard of this prince s greatness had  I   own  deceived me into expectations of pomp and grandeur in his   court  and particularly about his person  This made me surprised   to find everything in a plainness far greater than what I had in   many instances observed in private life  But I iostantly perceived   my error â€” that his greatness was his own  established on the virtues   of his soul  and independent of  and superior to  every adventitious   circumstance      I had not long lain upon his table when he entered alone  and    walking a meditated turn or two across the tent  kneeled down   and offered up his soul in the most ardent devotion to Heaven    He then arose with a serenely cheerful countenance  and coming   to the table poured out the money  and viewing it earnestly for a   moment â€”   thou source of every evil which distracts this wretched   world    said he    let me not be infected by thy poison  Let not my   heart conceive a fondness for thee  further than what the native   value of enabling it to do good justly entitles thee to  I am yet   free from thy infatuation  nor have ever suffered avarice to tempt   me to desire thee  by improper means nor vain luxury or pride    to abuse thee by profusion  This pittance only do T call my own          230 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     which I devote to the Divine Author of all the benefits and mercies   of my Ufe  in grateful return  by supplying  with it the necessities   of my distressed fellow creatures        Then  taking a handful of it to put into his pocket  and happen    ing to observe my shape  he took me up  and  looking attentively   at me â€”   la there no comer of the earth    said he    where the wealth   of Britain is not dispersed   If its commerce collects the produce   of every climate under heaven  its mimificence does also diffuse its   riches as far  Great and happy nation   wert thou but sensible of   the blessings of thy condition   but the time is come when thou   openest thine eyes to thine own interest  and feelest the mightiness   of thy strength  How great is the power of true wisdom   how   happy the people who have a good man for their guide        Saying this  he put us into his pocket  and  as soon as it was dark    wrapped himself in a cloak  and went out privately to take a view   of his camp  in a disguise that secured him from misinformation or   deceit          CHAPTER XXI     THE KING TAKES A VIEW OF HIS CAMP IN DISGUISE â€” THE EXALTED   PLBASTJBB HE RECEIVES IN THE VARIOUS OCCURRENCES OF HIS   WALK â€” HE GAINS A VICTORY â€” HIS CONDUCT IN AND AFTER THE   BATTLE     The notion I had formed of a camp  from the effects which I had   seen of war  made me expect a scene of tumult and confusion  But   how was I surprised here to find everything as regular and tranquil   as in the best governed city in the midst of peace      My master had not walked far  when some conversation    that seemed to be carried on with warmth in one of the tents    catching his ear  he stopped to listen what might be the subject   of it        I imagine    said a voice within    that we shall have a battle   soon  The cheerfulness of the king s looks  and the more than   common spirits he has been in for these few days  are certain signs   that he has some great things in view  I always observe him so   before a battle          The sooner it comes the better    replied another    I only wish   that our forces were not so overmatched in numbers   not that I   fear success when he is with us  but that we may be able to give   them a total defeat at once  and so prevent their making head   again  For such is the
