only say that the meeting of Horatio and Charlotta was such  as might be   expected from so arduous and constant an affection  that every thing   having been settled between the two fathers at the time they sent their   joint mandates to call him home  there now remained nothing but to   celebrate the long desired nuptials  which was deferred no longer than   was requisite for preparations to render the ceremony magnificent       The generous du Plessis and his beloved Louisa were also united the same   day  and it would be hard to say which of these weddings afforded most   satisfaction to the friends on both sides  or were attended with the   most happy consequences to the persons concerned in them       By these examples we may learn  that to sustain with fortitude and   patience whatever ills we are preordained to suffer  entitles us to   relief  while by impatient struggling we should but augment the score    and provoke fate to shew us the vanity of all attempts to frustrate   its decrees        FINIS
