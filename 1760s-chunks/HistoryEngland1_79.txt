 His threats were soon conveyed to Wolsey by an informer  who was not slow to accuse the Duke of high treason  The substance of his impeachment was  that he had consulted a fortune teller concerning his succession to the crown  and had affected to make himself popular  This was but a weak pretext to take away the life of a nobleman  whose father had died in defence of the late King  however  he was condemned to die as a traitor  When the sentence was pronouncing against him  and the High Steward came to mention the word traitor  the unhappy prisoner could no longer contain    My Lords  cried he to his Judges  I am no traitor  and  for what you have now done against me  take my sincere forgiveness  as for my life  I think it not worth petitioning for  may God forgive you  and pity me    He was soon after executed on Tower hill     Every just man must feel the highest indignation at so unmerited a punishment  In the former reign  the few that perished under the hand of the executioner were really culpable  but here we see a nobleman s life taken away  only for his dislike to an aspiring and licentious upstart  It is this cruelty of punishing without guilt  and not the number of executions in a reign  that distinguishes it into tyrannical or merciful  perhaps there were more executions under Henry VII  than his successor  and yet the first was a just and merciful Prince  the latter an arbitrary and merciless tyrant   By this time all the immense treasures of the late King were quite exhausted on empty ants  guilty pleasures  or vain treaties and expeditions  Wolsey was a proper instrument to supply the King   232 with money  which now began to be wanted  this he extorted by the name of a benevolence  Henry minded not by what methods it was raised  provided he had but the enjoyment of it  However  his minister met some opposition in his attempts to levy those involuntary contributions  having exacted a considerable subsidy from the clergy  he next addressed himself to the House of Commons  but they only granted half the supplies he demanded  The Cardinal was highly offended at their parsimony  and desired to be heard in the house  but  as this would have destroyed the very form and constitution of that august body  they replied  that none could be admitted to reason there but such as were members  This was the first attempt made  in the present reign  to render the King master of the debates in parliament  Wolsey first paved the way  and  unfortunately for the kingdom  the King too well improved upon his design   Wolsey was  soon after  raised to still greater dignities than before  he was  at once  Archbishop of York  Bishop of Durham  Abbot of St  Alban s  a Cardinal  Legate for life  Lord Chancellor of England  Prime Minister  and favourite  and caressed or feared by all the powers of Europe  he now  therefore  undertook more openly to render the King independent of his parliament  and levied the subsidy granted by them for four years  and consequently to be paid at four different times  all at once  Against this the poor  who were the greatest sufferers  most loudly exclaimed  but he disregarded their clamours  secure in the King s approbation and the Pope s protection   These proceedings only paved the way to still greater extortions  Wolsey was too haughty to   233 be refused in his demands by the House of Commons  and determined to levy money upon the King s authority alone  This was deemed a breach of the Magna Charta  and the people absolutely refused to comply  even a general rebellion threatened to ensue  the King  finding what were likely to be the consequences of the Cardinal s precipitate measures  pretended that they were carried on without his authority  but  at the same time  demanded from the people a benevolence  which was only an artifice to extort money  under a different name  The people seemed sensible of the King s art  and the citizens of London refused to give the benevolence demanded  their example was followed by the country  and an universal defection seemed to prevail  The King  apprehensive of bad consequences  by persisting in his demand  thought proper to retract  for this time  and wait a more favourable opportunity of oppression   You now find the people labouring under a very different form of oppression from that in the reigns preceding Henry VII  In those earlier times their miseries chiefly arose from the licentiousness of the nobility  in this reign they proceeded from the usurpations of the King  Before Henry VII  had balanced the government  the people often discharged their taxes by an insurrection  but now  that the present Henry had destroyed that balance again  the people were obliged to pay taxes that were not due  In short  they now seemed as miserable as when their great restorer had brought them from anarchy  an arbitrary King  an avaricious Pope  a revengeful favourite  a luxurious clergy  all conspired to harrass them  yet  during this whole reign  there was no rebellion
