be to make themselves as useless to the world as possible  Think too of the shocking indelicacy of many of them  who make it a point of religion to abjure linen  and wear their habits till they drop off  How astonishing that any mind should suppose the Deity an enemy to cleanliness  the Jewish religion was hardly any thing else       I paid my respects wherever I stopped  to the seigneuress of the village  for as to the seigneurs  except two or three  if they had not wives  they would not be worth visiting       I am every day more pleased with the women here  and  if I was gallant  should be in danger of being a convert to the French stile of gallantry  which certainly debases the mind much less than ours       But what is all this to my Emily  How I envy Sir George  what happiness has Heaven prepared for him  if he has a soul to taste it       I really must not think of her  I found so much delight in her conversation  it was quite time to come away  I am almost ashamed to own how much difficulty I found in leaving her  do you know I have scarce slept since  This is absurd  but I cannot help it  which by the way is an admirable excuse for any thing       I have been come but two hours  and am going to Silleri  to pay my compliments to your friend Miss Fermor  who arrived with her father  who comes to join his regiment  since I left Quebec  I hear there has been a very fine importation of English ladies during my absence  I am sorry I have not time to visit the rest  but I go to morrow morning to the Indian village for a fortnight  and have several letters to write to night        Adieu  I am interrupted   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER IX   9    To Mrs  MELMOTH  at Montreal   Quebec  August 24   I CANNOT  Madam  express my obligation to you for having added a postscript to Major Melmoth s letter  I am sure he will excuse my answering the whole to you  if not  I beg he may know that I shall be very pert about it  being much more solicitous to please you than him  for a thousand reasons too tedious to mention       I thought you had more penetration than to suppose me indifferent  on the contrary  sensibility is my fault  though it is not your little every day beauties who can excite it  I have admirable dispositions to love  though I am hard to please  in short  I am not cruel  I am only nice  do but you  or your divine friend  give me leave to wear your chains  and you shall soon be convinced I can love like an angel  when I set in earnest about it  But  alas  you are married  and in love with your husband  and your friend is in a situation still more unfavorable to a lover s hopes  This is particularly unfortunate  as you are the only two of your bewitching sex in Canada  for whom my heart feels the least sympathy  To be plain  but don t tell the little Major  I am more than half in love with you both  and  if I was the grand Turk  should certainly fit out a fleet  to seize  and bring you to my seraglio       There is one virtue I admire extremely in you both  I mean  that humane and tender compassion for the poor men  which prompts you to be always seen together  if you appeared separate  where is the hero who could resist either of you       You ask me how I like the French ladies at Montreal  I think them extremely pleasing  and many of them handsome  I thought Madame L— so  even near you and Miss Montague  which is  I think  saying as much as can be said on the subject        I have just heard by accident that Sir George is arrived at Montreal  Assure Miss Montague  no one can be more warmly interested in her happiness than I am  she is the most perfect work of Heaven  may she be the happiest  I feel much more on this occasion than I can express  a mind like hers must  in marriage  be exquisitely happy or miserable  my friendship makes me tremble for her  notwithstanding the worthy character I have heard of Sir George       I will defer till another time what I had to say to Major Melmoth       I have the honour to be   Madam                Yours  c   ED  RIVERS     LETTER X   10   Silleri  August 24   I HAVE been a month arrived  my dear  without having seen your brother  who is at Montreal  but I am told is expected to day  I have spent my time however very agreably  I know not what the winter may be  but I am enchanted with the beauty of this country in summer  bold  picturesque
