him  and accompanied him into town  with  acclamations  and other expressions of joy  insomuch that the agents  of his adversary durst not show their faces  The sovereign of the  corporation  who was a particular creature and favourite of the usurper   and whose all depended upon the issue of the cause  was so conscious of  the stranger s right  and so much awed by the behaviour of the people   who knew that consciousness  that he did not think it safe even to  preserve the appearance of neutrality upon this occasion  but actually  held the stirrup while Mr  A   dismounted from his horse    This sense of conviction in the people manifested itself still more  powerfully when he returned to the same place in the year 1744  about    6 22 15  3 45 PM   which time Lord A   being informed of his resolution  determined again  to be beforehand with him  and set out in person  with his agents  and friends  some of whom were detached before him to prepare for his  reception  and induced the people to meet him in a body  and accompany  him to town  with such expressions of welcome as they had before  bestowed on his nephew  but  in spite of all their art and interest   he was suffered to pass through the street in a mournful silence  and  though several barrels of beer were produced to court the favour of the  populace  they had no other effect than that of drawing their ridicule  upon the donor  whereas  when Mr  A    two days afterwards  appeared   all the inhabitants  with garlands  streamers  music  and other ensigns  of joy  crowded out to meet him  and ushered him into town with such  demonstrations of pleasure and goodwill  that the noble peer found it  convenient to hide himself from the resentment of his own tenants  the  effects of which he must have severely felt  had not he been screened  by the timely remonstrances of Mr  M    and the other gentlemen who  accompanied his competitor    Nor did his apprehension vanish with the transaction of this day  the  town was again in uproar on the Sunday following  when it was known that  Mr  A   intended to come thither from Dunmain to church  they went  out to meet him as before  and conducted him to the church door with  acclamations  which terrified his uncle to such a degree  that he fled  with precipitation in a boat  and soon after entirely quitted the place    It would be almost an endless task to enumerate the particular steps  that were taken by one side to promote  and by the other to delay  the  trial  The young gentleman s adversaries finding that they could not  by  all the subterfuges and arts they had used  evade it  repeated attempts  were made to assassinate him and his protector  and every obstruction  thrown in the way of his cause which craft could invent  villainy  execute  and undue influence confirm  But all these difficulties were  surmounted by the vigilance  constancy  courage  and sagacity of M     and  at last  the affair was brought to a very solemn trial at bar   which being continued  by several adjournments  from the eleventh to the  twenty fifth day of November  a verdict was found for the claimant by a  jury of gentlemen  which  in point of reputation and property  cannot  be easily paralleled in the annals of that or any other country  a jury   that could by no means be suspected of prepossessions in favour of Mr   A    to whose person they were absolute strangers  especially if we  consider  that a gentleman in their neighbourhood  who was nephew to  the foreman  and nearly related to some of the rest of their number   forfeited a considerable estate by their decision    This verdict   said the parson   gave the highest satisfaction to all  impartial persons that were within reach of being duly informed of their  proceedings  and of the different genius and conduct of the parties  engaged in the contest  but more especially to such as were in court  as  I was  at the trial  and had an opportunity of observing the characters  and behaviour of the persons who appeared there to give evidence  To  such it was very apparent  that all the witnesses produced there on the  part of the uncle  were either his tenants  dependents  pot companions   or persons some way or other interested in the issue of the suit  and  remarkable for a low kind of cunning  that many of them were persons  of profligate lives  who deserved no credit  that  independent of  the levity of their characters  those of them who went under the  denomination of colonels  Colonel L   alone excepted  who had nothing to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   say  and was only brought there in order to give credit to
