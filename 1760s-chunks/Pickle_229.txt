me tenderly  and took my  leave of the family  a family which I shall always remember with love   honour  and esteem  His grace received me in the most affectionate  manner  saying at parting   Lady W    if he does not use you well  I  will take you back again      The bridegroom and I met at Ox   Chapel  where the ceremony was  performed by the bishop of W    in presence of his lordship s mother  my  father  and another lady  The nuptial knot being tied  we set out for  my father s house in the country  and proceeded full twenty miles on  our journey before my lord opened his mouth  my thoughts having been all  that time employed on something quite foreign to my present situation   for I was then but a giddy girl of eighteen  At length my father broke  silence  and clapping his lordship on the shoulder  told him he was but  a dull bridegroom  upon which my lord gave him to understand that he was  out of spirits  This dejection continued all the day  notwithstanding  the refreshment of a plentiful dinner which he ate upon the road  and  in the evening we arrived at the place of our destination  where we were  kindly received by my mother  though she had no liking to the match   and  after supper  we retired to our apartment    It was here that I had occasion to perceive the most disagreeable  contrast between my present helpmate and my former lord  Instead of  flying to my arms with all the eagerness of love and rapture  this manly  representative sat moping in a corner  like a criminal on execution day   and owned he was ashamed to bed with a woman whose hand he had scarce  ever touched    I could not help being affected with this pusillanimous behaviour  I  remembered Lord W    while I surveyed the object before me  and made  such a comparison as filled me with horror and disgust  nay  to such a  degree did my aversion to this phantom prevail  that I began to sweat  with anguish at the thought of being subjected to his pleasure  and  when  after a long hesitation  he ventured to approach me  I trembled  as if I had been exposed to the embraces of a rattlesnake  Nor did the  efforts of his love diminish this antipathy  His attempts were like  the pawings of an imp  sent from hell to seize and torment some guilty  wretch  such as are exhibited in some dramatic performance  which I have    6 22 15  3 45 PM   never seen acted without remembering my wedding night  By such shadowy   unsubstantial  vexatious behaviour was I tantalized  and robbed of my  repose  and early next morning I got up  with a most sovereign contempt  for my bedfellow  who indulged himself in bed till eleven    Having passed a few days in this place  I went home with him to his  house at Twickenham  and soon after we were presented at court  when the  queen was pleased to say to my lord s mother  she did not doubt that  we should be a happy couple  for I had been a good wife to my former  husband    Whatever deficiencies I had to complain of in my new spouse  he was  not wanting in point of liberality  I was presented with a very fine  chariot  studded with silver nails  and such a profusion of jewels as  furnished a joke to some of my acquaintance  who observed  that I  was formerly queen of hearts  but now metamorphosed into the queen of  diamonds  I now also had an opportunity  which I did not let slip  of  paying Lord W   s debts from my privy purse  and on that score received  the thanks of his elder brother  who  though he had undertaken to  discharge them  delayed the execution of his purpose longer than I  thought they should remain unpaid  This uncommon splendour attracted the  eyes and envy of my competitors  who were the more implacable in their  resentments  because  notwithstanding my marriage  I was as much as  ever followed by the men of gallantry and pleasure  among whom it is  a constant maxim  that a woman never withholds her affections from her  husband  without an intention to bestow them somewhere else  I never  appeared without a train of admirers  and my house in the country was  always crowded with gay young men of quality    Among those who cultivated my good graces with the greatest skill and  assiduity  were the Earl C   and Mr  S     brother to Lord F    The  former of whom  in the course of his addresses  treated me with an  entertainment of surprising magnificence  disposed into a dinner   supper  and ball  to which I  at his desire  invited eleven ladies  whom  he paired with the like number of his own sex
