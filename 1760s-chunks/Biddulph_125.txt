knew I was in the house  said Mr Arnold  by the blustering manner of his departure  I made no reply  but taking him under the arm  led him to my mother   That best of women received him with a tenderness that delighted me  he put one knee to the ground while she embraced him with maternal love  then raised him  and taking his hand and mine  joined them  holding them between her own  God bless you my children  said she  and may you never more be separated  till God  who joined you  calls one or other of you to himself  Amen  cried I fervently  Amen  repeated Mr Arnold   He then besought my mother to forgive him for all the affliction he had occasioned both to her and me  assuring her that his veneration for her  and his tenderness for me  were augmented a hundred fold  and should for the future influence his whole conduct   After this  we fell on the subject of our domestick affairs  we informed my mother of my lord V——’s proposal  and said  as we should stay in town but two or three days  we had accepted of the offer of being at his house  rather than by our presence banish my brother from her’s   He is an untractable man  said she  but as I do not wish to quarrel    with my children  I think it will be prudent for you to stay at my lord’s rather than here  Mr Arnold said his obligations to lord V—— were unspeakable  for that he had promised not only to see all our affairs properly settled  but to take the mortgage of South Park into his own hands  as he fears the person who now has it will not be so tender a creditor as himself  He also proposes  as the sale of my effects cannot amount to what my debts come to  to pay what may be deficient  and make himself my sole creditor  If it had not been for such a prospect as this  added my dear Mr Arnold  notwithstanding your goodness and lady Bidulph’s  I had resolved never to have appeared before either of you   We determined to set out for Sidney castle in three or four days at farthest  and took leave of my mother for this night   December 21  I told lady V—— this morning  that though I was determined never to mention our past misfortune to Mr Arnold  yet I owned I had a great curiosity to know what means Mrs Gerrarde had made use of  to work up his suspicions to the high pitch she had done  but I would rather remain unsatisfied  than mortify him by the recollection of this particular   I can inform you of her whole proceedings  answered lady V——  as I had it from Mr Arnold himself  for to tell you the truth  I was as curious about that as you  and took the liberty to ask your husband concerning it yesterday  when we had him to ourselves  It was the interval between dinner  and the hour that you were expected here in the evening  that I laid hold of for this purpose  as I found him then composed enough to bear the enquiry   He told me  that from the time of his going down to South Park  Mrs Gerrarde had begun to throw out insinuations concerning you  that had a little alarmed him  She asked him  Whether you made a good wife  which he answering in the affirmative  she replied  she was glad of it  for that she had been told your affections were formerly deeply engaged to a very fine young gentleman  who  as his fortune was very much above your expectations  your mother  fearing your violent fondness for him might lead you into some act of indiscretion  had carried you out of town on purpose to avoid him  and was glad to marry you as hastily as she could  to put you out of the reach of harm   Your husband acknowleges  that he believes he had himself casually informed Mrs Gerrarde of the manner of his first becoming    acquainted with you  and the suddenness with which his marriage was concluded  yet she pretended to him  she was before apprized of these particulars   He owns that those hints  though far from giving him any suspicion of your virtue  had nevertheless made some impression on him  You know  Madam  added he  that  madly devoted as my affections were to Mrs Gerrarde  I had always behaved to my wife with great tenderness and respect  This I suppose it was which raised Mrs Gerrarde’s jealousy  and made her leave no method unattempted to part us  Mr Faulkland had not been long at V—— hall  when she asked me  with uncommon earnestness  whether he visited at my house  I told her he did not  and asked the meaning of her enquiry  She affected to turn it off  and said  she had no particular reason for her question  but her manner was such  as the more excited my curiosity  At length she was prevailed on to tell me  that Mr Faulkland was the man  for she had not yet named the person   whom my wife had so passionately
