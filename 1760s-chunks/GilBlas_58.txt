masquerading marshalmen  They were three servants and two journeymen barbers of his acquaintance  whom he had engaged to act this farce  I ordered wine to be served round to the detachment  and we all went together at night fall to Camilla s residence  The door was shut  and we knocked  The old woman  taking my companions to be on the scent of justice  and knowing they would not come into that neighbourhood for nothing  was terribly frightened  Cheer up again  good mother  said Fabricio  we are only come here upon a little business which will be soon settled  At these words we made our entry  and found our way to the sick chamber  under the guidance of the old dowager who walked before us  and by favour of a wax taper which she carried in a silver candlestick  I took the light  went to the bed side  and  making Camilla take particular notice of my features  Traitress  said I  call to mind the too credulous Gil Blas whom you have deceived Ah  thou wickedness personified  at last I have caught thee  The corregidor has taken down my deposition  and ordered this alguazil to arrest you  Come  officer  said I to Fabricio  do your duty  There is no need  replied he  swelling his voice  to inflame my severity  The face of that wretch is not new to me  she has long been marked with red letters in my pocket book  Get up  my princess  dress your royal person with all possible dispatch  I will be your squire  and lodge you in durance vile  if you have no objection   At these words  Camilla  ill as she was  observing two marshalmen with large whiskers ready to drag her out of bed by main force  sat up of herself  clasped her hands in an attitude of supplication  and looking at me ruefully  said  Signor Gil Blas  have compassion on me  I call as a witness to my entreaties the chaste mother whose virtues you inherit  Guilty as I am  my misfortunes are greater than my crimes  I will give you back your diamond  so do not be my ruin  Speaking to this effect  she drew my ring from her finger  and gave it me back  But I told her my diamond was not enough  and that she must refund the thousand ducats they had embezzled in the ready furnished lodging  Oh  as for your ducats  replied she  ask me not about them  That false  hearted deceiver  Don Raphael  whom I have not seen from that time to this  carried them off the very same night  O ho  my little darling  said Fabricio in his turn  that will not do  you had a hand in the robbery  whether you went snacks in the profit or no  You will not come off so cheaply  Your having been accessory to Don Raphael s manoeuvres is enough to render you liable to an examination  Your past life is very equivocal  and you must have a good deal upon your conscience  You will have the goodness  if you please  just to step into the town jail  and there unburden yourself by a general confession  This good old lady shall keep you company  it is hard if she cannot tell a world of curious stories  such as Mr Corregidor will be delighted to hear   The two women  at these words  brought every engine of pity into play to soften us  They filled the air with cries  complaints  and lamentations  While the old woman on her knees  sometimes to the alguazil and sometimes to his attendants  endeavoured  to melt their stubborn hearts  Camilla implored me  in the most touching terms  to save her from the hands of justice  I pretended to relent  Officer  said I to the son of Nunez  since I have got my diamond  I do not much care about anything else  It would be no pleasure to me to be the means of pain to that poor woman  I want not the death of a sinner  Out upon you  answered he  you set up for humanity  you would make a bad tipstaff  I must do my errand  My positive orders are to arrest these virgins of the sun  his honour the corregidor means to make an example of them  Nay  for mercy s sake  replied I  pay some little deference to my wishes  and slacken a little of your severity  on the ground of the present these ladies are on the point of offering to your acceptance  Oh  that is another matter  rejoined he  that is what you may call a figure of rhetoric suited to all capacities and all occasions  Well  then  let us see  what have they to give me  I have a pearl necklace  said Camilla  and drop ear rings of considerable value  Yes  but  interrupted he roughly  if these articles are the produce of the Philippine Isles  I will have none of them  You may take them in perfect safety  replied she  I warrant them real  At the same time she made the old woman bring a little box  whence she took out the necklace and ear
