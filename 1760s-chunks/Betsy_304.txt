All mere pretence   cried he    tis true  there was some talk of such a   thing  but she has inclinations of a different sort   To which Mrs    Munden replied  that inclinations  though ever so corrupt  might be   reformed by reason  adversity  and experience  that she hoped her   penitence was sincere  and what before her was her aversion  was now   become her choice  She then urged the request she came upon  in terms so   moving and pathetick  that Mr  Thoughtless  irritated as he was  could   not withstand the energy of her words  he told her he would consider on   what she had said  and give his answer the next day  but  in the mean   time  desired she would advise her unworthy guest to send for her   baggage immediately  saying  he would have nothing in his house that   should remind him of her       Mrs  Munden  pretty well satisfied with having obtained thus much  took   her leave  and returned to Mademoiselle de Roquelair  with an account of   what she had done                CHAPTER XVIII       Contains a most shocking instance of infidelity and ingratitude          Mademoiselle de Roquelair  on finding how far the good nature of Mrs    Munden had made her interest herself in her behalf  expressed the   transports of her gratitude in terms which gave some pain to the modesty   of that lady to receive   What I have done   said she   is to promote   the cause of virtue  and I hope my endeavours that way will not be lost   on your account     You are all goodness   replied the other   but I   blush to think that  being already indebted for so many favours  I must   still become your petitioner for more  though I have lived fifteen   months in this town  I am a perfect stranger to the greatest part of it    quite unacquainted with it s customs  and know not where  and in what   manner  to address myself for lodgings  In the midst of my distractions    I found shelter under your hospitable roof  may I presume to flatter   myself with the continuance of that charitable protection  till I   receive an answer from Mr  Thoughtless        Mrs  Munden paused a little at this request  but  thinking it would be   cruel in this distress to have recourse to strangers  and to whom she   could communicate nothing of her mind  made this reply  Though it would   be highly inconvenient  Madam   said she   for you to remain in my house   for any length of time  yet as  in all probability  your affairs will be   determined in a few days  I would not have you think of leaving me till   you are prepared to leave the kingdom  Please  therefore   continued   she   to make an inventory of what things you have at my brother s  and   I will give orders for their being brought directly hither        Mademoiselle de Roquelair was beginning to give some fresh testimonies   of the sense she had of this last obligation  but Mrs  Munden would not   suffer her to proceed  and  pointing to a standish that stood on the   table  desired her to write the memorandums she had mentioned     Obedience  Madam  is better than sacrifice   said the other  and   immediately did as she was directed  after which Mrs  Munden went down   to give the orders she had promised       She sent this inventory by her own man  and instructed him to procure   persons for bringing thither every thing belonging to Mademoiselle de   Roquelair  but as this could not be done  and that lady dressed  before   the hour of dinner  which was just at hand  she judged it improper she   should appear at table till she could do so with greater decency  she   therefore bid one of the maids prepare something apart  and serve it up   to her in her own chamber       She then began to consider what she should say to Mr  Munden in relation   to this affair  she knew not but he might already be apprized of what   had passed  or if even he were not so  she thought it would be   impossible to keep her in the house without his privity  so resolved to   be quite open in the affair       She was right in her conjecture  Mademoiselle de Roquelair had happened   to ring the bell for something she wanted  Mr  Munden hearing it  and   knowing his wife
