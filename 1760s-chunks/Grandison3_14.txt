me   I saw the chariot from the window  and  without asking any questions  I hurried Miss Emily down stairs  and conducted the trembling dear into it  and whipping in after her  ordered the coachman to drive any where  except towards London  And then the poor girl threw her arms about my neck  smothering me with her kisses  and calling me by all the tender names that terror and mingled gratitude could suggest to her   Miss Grandison told the circumstances pretty near as above  adding  I think  my Lord  that Miss Emily wants not apology for her terror on this occasion  That Lady  in her own heart  knows that the poor girl has reason for it   Madam  said the Major  my wife is cruelly used  Your brother—But I shall talk to him upon the subect  He is said to be a man of conscience and honour  I hope I shall find him so  I know how to protect and right my wife     34 And I will stand by my broder and his lady  said the Captain  to de very last drop of my blood —He looked fierce  and put his hand on his sword   Lord L  You don t by these airs mean to insult me  gentlemen—If you do—  Major  No  no  my Lord  But we must seek our remedy elsewhere  Surprising  that a mother is denied the sight of her daughter  Very surprising   Capt  Very surprising  indeed —Ver dis to be done in my country—In France—English liberty  Begar ver pretty liberty —A daughter to be supported against her moder—Whew  Ver pretty liberty  by my salvation —  Mrs  O Hara  And is indeed my vile child run away to avoid seeing her mother —Strange  Does she always intend to do thus —She must see me—And dearly shall she repent it   And she looked fierce  and particularly spiteful  and then declared  that she would stay there till Emily came back  were it midnight   Lord L  You will have my leave for that  madam   Major  Had we not best go into our coach  and let that drive in quest of her —She cannot be far off  It will be easy to trace a chariot   Lord L  Since this matter is carried so far  let me tell you  that  in the absence of her guardian  I will protect her  Since Miss Jervois is thus averse  she shall be indulged in it  If you see her  madam  it must be by the consent  and in the presence  of her guardian   Major  Well  my dear  since the matter stands thus  since your child is taught to shun you thus  let us see what Sir Charles Grandison will say to it  He is the principal in this affair  and is not privileged  If he thinks fit—And there he stopped  and blustered  and offered his hand to his bride —I am able both to protect and right you  madam  and I will  But you have a letter for the girl  written on a supposition that   35 she was not here —Little did you think  or I think  that she was in the house when we came  and that she should be spirited away to avoid paying her duty to her mother   Very true  Very true  And  Very true  said each  and Mrs  O Hara pulled out the letter  laying it on one of the chairs  and desired it might be given to her daughter  And then they all went away  very much dissatisfied  the two men muttering and threatning  and resolving  as they said  to make a visit to Sir Charles   I hope we shall see him here very soon  I hope these wretches will not insult him  or endanger a life so precious  Poor Emily  I pity her from my heart  She is as much grieved on this occasion  as I was  in dread of the resentment of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen   Let me give you some account of what passed between Emily and me  You will be charmed with her beautiful simplicity   When we were in the chariot  she told me  that the last time she saw her mother  it was at Mrs  Lane s  The bad woman made a pretence of private business with her daughter  and withdrew with her into another room  and then insisted that she should go off with her  unknown to any body  And because I desired to be excused  said she  my mother laid her hands upon me  and said she would trample me under her foot  It is true   unhappy woman   she was— Then the dear girl whispered me  tho  no body was near us—sweet modest creature  loth to reveal this part of her mother s shame even to me aloud  and blushed as she spoke—  she was in her cups —My mamma is as naughty as some men in that respect  And I believe she would have been as good as her word  but on my screaming  for I was very much frighted  Mrs  Lane  who had an eye upon us  ran in
