the  sum in a very few months   In a little time after this transaction  writs being issued out for  electing a new parliament  our adventurer  by the advice of his patron   went into the country  in order to canvass for a borough  and lined his  pockets with a competent share of banknotes for the occasion  But in  this project he unfortunately happened to interfere with the interest of  a great family in the opposition  who  for a long series of years   had made members for that place  and were now so much offended at the  intrusion of our young gentleman  that they threatened to spend ten    6 22 15  3 45 PM   thousand pounds in frustrating his design  This menace was no other than  an incitement to Peregrine  who confided so much in his own influence  and address  that he verily believed he should be able to baffle  his grace  even in his own territories  By that victory he hoped to  establish his reputation and interest with the minister  who  through  the recommendation of his noble friend  countenanced his cause  and  would have been very well pleased to see one of his great enemies suffer  such a disgraceful overthrow  which would have  moreover  in a great  measure  shaken his credit with his faction   Our hero  intoxicated with the ideas of pride and ambition  put all  his talents to the test  in the execution of this project  He spared no  expense in treating the electors  but  finding himself rivalled in this  respect by his competitor  who was powerfully supported  he had recourse  to those qualifications in which he thought himself superior  He made  balls for the ladies  visited the matrons of the corporation  adapted  himself to their various humours with surprising facility  drank with  those who loved a cherishing cup in private  made love to the amorous   prayed with the religious  gossiped with those who delighted in scandal   and with great sagacity contrived agreeable presents to them all  This  was the most effectual method of engaging such electors as were under  the influence of their wives  As for the rest  he assailed them in  their own way  setting whole hogsheads of beer and wine abroach  for the  benefit of comers  and into those sordid hearts that liquor would not  open  he found means to convey himself by the help of a golden key   While he thus exerted himself  his antagonist was not idle  his age and  infirmities would not permit him to enter personally into their parties   but his stewards and adherents bestirred themselves with great industry  and perseverance  The market for votes ran so high  that Pickle s ready  money was exhausted before the day of election  and he was obliged to  write to his patron an account of the dilemma to which he was reduced   entreating him to take such speedy measures as would enable him to  finish the business which he had so happily begun  This nobleman  communicated the circumstances of the case to the minister  and in a  day or two our candidate found credit with the receiver general of the  county  who lent him twelve hundred pounds on his personal note   payable on demand  By means of this new supply he managed matters so  successfully  that an evident majority of votes was secured in his  interest  and nothing could have obstructed his election  had not the  noble peer who set up his competitor  in order to avoid the shame and  mortification of being foiled in his own borough  offered to compromise  the affair with his honour  by giving up two members in another place   provided the opposition should cease in his own corporation  This  proposal was greedily embraced  On the eve of the election  Peregrine  received an intimation from his patron  desiring him to quit his  pretensions  on pain of his and the minister s displeasure  and  promising that he should be elected for another place   No other disappointment in life could have given him such chagrin as  he felt at the receipt of this tantalizing order  by which the cup of  success was snatched from his lip  and all the vanity of his ambitious  hope humbled in the dust  He cursed the whole chain of his court  connections  inveighed with great animosity against the rascally scheme  of politics to which he was sacrificed  and  in conclusion  swore he  would not give up the fruits of his own address for the pleasure of any  minister upon earth  This laudable resolution  however  was rendered    6 22 15  3 45 PM   ineffectual by his friend the receiver general  who was bearer of  the message  and  after having in vain endeavoured to persuade him  to submission  fairly arrested him upon the spot for the money he had  advanced  this expedient being performed by virtue of a writ which  he had been advised to take out  in case the young man should prove  refractory   The reader  who by this time must be pretty well acquainted
