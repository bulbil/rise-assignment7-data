and conditional powers    such as of instituting fairs and markets  and of issuing patents   for special or personal purposes  provided they shall not be found   to infringe on the rights of others  He is also intrusted with the   guardianship of the persons and possessions of idiots and lunatics    without account      I leave his majesty s prerogative of a negative voice in the   legislature  as also his prerogative  or rather duty  frequently   to call the two other estates to parliament  and duly to continue    prorogue  and dissolve the same  till I come to speak of the three   estates when in such parliament assembled      Here then we find  that a King of Great Britain is constitu    tionally invested with every power that can possibly be exerted in   acts of beneficence   and that  while he continues to move within   the sphere of his benign appointment  he continues to be constituted   the most worthy  most mighty  and most glorious representative   of Omnipotence upon earth      In treating of the second and third estate  I come naturally to   consider what those restraints are  which  while they are preserved   inviolate  have so happy a tendency to the mutual prosperity of   prince and people          or     THE nobility  or second estate in the constitution of Great   Britain  is originally representative  The members were ennobled   by tenure  and not by writ or patent   and they were holden in   service to the crown and kingdom for the respective provinces    counties  or baronies  whose name they bore  and which they   represented      A title to be a member of this second estate was from the   beginning hereditary   the king could not anciently either create   or defeat a title to nobility  Their titles were not forfeitable save   by the judgments of their peers upon legal trial   and when any   were so deprived  or happened to die without heirs  the succession   was deemed too important to be otherwise filled than by the   concurrence of the three estates  by the joint and solemn act of the   Parliament  or Commune Concilium Regni          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  277     These truths are attested by many ancient records and parlia    mentary acts  And although this most highly ennobling  custom   was  at particular times  infringed by particular tyrants  it was   inviolably adhered to by the best of our English kings  and was   observed even by the worst  excepting a few instances  till the reign   of Henry VII   who wished to give consequence to the third estate   by deducting from the honours and powers of the second      In truth  it is not to be wondered that any kings  who were   ambitious of extending their own power  should wish to break and   weaken that of the nobility  who had distinguished themselves by   so many glorious stands for the maintenance of liberty and the con    stitution   more particularly during the reigns of John  Henry III     the second Edward  and second Kichard      Till Harry VII  the nobles were looked upon as so many pillars   whereon the people rested their rights  Accordingly we find that    in the coalition or grand compact between John and the collective   body of the nation  the king and people jointly agree to confide to   the nobles the superintendence of the execution of the great   charter  with authority to them and their successors to enforce the   due performance of the covenants therein comprised       What an illustrating distinction must it have been  when patriot    excellence alone  approved before the country in the field or the   council  could give a claim to nobility  and compel  as it were  the   united estates of king  lords  and commons  to call a man up to a   second seat in the government and steerage of the nation      Such a preference must have proved an unremitting incitement   to the cultivation and exercise of every virtue  and to such   exertions  achievements  and acts of public beneficence  as should   draw a man forth to so shining a point of light  and set him like   a gem in the gold of the constitution      The crown did not  at once  assume the independent right of   conferring nobility  Henry III  first omitted to call some of the   barons to parliament who were personally obnoxious to him  and   he issued his writs or written letters to some others who were not   barons  but from whom he expected greater conformity to arbitrary   measures
