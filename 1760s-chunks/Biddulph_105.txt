the letter to Mr Arnold  Pivet did not at all disrelish the proposal  he had not been blind to Mrs Gerrarde’s charms  he only seemed surprized at my being willing to part with her so soon  for he had not the least conception of my reasons for carrying her off  and very naturally concluded I was deeply engaged in an amour  It was not difficult to guess his thoughts on this occasion   Pivet  said I  I must premise one thing to you  I assure you there is not  nor ever was  any intrigue between Mrs Gerrarde and me  I do not  however  pretend to vouch for her chastity  It was no secret at V—— hall that she had occasioned an unhappy breach in Mr Arnold’s    family  and that  and that only  as I have a most particular value and affection for that family   was my motive to the carrying this lady away  As I hope the disunion  now the cause of it is removed  will no longer subsist  I find it necessary to provide for Mrs Gerrarde some way or other  A good husband I would wish to bestow on her  I do not yet know whether I shall be able to bring her into any measures  but if she should be prevailed on to accept of you  and I should make it worth your while to accept of her  can you overlook the levity she has been guilty of  and resolve to use her kindly   He promised he would make the best husband in the universe  I bid him not be too sure of success  as I did not yet know Mrs Gerrarde’s mind  and feared I should find it hard to bring her into terms  adding  that though I intended to threaten her  I should be very unwilling to make use of compulsion  but if she should happen to like him  without suspecting my design  I might accomplish my purpose with less reluctance on her side  and much more satisfaction to myself   The conversation he had just had with her elated him highly  she had made him her confidant  she had implored his assistance  she had promised an unbounded gratitude  she had prohibited my visits  and invited his  All this facilitated my work  and I at one time thought of letting her e’en work out her fate  and run blindfold into my trap  for it is plain  if Pivet had given in to it  she would have marched off with him  and even married him  to get out of my clutches  and then  you know  she could have blamed nobody but herself for the consequences  But I resolved not to impose on the gypsey any farther  but let her know what she was to expect before the bargain was concluded  and at least give her her option of having the power of continuing a jilt  or being canonized for a saint   I found things were now likely to take such a turn as I wished  but it still required management  Pivet  said I  you must let her see you no more to day  it will make her prize your company the more  keep out of the way  that you may not be seen by Rachael  and give such orders in the house  as that there may be proper attendance for the lady  One of my footmen spoke a little French  and he had been directed to receive and communicate Mrs Rachael’s orders in the family   Tho’ Pivet assured me that he thought Mrs Gerrarde was not so ill as she said she was  I yet thought it incumbent on me to have the advice of a physician  The people with whom I lodged said I could    not have a better than the doctor who had attended me  as he was reckoned very skilful  I told them  in the present case  I believed honesty was more requisite than skill  They said he was very honest too  so I desired he might be sent for   Mrs Gerrarde  being determined to carry on the farce of sickness  pretended she was not able to rise  and the doctor was introduced to her bedside  As he could neither understand his patient  nor make himself understood by her  I had ordered the footman  whom I mentioned to you before  as knowing a little French  to wait at the chamber door  for I was resolved so far to keep up my resentment and my importance  as not to vouch safe assisting at the conference  which  by this means  became the most ridiculous scene you can imagine  The doctor  having felt Mrs Gerrarde’s pulse  proposed his questions by the footman  who just peeped his nose in at the door  He explained them  very ill I suppose  to Rachael in English  who re repeated them to her lady within her curtains  for she would not suffer them to be drawn back  Mrs Gerrarde’s answers travelled the same round about way back to the doctor  who got them mangled in very bad French from his interpreter   Mrs Gerrarde  provoked  I believe  at the doctor’s visit  and very much tired of his questions  asked peevishly where Monsieur Pivet was  This inquiry I expected  and the fellow who told
