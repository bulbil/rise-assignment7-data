 My lady presently called for tea  and we chatted as if nothing had happened  The servants waiting in the room made this necessary  though I could observe the two footmen  who had lived a good while with Lord V——  looked with no small astonishment at Mr Arnold and me   When the servants were withdrawn  my lady introduced the subject of our going out of town  She had before acquainted him with my mother’s proposal  and I repeated what she had said to me on that head  after lady V—— had left us  My lord renewed the kind offers of his friendship  and said  as we meant so shortly to part with our house in St James’s street  that he thought it would be better for us    not to go into it at all  but make use of his house while we staid in town  as perhaps Mr Arnold might not like to be at lady Bidulph’s  on account of Sir George coming there   I readily assented to this proposal  and Mr Arnold said it would be most agreeable to him  I told him  however  I should be glad of my mother’s approbation  and asked Mr Arnold if he did not think it would be right of us both to wait on her together  to let her know of my lord’s kind invitation  My lady V—— said  by all means  and the sooner the better  if you please  I will order you the chariot  I would have you see lady Bidulph directly  Mr Arnold said  it was what he purposed doing that very night   The chariot was presently at the door  lady V—— said  I have an apartment ready  and shall  with lady Bidulph’s permission  expect you back to night  We promised to return  and drove to my mother’s   I left Mr Arnold in the parlour  whilst I ran up stairs to inform her of his being come to wait on her   Unluckily  as well as unexpectedly  I found my brother with her  I judged by his voice  as I came up stairs  that he was talking warmly to my mother  he stopped  however  when I came into the room  He was standing  and had his hat under his arm  I concluded he was going  and was not sorry for it  he cast a cold look at me  and  with an ironical smile  I wish you joy Mrs Arnold  and he pronounced my name with an emphasis  Tho’ I was stung at his manner  I would not let him see it  Thank you brother  said I  God be praised I have cause to rejoice  Oh  no doubt on’t  said he  so have we all  that your husband has been graciously pleased  after beggaring you and your children  turning you out of doors  and branding you with infamy  to receive you at last into his favour   Sir George  said I  you shock me exceedingly  where is the need of those cruel repetitions  Indeed you are very unkind  and I could not refrain from tears   The more blameable Mr Arnold’s conduct has been  said my mother  the more cause have we to rejoice in his amendment  We must make allowances for human failings   Ay  madam  I wish you had thought of that in Mr Faulkland’s case  cried my brother   My mother seemed disconcerted at the rebuke  Sir George looked and smiled  with an air of ill natured triumph  As my mother was not quick in answering  I replied  the cases are very different  brother  what duty obliges us to pass by in a husband  it is hardly moral not to    discountenance in another man   You say true  child  said my mother  a woman certainly ought not to marry a loose man  if she knows him to be such  but if it be her misfortune to be joined to such a one  she is not to reject him  but more especially if she sees him willing to reform  Where is your husband my dear  Madam  he is below in the parlour  he is come to receive your forgiveness  and your blessing  He shall have both  said my good mother  and my prayers too  Sir George looked a little surprized  I will not interrupt so pious a ceremony  said he  but I hope you will give me leave to withdraw before you desire him up stairs  saying this  he bowed slightly to my mother  and left the room  we neither of us said any thing to stop him  my mother rang the bell  but before a servant could attend  he went out  and clapped the door violently after him   Go bring your husband up to me  said my mother  I begged she would not mention any thing of Sir George’s behaviour  I found Mr Arnold impatient at my stay  Poor man  his situation made him jealous of every thing that looked like a slight  I told him  my brother had been above stairs  and as I did not think a meeting would at that time have been agreeable to either of them  I waited till he was gone  I perceive he
