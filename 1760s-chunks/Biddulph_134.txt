fortune  The honest youth  who has ever since his father’s death supported his mother  and as many of the younger children as were not able to gain their own livelihood  has now invited his sister Patty to live with him  but the faithful girl declined the offer  telling her bother  she would never quit me  while I thought her worthy of my regard   I look upon myself to be much obliged to her for this  as the station she is now in  cannot be so advantageous as I hoped to make it  when I first took her into my service  but I will make up in kindness what may be wanting in profit  Indeed I consider her rather as a friend than a servant  and Mr Arnold always treats her with respect   March 20  I am very uneasy at not having it in my power to fulfil my promise to poor Miss Burchell  but that is a string I dare not as yet touch upon  Indeed I cannot bear any conversation that leads to the subject  Whenever Mr Arnold begins to accuse himself for his unhappy conduct  in relation to Mrs Gerrarde  which he often does  I always stop him  or turn the discourse to something else  He never speaks of her now  but with a contemptuous indifference  and is so firmly persuaded that she went off willingly with Mr Faulkland  that I dare not as yet undeceive him  which I must necessarily do  should I express even a wish that Mr Faulkland should repair the niece’s wrongs by marriage  Mr Arnold knows nothing of miss Burchell’s affair  I went once so far as to say I had heard Mr Faulkland formerly liked this young lady  Mr Arnold answered  I am glad it went no farther than liking  if it had  probably I should not have been so soon    delivered from my thraldom to her aunt  This reply silenced me  I am exceedingly perplexed about it  Would to Heaven Mr Faulkland would of himself think of doing the amiable unhappy girl justice My mother writes me word  that Sir George had informed Mr Faulkland  by letter  of the success of his project  and that his answer was full of congratulations  and expressions of joy  He is now in Italy  but talks of returning to England next summer  He says  he hears sometimes from Pivet  and that he and his wife live very well together   My mother says she often sees Miss Burchell  and that she encourages her with the hope of what may happen when Mr Faulkland comes back  If this match should ever take place  it would give me most sincere satisfaction  The girl’s family is not contemptible  her fortune is pretty large  her person lovely  the unfortunate false step she made  is an entire secret  except to the persons immediately concerned  so that with regard to the world  her character too is good  Mrs Gerrarde  at worst  was only her aunt by marriage  but if that circumstance should be the only rub in her way to happiness  I would sooner declare the whole affair  and run the risk of Mr Arnold’s being let into this ticklish secret  than be a hindrance to the poor young creature’s welfare  This affair never comes a cross me  but it makes me sigh  God send a favourable issue to it   March 26  Alas  my Cecilia  we have received most heavy news  My good lord V——  that stedfast  that worthy  that best of friends  is no more  He was preparing to go to V—— hall  three days ago  but was seized with an apoplexy  as he was coming down stairs to go into his coach  and died before any assistance could reach him  Oh  we have a severe loss in the death of this most dear and valuable man —but why do I mention our loss —his lady—poor lady V—— is almost distracted—and well she may—the best of husbands  fathers  every thing  His eldest son  who is abroad  is sent for home on this melancholy occasion—My poor mother is afflicted exceedingly  every body that knew him must be so  Mr Arnold and I have lost more than a father  How self recurs every minute  let me think of lady V—— again  and not dare to complain on my own account  but my obligations to him were of such a nature  as claim all my gratitude to his memory  and all the tears that I have abundantly shed for him     Mr Arnold is largely in his debt  we have no room to expect the same friendship from the present lord V——  that we experienced from his father   This circumstance did not occur to me till poor Mr Arnold put me in the mind of it  my thoughts were too much absorbed in grief  which the death alone of our friend occasioned  My mother hinted at it too  in her letter to Mr Arnold  for it was to him she wrote the mournful tidings   What a dark cloud of sorrow is spread over Sidney castle  and how this stroke has imbittered our little domestic joys  But let me not carry my complainings into presumptuous murmurings  I have lost a sincere and truly valued friend  but do I not still
