on the mistaken   supposition of her being influenced in favour of monsieur de Coigney  he   had no sooner left Horatio than he flew to her apartment  and reproached   her in terms the most severe that words could form   It was in vain she   protested that she never had any design of giving herself to Horatio   without having first received his permission   He looked on all she said   as an augmentation of her crime  and soon came to a determination to put   it past her power to give him more than she had already done       Early next morning he sent her  under the conduct of a person he could   confide in  to a monastry about thirty miles from Paris  without even   letting her know whither she was about being carried  or giving her the   least notice of her departure till the coach was at the door  into which   he put  her himself with these words   adeiu Charlotta  expect not to   see Paris  or me again  till you desire no more to see Horatio             CHAP  X        The reasons that induced Horatio to leave France  with the chevalier   St  George s behaviour on knowing his resolution  He receives an   unexpected favour from the baron de Palfoy        While Charlotta  under the displeasure of her father  and divided  as   she believed  for ever from her lover  was pursuing her melancholy   journey  Horatio was giving way to a grief which knew no bounds  and   which preyed with the greater feirceness on his soul  as he had no   friend to whom he could disburden it  The baron s estrang d behaviour   was no small addition to his other discontents  and he lamented the   cruel necessity which had enforced him to disoblige a person to whom he   owed so many favours  and whose advice would now have been the greatest   consolation       He could not now hope Charlotta would be permitted to come to St    Germains  and doubted not but her father would take effectual methods to   prevent her visiting at any place where even accident might occasion a   meeting between them  he knew the watch had been set over her on the   account of monsieur de Coigney  and might be assured it would not now be   less strict  and that it would be equally impossible for either to   communicate their thoughts by writing as it was to see each other       He was in the midst of these reflections when he heard  by some people   who were acquainted with the baron de Palfoy  that he had sent his   daughter away  but none knew where  this  instead of lessening his   despair  was a very great aggravation of it   he imagined she was   confined in some monastry  and was not insensible of the difficulties   that attend seeing a young lady who is sent there purposely to avoid the   world  yet  said he to himself  could I be happy enough to discover even   to what province she was carried  I would go from convent to convent   till I had found which of them contained her       It was in vain that he made all possible enquiry  every one he asked was   in reality as ignorant as himself   The baron de Palfoy had trusted   none  so could not be deceived but by those persons who had the charge   of conducting her  and of their fidelity he had many proofs  Yet how   impossible is it for human prudence to resist the decrees of fate   The   secret was betrayed  without any one being guilty of accusing the   confidence reposed in them  and by the strangest accident that perhaps   ever was  Horatio learned all he wished to know when he had given over   all his endeavours for that purpose  and was totally despairing of it       He came one day to Paris  in order to alleviate his melancholy  in the   company of some young gentlemen  who had expressed a very great regard   for him  but his mind being taken up with various and perplexed thoughts   on his entrance into that city  he mistook his way  and turned into the   rue St  Dennis instead of the rue St  Honore  where he had been   accustomed to leave his horses and servant   He found his error just as   he was passing by a large inn  and it being a matter of indifference to   him where he put up  would not turn back  but ordered his man to alight   here   I forgot where I was going  said he  but I suppose the horses   will be taken as much care of at this house as where we used to go
