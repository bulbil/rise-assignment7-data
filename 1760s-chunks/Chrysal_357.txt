determined her to change her system  and make sure   of something for fear of the worst  Accordingly  the next time   her lover visited her  on his repeating his professions of the violence   of his passion  and offering  as a proof of his disinterestedness  to   enter into a mutual engagement of marriage  as soon as the suit   should be ended one way or other  under the penalty of a large   sum of money on the refuser  she let herself be overcome by such   an instance of sincerity  and  taking him at his word  signed the   engagement directly  The event justiiied this caution   for  after   all the assurances of success by which she had been led on by her   lawyers to run into every expense they could devise  justice appeared   so strongly in favour of her opponents  that she was cast   and a   considerable part of the estate of her husband adjudged to return   directly to his family  and the rest after her death      Though what remained to her was more than sufficient to   support her in the genteelest manner  she could not but feel at first   a fall from such high hopes   but her spirit had been too well exer    cised in the beginning of her life to yield long to anjrthing  and she   had  almost got the better of it  when something that piqued her   resentment roused her effectually  Among all the friends who   came on this occasion to gratify the insolence of condoling her   inisfortune  she was not a Uttle surprised never to see the face of   her lover  As she could not be at a loss for the mean motive of   such behaviour  she might possibly have treated it with the contempt   it deserved  had not necessity urged her to show a warmer resent    ment      The expenses of her lawsuit had involved her in debts â€” for she   never lowered her living  depending on the assurances given her of   successâ€” which were now demanded with an importunity that per    plexed her  This was just at the time when she took notice of the   desertion of her lover  The urgency of her creditors  therefore    suggested it to her to call upon him to fulfil his engagement of         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 429      marriage   whicla his conduct convinced her he would forfeit the   penalty rather than do  by which means she should punish him for   his rashness  and extricate herself from her difficulties at the same   time   for  had she thought that he would fuliil it  there was nothing   that she would not have suffered  sooner than link her fate to him    There was something in a woman s calling upon a man to marry   her so contrary to those notions of delicacy  on which the superior   class of the female sex value themselves  that  perhaps  no other   woman of her rank could have prevailed on herself to do it  But   she had not been bom in  nor bred up with expectations of that   rank   her notions  therefore  were of a coarser complexion   and    though she had learned the external modes of behaviour â€” the   trick of complaisance â€” she had been put to school too late in life   to change her sentiments so far as to make her think it necessary   to sacrifice such powerful motives as resentment and interest to a   delicacy that appeared to her merely fantastic  The moment    therefore  the thought occurred  she applied once more to her   lawyer   and by his advice wrote a letter to her lover  in which   she directly claimed the performance of his engagement  But    as this was no more than his heart had told him he must expect â€”   for he would have done the very same thing himself â€” he was pre    pared how to answer her  Accordingly  he wrote to her in the most   artful manner  excusing him of his not having been to wait upon her   since the fatal decision of her lawsuit  on account of the pain he   must feel at seeing her  when he had lost all hopes of ever calling   her his   for  as her generosity would not permit her to marry   while there was only a possibiUty of such a misfortune  he could   not suppose that her sense of honour and justice would now  when   it had actually happened   and for this reason he desired that she   would please to send him his engagement  not that it was of any   consequence  as he would return hers  to whom he wished the   highest happiness in every scene and view of life  Such a refusal   was just what she wanted
