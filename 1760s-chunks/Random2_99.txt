 by the same canal of communication  which was  that Mr  Marmozet  before he advised me to this application  had informed the Earl  that he had read my play  and found it altogether unfit for the stage —Though I could not doubt the certainty of this intelligence  I believed there was some misapprehension in the case  and without taking any notice of it  told Mr  Marmozet the answer I had been favoured with  upon which  he testified much joy  and promised to ask Mr  Vandal the question proposed —I   298 waited upon him in a day or two  when he gave me to understand  that Mr  Vandal having professed himself free of all engagements  he had put my play into his hands  and represented it as a piece strongly recommended by Earl Sheerwit  who  he assured him  would honour him with a message in its favour  and he desired me to call for an answer at Mr  Vandal s house  in three days —I followed his directions  and sound the manager  who  being made acquainted with my business  owned  that Mr  Marmozet had given him a manuscript play  but denied that he had mentioned Earl Sheerwit s name —When I informed him of the circumstances of the affair  he said  he had no engagement with any author  that he would read my tragedy forthwith  and did not believe he should venture to reject it in contradiction to his Lordship s opinion  for which he had the utmost veneration  but put it into rehearsal without loss of time —I was so much intoxicated with this encouragement  that I overlooked the mysterious conduct of Mr  Marmozet  and attended the manager at the time appointed  when  to my infinite confusion  he pronounced my play improper for the stage  and rejected it accordingly  As soon as I could recollect myself from the disorder into which this unexpected refusal had thrown me  I expressed a desire of hearing his objections  which were so groundless  indistinct and unintelligible  that I persuaded myself he had not at all perused the piece  but had been prompted by somebody whose lessons he had not rightly retained  However  I have been since informed  that the poor man s head  which was not naturally very clear  had been disordered with superstition  and that he laboured under the tyranny   299 of a wife  and the terrors of hell fire at the same time —Precipitated in this manner  from the highest pinnacle of hope  to the abyss of despondence  I was ready to sink under the burthen of my affliction  and in the bitterness of my anguish  could not help entertaining some doubts of Mr  Marmozet s integrity  when I recollected and compared the circumstances of his conduct towards me  I was encouraged in this suspicion  by being told  that my Lord Sheerwit had spoke of his character with great contempt  and in particular  resented his insolence in opposing his own taste to that of his Lordship  concerning my tragedy —While I hesitated between different opinions of the matter  that friend  who  as told you before  was a little hot headed  favoured me with a visit  and having heard a circumstantial account of the whole affair  could not contain his indignation  but affirmed without ceremony  that Marmozet was the sole occasion of my disappointment  that he had acted from first to last with the most perfidious dissimulation  cajoling with insinuating civilities  while he underhand employed all his art and influence to prejudice the ignorant manager against my performance  that nothing could equal his hypocrisy  but his avarice  which ingrossed the faculties of his soul so much  that he scrupled not to be guilty of the meanest practices to gratify that fordid appetite  that in consequence of this disposition  he had prostituted his honour in betraying my inexperience  and in undermining the interest of another author of established reputation  who had also offered a tragedy to the stage  which he thought would interfere with the success of the comedy he had bought  and determined to bring on at all events     300 I was shocked at the description of such a monster  which I could not believe existed in the world  bad as it is  and argued against the asseverations of my friend  by demonstrating the bad policy of such behaviour  which could not fail of entailing infamy upon the author  and the small temptation that a man of Mr  Marmozet s figure and success  could have to consult his interest in such a groveling manner  which must create contempt and abhorrence of him in his patrons  and effectually deprive him of the countenance and protection he now enjoys in such an eminent degree —He pretended to laugh at my simplicity  and asked if I knew for which of his virtues he was so much caressed by the people of fashion —   It is not  said he  for the qualities of his heart  that this little parasite is invited to the tables of Dukes and Lords  who hire extraordinary cooks for his entertainment  His avarice they see not  his ingratitude they feel not  his hypocrisy accommodates itself to their humours  and is of consequence pleasing  but he is chiefly courted for his buffoonery  and will be admitted into the choicest parties of the
