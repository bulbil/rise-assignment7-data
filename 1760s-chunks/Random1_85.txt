 when in spite of my fears  I was over powered with slumber  tho  I did not long enjoy this comfortable situation  being arroused with a noise so loud and shrill  that I thought the drums of my ears were burst by it  this was followed by a dreadful summons pronounced by a hoarse voice  which I could not understand  While I was debating with myself whether or not I should wake my companion  and enquire into the occasion of this disturbance  I was informed by one of the quarter masters  who passed by me with a lanthorn in his hand  that the noise which alarmed me  was occasioned by the boatswain s mates who called up the larboard watch  and that I must lay my account with such interruption every morning at the same hour —Being now more assured of of my safety  I addressed myself again to rest  and slept till eight a clock  when getting up  and breakfasting with my comrades  on biscuit and brandy  the sick were visited and assisted as before  after which my good friend Thomson explained and performed another piece of duty  to which I was a stranger —At a certain hour in the morning  the boy of the mess went round all the decks  ringing a small hand bell  and in rhimes composed for the occasion  inviting all those who had sores to repair before the mast  where one of the doctor s mates attended  with applications to dress them       242  CHAP  XXVII   I acquire the friendship of the surgeon  who procures a warrant for me  and makes me a present of cloaths—a battle between a midshipman and me—the surgeon leaves the ship—the captain comes on board with another surgeon—a dialogue between the captain and Morgan—the sick are ordered to be brought upon the quarter deck and examined—the consequences of that order—a madman accuses Morgan  and is set at liberty by command of the captain  whom he instantly attacks and pummels without mercy   WHILE I was busied with my friend in this practice  the doctor chanced to pass by the place where we were  and stopping to observe me  appeared very well satisfied with my method of application  and afterwards sent for me to his cabbin  where  having examined me touching my skill in surgery  and the particulars of my fortune  interested himself so far in my behalf  as to promise his assistance in procuring a warrant for me  seeing I had been already found qualified at Surgeon s hall  for the station I now filled on board  and this he the more cordially engaged in  when he understood I was nephew to lieutenant Bowlin… for whom he expressed a   243 particular regard —In the mean time  I could learn from his discourse  that he did not intend to go to sea again with captain Oakhum  having  as he thought  been indifferently used by him during the last voyage   While I lived tollerably easy  in expectation of preferment  I was not altogether without mortifications  which I not only suffered from the rude insults of the sailors  and petty officers  among whom I was known by the name of Loblolly Boy  but also from the disposition of Morgan  who  though friendly in the main  was often very troublesome with his pride  which expected a good deal of submission from me  and delighted in recapitulating the favours I had received at his hands   About six weeks after my arrival on board  the surgeon bidding me follow him into his cabbin  presented a warrant to me  by which I was appointed surgeon s third mate on board the Thunder —This he had procured by his interest at the Navy office  as also another for himself  by virtue of which he was removed into a second rate  I acknowledged his kindness in the strongest terms my gratitude could suggest  and professed my sorrow at the prospect of losing such a valuable friend  to whom I hoped to have recommended myself still further  by my respectful and diligent behaviour —But his generosity rested not here —for  before he left the ship  he made me a present of a chest and some cloaths  that enabled me to support the rank to which he had raised me —I found my spirit revive with my good fortune  and now I was an officer  resolved to maintain the dignity of my station  against all opposition or affronts  nor was it long before I   244 had occasion to exert my resolution  my old enemy the midshipman  whose name was Crampley  entertaining an implacable animosity against me  for the disgrace he had suffered on my account  had since that time taken all opportunities of reviling and ridiculing me  when I was not intitled to retort his bad usage —And even after I had been rated on the books  and mustered as surgeon s mate  did not think fit to restrain his insolence —In particular  being one day present  while I dressed a wound in a sailor s leg  he began to sing a song  which I thought highly injurious to the honour of my country  and therefore signified my resentment  by observing  that the Scots always laid their account in finding enemies among the ignorant  insignificant and malicious —This unexpected piece of assurance enraged him to such a degree  that he lent
