had to this day  but that our ship was taken by the French  and so I lost it all   Our crew was carried into a French prison  and many of them died  because they were not used to live in a jail  but for my part it was nothing to me  for I was seasoned  One night however  as I was sleeping on the bed of boards  with a warm blanket about me   for I always loved to lie well   I was awaked by the boatswain  who had a dark lanthorn in his hand   Jack  says he to me  will you knock out the French centry s brains    I don t care  says I  striving to keep myself awake  if I lend a hand    Then follow me  says he  and I hope we shall do business   So up I got  and tied my blanket  which was all the cloaths I had  about my middle  and went with him to fight the Frenchmen  we had no arms  but one Englishman is able to beat five French at any time  so we went down to the door  where both the centries were posted  and rushing upon them  seized their arms in a moment  and knocked them down  From thence  nine of us ran together to the   222 key  and seizing the first boat we met  got out of the harbour  and put to sea  we had not been here three days before we were taken up by an English privateer  who was glad of so many good hands  and we consented to run our chance  However  we had not so much luck as we expected  In three days we fell in with a French man of war  of forty guns  while we bad but twenty three  so to it we went  The fight lasted for three hours  and I verily believe we should have taken the Frenchman  but unfortunately  we lost almost all our men  just as we were going to get the victory  I was once more in the power of the French  and I believe it would have gone hard with me  had I been brought back to my old jail in Brest  but by good fortune  we were re taken  and carried to England once more   I had almost forgot to tell you  that in this last engagement I was wounded in two places  I lost four fingers of the left hand  and my leg was shot off  Had I the good fortune to have lost my leg and use of my hand on board a king s ship  and not a privateer  I should have been entitled to cloathing and maintenance during the rest of my life  but that was not my chance  one man is born with a silver spoon in his mouth  and another with a wooden ladle  However  blessed be God  I enjoy good health  and have no enemy in this world that I know of  but the French  and the Justice of Peace   Thus saying  he limped off  leaving my friend and me in admiration of his intrepidity and content  nor could we avoid acknowledging  that an habitual acquaintance with misery  is the truest school of fortitude and philosophy  Adieu     223  LETTER CXVI  From the same   THE titles of European Princes are rather more numerous than ours of Asia  but by no means so sublime  The king of Visapour or Pegu  not satisfied with claiming the globe and all its appurtenances to him and his heirs  asserts a property even in the firmament  and extends his orders to the milky way  The monarchs of Europe  with more modesty  confine their titles to earth  but make up by number  what is wanting in their sublimity  Such is their passion for a long list of these splendid trifles  that I have known a German Prince with more titles than subjects  and a Spanish nobleman with more names than shirts   Contrary to this   The English monarchs  says a writer of the last century  disdain to accept of such titles  which tend only to encrease their pride  without improving their glory  they are above depending on the feeble helps of heraldry for respect  perfectly satisfied with the consciousness of acknowledged power   At present  however  these maxims are laid aside  the English monarchs have of late assumed new titles  and have impressed their coins with the names and arms of obscure dukedoms  petty states  and subordinate employments  Their design in this  I make no doubt  was laudably to add new lustre to the British throne  but in reality paltry claims only serve to diminish that respect they are designed to secure     224There is in the honours assumed by Kings  as in the decorations of architecture  a majestic simplicity  which best conduces to inspire our reverence and respect  numerous and trifling ornaments in either  are strong indications of meanness in the designer  or of concealed deformity  should  for instance  the Emperor of China  among other titles  assume that of Deputy Mandarin of Maccau  or the Monarch of Great Britain  France  and Ireland  desire to be
