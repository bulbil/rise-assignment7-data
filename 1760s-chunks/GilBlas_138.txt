 You were perfectly in the right  replied the new found abigail  called Beatrice  That was pretty much my method of proceeding with Constance  One morning early  I gave in my accounts with a very sulky air  she took them from me in moody silence  and we parted in a sort of well bred dudgeon   I am quite delighted  said I  that we have met again  where we need not be ashamed of our employers  Donna Euphrasia looks for all the world like a woman of fashion  and I am much deceived if she has not reputation too  You are too clear sighted to be deceived  answered the old appendage to sin  She is of a good family  and as for her temper  I can assure you it is unparalleled for evenness and sweetness  None of your termagant mistresses  never to be pleased  but always grumbling and scolding about everything  making the house ring with their clack  and fretting poor servants to a thread  whose places  in short  are a hell upon earth  I have not in all this time heard her raise her voice on any occasion whatever  When things happen not to be done exactly in her way  she sets them to rights without any anger  nor does any of that bad language escape her lips  of which some high spirited ladies are so liberal  My master  too  rejoined I  is very mild in his disposition  the very milk of human kindness  and in this respect we are  between ourselves  much better off than when we lived among the actresses  A thousand times better  replied Beatrice  my life used to be all bustle and distraction  but this place is an actual hermitage  Not a creature darkens our doors but this excellent Don Gonzales  You will be my only helpmate in my solitude  and my lot is but too greatly blessed  For this long time have I cherished an affection for you  and many a time and oft have I begrudged that Laura the felicity of engrossing you for her sweetheart  but in the end I hope to be even with her  If I cannot boast of youth and beauty like hers  to balance the account  I detest coquetry  and have all the constancy as well as affection of a turtle dove   As honest Beatrice was one of those ladies who are obliged to hawk their wares  and cheapen themselves for want of cheapeners in the market  I was happily shielded from any temptation to break the commandments  Nevertheless  it might not have been prudent to let her see in what contempt her charms were held  for which reason I forced my natural politeness so far  as to talk to her in a style not to cut off all hope of my more serious advances  I flattered myself then  that I had found favour in the eyes of an old dresser to the stage  but pride was destined to have a fall  even on so humble an occasion  The domestic trickster did not sharpen her allurements  from any longing for my pretty person  her design in subduing me to the little soft god was to enlist me for the purposes of her mistress  to whom she had sworn so passive an obedience  that she would have sold her eternal self to the old chapman  who first set up the trade of sin  rather than have disappointed her slightest wishes  My vain conceit was sufficiently evident on the very next morning  when I carried an Ovidian letter from my master to Euphrasia  The lady gave me an affable reception  and made a thousand pretty speeches  echoed from the practised lips of her chambermaid  The expression of my countenance was peculiarly interesting to the one  but that within which passeth shew was the flattering theme of the other  According to their account  the fortunate Don Gonzales had picked up a treasure  In short  my praises ran so high  that I began to think worse of myself than I had ever done in the whole course of my life  Their motive was sufficiently obvious  but I was determined to play at diamond cut diamond  The simper of a simpleton is no bad countermine to the attack of a sharper  These ladies under favour were of the latter description  and they soon began to open their batteries   Hark you  Gil Blas  said Euphrasia  fortune declares in your favour if you do not balk her  Let us put our heads together  my good friend  Don Gonzales is old  and a good deal shaken in constitution  so that a very little fever  in the hands of a very great doctor  would carry him to a better place  Let us take time by the forelock  and ply our arts so busily as to secure to me the largest slice of his effects  If I prosper  you shall not starve  I promise you  and my bare word is a better security than all the deeds and conveyances of all the lawyers in Madrid  Madam  answered I  you have but to command me  Give me my commission on your muster roll  and you shall have no reason to complain either of my cowardice or contumacy  So be it  then  replied she  You must watch your master  and bring me an
