you this afternoon  you will receive a man filled with sentiments of gratitude and esteem for you  and who is determined by his future conduct  to deserve a continuance of your love   ‘I am   c ’  I congratulated Miss Burchell  after reading this letter  on her approaching felicity  She had not words to express her acknowlegements to me  The service I had rendered her was indeed to her a most important one  and there are some occasions where words are of no use  Miss Burchell can be eloquent without them  She embraced me a thousand times  and wept in tender transport on my neck     My mother is as much delighted at this happy event  as if it immediately concerned her own welfare  She recommended it to Miss Burchell  to have her little boy with her when Mr Faulkland came to visit her  It seems he has not seen the child since his last return to England  he did not care to go to the house where it was boarded  for fear of drawing any observation on himself to Miss Burchell’s prejudice  and the people never permitted the child to be taken abroad by any one but Miss Burchell  who passes for its aunt  or Mr Faulkland’s house keeper  but this good woman  happening to be sick when he came to town  Mr Faulkland had not an opportunity of sending for it   Miss Burchell greatly approved of the motion  and flew from us to prepare for this so much desired interview   And now  Cecilia  do you not think Mr Faulkland has proved himself a disinterested  lover shall I say  of your Sidney  Indeed he has given a noble testimony of his esteem and deference for me  as well as he formerly did of his affection  If Miss Burchell does not render herself worthy of him  how shall I hate myself for having brought about this union  But she loves him too ardently  and is herself too lovely  not to get possession of his heart  when it becomes his duty  as well as his interest  to give it up to her  All acquaintance between her and me  must now cease  for her sake  as well as Mr Faulkland’s  this will be necessary  my presence may disturb  but can never contribute to the tranquillity of either of them   June 26  Miss Burchell was in too much haste to communicate her joy to us  to defer giving an account of what passed between her and Mr Faulkland yesterday evening  She hurried to us last night  at almost ten o’clock   He came to her house  she said  at six  the hour she had appointed him  and looked so enchantingly  She herself was dressed out very elegantly to receive him  and I thought looked really charming  her countenance was so lighted up with joy  that she did not appear the same woman   She had endeavoured  she said  to compose herself for this interview  and had tried to assume something of dignity  but it all vanished when her conqueror approached  and the tumult of her heart so intirely banished all recollection  and presence of mind  that she was not able to tell me in what manner she received him  She    only knows  she says  that having snatched up her little boy  who stood by her and hung on her gown  she put him into his father’s arms  and bidding the babe thank him for his goodness  she burst into tears  Mr Faulkland tenderly embraced the child  not without a visible emotion of countenance  and having gently set him down again  he placed himself by Miss Burchell’s side  She was still sobbing  Those generous tears  Madam  said he  taking her by the hand  reproach me too much  I have not deserved this tenderness  I cannot look upon you  nor that dear boy  without blushing  but you have forgiven me  it shall be the study of my life to make you both happy  Oh  Madam  continued Miss Burchell  what an exquisite joy must such a declaration give me from the beloved of my soul  I wrung his hand  Oh  Sir  you are too good  What return can I make you  One thing only say to me  that you do not offer me a very reluctant hand  and I shall then be the happiest of women   Mr Faulkland paused a little while  and then  with a noble frankness  replied  ‘You know  my dear Miss Burchell  with what an excess of passion I have ever loved Mrs Arnold  Had no such woman existed  you would have been my choice  preferably to any other  but when I first knew you  I looked upon myself as bound to her  though  at that time  I had never seen her  my knowledge of her afterwards confirmed me her’s  I made no secret of this to you  and you may remember what my declarations to you were  even at the time my hopes were frustrated  I have loved her fervently ever since  even in the arms of a husband I adored her  and I will be candid enough to own to you  that  as my attachment to her has
