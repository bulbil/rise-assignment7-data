of men  the best of wives  Let it not be long before you do  for the sake of many  who will hope on till then  As your Lover  I must hate him  As your Husband  I will love him  He will  he must  be kind  affectionate  grateful  to you  and you will deserve all his tenderness  May you live  the ornaments of human nature as you are  to see your children s children  all promising to be as good  as worthy  as happy  as yourselves  And  full of years  full of honour  in one hour may you be translated to that Heaven where only you can be more happy  than you will be  if you are both as happy as I wish and expect you to be      Tears dropt on my cheek  at this unexpected blessing  so like that of the wicked prophet of old  blessing where he was expected to curse  a    He still held my hand—I will not  without your leave  madam—May I  before I part with it —He looked at me as if for leave to kiss my hand  bowing his head upon it   My heart was opened  God bless you  Mr  Greville  as you have blessed me—Be a good man  and he will —I withdrew not my hand   He kneeled on one knee  eagerly kissed my hand  more than once  Tears were in his own eyes  He arose  hurried me to Sir Charles  and holding to him my then  through surprise  half withdrawn hand—Let me have the pride  the glory  Sir Charles Grandison  to quit this dear hand to yours  It is only to yours that I would quit it—Happy  happy  happy  pair —None but the brave deserves the fair —  Sir Charles took my hand—Let this precious present be mine  said he  kissing it   mine  with the declared assent of every one here  and presented me to my grandmamma and aunt  I was frighted by the hurry the strange man had put me into—    130 May I but live to see her yours  Sir  said my grandmamma  in a kind of rapture   The moment he had put my hand into Sir Charles s  he ran out of the room  with the utmost precipitation  He was gone  quite gone  when he came to be enquired after  and every body was uneasy for him  till we were told  by one of the servants  that he took from the window of the outward parlour his hat and sword  and by anotehr  that he met him  his servant after him  hurrying away  and even sobbing as he flew —Was there ever so strange a man   Don t you pity Mr  Greville  my dear   Sir Charles was generously uneasy for him   Mr  Greville  said Lucy  who had always charity for him  has frequently surprised us with his particularities  but I hope  from the last part of his behaviour  that he is not the free thinking man he sometimes affects to be thought  I flatter myself  that Sir Charles had a righter notion of him than we  in what he said of him yesterday   Sir Charles waited on my grandmamma home  so we had him not to supper  We are all to dine with her to morrow  Your brother  you may suppose  will be a principal guest   Monday Morning  Oct  16   I HAVE a Letter from my Emily  by which I find  she is with you  tho  she has not dated it  You was very kind in shewing the dear girl the overflowings of my heart in her favour  She is all grateful love  and goodness  I will soon write to her  to repeat my assurances  that my whole power shall always be exerted to do her pleasure  But you must tell her  as from yourself  that she must have patience  I cannot ask her guardian such a question as she puts  as to her living with me  till I am likely to succeed  Would the sweet girl have me make a request to him  that shall shew him I am supposing myself to be his  before I am so  We are not come so far on our journey   131 by several stages  And yet  from what he intimated last night  as he waited on my grandmamma to Shirley manor  I find  that his expectations are forwarder than it will be possible for me to answer  And I must  without intending the least affectation  for common decorum sake  take the management of this point upon myself  For  my dear  we are every one of us here so much in Love with him  that the moment he should declare his wishes  they would be as ready to urge me t oblige him  were he even to limit me but to two or three days  as if they were afraid he would not repeat his request   I have a Letter from Mr  Beauchamp  He writes  that there are no hopes of Sir Harry s recovery  I am very sorry for it
