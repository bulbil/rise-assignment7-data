ways  the door must either be shut  or it must be open  I must either be natural or unnatural   Be what you will  we shall criticise you  returned the bookseller  and prove you a dunce in spite of your teeth  But  Sir  it is time that I should come to business  I have just now in the press an history of China  and if you will but put your name to it as the author  I shall repay the obligation with gratitude   What  Sir  replied I  put my name to a w•rk which I have not written  Never while I retain a proper respect for the public and myself  The bluntness of my reply quite abated the ardour of the bookseller s conversation    224 and  after about half an hour s disagreeable reserve  he with some ceremony took his leave and withdrew  Adieu   LETTER L  To the same   IN all other countries  my dear Fum Hoam  the rich are distinguished by their dress  In Persia  China  and most parts of Europe  those who are possessed of much gold or silver  put some of it upon their cloaths  but in England  those who carry much upon their cloaths  are remarked for having but little in their pockets  A tawdry outside is regarded as a badge of poverty  and those who can sit at home  and glote over their thousands in silent satisfaction  are generally found to do it in plain cloaths   This diversity of thinking from the rest of the world which prevails here  I was first at a loss to account for  but am since informed that it was introduced by an intercourse between them and their neighbours the French  who  whenever they came in order to pay those islanders a visit  were generally very well dressed  and very poor  daubed with lace  but all the gilding on the outside  By this means laced cloaths have been brought so much into contempt  that at present even their Mandarines are ashamed of finery     225I must own myself a convert to English simplicity  I am no more for ostentation of wealth than of learning  the person who in company should pretend to be wiser than others  I am apt to regard as illiterate and ill bred  the person whose cloaths are extremely fine  I am too apt to consider as not being possessed of any superiority of fortune  but resembling those Indians who are found to wear all the gold they have in the world in a bob at the nose   I was lately introduced into a company of the best dressed men I have seen since my arrival  Upon entering the room  I was struck with awe at the grandeur of the different dresses  That personage  thought I  in blue and gold  must be some Emperor s son  that  in green and silver  a Prince of the blood  he  in embroidered scarlet  a prime minister  all first rate noblemen  I suppose  and well looking noblemen too  I sate for some time with that uneasiness which conscious inferiority produces in the ingenuous mind  all attention to their discourse  However  I found their conversation more vulgar than I could have expected from personages of such distinction  if these  thought I to myself  be Princes  they are the most stupid Princes I have ever conversed with  yet still I continued to venerate their dress  for dress has a kind of mechanical influence on the mind   My friend in black indeed did not behave with the same deference  but contradicted the finest of them all in the most peremptory tones of contempt  But I had scarce time to wonder at the imprudence of his conduct  when I found occasion to be equally surprized at the absurdity of theirs  for   226 upon the entry of a middle aged man  dressed in a cap  dirty shirt and boots  the whole circle seemed diminished of their former importance  and contended who should be first to pay their obeysance to the stranger  They somewhat resembled a circle of Kalmucs offering incense to a bear   Eager to know the cause of so much seeming contradiction  I whispered my friend out of the room  and found that the august company consisted of no other than a dancing master  two fiddlers  and a third rate actor  all assembled in order to make a set at country dances  as the middle aged gentleman whom I saw enter was a squire from the country  and desirous of learning the new manner of footing  and smoothing up the rudiments of his rural minuet   I was no longer surprized at the authority which my friend assumed among them  nay  was even displeased  pardon my eastern education  that he had not kicked every creature of them down stairs   What  said I  shall a set of such paltry fellows dress themselves up like sons of kings  and claim even the transitory respect of half an hour  There should be some law to restrain so manifest a breach of privilege  they should go from house to house  as in China  with the instruments of their profession strung round their necks  by this means we might be able to distinguish and treat them in a stile of becoming contempt
