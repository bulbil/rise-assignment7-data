have annals in abundance for you  my friend  your uncle Pedro  the poetaster  has fallen a sacrifice at the shrine of Pluto  to speak to the comprehension of the vulgar  he has been dead these three months  That miser  in his lifetime  was afraid of wanting necessaries    Argenti pallebat amore  Though the great were heaping wealth upon his head  his annual expenditure did not amount to ten pistoles  He had but one miserable attendant  and him he starved  This crazy fellow  more wrong headed than the Grecian Aristippus  who ordered his slaves to leave all their costly baggage in the heart of Lybia  as an incumbrance on their march  heaped up all the gold and silver he could scrape together  And to what end  for those very heirs whom he refused to acknowledge  He died worth thirty thousand ducats  shared between your father  your uncle Bertrand  and myself  We shall be able to do very well for our children  My brother Nicholas has already married off your sister Theresa to the son of a magistrate in this place    Connubio junxit stabili propriamque dica vit  These very hymeneals  greeted auspiciously by all the nuptial powers  have we been celebrating for these two days with all this pomp and luxury  These tents in the plain are of our pitching  Pedro s three heirs have each a booth of his own  and we defray the expenses of the day alternately  I wish you had come sooner  you might have seen the whole progress of our festivities  The day before yesterday  the wedding day  your father gave his treat  It was a superb entertainment  succeeded by running at the ring  Your uncle  the mercer  regaled us yesterday with a fête champêtre  and paid the piper handsomely  There were ten of the best grown boys  and ten young girls  dressed out in pastoral weeds  all the frippery in his shop was brought out to prank them up  This assemblage of Ganymedes and Houris ran through all the mazes of the dance  and warbled forth a thousand tender and spirit stirring lays  And yet  though nothing was ever more genteel  the effect was not thought striking  but that must be owing to the bad taste of the spectators  the simplicity of pastoral is lost upon the present age   To day  the wheels are greased by your humble servant  and I mean to pre sent the burgesses of Olmédo with a pageant of my own invention    Finis coronabit opus  I have got a stage erected  on which  God willing  shall be represented by my scholars a piece of my own composing  entitled and called    The Amusements of Muley Bugentuf  King of Morocco  It will be played to perfection  for my pupils declaim like the players of Madrid  They are lads of family at Penafiel and Segovia  boarders with me  They know how to touch the passions  To be sure they have rehearsed under my tuition  their emphasis will seem as if struck in the mint of their master    ut ita dicam  With respect to the piece I shall not say a word about it  you shall be taken by surprise  I shall simply state that it must produce a deep impression on the audience  It is one of those tragic subjects which harrow up the soul  by images of death presented to the senses in all their fearful forms  I am of Aristotle s mind  terror is a principal engine  Oh  if I had written for the stage  I would have introduced none but bloody tyrants  and death  dispensing heroes  Not all the perfumes of Arabia should have sweetened this blood polluted hand  I would have been up to my elbows in gore  There would have been tragedy with a vengeance  principal characters  ay  guards and attendants  should all have been sprawling together  I would have butchered every man of them  and the prompter into the bargain  In a word  I refine upon Aristotle  and border on the horrible  that is my taste  These plays to tear a cat in  are the only things for popularity  the actors live merrily on their own dying speeches  and the authors roll in luxury on the devastation of mankind   Just as this harangue was over  we saw a great crowd of both sexes coming out of town into the plain  Who should it be but the new married couple  attended by their families and friends  with ten or twelve musicians in the van  producing a most obstreperous din of harmony  We went up to them  and Diego introduced himself  Peals of congratulation were immediately rung through the assembly  and every one was eager to shake him by the hand  He had enough upon his shoulders to receive all their fraternal embraces  Relations and strangers all were for having a pull at him  At length his father said    You are welcome  Diego  You find your kinsmen living upon the fat of the land  my friend  I shall say no more at present  a nod is as good as a wink  Meanwhile the company went forward upon the plain  took their stations under the tents  and sat down to table  I
