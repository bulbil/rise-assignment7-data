           A fine woman would reap little advantage from the charms she is        mistress of  if confined to the languid embraces of a single        possesser  Marriage takes off the poignancy of desire  a man has        no relish for beauties that are always the same  and always in his        power  those endearments generally make his happiness become        disgustful to him by being his duty  and he naturally flies to seek        joys yet untasted  in the arms of others  This  fair angel  is the        case with us all  you have too much good sense not to know it  or        to expect your husband should vary from his sex in this particular            Let those unhappy women  therefore  to whom nature has been niggard        of her bounties  pine in an abandoned bed  You are formed to give        and to receive the most unbounded joys of love  to bless and to be        blest with the utmost profusion of extasies unspeakable            To tell you how infinitely I adore you  and how much I have        languished for an opportunity of declaring my passion  would        require a volume instead of a letter  besides  my pen would but        faintly express the sentiments of my soul  they will have more        energy when whispered in your ear  I know such a thing is        impossible at your own house  or at any of those where you visit         Favour me  then  I beseech you  with taking a little walk in the        Privy Garden near the water side  to morrow about eleven  from        which place  if my person and passion be not altogether        disagreeable to you  we may adjourn to some other  where I may give        you more substantial demonstrations how much I am  with the utmost        sincerity  dear Madam  your eternally devoted  and most faithful        admirer            P S  I do not sign my name for fear of accidents  but flatter        myself my eyes have already said enough to inform you who I am        If this letter had come but a very small time before it did  it is   possible that  though Mrs  Munden would even then have been highly   offended at the presumption  yet her vanity and curiosity might have   excited her to give the meeting required in it by the author  though it   had only been  as she would then have imagined  merely to see who he   was  and laugh at his stupidity for addressing her in that manner       Not but she had some distant guess at the person  but whether it was   him  or any other  who had taken this liberty  she now gave herself not   the least concern  she was only desirous to put an entire stop to those   audacious hopes she found he had entertained  and to keep herself from   receiving any future solicitations  from the same quarter at least       To send back his letter without any other token of her resentment and   disdain at the contents  she thought would not be sufficient  and her   ready wit  after a little pause  presented her with a method more   efficacious  It was this       She folded up the epistle in the same fashion it was when she received   it  and inclosed it in another piece of paper  in which she wrote these   lines             Sir            As I cannot think any man would be weak enough to dictate an        epistle of this nature to the wife of Mr  Munden  I must suppose        you made some mistake in the direction  and sent that to me which        was intended for some other woman  whose character it might better        agree with            I must intreat you  however  to be more careful for the future  for        if any
