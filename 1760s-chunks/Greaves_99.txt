Hark ye  friend   replied the bard   keep your pardon and your counsel for those who ask it  or  if you will force them upon people  take one piece of advice in return  If you don t like your present situation  apply for a committee without delay  They ll find you too much of a fool to have the least tincture of madness  and you ll be released without further scruple  In that case I shall rejoice in your deliverance  you will be freed from confinement  and I shall be happily deprived of your conversation    So saying  he flew off at a tangent  and our knight could not help smiling at the peculiar virulence of his disposition  Sir Launcelot then endeavoured to enter into conversation with his attendant  by asking how long Mr  Distich had resided in the house  but he might as well have addressed himself to a Turkish mute  The fellow either pretended ignorance  or refused an answer to every question that was proposed  He would not even disclose the name of his landlord  nor inform him whereabouts the house was situated   Finding himself agitated with impatience and indignation  he returned to his apartment  and the door being locked upon him  began to review  not without horror  the particulars of his fate   How little reason   said he to himself   have we to boast of the blessings enjoyed by the British subject  if he holds them on such a precarious tenure  if a man of rank and property may be thus kidnapped even in the midst of the capital  if he may be seized by ruffians  insulted  robbed  and conveyed to such a prison as this  from which there seems to be no possibility of escape  Should I be indulged with pen  ink  and paper  and appeal to my relations  or to the magistrates of my country  my letters would be intercepted by those who superintend my confinement  Should I try to alarm the neighbourhood  my cries would be neglected as those of some unhappy lunatic under necessary correction  Should I employ the force which Heaven has lent me  I might imbrue my hands in blood  and after all find it impossible to escape through a number of successive doors  locks  bolts  and sentinels  Should I endeavour to tamper with the servant  he might discover my design  and then I should be abridged of the little comfort I enjoy  People may inveigh against the Bastile in France  and the Inquisition in Portugal  but I would ask  if either of these be in reality so dangerous or dreadful as a private madhouse in England  under the direction of a ruffian  The Bastile is a state prison  the Inquisition is a spiritual tribunal  but both are under the direction of government  It seldom  if ever  happens that a man entirely innocent is confined in either  or  if he should  he lays his account with a legal trial before established judges  But  in England  the most innocent person upon earth is liable to be immured for life under the pretext of lunacy  sequestered from his wife  children  and friends  robbed of his fortune  deprived even of necessaries  and subjected to the most brutal treatment from a low bred barbarian  who raises an ample fortune on the misery of his fellow creatures  and may  during his whole life  practise this horrid oppression  without question or control    This uncomfortable reverie was interrupted by a very unexpected sound that seemed to issue from the other side of a thick party wall  It was a strain of vocal music  more plaintive than the widowed turtle s moan  more sweet and ravishing than Philomel s love warbled song  Through his ear it instantly pierced into his heart  for at once he recognised it to be the voice of his adored Aurelia  Heavens  what was the agitation of his soul  when he made this discovery  how did every nerve quiver  how did his heart throb with the most violent emotion  he ran round the room in distraction  foaming like a lion in the toilâ€”then he placed his ear close to the partition  and listened as if his whole soul was exerted in his sense of hearing  When the sound ceased to vibrate on his ear  he threw himself on the bed  he groaned with anguish  he exclaimed in broken accents  and in all probability his heart would have burst  had not the violence of his sorrow found vent in a flood of tears   These first transports were succeeded by a fit of impatience  which had well nigh deprived him of his senses in good earnest  His surprise at finding his lost Aurelia in such a place  the seeming impossibility of relieving her  and his unspeakable eagerness to contrive some scheme for profiting by the interesting discovery he had made  concurred in brewing up a second ecstasy  during which he acted a thousand extravagances  which it was well for him the attendants did not observe  Perhaps it was well for the servant that he did not enter while the paroxysm prevailed  Had this been the case  he might have met with the fate of Lichas  whom Hercules in his frenzy destroyed   Before the cloth was laid for supper  he
