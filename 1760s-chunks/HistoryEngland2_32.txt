from Limeric into France  by long difcipline  now become excellent soldiers  This army was assembled between Cherbourg and La Hogue  King James commanded it in person  and more than three hundred transports were provided for landing it on the English shore  Tourville  the French admiral  at the head of sixty three ships of the line  was appointed to favour the descent  and had orders to attack the enemy  if they should attempt to oppose him  All things conspired to revive the hopes of the hitherto unfortunate King   These preparations on the side of France were soon known at the court of England  and precautions were taken for a vigorous opposition  all the secret machinations of the banished King s adherents were early discovered to the English ministry by spies  and they took proper measures to defeat them  Admiral Russel was ordered to put to sea with all possible expedition  and he soon appeared with ninety nine ships of the line  besides frigates and fireships  Both fleets met at La Hogue  On the success of   85 this engagement all the hopes of James depended  but the victory was on the side of the English  and of numbers  the fight continued ten hours  and the pursuit two days  fifteen French men of war were destroyed  and the blow was so decisive  that from that time France seemed to relinquish her claims to the ocean   James was now reduced to the lowest ebb of despondence  his designs upon England were quite frustrated  nothing was now left his friends but terrors and despair  or the hopes of assassinating the Monarch on the throne  These base attempts  as barbarous as they were useless  were not intirely disagreeable to the temper of James  it is said  he encouraged and proposed them  but they all ended in the destruction of their undertakers  He passed the rest of his days at St  Germains  a pensioner on the bounties of Lewis  and assisted by occasional liberalities from his daughter  and friends in England  He died in 1700  at St  Germains  Some pretend that miracles were wrought at his tomb  We have seen few deposed Kings that have not died with a reputation for sanctity   The defeat at La Hogue confirmed King William s safety and title to the crown  the Jacobites were now a feeble and a disunited faction  new parties therefore arose among those who had been friends of the revolution  and William found as much opposition from his parliament at home  as from the enemy in the field  His chief motive for accepting the crown was to engage England more deeply in the concerns of Europe  It had ever been his ambition to humble the French  whom he considered as the most formidable enemies of that liberty which he idolized  and all his politics lay in making alliances against them  Many of the English  on the other hand  had neither the same animosity against the French  nor the same terrors of their increasing power  they therefore considered the interests of the   86 nation as sacrificed to foreign connections  and complained  that the war on the continent fell most heavily on them  though they had the least interest in its success  To these motives of discontent was added his partiality to his own countrymen  in prejudice of English subjects  together with his proud reserve and sullen silence  so unlike the behaviour of all their former Kings  William heard their complaints with the most phlegmatic indifference  the interests of Europe alone employed all his attention  but  while he incessantly waked over the schemes of contending Kings and nations  he was unmindful of the cultivation of internal polity  Patriotism was ridiculed as an ideal virtue  the practice of bribing a majority in parliament became universal  The example of the great was caught up by the vulgar  all principle  and even decency  was gradually banished  talents lay uncultivated  and the ignorant and profligate were received into favour   William  upon accepting the crown  was resolved to preserve  as much as he was able  the privileges of a Sovereign  He was  as yet  intirely unacquainted with the nature of a limited monarchy  which was not then thoroughly understood in any part of Europe  except England alone  He therefore often controverted the views of his parliament  and was directed by arbitrary councils  One of the first instances of this was  in the opposition he gave to the bill for triennial parliaments  it had past the two houses  and was sent up to receive the royal assent  which William refused to grant  the commons then voted  that whoever advised the King to this measure  was an enemy to his country  The bill  thus rejected  lay dormant for another season  and  being again brought in  the King found himself obliged  though reluctantly  to comply  The same opposition  and the same success  attended a bill for regulating tryals in cases of high treason  by which the   87 accused was allowed a copy of his indictment  and a list of the names of his jury  two days before his tryal  together with council to plead in his defence  That no person should be indicted  but upon the oaths of two faithful witnesses  This was one of the most salutary laws that
