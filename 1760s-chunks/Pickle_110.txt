absence  and  ordered his man to run in quest of his master to all the places which  he used to frequent  while he himself went to the commissaire  and   communicating his suspicions  was accommodated with a party of the  horse guards  who patrolled round all the environs of the city  with a  view of preventing the rencounter  Pipes might have directed them to the  lady  by whose information they could have learned the name and lodgings  of the mousquetaire  and if he had been apprehended the duel would not  have happened  but he did not choose to run the risk of disobliging his  master by intermeddling in the affair  and was moreover very desirous  that the Frenchman should be humbled  for he never doubted that  Peregrine was more than a match for any two men in France  In this  confidence  therefore  he sought his master with great diligence  not  with a view of disappointing his intention  but in order to attend him  to the battle  that he might stand by him  and see justice done   While this inquiry was carried on  our hero and his companion concealed  themselves among some weeds  that grew on the edge of the parapet  a few  yards from the spot where he had agreed to meet the mousquetaire   and scarce had the morning rendered objects distinguishable when they  perceived their men advancing boldly to the place  Peregrine  seeing  them approach sprang forward to the ground  that he might have the glory  of anticipating his antagonist  and swords being drawn  all four were  engaged in a twinkling  Pickle s eagerness had well nigh cost him  his life  for  without minding his footing  he flew directly to his  opposite  and  stumbling over a stone  was wounded on one side of his  head before he could recover his attitude  Far from being dispirited at    6 22 15  3 45 PM   this check  it served only to animate him the more  being endowed with  uncommon agility  he retrieved his posture in a moment  and having  parried a second thrust  returned the lunge with such incredible speed   that the soldier had not time to resume his guard  but was immediately  run through the bend of his right arm  and the sword dropping out of his  hand  our hero s victory was complete   Having despatched his own business  and received the acknowledgment of  his adversary who  with a look of infinite mortification  answered  that  his was the fortune of the day  he ran to part the seconds  just as the  weapon was twisted out of his companion s hand  upon which he took his  place  and  in all likelihood  an obstinate dispute would have ensued   had they not been interrupted by the guard  at sight of whom the two  Frenchmen scampered off  Our young gentleman and his friend allowed  themselves to be taken prisoners by the detachment which had been sent  out for that purpose  and were carried before the magistrate  who   having sharply reprimanded them for presuming to act in contempt of the  laws  set them at liberty  in consideration of their being strangers   cautioning them  at the same time  to beware of such exploits for the  future   When Peregrine returned to his own lodgings  Pipes  seeing the blood  trickling down upon his master s neckcloth and solitaire  gave evident  tokens of surprise and concern  not for the consequences of the wound   which he did no suppose dangerous  but for the glory of Old England   which he was afraid had suffered in the engagement  for he could not  help saying  with an air of chagrin  as he followed the youth into his  chamber   I do suppose as how you gave that lubberly Frenchman as good  as he brought    CHAPTER XLI    Mr  Jolter threatens to leave him on account of his Misconduct  which he  promises to rectify  but his Resolution is defeated by the Impetuosity  of his Passions  He meets accidentally with Mrs  Hornbeck  who elopes  with him from her Husband  but is restored by the Interposition of the  British Ambassador   Though Mr  Jolter was extremely well pleased at the safety of his pupil   he could not forgive him for the terror and anxiety he had undergone on  his account  and roundly told him  that notwithstanding the inclination  and attachment he had to his person  he would immediately depart for  England  if ever he should hear of his being involved in such another  adventure  for it could not be expected that he would sacrifice his own  quiet  to an unrequited regard for one who seemed determined to keep him  in continual uneasiness and apprehension   To this declaration Pickle made answer  that Mr  Jolter  by this time   ought to be convinced of the attention he had always paid to his ease  and satisfaction  since he well knew that he had ever looked upon him in  the light of a friend rather than as a counsellor or tutor  and
