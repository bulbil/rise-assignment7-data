Those which held the jewels  he could easily carry  Accordingly  when every one in his house was asleep  he loaded himself with his pleasing burdens  and having from each of the repositories which held the gold  filled several large purses for his immediate expences  he conveyed the rest by many journeys to and from the cave  all safe to his subterranean treasury  where having locked them up securely  he retired to his apartment  and went to bed     For the three succeeding days his thoughts were so perplexed and divided  that he knew not which of his favourite schemes he should first enter upon  Satisfied with having the means in his power  he neglected those ends for which  Page  33  he was so desirous of them  Shall I  said he  purchase or set about building for myself a magnificent palace  Shall I dispatch emissaries in search of the most beautiful virgins that can be obtained  and others  at the same time  to procure for me the rarest musicians  My household  meanwhile  may be established  and put on a footing suitable to the grandeur in which I purpose to live  I will directly hire a number of domestics  amongst which shall be a dozen of the best cooks in Persia  that my table at least may be immediately better supplied than that of the sultan  I am bewildered with such a multiplicity of business  and must find out some person  who  without giving me any trouble  will undertake to regulate the oeconomy of all my domestic concerns     Page  34  In these thoughts he was so immersed  that he entirely forgot to pay his court to Schemzeddin  and without any other enjoyment of his riches  than the pleasure of thinking of them  he sat for whole days alone  alternately improving on  or rejecting  such systems of happiness as arose in his mind     The sultan  mean time  offended at his absenting himself  without offering any excuse for it  especially as their last parting had been a cold one  was so disgusted at his behaviour  that he sent one of his officers to forbid him his presence  and charge him never more to appear at court  Tell him  however  said he  that I have not so far forgot  Page  35  got my former friendship for him  as to see him want a decent support  that house  therefore  in which he now lives  I freely bestow on him  and shall moreover allow him a pension of a thousand crowns yearly  Bid him remember that this is sufficient to supply him with all the sober enjoyments of life  These being his favourite s own words  the sultan thought proper to remind him of them     ← Nourjahad → received this message with the utmost indifference  but without daring to shew any mark of disrespect  Tell my lord the sultan  said he  that I would not have been thus long without prostrating myself at his feet  but that I was hastily sent for to visit a kinsman   Page  36  whose dwelling was some leagues from Ormuz  and who in his last hours was desirous of seeing me  He died very rich  and has made me his heir  The thousand crowns a year therefore  my royal master may please to bestow on some one who wants them more  and is more deserving of his bounty  than I  wretch that I am  to have forfeited my prince s favour  The house that his goodness bestows on me  with all gratitude I thankfully accept  as it will daily remind me that Schemzeddin does not utterly detest his slave  Saying this  he presented the officer with a handsome diamond  which he took from his finger  and begged him to accept of it as a token of his respect for him  and submission to the sultan s pleasure     Page  37  Though ← Nourjahad → had given such a turn to his acceptance of the house  his true reason was  that having his treasure buried in the garden  he thought he could not without great difficulty  and the hazard of a discovery  remove it  Thus had he already  in two instances  been obliged to depart from truth  in consequence of his ill judged and pernicious choice     The house which the sultan had given him  was handsome and commodious  and he thought by enlarging and furnishing it magnificently  it would sufficiently answer the purpose of his town residence  besides  as it was a royal grant  he was sure of remaining unmolested in the possession of it     Page  38  He now bent his thoughts on nothing but in giving a loose to his appetites  and indulging without controul in every delight which his passions or imagination could suggest to him  As he was not of an active temper  he put the conduct of his pleasures into the hands of one  whom he had lately received into his service  This man  whose name was Hasem  he found had good sense  and a quickness of parts  which he thought qualified him for the trust he reposed in him  To him he committed the care of regulating his family
