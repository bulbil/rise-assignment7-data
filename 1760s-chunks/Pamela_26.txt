have thought  Indeed  and please   your honour  said I  I have worked early and late upon it  there is a   great deal of work in it   Work in it  said he  You mind your pen more   than your needle  I don t want such idle sluts to stay in my house       He seemed startled  when he saw the butler  as he entered the hall    where Mr  Jonathan stood  What do you here  said he   The butler was as   much confounded as I  for  never having been taxed so roughly  I could   not help crying sadly  and got out of both their ways to Mrs  Jervis    and told my complaint  This love  said she  is the d      In how many   strange shapes does it make people shew themselves  And in some the   farthest from their hearts       So one  and then another  has been since whispering  Pray  Mrs  Jervis    are we to lose Mrs  Pamela  as they always call me  What has she done    And she tells them  as above  about going home to you       She said afterwards to me  Well  Pamela  you have made our master  from   the sweetest tempered gentleman in the world  one of the most peevish    But you have it in your power to make him as sweet tempered as ever    though I hope you ll never do it on his terms       This was very good in Mrs  Jervis  but it intimated  that she thought   as ill of his designs as I  and as she knew his mind more than I  it   convinced me that I ought to get away as fast as I could       My master came in  just now  to speak to Mrs  Jervis about household   matters  having some company to dine with him to morrow  and I stood up    and having been crying at his roughness in the entry  I turned away my   face       You may well  said he  turn away your cursed face  I wish I had never   seen it   Mrs  Jervis  how long is she to be about this waistcoat       Sir  said I  if your honour had pleased  I would have taken it with me    and though it would be now finished in a few hours  I will do so still    and remove this hated poor Pamela out of your house and sight for ever       Mrs  Jervis  said he  not speaking to me  I believe this little slut has   the power of witchcraft  if ever there was a witch  for she enchants all   that come near her  She makes even you  who should know better what the   world is  think her an angel of light       I offered to go away  for I believe he wanted me to ask to stay in my   place  for all this his great wrath  and he said  Stay here  Stay here    when I bid you  and snatched my hand  I trembled  and said  I will  I   will  for he hurt my fingers  he grasped me so hard       He seemed to have a mind to say something to me  but broke off abruptly    and said  Begone  And away I tripped as fast as I could  and he and   Mrs  Jervis had a deal of talk  as she told me  and among the rest  he   expressed himself vexed to have spoken in Mr  Jonathan s hearing       Now you must know  that Mr  Jonathan  our butler  is a very grave good   sort of old man  with his hair as white as silver  and an honest worthy   man he is  I was hurrying out with a flea in my ear  as the saying is    and going down stairs into the parlour  met him  He took hold of my   hand  in a gentler manner  though  than my master  with both his  and he   said  Ah  sweet  sweet Mrs  Pamela  what is it I heard but just now   I   am sorry at my heart  but I am sure I will sooner believe any body in   fault than you  Thank you  Mr  Jonathan  said I  but as you value your   place  don t be seen speaking to such a one as me  I cried too  and   slipt away as fast as I could from him  for his own sake  lest he should   be seen to pity me       And
