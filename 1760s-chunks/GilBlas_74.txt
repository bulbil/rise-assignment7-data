have guards in attendance  I comprehend you  said Diego  you mean to tell us  you are a player  You guess right  replied the other  I have been an actor for these fifteen years at least  From my very infancy  I was sent on the boards in children s parts  To deal freely  rejoined the barber  shaking his head  I do not believe a word of it  I know the players  those gentry do not travel on foot  like you  nor do they mess with St Anthony  I doubt whether you are anything better than a candle snuffer  You may  quoth the son of Thespis  think of me as you please  but my parts  for all that  are in the first line  I play the lovers  If that be the case  said my companion  I wish you much joy  and am delighted that Signor Gil Blas and myself have the honour of breakfasting with so eminent a character   We then began to pick up our crumbs  and to gnaw the precious relics of the hare  bestowing such hearty smacks upon the bottle  as to empty it very shortly  We were all three so deeply engaged in the great affair of eating  that we said very little till we had finished  when we resumed our conversation  I wonder  said the barber to the player  that you should be so much out at elbows  For a theatrical hero  you have but a needy exterior  I beg pardon if I speak rather freely  Rather freely  exclaimed the actor  Ah  by my troth  you are not yet acquainted with Melchior Zapata  Heaven be praised  I have no mind to see things in a wrong light  You do me a pleasure by speaking so confidently  for I love to unbosom myself without reserve  I honestly own I am not rich  Here  pursued he  showing us his doublet lined with playbills  this is the common stuff which serves me for linings  and if you are curious to see my wardrobe  you shall not be disappointed  At the same time he took out of his knapsack a dress  laced with tarnished frippery  a shabby head dress for an hero  with an old plume of feathers  silk stockings full of holes  and red morocco shoes a great deal the worse for wear  You see  said he again  that I am very little better than a beggar  That is astonishing  replied Diego  then you have neither wife nor daughter  I have a very handsome young wife  rejoined Zapata  and yet I might just as well be without her  Look with awe on the lowering aspect of my horoscope  I married a personable actress  in the hope that she would not let me die of hunger  and  to my cost  she is cursed with incorruptible chastity  Who the devil would not have been taken in as well as myself  There was but one virtuous princess in a whole strolling company  and she  plague take her  fell into my hands  It was throwing with bad luck most undoubtedly  said the barber  But then  why did not you look out for an actress in the regular theatre at Madrid  You would have been sure of your mark  You are perfectly in the right  replied the stroller  but the mischief is  we underlings dare not raise our thoughts to those illustrious heroines  It is as much as an actor of the prince s company can venture on  nay  some of them are obliged to match with citizens  daughters  Happily for our fraternity  citizens  daughters now a days contract theatrical notions  and you may often meet with characters among them  to the full as eccentric as any bona roba of the green room   Well  but have you never thought  said my fellow traveller  of getting an engagement in that company  Is it necessary to be a Roscius for that purpose  That is very well of you  replied Melchior  you are a wag  with your Roscius  There are twenty performers  Ask the town what it thinks of them  and you will hear a pretty character of their acting  More than half of them deserve to carry a porter s knot  Yet for all that  it is no easy matter to get upon the boards  Bribery or interest must make up for the defect of talent  I ought to know what I say since my debut at Madrid  where I was hissed and cat called as if the devil had got among the grimalkins  though I ought to have been received with thunders of applause  for I whined  ranted  and offered all sorts of violence to nature s modesty  nay  I went so far as to clench my list at the heroine of the piece  in a word  I adopted the conceptions of all the great performers  and yet that same audience condemned by bell  book  and candle in me  what was thought to be the first style of playing in them  Such is the force of prejudice  So that  being no favourite with the pit  and not having wherewithal to insinuate myself into the good graces of the manager  I am on my return to Zamora
