his favour by submission and respect   These insolent terms were readily embraced by the unfortunate  challenger  who fairly owned  that he was not at all calculated for the  purposes of war  and that henceforth he would contend with no weapon  but his pencil  He begged with great humility  that Mr  Pickle would not  think the worse of his morals for this defect of courage  which was a  natural infirmity inherited from his father  and suspend his opinion of  his talents  until he should have an opportunity of contemplating the  charms of his Cleopatra  which would be finished in less than three  months   Our hero observed  with an affected air of displeasure  that no man  could be justly condemned for being subject to the impressions of fear   and therefore his cowardice might easily be forgiven  but there was  something so presumptuous  dishonest  and disingenuous  in arrogating  a quality to which he knew he had not the smallest pretension  that  he could not forget his misbehaviour all at once  though he would  condescend to communicate with him as formerly  in hopes of seeking  a reformation in his conduct  Pallet protested  that there was no  dissimulation in the case  for he was ignorant of his own weakness   until his resolution was put to the trial  he faithfully promised  to demean himself  during the remaining part of the tour  with that  conscious modesty and penitence which became a person in his condition   and  for the present  implored the assistance of Mr  Pipes  in  disembarrassing him from the disagreeable consequence of his fear   CHAPTER LXIV   The Doctor exults in his Victory  They set out for Rotterdam  where they  are entertained by two Dutch Gentlemen in a Yacht  which is overturned  in the Maese  to the manifest hazard of the Painter s Life  They spend  the Evening with their Entertainers  and next Day visit a Cabinet of  Curiosities   Tom was accordingly ordered to administer to his occasions  and  the conqueror  elated with his success  which he in a great measure  attributed to his manner of attack  and the hymn which he howled  told  Peregrine  that he was now convinced of the truth of what Pindar sung in  these words  ossa de me pephileke Zeus atuzontai boan Pieridon aionta   for he had no sooner begun to repeat the mellifluent strains of that    6 22 15  3 45 PM   divine poet  than the wretch his antagonist was confounded  and his  nerves unstrung   On their return to the inn  he expatiated on the prudence and  tranquility of his own behaviour  and ascribed the consternation  of Pallet to the remembrance of some crime that lay heavy upon his  conscience  for  in his opinion  a man of virtue and common sense could  not possibly be afraid of death  which is not only the peaceful harbour  that receives him shattered on the tempestuous sea of life  but also the  eternal seal of his fame and glory  which it is no longer in his power  to forfeit and forego  He lamented his fate  in being doomed to live in  such degenerate days  when war is become a mercenary trade  and ardently  wished  that the day would come  when he should have such an opportunity  of signalizing his courage in the cause of liberty  as that of Marathon   where a handful of Athenians  fighting for their freedom  defeated the  whole strength of the Persian empire   Would to heaven   said he   my  muse were blessed with an occasion to emulate that glorious testimony on  the trophy in Cyprus  erected by Cimon  for two great victories gained  on the same day over the Persians by sea and land  in which it is very  remarkable  that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of  expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient  inscriptions   He then repeated it with all the pomp of declamation  and  signified his hope  that the French would one day invade us with such an  army as that which Xerxes led into Greece  that it might be in his power  to devote himself  like Leonidas  to the freedom of his country   This memorable combat being thus determined  and everything that was  remarkable in Antwerp surveyed  they sent their baggage down the Scheldt  to Rotterdam  and set out for the same place in a post waggon  which  that same evening brought them in safety to the banks of the Maese  They  put up at an English house of entertainment  remarkable for the modesty  and moderation of the landlord  and next morning the doctor went in  person to deliver letters of recommendation to two Dutch gentlemen from  one of his acquaintance at Paris  Neither of them happened to be at home  when he called  so that he left a message at their lodgings  with his  address  and in the afternoon  they waited upon the company  and  after  many hospitable professions  one of the two invited them to spend the  evening
