he has given himself an unnecessary trouble  pray excuse me  it was not handsome of him to write to my daughter  after he knew my sentiments  You need not be afraid of fresh sollicitations  madam  said my brother  I knew enough of your firmness  and he spoke the word firmness reluctantly  as if he would rather have used another  perhaps less respectful term   I knew enough to assure Faulkland there was not the least hope left for him  and though I do not know the subject of that letter  I can venture to assure you  it is not intended to move you in favour of his pretensions  this he declared to me  before I would take the letter from him  but what puts it past doubt  is  that he set out this very evening from London  in order to embark for Germany  I could not help breathing a sigh when Sir George said this  but no body heard me  He still held the letter in his hand  and again offered it to my mother  you need not be afraid of it  madam  I presume it may be no more than to take a civil leave of you  I wish him well  said my mother  taking the letter  if that be all  what he says may keep cold  and she put it into her pocket without opening   This being the eve of our journey  some little domestic matters  which my mother had to settle  called her out of the room  Sir George took that opportunity to ask me  whether my mother had shewed me the letter which he had received from Mr Faulkland while he was at Bath  relative to that cursed affair  as he called it  I told him  my mother had repeated great part of the contents of it to me  and that the principal observation she had made  was not favourable to him  on account of his being made the confidant of such an affair   I am very sorry for your sake  Sidney  said he  that our mother is of so inflexible a temper  you have lost by it  what you will have reason to    regret as long as you live  Such amazing obstinacy  such unaccountable perverseness  I do not want to shake your filial obedience  but I  for my own part  think that nothing but infatuation can account for your mother’s conduct—Does she want a man without passions  Or have you filled your head with such chimærical notions as to—I interrupted him  for my brother is not always nice in his choice of words  —Dear Sir George  say no more  I am very well contented as I am  I will not increase your uneasiness  said he  by telling you what Faulkland has suffered on this occasion  If ever love was carried to adoration  it was in the breast of that generous  charming fellow—but you have lost him—and I have lost him  thanks to my wise scrupulous mother for that  I begged of him to drop the subject  My mother came in to us again  Sir George bid us good night  and wished us a good journey  The parting was cool enough  I am glad  however  there is not a total rupture  I believe he will continue in our house in town for a time  at least   Patty Main  who gladly accepted of the offer of my service  came home to me this evening  She is grown very tall and genteel  I hardly know how to treat her as a servant  but the good girl is so humble  that she does all in her power to make me forget that I ever knew her in a better situation  but in this she fails of her purpose  for it only serves to remind me the more strongly of it  she is so ready  and so handy  that she does twenty little offices that do not belong to her place  and which are not expected of her  My mother is exceedingly pleased with her  and says it is such a happiness to have about me a young person virtuously brought up  that she almost considers her as one of the family   Grimston hall  August 8  We arrived here yesterday  and met a most friendly reception from the lady of this mansion  But before I say any more of her  I will hasten to a more interesting subject  I have got Mr Faulkland’s letter to my mother  she has just put it into my hands  and while she walks in the garden with lady Grimston  I will make haste to transcribe it  Thus it is   Madam   I submit to the sentence you have passed on me  I am miserable  but do not presume to expostulate  I purpose leaving England directly  but would wish if possible  a little to mitigate the severity of my lot   to convince you  that the unhappy rejected man  who aspired to the honour of being your son in law  is not quite such a criminal as he now appears to you   To Sir George’s friendship I know I am much indebted for endeavouring to vindicate me  It was not in his power  it was not in my own  for you saw all which
