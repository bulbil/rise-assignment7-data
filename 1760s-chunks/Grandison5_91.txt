from unpoliteness  I was obliged to be unpolite  or I could not have been sincere  and must have given such answers  as would  perhaps  in some measure  have intitled the Lady to think herself amused  Poor woman  She threatened to have me overtaken by her vengeance  But now  on the disappointment I had met with at Bologna  it became absolutely necessary for me to encourage  or to discourage  this unhappy Lady—I could not have been just to her  had I not been just to myself   A very extraordinary attempt was made  next day  on my person  I am apt to believe  from this quarter  It succeeded not  And as I was on the Tuesday to set out for Bologna  I let it pass off without complaint or enquiry   I paid the Count of Belvedere a visit  as I had promised  The General at Naples  and the Count at Parma  received me with the highest civilities  and both from the same motive  The Count will hope  The General accompanied me  with his Lady  part of my way to Florence  The motive of his journey is to rejoice personally with his friends at Urbino and Bologna  on the resolution his sister has taken  and to congratulate her upon it  as he has already done by Letter  the copy of which he shewed me  There were high compliments made me in it  We may speak handsomely of the man whom we neither envy nor fear  He would have loaded me with presents  but I declined accepting any  in such a manner  however  as he could not be dissatisfied with me for my refusal   I paid also my respects at Urbino to the Altieri family  and the Conte della Porretta  in my way to Page  228 Rome and Naples  and met with a very polite reception from both  For the rest of the time of my absence from Bologna  my literary journal will account   On Wednesday afternoon I went to the palace of Porretta  I hastened up to my Jeronymo  with whom  as also with Mr  Lowther  I had held a correspondence  in my absence  and received favourable intelligences from them   Jeronymo rejoiced to see me  I was inexpressibly delighted to find him so much recovered  His appetite  he told me  was restored  His rest was balmy and refreshing  He sat up several hours in the day  and his sister and he gave joy to each other  and to all their friends  But he hinted to me his wishes still  to call me brother  and begged of God  in a very earnest manner  snatching my hand  and wetting it with his tears  that it still might be so   The Marquis  the Marchioness  the Bishop  and Father Marescotti  joined to thank and applaud me for my part of the correspondence with their beloved daughter  for  on my declining to support her in her wishes to be allowed to take the veil  she had shewed them the copy of her second Letter  as well as my reply  to it  The blessings which they poured out upon me  were mingled with their tears  and Father Marescotti and the Bishop declared  that they would  in every prayer they put up to Heaven for themselves and the Family  remember me  and beg of God to supply to me  by another  and even  they said  a better Clementina  the disappointment I had so unexpectedly met with from theirs  The General and his Lady  and the Count  arrived the day before  But they were not present   While they were all complimenting and applauding the almost silent man  for in so critical a situation what could I say   Camilla came in  and whispering the Marchioness  Clementina  said the Marchioness  is impatient to see her friend  Chevalier  I will introduce you  I followed her   Page  229 The young Lady  the moment she beheld me  flew to me with open arms  as to her brother  her fourth brother  as she called me  and thanked me  she said  a thousand thousand times  for my Letters to her  My mamma  said she  has seen them all  But  ah  Sir  your third —I did not think you would have refused me your interest with my friends  I cannot  cannot give up that point  It was always my wish  madam  turning to her mother  to be God s child  that does not make me less yours and my papa s  O  Chevalier  you have not quieted  you have not convinced  my heart   I promise myself  that I could have left you without a plea  my dear correspondent  returned I  had my heart been at ease  and the argument less affecting to myself  And surely  if Lady Clementina had been convinced  she would have acted up to her conviction   O  Sir  you are a dangerous man  I see  if a certain event had taken place  I should have been a lost creature —Are not you  Sir  convinced  that I should  in my notions of a lost creature  If
