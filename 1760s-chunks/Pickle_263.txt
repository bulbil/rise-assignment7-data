my admirers  he counselled me to surrender that freedom   well knowing that my lord would be easily persuaded to banish all his  rivals from the house  in which case  he did not doubt of his being able  to insinuate himself into my affections  because he laid it down as an  eternal truth  that  if any two persons of different sexes were obliged  to live together in a desert  where they would be excluded from all  other human intercourse  they would naturally and inevitably contract an  inclination for each other    How just this hypothesis might be  I leave to the determination of the  curious  though  if I may be allowed to judge from my own disposition   a couple so situated would be apt to imbibe mutual disgusts from the  nature and necessity of their union  unless their association was at  first the effect of reciprocal affection and esteem  Be this as it will   I honour the gentleman for his plan  which was ingeniously contrived   and artfully conducted  but I happened to have too much address for him  in the sequel  cunning as he was  though at first I did not perceive his  drift  and his lordship was much less likely to comprehend his meaning    Immediately after this new accommodation  I was carried to a country  house belonging to my lord  and was simple enough to venture myself   unattended by any servant on whose integrity I could depend  in the  hands of his lordship  and H    whose villainy I always dreaded   though  at this time  my apprehensions were considerably increased by  recollecting  that it was not his interest to let me live in the house   lest his conduct should be inquired into  and by remembering that the  very house to which we were going had been twice burnt down in a very  short space of time  not without suspicion of his having been the  incendiary  on account of some box of writings which was lost in the  conflagration  True it is  this imputation was never made good  and   perhaps  he was altogether innocent of the charge  which nevertheless  affected my spirits in such a manner  as rendered me the most miserable  of all mortals  In this terror did I remain  till my consternation was  awakened by the arrival of Mr  B    a good natured worthy man  whom my  lord had invited to his house  and I thought would not see me ill used   In a few weeks we were joined by Dr  S   and his lady  who visited us  according to their promise  and it was resolved that we should set out  for Tunbridge  on a party of pleasure  and at our return examine H   s  accounts    This last part of our scheme was not at all relished by our worthy  steward  who therefore determined to overturn our whole plan  and  succeeded accordingly  My lord  all of a sudden  declared himself  against the jaunt we had projected  and insisted upon my staying at  home  without assigning any reason for this peremptory behaviour  his  countenance being cloudy  and  for the space of three days  he did not  open his mouth  At last  he one night entered my bedchamber  to which  he now had free access  with his sword under his arm  and  if I remember  aright  it was ready drawn  I could not help taking notice of this  alarming circumstance  which shocked me the more  as it happened  immediately after a gloomy fit of discontent  However  I seemed to  overlook the incident  and  dismissing my maid  went to bed  because I  was ashamed to acknowledge  even to my own heart  any dread of a person  whom I despised so much  However  the strength of my constitution was  not equal to the fortitude of my mind  I was taken ill  and the servants  were obliged to be called up  while my lord himself  terrified at my  situation  ran upstairs to Mrs  S    who was in bed  told her  with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   evident perturbation of spirits  that I was very much indisposed  and  said  he believed I was frightened by his entering my chamber with his  sword in hand    This lady was so startled at his information  that she ran into my  apartment half naked  and as she went down stairs  asked what reason  could induce him to have carried his sword with him  Upon which he gave  her to understand  that his intention was to kill the bats  I believe  and hope he had no other design than that of intimidating me  but when  the affair happened  I was of a different opinion  Mrs  S    having put  on her clothes  sat up all night by my bedside  and was so good as to  assure me that she would not leave me until I should be safely delivered  from the
