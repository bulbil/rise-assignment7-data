 that generous friend  very soon repaired to Lirias  I cannot recall the moment when he first presented himself to my view without even now being sensibly affected  My dear Santillane  said he  embracing me  I am not come to offer you impertinent consolation  but to weep over Antonia with you  as you would have wept with me over Seraphina  had the hand of death snatched her from me  In good truth  his tears bore testimony to his sincerity  and his sighs were blended with mine in the most friendly sympathy  Though overwhelmed with my affliction  I felt in the most lively manner the kindness of Don Alphonso   The governor had a long conversation with Scipio respecting the measures to be taken for overcoming my despair  They judged it best to remove me for some time from Lirias  where every object incessantly brought back to my mind the image of Antonia  On this account the son of Don Caesar proposed carrying me back with him to Valencia  and my secretary seconded the plan with so many unanswerable arguments  that I made no further opposition  I left Scipio and his wife on my estate  where my longer stay could have produced no other effect but that of aggravating and enhancing all my sorrows  and took my own departure with the governor  On my arrival at Valencia  Don Caesar and his daughter in law spared no exertions to divert my sorrows from perpetual brooding  they plied me alternately with every sort of amusement  the most proper to turn the current of my thoughts to passing objects  but  in spite of all their pains  I remained plunged in melancholy  whence they were incompetent to draw me out  Nor was it for want of Scipio s kind attentions that my peace of mind was still so hopeless  he was continually going back and fore between Lirias and Valencia to inquire after me  and his journey home was cheerful or gloomy  in proportion as he found more or less disposition in me to listen to the words of comfort  and to reward the affectionate solicitude of my friends   He came one morning into my room  Sir  said he  with a great deal of agitation in his manner  a report is current about town  in which the whole monarchy is deeply interested it is said that Philip the Third has departed this life  and that the prince  his son  is actually seated on the throne  To this it is added  that the cardinal Duke of Lerma has lost the premiership  that he is even forbidden to appear at court  and that Don Gaspard de Guzman  Count of Olivarez  is actually at the head of the administration  I felt a little agitated by this sudden change  without knowing why  Scipio caught at this manifestation  and asked whether the veering of the wind in the political horizon might not blow me some good  How is that possible  What good can it blow me  my worthy friend  answered I  The court and I have shaken hands once for all  the revolutions which may take place there are all alike indifferent to me   For a man at your time of life  replied that cunning son of a diviner  you are uncommonly mortified to all the uses of this world  Under your circumstances my curiosity would be all alive  I should go to Madrid and show my face to the young monarch  just to see whether he would recollect it  merely for the amusement of the thing  I understand you  said I  you would have me return to court and try my fortune again  or rather you would plunge me back into the gulf of avarice and ambition  Why should such baleful passions any more take possession of your breast  rejoined Scipio  Do not so much play the calumniator on your own virtue  I will answer for your firmness to yourself  The sound moral reflections which your disgrace has occasioned you to make on the vanities of a court life  are a sufficient security against all the dangers to be feared from that quarter  Embark boldly once again upon an ocean where are acquainted with every shoal and rock in the dangerous navigation  Hold your tongue  you flatterer  said I  with a smile of no very positive discouragement  are you weary of seeing me lead a retired and tranquil life  I thought my repose had been more dear to you   Just at this period of our conversation  Don Caesar and his son came in  They confirmed the news of the king s death  as well as the Duke of Lerma s misfortune  It appeared  moreover  that this minister  having requested permission to retire to Rome  had not been able to obtain it  but was ordered to confine himself to his marquisate at Denia  On this  as if they had been in league with my secretary  they advised me to go to Madrid and offer my congratulations to the new king  as one of his former acquaintances  with the merit of having rendered him even such services  as the great are apt to reward more willingly than some which are performed with cleaner hands  For my part  said Don Alphonso  I have no doubt but they will be liberally acknowledged  Philip the Fourth is bound in honour to pay the Prince of Spain
