 resembles strongly       I am interrupted  adieu  for a moment       It was my Rivers  he brought me a bouquet  I opened the door  supposing it was my mother  conscious of what I had been writing  I was confused at seeing him  he smiled  and guessing the reason of my embarrassment   I must leave you  Emily  you are writing  and  by your blushes  I know you have been talking of your lover        I should have told you  he insists on never seeing the letters I write  and gives this reason for it  That he should be a great loser by seeing them  as it would restrain my pen when I talk of him       I believe  I am very foolish in my tenderness  but you will forgive me        Rivers yesterday was throwing flowers at me and Lucy  in play  as we were walking in the garden  I catched a wall flower  and  by an involuntary impulse  kissed it  and placed it in my bosom       He observed me  and his look of pleasure and affection is impossible to be described  What exquisite pleasure there is in these agreable follies       He is the sweetest trifler in the world  my dear Bell  but in what does he not excel all mankind       As the season of autumnal flowers is almost over  he is sending for all those which blow early in the spring  he prevents every wish his Emily can form       Did you ever  my dear  see so fine an autumn as this  you will  perhaps  smile when I say  I never saw one so pleasing  such a season is more lovely than even the spring  I want you down before this agreable weather is all over       I am going to air with my mother  my Rivers attends us on horseback  you cannot think how amiable his attention is to both       Adieu  my dear  my mother has sent to let me know she is ready   Your affectionate  EMILY RIVERS     LETTER CCV   205   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Oct  24   SOME author has said   The happiness of the next world  to the virtuous  will consist in enjoying the society of minds like their own         Why then should we not do our best to possess as much as possible of this happiness here       You will see this is a preface to a very earnest request to see Captain Fermor and the lovely Bell immediately at our farm  take notice  I will not admit even business as an excuse much longer       I am just come from a walk in the wood behind the house  with my mother and Emily  I want you to see it before it loses all its charms  in another fortnight  its present variegated foliage will be literally humbled in the dust        There is something very pleasing in this season  if it did not give us the idea of the winter  which is approaching too fast       The dryness of the air  the soft western breeze  the tremulous motion of the falling leaves  the rustling of those already fallen under our feet  their variety of lively colors  give a certain spirit and agreable fluctuation to the scene  which is unspeakably pleasing       By the way  we people of warm imaginations have vast advantages over others  we scorn to be confined to present scenes  or to give attention to such trifling objects as times and seasons       I already anticipate the spring  see the woodbines and wild roses bloom in my grove  and almost catch the gale of perfume   Twelve o clock       I have this moment received your letter       I am sorry for what you tell me of Miss H—  whose want of art has led her into indiscretions        Tis too common to see the most innocent  nay  even the most laudable actions censured by the world  as we cannot  however  eradicate the prejudices of others  it is wisdom to yield to them in things which are indifferent       One ought to conform to  and respect the customs  as well as the laws and religion of our country  where they are not contrary to virtue  and to that moral sense which heaven has imprinted on our souls  where they are contrary  every generous mind will despise them       I agree with you  my dear friend  that two persons who love  not only seem  but really are  handsomer to each other than to the rest of the world       When we look at those we ardently love  a new softness steals unperceived into the eyes  the countenance is more animated  and the whole form has that air of tender languor which has such charms for sensible minds       To prove the truth of this  my Emily approaches  fair as the rising morn  led by the hand of the Graces  she sees her lover  and every charm is redoubled  an involuntary smile  a blush of pleasure  speak a
