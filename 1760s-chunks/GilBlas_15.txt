it  I mounted my mule  and saw the outside of the town       CH  II    Gil Blas  alarm on his road to Pegnaflor  his adventures on his arrival in that town  and the character of the men with whom he supped   HERE I am  then  on the other side of Oviedo  in the road to Pegnaflor  with the world before me  as yet my own master  as well master of a bad mule and forty good ducats  without reckoning on a little supplementary cash purloined from my much  honoured uncle  The first thing I did was to let my mule go as the beast liked  that is to say  very lazily  I dropped the rein  and taking out my ducats  began to count them backwards and forwards in my hat  I was out of my wits for joy  never having seen such a sum of money before  and could not help looking at it and sifting it through my fingers  I had counted it over about the twentieth time  when all at once my mule  with head raised  and ears pricked up  stood stock still in the middle of the high road  I thought  to be sure  something was the matter  looked about for a cause  and perceiving a hat upon the ground  with a rosary of large beads  at the same time heard a lugubrious voice pronounce these words  Pray  honoured master  have pity on a poor maimed soldier  Please to throw a few small pieces into this hat  you shall be rewarded for it in the other world  I looked immediately on the side whence the voice proceeded  and saw  just by a thicket  twenty or thirty paces from me  a sort of a soldier  who had mounted the barrel of a confounded long carbine on two cross sticks  and seemed to be taking aim at me  At a sight which made me tremble for the patrimony of the Church committed to my care  I stopped short  made sure of my ducats  and taking out a little small change  as I rode by the hat  placed to receive the charity of those quiet subjects who had not the courage to refuse it  dropped in my contribution in detail  to convince the soldier how nobly I dealt by him  He was satisfied with my liberality  and gave me a blessing for every kick I gave my mule in my impatience to get out of his way  but the infernal beast  without partaking in the slightest degree of my impatience  went at the old steady pace  A long custom of jogging on fair and softly under my uncle s weight had obliterated every idea of that motion called a gallop   The prospect of my journey was not much improved by this adventure as a specimen  I considered within myself that I had yet some distance to Salamanca  and might  not improbably  meet with something worse  My uncle seemed to have been very imprudent not to have consigned me to the care of a muleteer  That  to be sure  was what he ought to have done  but his notion was  that by giving me his mule  my journey would be cheaper  and that entered more into his calculation than the dangers in which I might be involved on the road  To retrieve his error  therefore  I resolved  if I had the good luck to arrive safe at Pegnaflor  to offer my mule for sale  and take the opportunity of a muleteer going to Astorga  whence I might get to Salamanca by a similar conveyance  Though I had never been out of Oviedo I was acquainted with the names of the towns through which I was to pass  a species of information I took care to procure before my setting out   I got safe and sound to Pegnaflor  and stopped at the door of a very decent looking inn  My foot was scarcely out of the stirrup before the landlord was at my side  overwhelming me with public  house civility  He untied my cloakbag with his own hands  swung it across his shoulders  and ushered my Honour into a room  while one of his men led my mule to the stable  This landlord  the most busy prattler of the Asturias  ready to bother you impertinently about his own concerns  and  at the same time  with a sufficient portion of curiosity to worm himself into the knowledge of yours  was not long in telling me that his name was Andrew Corcuelo  that he had seen some service as a sergeant in the army  which he had quitted fifteen months ago  and married a girl of Castropol  who  though a little tawny or so  knew how to make both ends meet as well as the best of them  He told me a thousand things besides which he might just as well have kept private  Thinking himself entitled  after this voluntary confidence  to an equal share of mine  he asked me in a breath  and without further preface  whence I came  whither I was going  and who I was  To all this I felt myself bound to answer  article by article  because  though rather abrupt in asking them  he accompanied each question with so
