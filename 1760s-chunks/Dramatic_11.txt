absurd in me—in me  to descend from being an actor s  nay a manager s mistress  and become a chairman s wife—perish that thought—can I bear it  can I  dear Miss Shred  can I  who came from a gentleman s family  Yes  madam  my papa was a counsellor at law  he was prosecuted for his merit  persecuted for the superiority of his talents  and banished from his native country by faction  but I am his own daughter  and can I ever agree to have these arms filled with any body  who is not a gentleman born  or who is not so by profession  or is not a person of consequence  ay  consequence  that was what my deceiver Samly used to insist upon  his consequence  but why should I mention him  or any other belonging to the stage  I  who have suffered by my fatal connection with an actor  O  that the world was all in flames  that final destruction might seize on all  since I am deceived  deserted  Farther she could not proceed  for her friend  fearful least her companion should relapse into fresh grief  snatched up the pewter measure in a moment  in which was one remaining cordial draught  and holding it to Chloe s lips  insisted on her not making any more words  but drink it off     CHLOE    Wiping her lips   Dear Shred  you are so immensely kind  that  to convince you of my esteem  I will be ruled by you  and marry this horrid creature  nay  I ll do more  for from henceforth I bid  Page  30  adieu to all high life t ideas  to the fond charms of even dear intrigue     Miss SHRED   Miss Justice  you should not make rash vows  consider  my dear  you are a gentlewoman  and many gentlewomen marry only for the sake of intriguing  we should use the sex as that sex ought to be used  I would always chuse the man  who I fancied most properest for my interest  to be my husband  and then chuse the man  whom I most fancied  for my lover     CHLOE   But how  dear creature  am I sure  that as this odd mortal  this David  my landlord  now he knows I was only Samly s mistress  how am I sure  I say  that he will have me for a wife  and upon my soul  I would sooner die than derogate so far from the dignity of my birth  and my principles of honour  as to live with any man but a gentleman  without being married to him     Miss SHRED   As to that  my dear  you are vastly in the right on t  and our sex ought to be as strict in keeping up our consequence  in that point  as any  or more than any other  but as to the landlord s knowing of your having an affair — to be sure  although he is but a chairman  yet he is a Welshman  and he might  perhaps  have too much spirit  had he not lived so many years at this end of the town  as to know that it is fashionable  and what is fashionable  you know  must be polite  Besides  my dear  not one of  Page  31  his companions dare to hit him in the teeth with it  if he was to marry you  for fear of offending one or other of their best customers     CHLOE   I am determined  but  at the same time  am as determined  to avoid even the appearance of intrigue  what other ladies of taste and delicacy do  shall be no rule for me to go by  I will be true to my husband  my honour  and myself  nor ever again grant any other man  save him  an involuntary embrace     The next week s sun saw her blazon d in the matrimonial installation  With how much firmness of soul  she maintained her resolution of chastity  will be expressed in some of the succeeding chapters  In the conclusion of this  I hope  the reader will give me leave to observe  that though  like Miss Shred  ladies may be women of the town  and actresses at the same time  and that there are some females belonging to the Theatres  who  now publickly act in both capacities  yet so far from being a reproach  it is the greatest argument  which can be brought  in support of the profession of a player  for although the want of chastity  like the want of money  may make some people appear but in an indifferent light  yet  according to the times  neither of them have any thing to do  at present  with the respect which is paid to the accomplishments of genius     Page  32  SCENE MATRIMONY   ON the wedding night  after the raptures of enjoyment between Mr  and Madam Llwhyddwhudd were evaporated  when every heart felt thrill and throb of desire subsided  each fine string of delight  which had been
