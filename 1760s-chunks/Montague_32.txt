ordered your brother to come and walk with us from morning till night  every day and all the day       The dear man was amazingly overjoyed to see us again  we shared in his joy  though my little Emily took some pains to appear tranquil on the occasion  I never saw more pleasure in the countenances of two people in my life  nor more pains taken to suppress it        Do you know Fitzgerald is really an agreable fellow  I have an admirable natural instinct  I perceived he had understanding  from his aquiline nose and his eagle eye  which are indexes I never knew fail  I believe we are going to be great  I am not sure I shall not admit him to make up a partie quarrée with your brother and Emily  I told him my original plot upon him  and he was immensely pleased with it  I almost fancy he can be foolish  in that case  my business is done  if with his other merits he has that  I am a lost woman       He has excellent sense  great good nature  and the true princely spirit of an Irishman  he will be ruined here  but that is his affair  not mine  He changed quarters with an officer now at Montreal  and  because the lodgings were to be furnished  thought himself obliged to leave three months wine in the cellars       His person is pleasing  he has good eyes and teeth  the only beauties I require   is marked with the small pox  which in men gives a sensible look  very manly  and looks extremely like a gentleman       He comes  the conqueror comes       I see him plainly through the trees  he is now in full view  within twenty yards of the house  He looks particularly well on horseback  Lucy  which is one certain proof of a good education  The fellow is well born  and has ideas of things  I think I shall admit him of my train       Emily wonders I have never been in love  the cause is clear  I have prevented any attachment to one man  by constantly flirting with twenty   tis the most sovereign receipt in the world  I think too  my dear  you have maintained a sort of running fight with the little deity  our hour is not yet come  Adieu   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER XXXVIII   38   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Oct  15  evening   I AM returned  my dear  and have had the pleasure of hearing you and my mother are well  though I have had no letters from either of you       Mr  Temple  my dearest Lucy  tells me he has visited you  Will you pardon me a freedom which nothing but the most tender friendship can warrant  when I tell you that I would wish you to be as little acquainted with him as politeness allows  He is a most agreable man  perhaps too agreable  with a thousand amiable qualities  he is the man I love above all others  and  where women are not concerned  a man of the most unblemished honor  but his manner of life is extremely libertine  and his ideas of women unworthy the rest of his character  he knows not the perfections which adorn the valuable part of your sex  he is a stranger to your virtues  and incapable  at least I fear so  of that tender affection which alone can make an amiable woman happy  With all this  he is polite and attentive  and has a manner  which  without intending it  is calculated to deceive women into an opinion of his being attached when he is not  he has all the splendid virtues which command esteem  is noble  generous  disinterested  open  brave  and is the most dangerous man on earth to a woman of honor  who is unacquainted with the arts of man       Do not however mistake me  my Lucy  I know him to be as incapable of forming improper designs on you  even were you not the sister of his friend  as you are of listening to him if he did   tis for your heart alone I am alarmed  he is formed to please  you are young and inexperienced  and have not yet loved  my anxiety for your peace makes me dread your loving a man whose views are not turned to marriage  and who is therefore incapable of returning properly the tenderness of a woman of honor       I have seen my divine Emily  her manner of receiving me was very flattering  I cannot doubt her friendship for me  yet I am not absolutely content  I am however convinced  by the easy tranquillity of her air  and her manner of bearing this delay of their marriage  that she does not love the man for whom she is intended  she has been a victim to the avarice of her friends  I would fain hope yet what have I to hope  If I had even the happiness to be agreable to her  if she was disengaged from Sir George  my fortune makes it impossible for me to marry her
