real wit  She thought him therefore a very fine gentleman  and such as consider what powerful ingredients a good figure  fine cloaths  and fortune  are in that character  will easily forgive her  Mr  Thornhill  notwithstanding his real ignorance  talked with ease  and could expatiate upon the common topics of conversation with fluency  It is not surprising then that such talents should win the affections of a girl  who by education was taught to value an appearance in herself  and consequently to set a value upon it when found in another   Upon his departure  we again entered into a debate upon the merits of our young landlord  As he directed his looks and  Page  63  conversation to Olivia  it was no longer doubted but that she was the object that induced him to be our visitor  Nor did she seem to be much displeased at the innocent raillery of her brother and sister upon this occasion  Even Deborah herself seemed to share the glory of the day  and exulted in her daughter s victory as if it were her own    And now  my dear    cried she to me    I ll fairly own  that it was I that instructed my girls to encourage our landlord s addresses  I had always some ambition  and you now see that I was right  for who knows how this may end     Ay  who knows that indeed    answered I  with a groan    for my part I don t much like it  and I could have been better pleased with one that was poor and honest  than this fine gentleman with his fortune and infidelity  for depend on t  if he be what I suspect him  no free thinker shall ever have a child of mine      Page  64   Sure  father    cried Moses    you are too severe in this  for heaven will never arraign him for what he thinks  but for what he does  Every man has a thousand vicious thoughts  which arise without his power to suppress  Thinking freely of religion  may be involuntary with this gentleman  so that allowing his sentiments to be wrong  yet as he is purely passive in their reception  he is no more to be blamed for their incursions than the governor of a city without walls for the shelter he is obliged to afford an invading enemy         True  my son    cried I    but if the governor invites the enemy  there he is justly culpable  And such is always the case with those who embrace error  The vice does not lie in assenting to the proofs they see  but in being blind to many of the proofs that offer  Like corrupt judges on a bench  they determine right on that part of the evidence they hear  but they will not hear all the  Page  65  evidence  Thus  my son  though our erroneous opinions be involuntary when formed  yet as we have been wilfully corrupt  or very negligent in forming them  we deserve punishment for our vice  or contempt for our folly      My wife now kept up the conversation  though not the argument  she observed  that several very prudent men of our acquaintance were free thinkers  and made very good husbands  and she knew some sensible girls that had skill enough to make converts of their spouses    And who knows  my dear    continued she    what Olivia may be able to do  The girl has a great deal to say upon every subject  and to my knowledge is very well skilled in controversy         Why  my dear  what controversy can she have read    cried I    It does not occur to my memory that I ever put such books into her hands  you certainly over rate her merit     Indeed  pappa    Page  66  replied Olivia    she does not  I have read a great deal of controversy  I have read the disputes between Thwackum and Square  the controversy between Robinson Crusoe and Friday the savage  and I am now employed in reading the controversy in Religious courtship    —   Very well    cried I    that s a good girl  I find you are perfectly qualified for making converts  and so go help your mother to make the gooseberry pye      Page   unnumbered   CHAP  VIII   An amour  which promises little good fortune  yet may be productive of much   THE next morning we were again visited by Mr  Burchell  though I began  for certain reasons  to be displeased with the frequency of his return  but I could not refuse him my company and fire side  It is true his labour more than requited his entertainment  sor he wrought among us with vigour  and either in the meadow or at the hay rick put himself foremost  Besides  he had always something amusing to say that lessened our toil  and was at once so out of the way  and yet so sensible
