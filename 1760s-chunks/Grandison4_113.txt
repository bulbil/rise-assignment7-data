he told me afterwards  beheld so   281 much pleasure and pain struggling in the same countenance  as in that of the Lady  so fixed a melancholy  as in that of the Marquis  Mr  Lowther is a man of spirit  tho  a modest man  He is  as on every proper occasion I found  a man of piety  and has a heart tender as manly  Such a man  heart and hand  is qualified for a profession which is the most useful and certain in the art of healing  He is a man of sense and learning out of his profession  and happy in his address   The two surgeons who now attend Signor Jeronymo▪ are both of this country  They were sent for  With the approbation  and at the request  of the family  I presented Mr  Lowther to them  but first gave them his character  as a modest man  as a man of skill  and experience  and told them  that he had quitted business  and wanted not either fame or fortune   They acquainted him with the case  and their methods of proceeding  Mr  Lowther assisted in the dressings that very evening  Jeronymo would have me to be present  Mr  Lowther suggested an alteration in their method  but in so easy and gentle a manner  as if he doubted not  but such was their intention when the state of the wounds would admit of that method of treatment  that the gentlemen came readily into it  A great deal of matter had been collected  by means of the wrong methods pursued  and he proposed  if the patient s strength would bear it  to make an aperture below the principal wound  in order to discharge the matter downward  and he suggested the dressing with hollow tents and bandage  and to dismiss the large tents  with which they had been accustomed to distend the wound  to the extreme anguish of the patient  on pretence of keeping it open  to assist the discharge   Let me now give you  my dear friend  a brief history of my Jeronymo s case  and of the circumstances   282 which have attended it  by which you will be able to account for the difficulties of it  and how it has happened  that  in such a space of time  either the cure was not effected  or that the patient yielded not to the common destiny   In lingering cases  patients or their friends are sometimes too apt to blame their physicians  and to listen to new recommendations  The surgeons attending this unhappy case  had been more than once changed  Signor Jeronymo  it seems  was unskilfully treated by the young surgeon of Cremona  who was first engaged  He neglected the most dangerous wound  and when he attended to it  managed it wrong  for want of experience  He was therefore very properly dismissed   The unhappy man had at first three wounds  One in his breast  which had been for some time healed  one in his shoulder  which  through his own impatience  having been too suddenly healed up  was obliged to be laid open again  the other  which is the most dangerous  in the hip joint   A surgeon of this place  and another of Padua  were next employed  The cure not advancing  a surgeon of eminence  from Paris  was sent for   Mr  Lowther tells me  that this man s method was by far the most eligible  but that he undertook too much  since  from the first  there could not be any hope  from the nature of the wound in the hip joint  that the patient could ever walk  without sticks or crutches  And of this opinion were the other two surgeons  But the French gentleman was so very pragmatical  that he would neither draw with them  nor give reasons for what he did  regarding them only as his assistants  They could not long bear this usage  and gave up to him in disgust   How cruel is punctilio  among men of this science  in cases of difficulty and danger   The present operators  when the two others had   283 given up  were not  but by leave of the French gentleman  called in  He valuing himself on his practice in the Royal Hospital of Invalids at Paris  looked upon them as Theorists only  and treated them with as little ceremony as he had shewn the others  So that at last  from their frequent differences  it became necessary to part with either him  or them  His pride  when he knew that this question was a subject of debate  would not allow him to leave the family an option  He made his demand  It was complied with  and he returned to Paris   From what this gentleman threw out at parting  to the disparagement of the two others  Signor Jeronymo suspected their skill  and from a hint of this suspicion  as soon as I knew I should be welcome myself  I procured the favour of Mr  Lowther s attendance   All Mr  Lowther s fear is  that Signor Jeronymo has been kept too long in hand by the different managements of the several operators  and that
