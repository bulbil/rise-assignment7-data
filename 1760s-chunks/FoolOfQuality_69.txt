says Harry  Why should you box with me    Harry  sure I did nt strike you  says Tom  Yes  sir  replied our   hero  you struck me when you struck Dicky  and knew that he   was my brother  Nay  Harry  cried Tom  if it s fight you are for    I ll give you enough of it  I warrant you      Tom was about eight months older than Harry  his equal in the   practice of arms  and much the stronger  But Harry was full as         42 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      tall  and his motions  quicker than thought  prevented the ward   of the most experienced adversary      Together they rushed like two little tigers  At once they struck   and parried  and  watching every opening  they darted their little   fists like engines at each other  But Tom  marking the quickness    and feeling the smart of Harry s strokes  suddenly leaped within   his arms  bore him down to the earth  and triumphantly gave him   the first rising blow      Harry rose indignant  but warned by the strength of his adversary   to better caution  He now fought more aloof  and  as Tom pressed   upon him  he at once guarded  struck  and wheeled like an ex    perienced cock  without quitting the pit of honour      Tom  finding himself wholly foiled by this Parthian method of   combat  again rushed upon his enemy  who was now aware of the   shock  They closed  they grappled  they caught each other by the   shoulders  joined head to head  and breast to breast  and stood like   two pillars  merely supported by their bearing against one another    Again they shifted the left arm  caught each other about the neck    and cuffed and punched at face and stomach  without mercy or re    mission  till Tom  impatient of this length of battle  gave Harry   a side swing  and Harry  giving Tom a trip at the same time  they   fell side by side together upon the earth      They rose and retreated to draw breath  as by mutual consent    They glared on one another with an eye of vindictive apprehen    sion  For neither of them could now boast of more optics than   Polyphemus  and from their foreheads to their shoes they were   in one gore of blood      Again they flew upon each other  again they struck  foined  and   defended  and alternately pressed on and retreated in turns  till   Harry  spying an opening  darted his fist like a shot into the re    maining eye of his enemy  Tom  finding himself in utter dark    ness  instantly sprung upon his foe  and endeavoured to grapple     but Harry with equal agility avoided the shock  and traversing here   and there  beat his adversary at pleasure   till Tom cried out I   yield  I yield  Harry  for I can t see to fight any more      Then Harry took Tom by the hand  and led him to his clothes    and  having assisted him to dress  he next did the same friendly office   to himself  Then  arm in arm  they returned much more loving in   reality than they set out  having been beaten into a true respect   and affection for each other      Some time before this the footman had joined his young lord  with   the several implements required for nutting  They had already   pulled down great quantities   the young quality had stuffed their   pockets   and the little plebeians who had assisted were now per    mitted to be busy in gathering up the refuse  When all turning   at the cry of There is Harry  there is Tom   they perceived our   two champions advancing leisurely  but hand in hand  as friends   and brothers      They had left their clothes unbuttoned for the benefit of the   cooling air   and  as they approached  their companions were frozen   into astonishment at the sight of their two friends all covered   with crimson          TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  43     They were neither able to advance to meet them  nor to speak   when they arrived  Till Lord Dicky first inquired into this bloody   catastrophe  and Harry remaining wholly silent on the subject    blind Tommy cried out Why  Master Dicky  the truth is  that   Harry beat me because I beat you  Then Dicky  feeling a sudden   gush of gratitude and affection rising up in his bosom  looked wist    fully
