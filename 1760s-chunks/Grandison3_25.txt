reformation of one who never was well principled  All that is wished for  in the latter  is that she may be made unhurtful  Her highest good was never more then harmlessness  She that was once good  cannot be easy  when she is in a true state of penitence  till she is restored to that from which she was induced to depart   You understand these matters  cousin  I don t  But if you will favour me with more of your company  I shall  I believe  be the better for your notions  But I must talk about this woman  nephew  I am calm now  I must talk of this woman now—I am resolved to part with her  I can bear her no longer  Did you n•• mind how she pulled the door after her  tho  you were present   I did  my Lord  But it was plain  that something disagreeable had passed before  or she could not so intirely have forgot herself  But  my Lord  we will postpone this subject  if you please  If you yourself   61 lead to it after dinner  I will attend to it  with all my heart   Well  then  be it so  But now tell me  Have you  nephew  any thoughts of marriage   I have great honour for the state  an hope to be one day happy in it   Well said—And are you at liberty  kinsman  to receive a proposal of that nature   And then  without waiting for my answer  he proposed Lady Frances N  and said  he had been spoken to on that subject   I answered  that the Lady was very deserving  but that I should think myself under too great obligations to a wife  for my own ease  if there were a woman in the world whom I could prefer to her   Well  what think you of Lady Anne S   I am told  that she is likely to be the Lady  She has a noble fortune  Your sisters  I hear  are friends to Lady Anne   My sisters wish me happily married  I have such an opinion of both those Ladies  that it would give me some little pain  to imagine each would not  in her turn  refuse me  were I offered to her  as I cannot  myself  make the offer  I cannot bear  my Lord  to think of returning slight for respect  to my own sex  But as to Ladies  how can we expect that delicacy and dignity from them  which are the bulwarks of their virtue  if we do not treat them with dignity   Charming notions  If you had them not abroad  you had them from your mother  She was all that was excellent in woman   Indeed she was  Excellent woman  She was always before my eyes   And excellent kinsman too  Now I know your reverence for your mother  I will allow of all you say of your father  because I see it is all from principle  I have known some men who have spoken with reverence of their mothers  to give themselves dignity    62 That is to say  for bringing creatures so important as themselves into the world  and who have exacted respect to the good old women who were merely good old women  as we call them  in order to take the incense  offered the parent  into their own nostrils  This was duty in parade   The observation my good Dr  Barlett  I thought above my Lord W  I think I have heard one like it  made by my father  who saw very far into men  but was sometimes led  by his wit  into saying a severe thing  And yet  whenever I hear a man praised highly for the performance of common duties  as for being a good husband  a good son  or a kind father  tho  each is comparatively praise worthy  I conclude  that there is nothing extraordinary to be said of him  To call a man a good FRIEND  is indeed comprizing all the duties in one word  For friendship is the balm  as well as seasoning  of life  And a man cannot be defective in any of the social duties  who is capable of it  when the term is rightly understood   Well  cousin  since you cannot think of either of those Ladies  how should you like the rich and beautiful Countess of R   You know what an excellent character she bears   I do  But  my Lord  I should not choose to marry a widow  And yet  generally  I do not disrespect widows  nor imagine those men to blame who marry them  But as my circumstances are not unhappy  and as riches will never be my principal inducement in the choice of a wife  I may be allowed to indulge my peculiarities  especially as I shall hope  and I should not deserve a good wife if I did not  that  when once married  I shall be married for my whole life   The Countess once declared  said my Lord  before half a score in company  two of them her
