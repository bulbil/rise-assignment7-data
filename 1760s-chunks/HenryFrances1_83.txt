 should I attempt  would not only be impracticable  but explained into an Act of the highest Disregard and Ingratitude  by my Aunt —Is not this a pleasant Situation     288I have read six or seven Chapters of Montaigne  but  as I read regularly  am not come to that  you lately mentioned  on Cruelty  I like him vastly  and have a Kind of Pleasure in recalling the Ideas he inspired me with some Years ago  I am ashamed  and sorry to tell you  that I think my Understanding and Judgment were infinitely superior  even in my childish Days  to what they are at present  I can only account for it by my Thoughts being more dissipated  and eagerly engaged in a Variety of Pursuits  than they then were  And  there being  at first  but a slight Foundation  it was intirely destroyed in the Division  I will not expatiate farther on those Merits  which  as I no longer possess them  may appear to you quite imaginary  but shall build all my Hopes of your Regard on one  which neither Time nor Chance can alter—that of being sincerely and affectionately  Your s   LETTER CXLVII   HOW could you take me to Task so unfairly as you did  about my Carelessness  with Regard to your Inquiries  Recollect yourself of my Letter to Kitty  you ll find  when I had sealed mine to you  that Post  George brought me your Letter from —  I was then writing to Kitty about Business  and I thought the Account of my Health would come as quickly   289 to you by a Paragraph in her Letter  as if I had broke open a Seal  to inform you of it in your s  This would have been such a Piece of Formality  as I would be very sorry  we were upon Terms to require  As for the critical and philosophical Subjects of my Letters  which you so genteely reprimand  let me make this Apology for them  That they never once diverted me from answering  and observing upon every single Paragraph of your Letters  and I only essay my own Fund  when I have nothing better to comment upon   Your Observation upon disagreable Company is very pretty  and just  They destroy the Pleasures of Solitude  but leave us the irksome Part of it  which is  the Remembrance of our absent Friends  and this too in a stronger Manner than when alone  by affording us an Opportunity of Comparison  I am sure you make a provoking Comparison between your former and present Understanding  and the Reason that you thought better of the first  was  because it was the weakest  Our Humility increases in Proportion to our Sense and Knowledge A Person in a Valley is insensible of the narrow Circumference of his Sight  but mounting up the Hill  the Extent of Prospect betrays the short Limits of that Sense  If you will rest your Opinion upon my Judgment in this Matter  be assured that I never said any Thing either of your Sense  Wit  Taste  or other Merits  that I   290 did not really think to the full Extent of the Letter   I am   my dearest Fanny   your s Au pied du Lettre   LETTER CXLVIII   Dear FANNY   THE Lines you desire  are not worth sending  but to write good Verses is one Thing  and to obey is another  so  according to your Commands  take what follows           A vile Phrase  and worse Matter  but both preferable to the Subject  I suspect these were not the Lines  you enquired for  and fancy those wrote in — were what you meant  tho  I believe I gave you them before  They had some Spirit it them  but alluded to secret History so much  that they could not be understood without a Comment  which I shall never give   Let us now proceed to Prose  for I look upon Verse  I mean Rhyme  to be such a Device for reading or writing  as the jingling Bells  which our Carters use  that are supposed to encourage   291 their Brutes to labour with more Chearfulness  and I shall ever honour that Critick  in the Class of false Taste  who said that Milton wanted only the Ornament of Rhyme  to render him perfect  Such a Genius would cut all the Trees of a Forest into Pyramids  and fashion Mount Athos into the Figure of a Man  as was projected once by Alexander  and shew the Power of Art  by it s  Violence upon Nature   To give you my Opinion of Rhyme  I look upon Puns to be a Species of it  as they are a Jingling of Words  and a Tinkling of Sounds  Indeed  those  who can write like you  may be excused  where the real Beauties of Poety render the Reader insensible to the Crambo  but then this Apology is such a one  as is made for the Quibbling of Shakespear  that the false Relish of the Age required such a Condescension  You use Verse  as you do Cloaths  not for the Ornament  but in Compliance to Custom  and not because you have
