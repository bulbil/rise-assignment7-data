in the prices of beef and mutton  I always looked on that as the   province of a wife  it is enough for me to discharge all reasonable   demands on that score  and  since you provoke me to it  I must tell you    Madam   continued he   that what my table wants of being compleat  is   robbed from it by the idle superfluities you women are so fond of  and   with which  I think  I ought to have no manner of concern        As she was not able to comprehend the meaning of these words  she was   extremely astonished at them  and  in a pretty hasty manner  demanded a   detail of those superfluities he accused her of  on which  throwing   himself back in his chair  and looking on her with the most careless and   indifferent air he could assume  he replied in these terms        I know not   said he   what fool it was that first introduced the   article of pin money into marriage writings  Nothing  certainly  is more   idle  since a woman ought to have nothing apart from her husband  but    as it is grown into a custom  and I have condescended to comply with it    you should  I think  of your own accord  and without giving me the   trouble of reminding you of it  convert some part of it  at least  to   such uses as might ease me of a burden I have  indeed  no kind of reason   to be loaded with  As  for example   continued he   coffee  tea    chocolate  with all the appendages belonging to them  have no business   to be enrolled in the list of housekeeping expences  and consequently   not to be taken out of what I allow you for that purpose        Here he gave over speaking  but the consternation his wife was in   preventing her from making any immediate answer  he resumed his   discourse   Since we are upon this topick  my dear   said he   it will   be the best to tell you at once what I expect from you  it is but one   thing more  which is this  You have a man entirely to yourself  I am   willing he should eat with the family  but as to his livery and wages  I   think it highly reasonable you should be at the charge of        The innate rage which  during the whole time he had been talking    swelled her breast to almost bursting  would now no longer be confined     Good Heavens   cried she   to what have I reduced myself   Is this to   be a wife   Is this the state of wedlock   Call it rather an Egyptian   bondage   The cruel task masters of the Israelites could exact no more    Ungrateful man  pursued she  bursting into tears   is this the love  the   tenderness  you vowed        Overwhelmed with passion  she was capable of uttering no more  but   continued walking about the room in a disordered motion  and all the   tokens of the most outrageous grief and anger  He sat silent for some   time  but  at last  looking somewhat more kindly on her than he had   done   Pr ythee  my dear   said he   don t let me see you give way to   emotions so unbecoming of yourself  and so unjust to me  You shall have   no occasion to complain of my want of love and tenderness  you know what   my expectations are  and when once I have gained my point  you may be   sure  for my own sake  I shall do every thing suitable to it  I would   only have you behave with a little prudence for the present        In concluding these words  he rose and took hold of her hand  but   approached her with an air so cold and indifferent  as was far from   atoning  with a woman of her penetration  for the unkindness of his late   proposal   No  Mr  Munden   cried she  haughtily turning from him   do   not imagine I am so weak as to expect  after what you have said  any   thing but ill usage         I have said nothing that I have cause to repent of   answered he   and   hope that  when this heat is over  you will do me the justice to think   so too  I leave you to consider it  and bring yourself into a better   humour against my return   He added no more  but took his hat and sword
