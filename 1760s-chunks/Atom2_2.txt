money of the empire  and persuaded   7 the people not only to beggar themselves  but likewise to entail indigence upon their latest posterity  and all for the sake of Yesso  It is by dint of these efforts I have been able to subsidize Brut an tiffi  and raise an army of one hundred thousand men to defend your imperial majesty s farm  which  were the entire property of it brought to market  would not fetch one third part of the sums which are now yearly expended in its defence  I shall strike but one great stroke in the country of Fatsisio  and then turn the whole stream of the war into the channel of Tartary  until the barren plains of Yesso are fertilized with human blood  In the mean time  I must insist upon your majesty s continuing in the dark  and amusing yourself in your cabinet with the trumpet and other gewgaws which I have provided for your   8 diversion  otherwise I quit the reins of administration  and turn the monster out of my trammels  in which case  like the dog that returns to its vomit  it will not fail to take up its former prejudices against Yesso  which I have with such pains obliged it to resign  — O my dear Taycho   cried the affrighted Dairo  talk not of leaving me in such a dreadful dilemma  Rather than the dear farm should fall into the hands of the Chinese  I would be contented to be led about blindfold all the days of my life —Proceed in your own way —I invest you with full power and authority  not only to gag my whole council  but even to nail their ears to the pillory  should it be found necessary for the benefit of Yesso  In token of which delegation  present your posteriors  and I will bestow upon you a double portion of my favour    Taycho humbly thanked his imperial   9 majesty for the great honour he intended him  but begged leave to decline the ceremony  on account of the haemorrhoids  which at that time gave him great disturbance     The orator having thus annihilated all opposition in the council of Twenty eight  repaired to his own house  in order to plan the operations of the ensuing campaign  Tho  he had reinforced the army in Tartary with the flower of the Japonese soldiery  and destined a strong squadron of Fune  as usual  to parade on the coast of China  he foresaw it would be necessary to amuse the people with some new stroke on the side of Fatsisio  which indeed was the original  and the most natural scene of the war  He locked himself up in his closet  and in consulting the map of Fatsisio  he found that the principal Chinese settlement of that   10 island  was a fortified town called Quib quab  to which there was access by two different avenues  one by a broad  rapid  navigable river  on the banks of which the town was situated  and the other by an inland route over mountains  lakes  and dangerous torrents  He measured the map with his compass  and perceived that both routes were nearly of the same length  and therefore he resolved that the forces in Fatsisio  being divided into two equal bodies  should approach the place by the two different avenues  on the supposition that they would both arrive before the walls of Quib quab at the same instant of time  The conduct of the inland expedition was given to Yaffray  who now commanded in chief in Fatsisio  and the rest of the troops were sent up the great river  under the auspices of Ya loff  who had so   11 eminently distinguished himself in the course of the preceding year   Orator Taycho had received some articles of intelligence which embarrassed him a little at first  but these difficulties soon vanished before the vigour of his resolutions  He knew  that not only the town of Quib quab was fortified by art  but also  that the whole adjacent country was almost impregnable by nature  that one Chinese general blocked up the passes with a strong body of forces  in the route which was to be followed by Yaff rai  and that another commanded a separate corps in the neighbourhood of Quib quab  equal  at least  in number to the detachment of Ya loff  whom he might therefore either prevent from landing  or attack after he should be landed  or finally  should neither of these attempts succeed  he might reinforce the garrison of Quib quab    12 so as to make it more numerous than the besieging army  which  according to the rules of war  ought to be ten times the number of the besieged  On the other hand  in order to invalidate these objections  he reflected that Fortune  which hath such a share in all military events  is inconstant and variable  that as the Chinese had been so long successful in Fatsisio  it was now their turn to be unfortunate  He reflected that the daemon of folly was capricious  and that as it had so long possessed the rulers and generals of Japan  it was high time it should shift its quarters  and occupy the brains of the enemy  in which case they would quit their advantageous posts  and commit some blunder that would lay them
