and scruples were as much a part of it  as the gravitation of the whole world —In a word  he would say  error was error —no matter where it fell —whether in a fraction —or a pound — twas alike fatal to truth  and she was kept down at the bottom of her well as inevitably by a mistake in the dust of a butterfly s wing —as in the disk of the sun  the moon  and all the stars of heaven put together   He would often lament that it was for want of considering this properly  and of applying it skilfully to civil matters  as well as to speculative truths  that so many things in this world were out of joint —that the political arch was giving way —    and that the very foundations of our excellent constitution in church and state  were so sapp d as estimators had reported   You cry out  he would say  we are a ruined  undone people —Why  he would ask  making use of the sorites or fyllogism of Zeno and Chrysippus without knowing it belonged to them —Why  why are we a ruined people —Because we are corrupted —Whence is it  dear Sir  that we are corrupted —Because we are needy —our poverty  and not our wills  consent —And wherefore  he would add —are we needy —From the neglect  he would answer  of our pence and our halfpence —Our bank notes  Sir  our guineas —nay our shillings  take care of themselves    Tis the same  he would say  throughout the whole circle of the sciences —    the great  the established points of them  are not to be broke in upon —The laws of nature will defend themselves —but error— he would add  looking earnestly at my mother —error  Sir  creeps in thro  the minute holes  and small crevices  which human nature leaves unguarded   This turn of thinking in my father  is what I had to remind you of —The point you are to be informed of  and which I have reserved for this place  is as follows   Amongst the many and excellent reasons  with which my father had urged my mother to accept of Dr  Slop s assistance preferably to that of the old woman —there was one of a very singular nature  which  when he had done arguing the matter with her as a Christian  and came to argue it over again with her    as a philosopher  he had put his whole strength to  depending indeed upon it as his sheet anchor —It failed him  tho  from no defect in the argument itself  but that  do what he could  he was not able for his soul to make her comprehend the drift of it —Cursed luck —said he to himself  one afternoon  as he walk d out of the room  after he had been stating it for an hour and a half to her  to no manner of purpose —cursed luck  said he  biting his lip as he shut the door —for a man to be master of one of the finest chains of reasoning in nature —and have a wife at the same time with such a head piece  that he cannot hang up a single inference within side of it  to save his soul from destruction   This argument  tho  it was intirely lost upon my mother —had more weight with    him  than all his other arguments joined together —I will therefore endeavour to do it justice —and set it forth with all the perspicuity I am master of   My father set out upon the strength of these two following axioms   First  That an ounce of a man s own wit  was worth a tun of other peoples  and   Secondly   Which  by the bye  was the ground work of the first axiom —tho  it comes last  That every man s wit must come from every man s own soul —and no other body s   Now  as it was plain to my father  that all souls were by nature equal —and that the great difference between the most acute and the most obtuse understanding     —was from no original sharpness or bluntness of one thinking substance above or below another —but arose merely from the lucky or unlucky organization of the body  in that part where the soul principally took up her residence —he had made it the subject of his enquiry to find out the identical place   Now  from the best accounts he had been able to get of this matter  he was satisfied it could not be where Des Cartes had fixed it  upon the top of thepineal gland of the brain  which  as he philosophised  formed a cushion for her about the size of a marrow pea  tho  to speak the truth  as so many nerves did terminate all in that one place — twas no bad conjecture —and my father had certainly fallen with that great philosopher plumb into the center of the mistake  had it not    been for my uncle Toby  who rescued him out of it  by a story he told him of a Walloon officer at the battle of Landen  who had one part of his brain shot away by a musket ball —and another part of it
