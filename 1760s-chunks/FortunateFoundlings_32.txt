 By heaven  cried he  in the utmost agitation  I know so little the   meaning of what I have just now heard  that it seems rather a dream than   a reality  O the deceiver  returned she  a little slackening her pace    will you pretend to have given no occasion for the reproach you have   received   great must have been your professions to draw on you a   resentment such as I have been witness of   but I shall take care to   give the lady  whoever she is  no farther room for jealousy on my   account  and as for mademoiselle Sanserre  I believe the stock of   reputation she has will not suffer much from the addition of one more   favourite to the number the world has already given her       The oddness of this adventure  and the vexation he was in to find   Charlotta seemed incensed against him for a crime of which he knew   himself so perfectly innocent  destroyed at once all the considerations   his timidity had inspired  and aiming only to be cleared in her   opinion   if there be faith in man  cried he  I know nothing of what I   am accused  no woman but your charming self ever had the power to give   me an uneasy moment   it is you alone have taught me what it is to love    and as I never felt  I never pretended to that passion for any other       Me  replied Charlotta  extremely confused  If it were so  you take a   strange time and method to declare it in   but I know of no concern I   have in your amours  your gratitude  or your perfidy  and you had better   follow and endeavour to appease your enraged mistress  than lose your   time on me in vain excuses       Ah mademoiselle  cried he  how unjust and cruel are you  and how severe   my fate  which not content with the despair my real unworthiness of   adoring you has plunged me in  but also adds to it an imputation of   crimes my soul most detests   I never heard even the name of the lady   you mentioned till your lips pronounced it  and if it be she I danced   with  I protest I never saw her face  and as for the meaning of the   other lady s treatment of me  it must certainly be occasioned by some   mistake  having offered nothing to any of the sex that could justify   such a proceeding       All the time he was speaking Charlotta was endeavouring to compose   herself   The hurry of spirits she had been in at the apprehensions of   Horatio s having any amorous engagements  shewing her how much interest   she took in him  made her blush at having discovered herself to him so   far  and tho  she could not be any more tranquil  yet she thought she   would for the future be more prudent  to this end she now affected to   laugh at the dilemma into which she told him he had brought himself  by   making addresses in two places at the same time  and advised him in a   gay manner to be more circumspect       Thus was this beautiful lady  by her jealousy  convinced of her   sensibility  and as difficult as Horatio found it to remove the one  he   found his consolation in the discovery of the other       From the time he had been disengaged from mademoiselle Sanferre  he had   retired with Charlotta to one corner of the room  and the greatest part   of the company being in a grand dance  the others were taken up in   looking on them  so that our young lovers had the opportunity of talking   to each other without being taken much notice of  but several of the   masquers now drawing nearer that way  prevented Horatio from saying any   thing farther at that time  either to clear his innocence or prosecute   his passion  and Charlotta  glad to avoid all discourse on a subject she   thought herself but ill prepared to answer  joined some ladies  with   whom she stayed till the ball was near concluded       Horatio after this withdrew to a window  and flickered behind a large   damask curtain  threw himself on a sopha he found there  and ruminated   at full on the adventure had happened to him  in which he found a   mixture of joy and discontent  the behaviour of Charlotta assured him he   was not indifferent to her  but then the thoughts that he appeared in   her eyes as ungrateful  inconstant and perfidious  made him tremble    left the idea of what he seemed to be should utterly erase that   favourable one she had entertained of what he truly was  By what means
