  After many supplications on one hand  and pressing remonstrances on the  other  she yielded at length  and  turning to her lover while her face  was overspread with blushes    Well  sir   said she   supposing I were  to put the difference on that issue  how could you excuse the ridiculous  letter which you sent to me from Winchester   This expostulation  introduced a discussion of the whole affair  in which all the  circumstances were canvassed  and Emilia still affirmed  with great  heat  that the letter must have been calculated to affront her  for she  could not suppose the author was so weak as to design it for any other  purpose   Peregrine  who still retained in his memory the substance of this  unlucky epistle  as well as the verses which were inclosed  could  recollect no particular expression which could have justly given the  least umbrage  and therefore  in the agonies of perplexity  begged  that the whole might be submitted to the judgment of Miss Sophy  and  faithfully promised to stand to her award  In short  this proposal was   with seeming reluctance  embraced by Emilia  and an appointment made to  meet next day in the place  whither both parties were desired to come  provided with their credentials  according to which definitive sentence  would be pronounced   Our lover  having succeeded thus far  overwhelmed Sophy with  acknowledgments on account of her generous mediation  and in the course  of their walk  which Emilia was now in no hurry to conclude  whispered  a great many tender protestations in the ear of his mistress  who  nevertheless continued to act upon the reserve  until her doubts should  be more fully resolved     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Mr  Pickle  having found means to amuse them in the fields till the  twilight  was obliged to wish them good even  after having obtained a  solemn repetition of their promise to meet him at the appointed time  and place  and then retreated to his apartment  where he spent the whole  night in various conjectures on the subject of the letter  the Gordian  knot of which he could by no means untie  One while he imagined that  some wag had played a trick on his messenger  in consequence of  which Emilia had received a supposititious letter  but  upon farther  reflection  he could not conceive the practicability of any such deceit   Then he began to doubt the sincerity of his mistress  who perhaps had  only made that a handle for discarding him  at the request of some  favoured rival  but his own integrity forbade him to harbour this mean  suspicion  and therefore he was again involved in the labyrinth of  perplexity  Next day he waited on the rack of impatience for the hour of  five in the afternoon  which no sooner struck than he ordered Pipes  to attend him  in case there should be occasion for his evidence  and  repaired to the place of rendezvous  where he had not tarried five  minutes before the ladies appeared  Mutual compliments being passed  and  the attendant stationed at a convenient distance  Peregrine persuaded  them to sit down upon the grass  under the shade of a spreading oak   that they might be more at their ease  while he stretched himself at  their feet  and desired that the paper on which his doom depended might  be examined  It was accordingly put into the hand of his fair arbitress   who read it immediately with an audible voice  The first two words of  it were no sooner pronounced  than he started  with great emotion  and  raised himself upon his hand and knee  in which posture he listened  to the rest of the sentence  then sprang upon his feet in the utmost  astonishment  and  glowing with resentment at the same time  exclaimed    Hell and the devil  what s all that  Sure you make a jest of me   madam     Pray  sir   said Sophy   give me the hearing for a few  moments  and then urge what you shall think proper in your own defence    Having thus cautioned him  she proceeded  but before she had finished  one half of the performance  her gravity forsook her  and she was seized  with a violent fit of laughter  in which neither of the lovers could  help joining  notwithstanding the resentment which at that instant  prevailed in the breasts of both  The judge  however  in a little  time  resumed her solemnity  and having read the remaining part of this  curious epistle  all three continued staring at each other alternately  for the space of half a minute  and then broke forth at the same instant  in another paroxysm of mirth  From this unanimous convulsion  one would  have thought that both parties were extremely well pleased with a joke   yet this was by no means the case   Emilia imagined that  notwithstanding his affected surprise  her lover   in spite of himself  had received the laugh at
