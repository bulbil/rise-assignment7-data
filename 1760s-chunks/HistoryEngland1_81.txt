the Augustine friars had been in possesson of the distribution of them time out of mind before  Martin Luther was an Augustine Monk  and one of those who resented this transferring the sale of indulgences to another order  He began to shew his indignation  by preaching against their efficacy  opposition soon drove him farther than he at first intended to go  and  now the veil was lifted  he proceeded to examine the authority of the Pope himself  The people  who had long groaned under the Papal tyranny  heard his discourses with pleasure  and defended him against the authority and machinations of the church of Rome  Frederic  Elector of Saxony  surnamed the Wise  openly protected him  Luther as openly declaimed against the number of sacraments  reducing the seven held by the church of Rome  first to three  and afterwards to two  from thence he proceeded to examine the doctrine of transubstantiation  to shew the folly of supposing a purgatory  and the dangerous consequence of celibacy among the clergy   The Pope issued out his bulls against Luther  and the Dominican friars procured his books to be burned  Luther abused the Dominicans  and boldly  in the streets of Wirtemberg  burned the bull of the Pope  In the mean time the dispute was carried on by writings on either side  Luther  though opposed by the Pope  the Cardinals  and all the body of the clergy  supported his cause singly and with success  If indeed we look into his works at this day  we shall find them trifling and unsatisfactory enough  but then he had only ignorance to contend with  and  ill as he wrote  they answered still worse  Opinions are inculcated upon the minds of the public  rather by fortitude and perseverance than by strength of reasoning or   238 beauty of thought  and no man had more fortitude and more perseverance than he   In this dispute it was the fate of Henry VIII  to be one of the champions  His father  who had given him the education of a scholar  permitted him to be instructed in school divinity  which then composed the learning of the times  He was  therefore  willing to give the world a demonstration of his abilities in this respect  and desired the Pope s permission to read the works of Luther  which had been forbidden to be read under pain of excommunication  Having readily obtained this request  the King  from St  Thomas Aquinas  defended the seven sacraments  and shewed some skill in school divinity  tho  it is thought that Wolsey had the chief hand in directing him  A book being thus finished in haste  it was sent to Rome for the Pope s approbation  the Pope  ravished with its eloquence and depth  compared the work to that of St  Augustine or St  Jerome  and gave Henry the title of Defender of the Faith  little suspecting that Henry was soon going to be one of the most terrible enemies that ever the church of Rome had yet experienced  Besides these causes which contributed to render the Romish church odious or contemptible  there were still others proceeding from political motives  Clement V…I  had succeeded Leo  and  the hereditary animosity between the Emperor and the Pope breaking out into 〈◊〉  Clement was taken prisoner in the castle of St  Angelo  and  with thirteen Ca…inals beside  kept in custody for his ransom  As the demands of the Emperor were exorbitant  Henry undertook to negotiate for the Pope  and procured a reaty in his favour  but his Holiness  in the mean time  corrupting his guards    239 had the good fortune to escape from confinement  and left the treaty unfinished  but sent H… a letter of thanks for his mediation  The conduct of the Emperor shewed Henry that the Pope might be injured with impunity  and the behaviour of the Pope manifested but little of that sanctity or infallibility to which the Pontiffs pretended  Besides  as he had obliged the Pope  he supposed that he might  upon any emergency  expect a return of favour   It was in this situation of the church and of the Pope  that a new drama was going to be performed  which was to change the whole system of Europe  Henry had now been married eighteen years to Catharine of Arragon  who had been brought over from Spain to marry his elder brother  Prince Arthur  who died some months after his co habitation with her  Henry had three children by this lady  one of whom was still living  while she herself was esteemed for her virtue and the gentleness of her disposition  The King  tho  he felt no real passion  either for the qualifications of her mind or person  yet for a long time broke out into no flagrant contempt  he ranged from beauty to beauty in the court  and his title and authority always procured him a ready compliance from female frailty  It happened  at length  that among the maids of honour that then attended the Queen  was one Anna Bullen  the daughter of a gentleman of distinction  tho  not of the nobility  Her beauty surpassed what had hitherto appeared at this voluptuous court  her features were regular  mild  and attractive  her stature elegant  though below the middle
