suit   for by the bye  unless it suits in some degree  I will not part with it —it is much at his service for fifty guineas —which  Page  31  I am positive is twenty guineas less than it ought to be afforded for  by any man of genius   My Lord  if you examine it over again  it is far from being a gross piece of daubing  as some dedications are  The design  your Lordship sees  is good  the colouring transparent —the drawing not amiss —or to speak more like a man of science—and measure my piece in the painter s scale  divided into 20 —I believe  my Lord  the out lines will turn out as 12 —the composition as 9 —the colouring as 6 —the expression 13 and a half —and the design —if I may be allowed  my Lord  to understand my own design  and supposing absolute perfection in designing  to be as 20 —I think it cannot well fall short of 19  Besides all this —there is keeping in it  and  Page  32  the dark strokes in the HOBBY HORSE   which is a secondary figure  and a kind of back ground to the whole  give great force to the principal lights in your own figure  and make it come off wonderfully —and besides  there is an air of originality in the tout ensemble   Be pleased  my good Lord  to order the sum to be paid into the hands of Mr  Dodsley  for the benefit of the author  and in the next edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged  and your Lordship s titles  distinctions  arms and good actions  be placed at the front of the preceding chapter  All which  from the words  De gustibus non est disputandum  and whatever else in this book relates to HOBBY HORSES  but no more  shall stand dedicated to your Lordship —The rest I dedicate to the MOON  who  by  Page  33  the bye  of all the PATRONS or MATRONS I can think of  has most power to set my book a going  and make the world run mad after it   Bright Goddess   If thou art not too busy with CANDID and Miss CUNEGUND s affairs —take Tristram Shandy s under thy protection also   CHAP  X   WHatever degree of small merit  the act of benignity in favour of the midwife  might justly claim  or in whom that claim truly rested —at first sight seems not very material to this history —certain however it was  that the gentlewoman  the parson s wife  did run away at that time with the whole of it  And yet  for my life  I cannot help thinking but that the parson himself   Page  34  tho  he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design first —yet  as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid before him  and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into execution  had a claim to some share of it —if not to a full half of whatever honour was due to it   The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter otherwise   Lay down the book  and I will allow you half a day to give a probable guess at the grounds of this procedure   Be it known then  that  for about five years before the date of the midwife s licence  of which you have had so circumstantial an account —the parson we have to do with  had made himself a  Page  35  country talk by a breach of all decorum  which he had committed against himself  his station  and his office —and that was  in never appearing better  or otherwise mounted  than upon a lean  sorry  jack ass of a horse  value about one pound fifteen shillings  who  to shorten all description of him  was full brother to Rosinante  as far as similitude congenial could make him  for he answered his description to a hair breadth in every thing —except that I do not remember  tis any where said  that Rosinante was broken winded  and that  moreover  Rosinante  as is the happiness of mostSpanish horses  fat or lean —was undoubtedly a horse at all points   I know very well that the HERO S horse was a horse of chaste deportment  which may have given grounds for a  Page  36  contrary opinion  But it is as certain at the same time  that Rosinante s continency  as may be demonstrated from the adventure of the Yanguesiancarriers  proceeded from no bodily defect or cause whatsoever  but from the temperance and orderly current of his blood —And let me tell you  Madam  there is a great deal of very good chastity in the world  in behalf of which you could not say more for your life   Let that be as it may  as my purpose is to do exact justice to every creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic work —I could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don Quixote s horse —in all other points the parson s horse  I say  was just such another —for he was as lean  and as lank  and as sorry a jade  as HUMILITY herself could have bestrided
