 Then would my name be immortalised among the patriot heroes of  antiquity  and my memory  like that of Harmodius and Aristogiton  be  honoured by statues erected at the public expense    This rhapsody  which was delivered with great emphasis and agitation   gave so much offence to Jolter  that  without saying one word  he  retired in great wrath to his own chamber  and the republican returned  to his lodging  in full hope of his prognostic being verified in the  death and destruction of Peregrine and the painter  which must give rise  to some renowned revolution  wherein he himself would act a principal  part  But the governor whose imagination was not quite so warm and  prolific  went directly to the ambassador  whom he informed of his  pupil s situation  and besought to interpose with the French ministry   that he and the other British subject might obtain their liberty   His excellency asked  if Jolter could guess at the cause of his  imprisonment  that he might be the better prepared to vindicate or  excuse his conduct  but neither he nor Pipes could give the smallest  hint of intelligence on that subject  though he furnished himself from  Tom s own mouth with a circumstantial account of the manner in which  his master had been arrested  as well as of his own behaviour  and the  disaster he had received on that occasion  His lordship never doubted  that Pickle had brought this calamity upon himself by some unlucky  prank he had played at the masquerade  when he understood that the young  gentleman had drunk freely in the afternoon  and been so whimsical as to  go thither with a man in woman s apparel  and he that same day waited on  the French minister  in full confidence of obtaining his discharge  but  met with more difficulty than he expected  the court of France being  extremely punctilious in everything that concerns a prince of the blood   the ambassador was therefore obliged to talk in very high terms  and   though the present circumstances of the French politics would not allow  them to fall out with the British administration for trifles  all the  favour he could procure was to promise that Pickle should L set at  liberty  provided he would ask pardon of the prince to whom he had given  offence   His excellency thought this was but a reasonable condescension   supposing Peregrine to have been in the wrong  and Jolter was admitted  to him in order to communicate and reinforce his lordship s advice   which was  that he comply with the terms proposed  The governor  who  did not enter this gloomy fortress without fear and trembling  found  his pupil in a dismal apartment  void of all furniture but a stool and  a truckle bed  The moment he was admitted  he perceived the youth  whistling with great unconcern  and working with his pencil at the bare  wall  on which he had delineated a ludicrous figure labelled with the  name of the nobleman  whom he had affronted  and an English mastiff with  his leg lifted up  in the attitude of making water in his shoe  He  had been even so presumptuous as to explain the device with satirical  inscriptions in the French language  which  when Jolter perused  his  hair stood on end with affright  The very turnkey was confounded and  overawed by the boldness of his behaviour  which he had never seen    6 22 15  3 45 PM   matched by any inhabitant of that place  and actually joined his friend  in persuading him to submit to the easy demand of the minister  But our  hero  far from embracing the counsel of this advocate  handed him to the  door with great ceremony  and dismissed him with a kick on the breeches   and  to all the supplications  and even tears of Jolter  made no other  reply than that he would stoop to no condescension  because he had  committed no crime  but would leave his case to the cognisance and  exertion of the British court  whose duty it was to see justice done to  its own subjects  he desired  however  that Pallet  who was confined  in another place  might avail himself of his own disposition  which  was sufficiently pliable  but when the governor desired to see his  fellow prisoner  the turnkey gave him to understand that he had received  no orders relating to the lady  and therefore could not admit him into  her apartment  though he was complaisant enough to tell him that she  seemed very much mortified at her confinement  and at certain times  behaved as if her brain was not a little disordered   Jolter  thus baffled in all his endeavours  quitted the Bastille with a  heavy heart  and reported his fruitless negotiation to the ambassador   who could not help breaking forth into some acrimonious expressions  against the obstinacy and insolence of the young man  who  he said   deserved to suffer for his folly  Nevertheless  he did not desist  from his representations to the French ministry  which he found so  unyielding  that he was obliged
