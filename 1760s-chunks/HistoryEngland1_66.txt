 that such a project might not be true  influenced his judgment  and confirmed him in his security  Soon  however  Catesby  a vile creature of the Protector s  was sent to sound him  and try whether he could not be brought over to side with the projected usurpation  Hastings appeared immoveable in his adherence to the King  and his death was therefore resolved on   With this design  the Protector next day called a council in the Tower  under the pretence of expediting the coronation  he came thither himself at nine o clock in the morning  with a chearful countenance  saluting the members with the utmost affability  and appearing with demonstrations of unusual good humour  and then  going out for a short time  desired his absence might not interrupt the debates  In about an hour he returned again  quite altered  knitting his brows  biting his lips  and shewing  by the frequent alterations of his looks  some inward perturbation  A silence ensued for some time  and the lords looked upon each other  not without reason  expecting some horrid catastrophe  at length he broke the dreadful silence    My Lords  said he  What punishment do they deserve who have conspired against my life    This redoubled the astonishment of the assembly  and  continuing their silence  Lord Hastings at length made answer  That whoever did so deserved to be punished as a traitor  upon which the Protector    194 with a stern countenance  baring his wthered arm  cried out   See what the sorceress my Queensister  and that wretch  Shore s wife  have done by their witcherafts  Their spells have reduced my arm to this condition  and my whole body would have suffered the same calamity  but for a timely detection   The amazement of the council seemed to increase at this terrible accusation  and Lord Hastings again said   IF they have committed such a crime  they deserve punishment  IF   cried the Protector  with a loud voice  Dost thou answer me with IFS   I tell thee  that they have conspired my death  and that thou  traitor  art an accomplice in their crime   Thus having said  he struck the table twice with his hand  and the room was instantly filled with armed men   I arrest thee  continues he  turning to Hastings  for high treason    and  at the same time  delivered him to the custody of the soldiers     The council room was now filled with tumult  and  though no rescue was offered  yet the soldiers caused a bustle  as if they apprehended danger  One of them narrowly missed cleaving Lord Stanley s head with a battle ax  but he escaped by shrinking under the table  in all probability  the fellow had orders for this attempt  so that  when thus killed  his death might be ascribed to the tumult caused by an intended rescue  Stanley  however  escaping the blow  was arrested by the Protector s order  who was well apprized of his attachment to the young King  As for Lord Hastings  he was forced to make a short confession to the next priest that was at hand  the Protector crying out  by St  Paul  he would not dine till he had seen his head taken off  he was accordingly hurried out to the little green before the Tower   195 chapel  and there beheaded on a log of wood that acccidentally lay there   But not those alone of his council were thus barbarously treated  on the very same day a similar tragedy was acted at Pontefract castle  where the Earl Rivers  the most polite and gallant man of the age in which he lived  and Lord Grey  were both beheaded by a decree of that very same council  the members of which were now in such danger themselves  A plot against the King was the pretext for their execution  but  in reality  they died as being the only obstacles to prevent his destruction   The Protector  having thus got rid of those he most feared  undertook to punish even the least dangerous  Jane Shore  the late King s mistress  was an enemy too humble for him to fear any thing from her attempts  yet  as she had been accused of witchcraft  of which all the world saw she was innocent  he thought proper to punish her for faults of which she was really guilty  This unhappy woman had been deluded formerly from her husband one Shore  a goldsmith in Lombard street  and continued with Edward the most guiltless mistress in his luxurious and abandoned court  she ever interceded for the distressed  and was ever applied to as a mediator for mercy  She was charitable  generous  and pleasing in conversation  her wit and her beauty were said to be irresistible  Being blameless in other respects  the Protector ordered her to be sued for incontinency  for having left her husband to live in adultery with another  It is possible that the people were not displeased at seeing  again reduced to her former meanness  a person  who had  for a while  been raised above them  and enjoyed all the favours of   196 the King  Her
