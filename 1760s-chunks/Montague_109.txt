wish to invent new pleasures for her gratification       I hope to be happy  and to make the loveliest of womankind so  because my notions of the state  into which I am entering  are I hope just  and free from that romantic turn so destructive to happiness       I have  once in my life  had an attachment nearly resembling marriage  to a widow of rank  with whom I was acquainted abroad  and with whom I almost secluded myself from the world near a twelvemonth  when she died of a fever  a stroke I was long before I recovered       I loved her with tenderness  but that love  compared to what I feel for Emily  was as a grain of sand to the globe of earth  or the weight of a feather to the universe       A marriage where not only esteem  but passion is kept awake  is  I am convinced  the most perfect state of sublunary happiness  but it requires great care to keep this tender plant alive  especially  I blush to say it  on our side       Women are naturally more constant  education improves this happy disposition  the husband who has the politeness  the attention  and delicacy of a lover  will always be beloved       The same is generally  but not always  true on the other side  I have sometimes seen the most amiable  the most delicate of the sex  fail in keeping the affection of their husbands       I am well aware  my friend  that we are not to expect here a life of continual rapture  in the happiest marriage there is danger of some languid moments  to avoid these  shall be my study  and I am certain they are to be avoided       The inebriation  the tumult of passion  will undoubtedly grow less after marriage  that is  after peaceable possession  hopes and fears alone keep it in its first violent state  but  though it subsides  it gives place to a tenderness still more pleasing  to a soft  and  if you will allow the expression  a voluptuous tranquillity  the pleasure does not cease  does not even lessen  it only changes its nature       My sister tells me  she flatters herself  you will give a few months to hers and Mr  Temple s friendship  I will not give up the claim I have to the same favor       My little farm will induce only friends to visit us  and it is not less pleasing to me for that circumstance  one of the misfortunes of a very exalted station  is the slavery it subjects us to in regard to the ceremonial world       Upon the whole  I believe  the most agreable  as well as most free of all situations  to be that of a little country gentleman  who lives upon his income  and knows enough of the world not to envy his richer neighbours       Let me hear from you  my dear Fitzgerald  and tell me  if  little as I am  I can be any way of the least use to you       You will see Emily before I do  she is more lovely  more enchanting  than ever       Mrs  Fitzgerald will make me happy if she can invent any commands for me       Adieu  Believe me   Your faithful   c   ED  RIVERS     LETTER CLXXVIII   178   To Colonel RIVERS  at Bellfield  Rutland   London  Sept  15   EVERY mark of your friendship  my dear Rivers  must be particularly pleasing to one who knows your worth as I do  I have  therefore  to thank you as well for your letter  as for those obliging offers of service  which I shall make no scruple of accepting  if I have occasion for them       I rejoice in the prospect of your being as happy as myself  nothing can be more just than your ideas of marriage  I mean  of a marriage founded on inclination  all that you describe  I am so happy as to experience       I never loved my sweet girl so tenderly as since she has been mine  my heart acknowledges the obligation of her having trusted the future happiness or misery of her life in my hands  She is every hour more dear to me  I value as I ought those thousand little attentions  by which a new softness is every moment given to our affection       I do not indeed feel the same tumultuous emotion at seeing her  but I feel a sensation equally delightful  a joy more tranquil  but not less lively       I will own to you  that I had strong prejudices against marriage  which nothing but love could have conquered  the idea of an indissoluble union deterred me from thinking of a serious engagement  I attached myself to the most seducing  most attractive of women  without thinking the pleasure I found in seeing her of any consequence  I thought her lovely  but never suspected I loved  I thought the delight I tasted in hearing her  merely the effects of those charms which all the world found in her conversation
