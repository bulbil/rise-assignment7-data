he concerted  with himself a plan which was executed in this manner  During his next  interview with his dulcinea  far from discovering the least sign of  jealousy or discontent  he affected the appearance of extraordinary  fondness  and  after having spent the afternoon with the show  of uncommon satisfaction  told her he was engaged in a party for  Fountainebleau  and would set out from Paris that same evening  so that  he should not have the pleasure of seeing her again for some days   The lady  who was very well versed in the arts of her occupation   pretended to receive this piece of news with great affliction  and  conjured him  with such marks of real tenderness  to return as soon as  possible to her longing arms  that he went away almost convinced of her  sincerity  Determined  however  to prosecute his scheme  he actually  departed from Paris with two or three gentlemen of his acquaintance   who had hired a remise for a jaunt to Versailles  and having accompanied  them as far as the village of Passe  he returned in the dusk of the  evening on foot   He waited impatiently till midnight  and then  arming himself with a  brace of pocket pistols  and attended by trusty Tom with a cudgel in his  hand  repaired to the lodgings of his suspected inamorata  Having given  Pipes his cue  he knocked gently at the door  which was no sooner opened  by the lacquey  than he bolted in  before the fellow could recollect  himself from the confusion occasioned by his unexpected appearance  and   leaving Tom to guard the door  ordered the trembling valet to light  him upstairs into his lady s apartment  The first object that presented  itself to his view  when he entered the antechamber  was a sword upon  the table  which he immediately seized  exclaiming  in a loud and  menacing voice  that his mistress was false  and then in bed with  another gallant  whom he would instantly put to death  This declaration   confirmed by many terrible oaths  he calculated for the hearing of his  rival  who  understanding his sanguinary purpose  started up in great  trepidation  and  naked as he was  dropped from the balcony into the  street  while Peregrine thundered at the door for admittance  and   guessing his design  gave him an opportunity of making this precipitate  retreat  Pipes  who stood sentinel at the door  observing the fugitive  descend  attacked him with his cudgel  and sweating him from one end of  the street to the other  at last committed him to the guet by whom he  was conveyed to the officer on duty in a most disgraceful and deplorable  condition   Meanwhile Peregrine  having burst open the chamber door  found the lady  in the utmost dread and consternation  and the spoils of her favourite  scattered about the room  but his resentment was doubly gratified  when  he learned  upon inquiry  that the person who had been so disagreeably    6 22 15  3 45 PM   interrupted was no other than that individual mousquetaire with whom he  had quarrelled at the comedy  He upbraided the nymph with her  perfidy and ingratitude  and telling her that she must not expect the  continuance of his regard  or the appointments which she had hitherto  enjoyed from his bounty  went home to his own lodgings  overjoyed at the  issue of the adventure   The soldier  exasperated at the disgrace he had undergone  as well as  the outrageous insult of the English valet  whom he believed his master  had tutored for that purpose  no sooner extricated himself from the  opprobrious situation he had incurred  than  breathing vengeance  against the author of the affront  he came to Peregrine s apartment  and  demanded satisfaction upon the ramparts next morning before sunrise   Our hero assured him he would not fail to pay his respects to him at the  time and place appointed  and foreseeing that he might be prevented from  keeping this engagement by the officious care of his governor  who saw  the mousquetaire come in  he told Mr  Jolter  that the Frenchman  had visited him in consequence of an order he had received from his  superiors  to make an apology for his rude behaviour to him in the  playhouse  and that they had parted very good friends  This assurance   together with Pickle s tranquil and unconcerned behaviour through the  day  quieted the terrors which had begun to take possession of his  tutor s imagination  so that the youth had an opportunity of giving him  the slip at night  when he betook himself to the lodgings of a friend   whom he engaged as his second  and with whom he immediately took the  field  in order to avoid the search which Jolter  upon missing him   might set on foot   This was a necessary precaution  for as he did not appear at supper  and  Pipes  who usually attended him in his excursions  could give no account  of his motions  the governor was dreadfully alarmed at his
