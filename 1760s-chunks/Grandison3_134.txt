 thought I  I shall not have this call from any one of a family I so greatly respect   I was received by the Bishop  who politely  after I had paid my compliments to the Marquis and his Lady  presented me to those of the Urbino family to whom I was a stranger  Every one of those named by Signor Jeronymo  in his last Letter  was present   The Marquis  after he had returned my compliment  looked another way  to hide his emetion  The Marchioness put her handkerchief to her eyes  and looked upon me with tenderness  and I read in them her concern for her Clementina   I paid my respects to the General with an air of freedom  yet of regard  to my Jeronymo  with the tenderness due to our friendship  and congratulated   334 him on seeing him out of his chamber  His kind eyes glistened with pleasure  yet it was easy to read a mixture of pain in them  which grew stronger as the first emotions at seeing me enter  gave way to reflection   The Conte della Porretta seemed to measure me with his eye   I addressed myself to Father Marescotti  and made my particular acknowlegements to him for the favour of his visit  and what had passed in it  He looked upon me with pleasure  probably with the more  as this was a farewel visit   The two Ladies whispered  and looked upon me  and seemed to bespeak each other s attention to what passed   Signor Sebastiano placed himself next to Jeronymo  and often whispered him  and as often cast his eye upon me  He was partial to me  I believe  because my generous friend seemed pleased with what he said   His brother  Signor Juliano  sat on the other hand of me  They are agreeable and polite young gentlemen   A profound silence succeeded the general compliments   I addressed myself to the Marquis  Your Lordship  and you  madam  turning to the Marchioness  I hope will excuse me for having requested of you the honour of being once more admitted to your presence  and to that of three brothers  for whom I shall ever retain the highest veneration and respect  I could not think of leaving a city  where one of the first families in it has done me the highest honour  without taking such a leave as might shew my gratitude —Accept  my Lords  bowing to each  Accept  madam  more profoundly bowing to the Marchioness  my respectful thanks for all your goodness to me  I shall  to the end of my life  number most of the days that I have passed at Bologna among its happiest  even   335 were the remainder to be as happy as man ever knew   The Marquis said  We wish you  Chevalier  very happy  happier than—He sighed  and was silent   His Lady only bowed  Her face spoke distress  Her voice was lost in sighs  tho  she struggled to suppress them   Chevalier  said the Bishop  with an air of solemnity  you have given us many happy hours  For them we thank you  Jeronymo  for himself  will say more  He is the most grateful of men  We thank you also for what you have done for him   I cannot  said Jeronymo  express suitably my gratitude  My prayers▪ my vows  shall follow you whithersoever you go  best of friends  and best of men   The general  with an air and a smile that might have been dispensed with  oddly said  High pleasure and high pain are very near neighbours  They are often guilty of excesses  and then are apt to mistake each other s house  I am one of those who think our whole house obliged to the Chevalier for the seasonable assistance he gave to our Jeronymo▪ But—  Dear General  said Juliana  bear with an interruption  The intent of this meeting is amicable  The Chevalier is a man of honour  Things may have fallen out unhappily  yet nobody to blame   As to blame  or otherwise  said the Conte della Porretta  that is not now to be talked of  else  I know where it lies  In short  among ourselves  The Chevalier acted greatly by Signor Jeronymo  We were all obliged to him  But to let such a man as this have free admission to our daughter—She ought to have had no eyes   Pray  my Lord  Pray  brother  said the Marquis  Are we not enough sufferers   The Chevalier  said the General  cannot but be gratified by so high a compliment  and smiled indignantly     336 My Lord  replied I to the General  you know very little of the man before you  if you don t believe him to be the most afflicted man present   Impossible  said the Marquis  with a sigh   The Marchioness arose from her seat  motioning to go  and turning round to the two Ladies  and the Count  I have resigned my will to the will of you all  my dearest friends  and shall be permitted to withdraw  This testimony  however  before I go  I cannot but bear
