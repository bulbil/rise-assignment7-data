miles from Canterbury       I am wild with joy at setting foot once more on dry land       I am not less happy to have traced your brother and Emily  by my enquiries here  for we left Quebec too soon to have advice there of their arrival       Adieu  If in town  you shall see us the moment we get there  if in the country  write immediately  to the care of the agent       Let me know where to find Emily  whom I die to see  is she still Emily Montague       Adieu   Your affectionate   A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXXVI   176   To Mrs  FITZGERALD   Temple house  Sept  11   YOUR letter  my dear Bell  was sent by this post to the country       It is unnecessary to tell you the pleasure it gives us all to hear of your safe arrival       All our argosies have now landed their treasures  you will believe us to have been more anxious about friends so dear to us  than the merchant for his gold and spices  we have suffered the greater anxiety  by the circumstance of your having returned at different times       I flatter myself  the future will pay us for the past       You may now  my dear Bell  revive your coterie  with the addition of some friends who love you very sincerely       Emily  still Emily Montague  is with a relation in Berkshire  settling some affairs previous to her marriage with my brother  to which we flatter ourselves there will be no further objections        I assure you  I begin to be a little jealous of this Emily of yours  she rivals me extremely with my mother  and indeed with every body else       We all come to town next week  when you will make us very unhappy if you do not become one of our family in Pall Mall  and return with us for a few months to the country       My brother is at his little estate  six miles from hence  where he is making some alterations  for the reception of Emily  he is fitting up her apartment in a style equally simple and elegant  which  however  you must not tell her  because she is to be surprized  her dressing room  and a little adjoining closet of books  will be enchanting  yet the expence of all he has done is a mere trifle       I am the only person in the secret  and have been with him this morning to see it  there is a gay  smiling air in the whole apartment  which pleases me infinitely  you will suppose he does not forget jars of flowers  because you know how much they are Emily s taste  he has forgot no ornament which he knew was agreable to her       Happily for his fortune  her pleasures are not of the expensive kind  he would ruin himself if they were       He has bespoke a very handsome post chaise  which is also a secret to Emily  who insists on not having one        Their income will be about five hundred pounds a year  it is not much  yet  with their dispositions  I think it will make them happy       My brother will write to Mr  Fitzgerald next post  say every thing affectionate for us all to him and Captain Fermor        Adieu  Yours   LUCY TEMPLE     LETTER CLXXVII   177   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Sept  13   I CONGRATULATE you  my dear friend  on your safe arrival  and on your marriage        You have got the start of me in happiness  I love you  however  too sincerely to envy you       Emily has promised me her hand  as soon as some little family affairs are settled  which I flatter myself will not take above another week       When she gave me this promise  she begged me to allow her to return to Berkshire till our marriage took place  I felt the propriety of this step  and therefore would not oppose it  she pleaded having some business also to settle with her relation there       My mother has given back the deed of settlement of my estate  and accepted of an assignment on my half pay  she is greatly a loser  but she insisted on making me happy  with such an air of tenderness  that I could not deny her that satisfaction       I shall keep some land in my own hands  and farm  which will enable me to have a post chaise for Emily  and my mother  who will be a good deal with us  and a constant decent table for a friend       Emily is to superintend the dairy and garden  she has a passion for flowers  with which I am extremely pleased  as it will be to her a continual source of pleasure       I feel such delight in the idea of making her happy  that I think nothing a trifle which can be in the least degree pleasing to her       I could even
