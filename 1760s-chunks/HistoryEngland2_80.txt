of Prussia knew the Austrians to be his enemies  and the Russians to be in league with them against him  an alliance therefore with the court of London kept back the Russians whom he dreaded  and gave him hopes of taking an ample satisfaction from Austria  whom he suspected  As for France  he counted upon it as a natural ally  which  from the long and hereditary enmity with the Austrians  could not  by declaring against him  join them to whom they had such various reasons for political aversion  The Elector of Hanover  on the other hand  had still stronger expectations of the benefits that would arise from this alliance  He thus procured a near and powerful ally  an ally which he thought the French  in their present circumstances  would not venture to disoblige  he counted upon the Austrians as naturally attached to his interests by former services and friendship  and the Russians  at least  as likely to continue neuter  from their former stipulations and subsidy  Such were the motives to this alliance  but both were deceived in every particular  And though this alliance astonished Europe at that time  it soon produced another still more extraordinary  The Austrian Queen had long meditated designs for recovering Silesia  which  in her exigency  the King of Prussia had invaded  and expected   216 the assistance of Russia to effect her purposes  By this last treaty  however  she saw England joining with Prussia in frustrating her hopes  and  deprived of one ally  sought about  in order to substitute another in the room  She therefore applied to France  and  in order to procure the friendship of that power  gave up her barrier in the Netherlands  which England had been for ages acquiring with its blood and treasure  By this extraordinary revolution the whole political system of Europe assumed a new face  and it pretty clearly shews that events guide the politician  while the politician seldom guides events  or  to use words of Tacitus  there is but very little difference between the art and its futility   In the mean time  this treaty between France and Austria  was no sooner ratified  than the Empress of Russia was invited to accede to it  which proposal she ardently embraced  By concurring with their proposals  Russia had another opportunity of sending her forces into the western parts of Europe  which was all she had hoped by the subsidiary treaty with England  A settlement in the western parts of Europe was what this fierce northern power long wanted an opportunity of obtaining  for  possessed of that  she could then pour in fresh forces at any time upon the more effeminate and contending states  and  perhaps  at length  obtain universal Empire  The intrigues of France were also successfully employed with Sweden  A war between that nation and Prussia was kindled up  though contrary to the inclination of their Sovereign  who had the natural motives of kindred for being averse to that measure   Thus all the alliances which England had long been purchasing upon the continent  and many of the treaties which she had been long making  with all the bustle of negotiation  seemed now destroyed  The forces of the contending powers therefore  now drawn out on each side  stood thus  England opposed   217 France in America and Asia  France attacked Hanover on the continent of Europe  This country the King of Prussia undertook to protect  while England promised to furnish him with troops and money to assist his operations  On the other hand  Austria had designs upon Prussia  and drew the Elector of Saxony into the same pursuits  she was also seconded in her views by Russia  Sweden  and France  while the rest of the powers of Europe continued spectators of the contention   These designs of Austria  for the recovery of her lost dominions  were too apparent not to be early discovered by so vigilant a Monarch as that of Prussia  he saw that preparations were making against him by that power in Bohemia and Moravia  while the Elector of Saxony  under the pretence of a military parade  drew together about sixteen thousand men  which occupied the strong fortress of Pirna  The secret treaty also between the courts of Russia and Austria did not escape his penetration  by this it was privately stipulated  that the treating powers should  in case of apprehending any breach of the present peace  unite against Prussia  and share the dominions of that crown between them  This he considered as an offensive alliance  the treating powers alledged  that it was only defensive  As preparations for war  however  were carrying on with the utmost diligence on either side  the King of Prussia  in order to be confirmed in what he already suspected  ordered his minister at Vienna to demand a clear explication  and proper assurances concerning the preparations he saw making  He at first received an equivocal anwser  but  ordering his minister to demand a categorical reply  whether the Empress Queen was for peace or war  and to require a positive assurance  that she had no intention to attack him that year  or the next  an ambiguous answer was returned to so plain a question  which   218 undoubted manifested an inclination for war  H therefore thought proper no longer to suspend his opera¦tions
