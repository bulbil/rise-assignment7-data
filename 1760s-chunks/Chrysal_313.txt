harbour where it had happened  to attend the trial  in order to   inform the court  in the usages of their service  One of those     who had never seen a court of ci  dl judicature before  but was a   man of natural good sense  and some reading  having listened to the   unintelligible pleadings  and gross exaggerations of the counsel on   both sides of the question  especially those hired in the prosecution    till his patience was quite exhausted  at length arose  and having   obtained permission from the judge to speak  addressed himself   to the court in these words   â€”       I am sent here by those to whom the king has entrusted the   conduct of his navy  to explain the nature and rules of our service   to this court  in case I see any danger of their forming a wrong judg    ment of it from inexperience in a matter so much out of their way    The little gentleman   yonder has spent so much breath  and shown   so much great reading on the subject  that I imagine it is proper for   me to make some answer  which I shall do in as few words as possible    being not half so long  Â« inded as he  But first I must beg leave to   tell him a story  to conform to rule        I have readin a book â€” for I perceive that common sense signifies   nothing here  if not supported by a quotation  it matters not whether   to the purpose or not â€” that a certain philosopher having declaimed   one day for a considerable length of time before Alexander the   Great  at the head of his army  on the duties of a general  the     1 Captain Hamilton  Davis s Olio       2 Lorrl Colville of Culross  Davis s Olio          Mr Pratt  afterwards Lord Camden  Lord Chief Justice of England      2a         370 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     eniperor turned about to Parmenio  one of his generals who stood   near him  and asked him what he thought of his speech     Sire      aiLswered Parmenio    my opinion is  that I never heard a fool talk   so learnedly          I make no applications  All that I say on this occasion is  that   I am sure that gentleman has never been at sea   and consequently   knows nothing of the service  on which he has been haranguing   with such vehemence and elocution  He has expatiated most   pathetically on the injustice of inflicting corporal punishment    without a legal trial and condemnation   and flourished on the   dfinger of such an invasion of liberty  ITiese  to be sure  are fine   words   but I much doubt whether they are properly applied on   this occasion  The most perfect form of government is allowed   to be absolute despotism  as best calculated to work its effects   without delay  In all the communities in this world  I doubt if   there is one where immediate obedience to the command of the   governor is so indispensably necessary to the safety of the whole    or where individuals are so insensible to every other motive to   obedience but fear  as in a man of war  I have myself the honour   to command a ship  in which I have five hundred men under me    the greatest part of whom  I am sorry to say it  are the outcasts   of human nature  as from some unhappy circumstances is  and   perhaps must always be  the imiversal ease in our service  Now    as instances daily occur  in which a moment s delay or hesitation   to execute my orders  though attended with the greatest difficulty    or most imminent danger  mast evidently hazard the loss of the   ship  and every life in her  T desire that gentleman to inform me   how I am to act  should one of the men  whom I order  suppose    to cut away a yard that is broken in the slings  refuse to go aloft    and tell me I have no right to punish him  till he is regularly tried   and found guilty   Shall I admit of such an answer to be an example   to the rest   Or shall I punish him with such severity on the spot    by my own mere authority  as to terrify any other from imitating   him   The answer to this plain question will determine the aSair   Tinder consideration  If it is said that in the present case the ship s   being in the harbour makes a difference   let us suppose her on
