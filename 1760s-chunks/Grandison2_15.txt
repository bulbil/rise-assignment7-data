Sir Ch  No where  Sir Hargrave  What has hitherto passed between us  was owing to accident  It is not my way to recriminate  To your own heart  however  I appeal  That must convince you  that the method you took to gain the Lady  rendered you unworthy of her  I took no unmanly advantage of you  That I refused to meet you in the way you have demanded  gives me a title to call myself your best friend—  Sir Har   My best friend   Sir —  Sir Ch  Yes  Sir  If either the preservation of your own life  or the saving you a long regret for takeing that of another  as the chance might have been  deserves your consideration  In short  it depends upon yourself  Sir Hargrave  to let me know whether   37 you were guilty of a bad action from mad and violent passion  or from design  and a natural byass  if I may so call it  to violence  which alone can lead you to think of justifying one bad action by another   Sir Har  Then  Sir  account me a man of natural violence  if you please  Who shall value the opinion of a man that has disgracefully—G—d d—you  Sir—Do you see—what marks I shall carry to my grave—  Sir Ch  Were I as violent as you  Sir Hargrave  you might carry those marks to your grave  and not wear them long —Let us breakfast  Sir  That will give you time to cool  Were I even to do  as you would have me  you will best find your account in being cool  You cannot think I would take such an advantage of you  as your passion would give me   Mr  Bag  Nobly said  by Heaven —Let us breakfast  Sir Hargrave  Then you will be cooler  Then will you be fitter to discuss this point  or any other   Mr  Merceda  Very right  You have a noble enemy  Sir Hargrave   Sir Ch  I am no man s enemy  Mr  Merceda  Sir Hargrave should consider  that  in the occasion for all this  he was to blame  and that all my part in the affair was owing to accident  not malice   Mr  Jordan  I doubt not  Sir Charles  but you are ready to ask pardon of Sir Hargrave  for your part—  Sir Ch  Ask pardon  Sir —No —I think I ought to have done just as I did  Were it to do again  I should do it  whoever were the man   Sir Har  See there  See there —Mr  Bagenhall  Mr  Merceda  Mr  Jordan  See there  Hear that —Who can have patience   Sir Ch  I can tell you who ought to have patience  Sir Hargrave  I should have a very mean opinion of any man here  called upon as I was  if he had not done just as I did  And a still meaner than I have of you  Sir Hargrave  had you  in the like case  refused   38 the same assistance to a woman in distress  But I will not repeat what I have written   Sir Har  If you are a man  Sir Charles Grandison  take your choice of one of those pistols  G—d—n you  I insist upon it   And I saw thro  the knot hole  that Sir Hargrave arose in passion   Sir Ch  As I AM a man  Sir Hargrave  I will not  It might look to an angry man like an insult  which I am above intending  were I to say  that I have given  on our first interview  proofs that I want not courage  I give you now  as I think  the highest I can give  in refusing your challenge  A personal insult I know how to repel  I know how to defend myself—But  as I said  I will not repeat any thing I have written   Mr  Mer  But  Sir Charles  you have threatened a man of honour in what you have written  if we take you right  with a weapon that ought to be used only to a scoundrel  yet refuse—  Sir Ch  The man  Sir  that shall take it into his head to insult me  may do it with the greater safety  tho  perhaps not with impunity  as he may be assured I will not kill him for it  if I can help it  I can play with my weapons  Sir  it may look like boasting   but will not play with any man s life  nor consent to make a sport of my own   Sir Har  D—n your coolness  Sir —I cannot bear—  Sir Ch  Curse not your safety  Sir Hargrave   Mr  Jor  Indeed  Sir Charles  I could not bear such an air of superiority—  Sir Ch  It is more than an air  Mr  Jordan  The man who can think of justifying one violent action by another  must give a real superiority against himself  Let Sir Hargrave confess his fault—I have put him in the way
