who suffered a beast  a mule  a bear to surprize me  and stink me into convulsions with the fumes of tobacco  —  Simper  who by this time  I found  was obliged to art for the clearness of his complexion  assumed an air of softness and sympathy  and lamented with many tender expressions of sorrow  the sad accident that had thrown him into that condition  then feeling his patient s pulse on the outside of his glove  gave it as his opinion  that his disorder was entirely nervous  and that some drops of tincture of castor and liquid laudanum  would be of more service to him than bleeding  by bridling the inordinate sallies of his spirits  and composing the fermentation of his bile proceeding therefrom —I was   312 therefore sent to prepare this prescription  which was administred in a glass of sack posset  after the captain had been put to bed  and orders sent to the officers on the quarter deck  to let no body walk on that side under which he lay     While the captain enjoyed his repose  the doctor watched over him  and indeed became so necessary  that a cabin was made for him contiguous to the state room  where Whiffle slept  that he might be at hand in case of accidents in the night —Next day  our commander being happily recovered  gave orders  that none of the lieutenants should appear upon deck  without a wig  sword  and ruffles  nor any midshipman  or other petty officer  be seen with a check shirt or dirty linen —He also prohibited any person whatever  except Simper and his own servants  from coming into the great cabbin  without first sending in to obtain leave —These singular regulations did not prepossess the ship s company in his favour  but on the contrary  gave scandal an opportunity to be very busy with his character  and accuse him of maintaining a correspondence with his surgeon  not fit to be named   In a few weeks  our ship was under sailing orders  and I was in hopes of re visiting my native country in a very short time  when the admiral s surgeon came on board  and sending for Morgan and me to the quarter deck  gave me to understand  there was a great scarcity of surgeons in the West Indies  that he was commanded to detain one mate out of every great ship that was bound for England  and desired us to agree among ourselves  before the next day at that hour  which of us should stay behind —We   313 were thunder struck at this proposal  and stared at one another some time  without speaking  at length the Welchman broke silence  and offered to remain in the West Indies  provided the admiral would give him a surgeon s warrant immediately  But he was told there was no want of chief surgeons  and that he must be contented with the station of mate  till he should be further provided for in due course  Whereupon Morgan flatly refused to quit the ship for which the commissioners of the navy had appointed him  and the other told him as plainly  that if we could not determine the affair by ourselves before tomorrow morning  he must cast lots  and abide by his chance —When I recalled to my remembrance the miseries I had undergone in England  where I had not one friend to promote my interest  or favour my advancement in the navy  and at the same time  reflected on the present dearth of surgeons in the West Indies  and the unhealthiness of the climate  which every day  almost  reduced the number  I could not help thinking my success would be much more certain and expeditious  by staying where I was  than by returning to Europe —I therefore resolved to comply with a good grace  and next day  when we were ordered to throw dice  told Morgan  he needed not trouble himself  for I would voluntarily submit to the admiral s pleasure —This frank declaration was commended by the gentleman  who assured me  it should not fare the worse with me for my resignation  Indeed he was as good as his word  and that very afternoon  procured a warrant  appointing me surgeon s mate of the Lizzard sloop of war  which   314 put me on a footing with every first mate in the service   My ticket being made out  I put my chest and bedding on board a canoe that was alongside  and having shook hands with my trusty friend the serjeant  and honest Jack Rattlin  who was bound for Greenwich hospital  I took my leave of Morgan with many tears  after we had exchanged our sleeve buttons as remembrances of each other —Having presented my new warrant to the captain of the Lizard  I enquired for the doctor  whom I no sooner saw  than I recollected him to be one of those young fellows with whom I had been committed to the round house  during our frolick with Jackson  as I have related before —He received me with a good deal of courtesy  and when I put him in mind of our former acquaintance  expressed great joy in seeing me again  and recommended me to an exceeding good mess  composed of the gunner and the master s mate —As there was not one sick person
