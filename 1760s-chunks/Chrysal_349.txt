the other holds in abhorrence    In pursuance  therefore  of a plan which he soon formed  he culti    vated the acquaintance of Eusebius with the greatest assiduity    and  in all his visits to his house  turned his conversation entirely   upon points of speculative knowledge  in which he professed the   most earnest desire of information  Eusebius took the bait  As   these were the usual topics of discourse between him and hia   daughter  he was pleased at her being present whenever my master   was with him  both for her information  and to give her an oppor    tunity of displaying the advantages she had received from his care     for which purpose he often led her and my master into arguments    to which he listened with the highest delight  as she always had   the better in them  Nor was she less pleased on such occasiona   than her father  The modest deference which my master con    stantly paid to her judgment was so flattering to her consciousness   of superiority  that she soon became fond of his company   at the   same time that the artfulness of his address to her  for he never   showed any other notice of her sex than by a most guarded delicacy   in his expressions  deceived the watchful care of Eusebius so effectu    ally  that he never scrupled to leave his two pupils â€” as he fondly   affected to call them â€” alone together  when any business demanded   his attendance elsewhere  As this was what my master had long   aimed at  it may be supposed he did not neglect to improve oppor    tunities so favourable to his wishes  He always turned his con    versation directly to such subjects as were most likely to inflame   the passions  on the gratification of which he expatiated with a   particular warmth and luxuriancy of imagination  but in terms   so well wrapped up  as to conceal the poison they conveyed  The   effect soon answered his design  Subjects  proposed merely as   points of speculation  gave her no alarm  And when such thoughts   are once suggested  nature will lead them to her own ends  Her   passions had been smothered  not extinguished   and were the readier   to take fire for such restraint  She heard him  therefore  with   pleasure  and slid insensibly into danger  the direct mention of   which would have struck her with horror      Matters were in this critical situation  when he returned from   the society  The moment he alighted  he flew to the house of   Eusebius  who unhappily was not at home  The conversation   soon fell into its late course  There are some moments in which   nature will bear down all opposition  Though she had indulged   herself in talking on such subjects  she meant nothing more  But   he was too well versed in the practice to let her stop at the theory     and one unguarded minute murdered the peace of her future life   and blasted the fruits of all her father s care  It is impossible to   describe what she felt when passion gave place to reason  and she   became sensible of what had passed  Even he  hackneyed as he   was in the ways of wickedness  could not stand it  He left her   precipitately  and for the first time felt something Uke remorse    But these qualms lasted not long  His desires were rather raised   than satisfied   besides that  to have stopped here  without making   his success public  would have disappointed perhaps the principal         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 419     pleasure he had in view  He resolved  therefore  to seduce her   from her father s house  that all the world might be witnesses of   his triumph  For this purpose he went to her the next morning    at a time when he knew Eusebius was usually engaged abroad    On inquiring for her  he was answered that she was not well   and   was turning about to go away  when her maid  who  from her own   experience  had suspected something of the cause of her mistress s   illness  officiously ran to him  and told him she was in her dressing          CHAPTER 2XXII     CONTTNTTED   CHKYSAl s MASTEB MAEBS HIS TEITTMPH PUBLIC BY   SEDUCING HIS NEW MISTKESS AWAY FROM HEB PATHEE s HOUSE â€”   THE MANNEE IN WHICH HE IMPOSED UPON THEM BOTH TO EPEBCT   THIS   WITH THE CONSOLATION HE GAVE HEE EOE SOME NATUEAL   CONSEQUENCES OF HIS GALLANTEY â€” HIS TEIUMPH IS COMPLETED   BY HEE GOING UPON THE TOWN  AND HER PATHBE s BEEAKINQ   HIS HEART â€” CHEYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE     His intimacy in the family giving him a
