of his purse with a look of tenderness that brought the   tears into his eyes     And shall I hazard the loss of thee     he cried       the object  the reward  of a life of toil and danger   Shall I sacri    fice the only good of life to that chimera  honour   â€” to that bubble    Tighter than air and more variable than the wind  the interest of   my country   What is honour without wealth   What is the   country to him who has nothing in it   Let the poor fight for   money â€” I have enough   Let the ambitious fight for gloryâ€” I    despise the empty name   Let those who have a property in their   country fight for it â€” I have none  nor can have  nor any of its   blessings  without thee   and therefore will not venture thy loss   for any such vain considerations        As soon as he had formed this prudent resolution  he clasped me   to his heart  kissed me  and returned me into his purse  just as the   lieutenant came in to tell him they could now make the ship  which   must be vastly rich  she was so deep in the water  My master made   no reply   but  taking a telescope in his hand  he went upon the   quarter deck  and viewing her for some time with great apparent   â  earnestness     You are all mistaken    said he    in that ship     rich  indeed   and so she may remain for us  That ship is a first rate         ADVENTUHES OF A GUINEA 29      man of war by her size   and as for her depth in the water  she   is only brought down by her guns  which are fifty two pounders   at least  Put about the ship  and make all sail possible from her    I am answerable for His Majesty s ship committed to my care  and   win not sacrifice her against such odds  Her weight of metal   would blow us out of the water  Besides  I have a packet on board   and must not go out of my way   about ship  and away directly    I say        The officers stood aghast at this speech  that disappointed all   their golden hopes  They urged  they beseeched  they remon    strated  that it was impossible she could be what he said  They   insisted that the colour of her sails  and the heaviness of her going   proved her to be a ship of trade that had been long at sea   and as   for her bulk  it only encouraged them to hope she would prove the   better prize  as all the ships that carry the treasure are very large     that they had observed they wronged her so much  they could go    round her if they pleased   and begged only that they might be   permitted to take a nearer view of her  which they were confident   would prove her to be what they said  They alleged the oppor    tunity of making aU their fortunes   the honour  the interest of   their country  They begged  swore  stormed  and wept   but all   in vain  The captain had taken his resolution  and would vouchsafe   no other answer than a repetition of what he said before    That he   was accountable for His Majesty s ship  and would not hazard her    to gratify them   besides  the packet he had on board might be   of worse consequence than the taking of such a ship  should she   even be what they said  though he was certain to the contrary  would   make amends for  And that  as to going nearer to her  the length   of her guns would enable them to drive every shot through and   through his ship  at a distance that his could never reach her from    though if they should be mad enough to engage her  his small shot   could never pierce such mountains of timber as her sides were barri    caded with    And so  as his power was absolute  they were obliged   to submit  and ofi he sheered      It is impossible to describe the distraction which this affair threw   our ship into  The officers acted all the inconsistent outrages of   madness  The men chewed the quid  damned their eyes and hmbs   for their bad luck  and went to work as usual   while several poor    sick wretches  whose spirits had been so raised by the hopes of such   a prize
