  Yes  sir  at your service   replied this  retainer of the law   and  if you please  the sooner we despatch the  affair the better  for  tis an old observation  that delay breeds  danger     Truly  brother   said the commodore  who could no longer  contain himself   I do confess that I am very much of your way of  thinking  d ye see  and therefore you shall be despatched in a trice    So saying  he lifted up his walking staff  which was something between  a crutch and a cudgel  and discharged it with such energy on the seat of  the attorney s understanding  that if there had been anything but solid  bone  the contents of his skull must have been evacuated   Fortified as he was by nature against all such assaults  he could not  withstand the momentum of the blow  which in an instant laid him flat  on the floor  deprived of all sense and motion  and Trunnion hopped  upstairs to dinner  applauding himself in ejaculations all the way for  the vengeance he had taken on such an impudent pettifogging miscreant     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The attorney no sooner awaked from his trance  into which he had been so  unexpectedly killed  than he cast his eyes around in quest of evidence   by which he might be enabled the more easily to prove the injury he had  sustained  but not a soul appearing  he made shift to get upon his legs  again  and  with the blood trickling over his nose  followed one of the  servants into the dining room  resolved to come to an explanation with  the assailant  and either extort money from him by way of satisfaction   or provoke him to a second application before witnesses  With this  view  he entered the room in a peal of clamour  to the amazement of all  present  and the terror of Mrs  Trunnion  who shrieked at the appearance  of such a spectacle  and addressing himself to the commodore   I ll  tell you what  sir   said he   if there be law in England  I ll make you  smart for this here assault   You think you have screened yourself from  a prosecution by sending all your servants out of the way  but that  circumstance will appear upon trial to be a plain proof of the malice  prepense with which the fact was committed  especially when corroborated  by the evidence of this here letter  under your own hand  whereby I am  desired to come to your own house to transact an affair of consequence   So he produced the writing  and read the contents in these words                       Mr  Roger Ravine       Sir   Being in a manner prisoner in my own house  I desire      you will give me a call precisely at three o clock in the      afternoon  and insist upon seeing myself  as I have an affair      of great consequence  in which your particular advice is      wanted by your humble servant                                       Hawser Trunnion    The one eyed commander  who had been satisfied with the chastisement he  had already bestowed upon the plaintiff  hearing him read this audacious  piece of forgery  which he considered as the effect of his own villainy   started up from table  and seizing a huge turkey that lay in a dish  before him  would have applied it  sauce and all  by way of poultice  to  his wound  had he not been restrained by Hatchway  who laid fast hold on  both his arms  and fixed him to his chair again  advising the attorney  to sheer off with what he had got  Far from following this salutary  counsel  he redoubled his threats  set Trunnion at defiance  telling him  he not a man of true courage  although he had commanded a ship of war   or else he would not have attacked any person in such a cowardly and  clandestine manner  This provocation would have answered his purpose  effectually  had not his adversary s indignation been repressed by the  suggestions of the lieutenant  who desired his friend  in a whisper  to  be easy  for he would take care to have the attorney tossed in a  blanket for his presumption  This proposal  which he received with  great approbation  pacified him in a moment  he wiped the sweat from his  forehead  and his features relaxed into a grim smile   Hatchway disappeared  and Ravine proceeded with great fluency of abuse   until he was interrupted by the arrival of Pipes  who  without any  expostulation  led him out by the hand  and conducted
