the  insinuations of a foreigner who had come over with him  and filled his  imagination with extravagant notions of pleasure  infinitely superior  to any which he could enjoy while he was in the trammels and under the  restraints of a governor  He  therefore  turned a deaf ear to all M   s  arguments  and entreated him to accompany him in the journey  but  this gentleman  foreseeing that a young man  like my lord  of strong  passions  and easy to be misled  would  in all probability  squander  away great sums of money  in a way that would neither do credit to  himself  or to those who were concerned with him  resisted all his  solicitations  on pretence of having business of consequence at London   and afterwards had reason to be extremely well pleased with his own  conduct in this particular    Before he set out on this expedition  M    in justice to himself   reminded him of the proposal which he had made to him at Marseilles   desiring to know if he had altered his design in that particular  in  which case he would turn his thoughts some other way  as he would not  in the least be thought to intrude or pin himself upon any man  My lord  protested in the most solemn manner  that he still continued in his  former resolution  and  again beseeching him to bear him company into  France  promised that everything should be settled to his satisfaction  upon their return to England  M    however  still persisted in his  refusal  for the above mentioned reasons  and  though he never heard  more of the annuity  he nevertheless continued to serve his lordship  with his advice and good offices ever after  particularly in directing  his choice to an alliance with a lady of eminent virtue  the daughter of  a noble lord  more conspicuous for his shining parts than the splendour  of his titles  a circumstance upon which he always reflected with  particular satisfaction  as well on account of the extraordinary merit  of the lady  as because it vested in her children a considerable part  of that great estate  which of right belonged to her grandmother  and  afterwards put him in a way to retrieve his estate from a heavy load of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   debt he had contracted  When my lord set out on his Paris expedition   the money M   had received from his generous friend at Paris was almost  reduced to the last guinea  He had not yet reaped the least benefit from  his engagements with his lordship  and  disdaining to ask for a supply  from him  he knew not how to subsist  with any degree of credit  till  his return    This uncomfortable prospect was the more disagreeable to him  as  at  that time of life  he was much inclined to appear in the gay world  had  contracted a taste for plays  operas  and other public diversions  and  acquired an acquaintance with many people of good fashion  which could  not be maintained without a considerable expense  In this emergency   he thought he could not employ his idle time more profitably than in  translating  from foreign languages  such books as were then chiefly in  vogue  and upon application to a friend  who was a man of letters  he  was furnished with as much business of that kind as he could possibly  manage  and wrote some pamphlets on the reigning controversies of that  time  that had the good fortune to please  He was also concerned in a  monthly journal of literature  and the work was carried on by the two  friends jointly  though M   did not at all appear in the partnership   By these means he not only spent his mornings in useful exercise but  supplied himself with money for what the French call the menus plaisirs   during the whole summer  He frequented all the assemblies in and about  London  and considerably enlarged his acquaintance among the fair sex    He had  upon his first arrival in England  become acquainted with a  lady at an assembly not far from London  and though  at that time  he  had no thoughts of extending his views farther than the usual gallantry  of the place  he met with such distinguishing marks of her regard in  the sequel  and was so particularly encouraged by the advice of another  lady  with whom he had been intimate in France  and who was now of  their parties  that he could not help entertaining hopes of making an  impression upon the heart of his agreeable partner  who was a young lady  of an ample fortune and great expectations  He therefore cultivated her  good graces with all the assiduity and address of which he was master   and succeeded so well in his endeavours  that  after a due course of  attendance  and the death of an aunt  by which she received an accession  of fortune to the amount of three and twenty thousand pounds  he  ventured to declare his
