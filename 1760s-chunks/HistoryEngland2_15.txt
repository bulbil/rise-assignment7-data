meet at a certain place  he unexpectedly appeared before the terrified assembly  at the head of his red regiment  which had been hitherto invincible  He demanded  in the name of God  what their assembly and murmurings would be at  and  receiving an insolent answer  he laid two of the most remarkable dead upon the ground with his own hands  The guards dispersing the rest  he caused several of them to be hanged upon the spot  sent others prisoners to London  and thus dispersed a faction  no otherwise criminal than in having followed his own example   This action served still more to increase his power in the camp  in the parliament  and in the city  Fairfax  now become a Lord  was nominally general  but Cromwell was invested with all the power of the army  The King  a prisoner in the Isle of Wight  still continued to negotiate a peace  while the parliament   38 saw no other method of destroying the military power which themselves had raised  but by opposing to it that of the King  Frequent propositions therefore passed between the captive Monarch and the commons  but the great obstacle  their insisting upon destroying Episcopacy  still defeated every measure   In the mean time the Scotch  ashamed of having been thought to have sold their King  raised an army in his favour  Many of the young nobility in England seconded their intentions  the King s desperate affairs once more began to wear a favourable aspect  which Cromwell perceiving  led his veteran army to certain victory  Success still seemed to back his crimes  he defeated their forces entirely at Preston  and took the Duke of Hamilton  their general  prisoner  Fair fax  on the other hand  was equally successful in Kent and Essex  the insurgents having retired into the city of Colchester  which declared for the King  he blocked them up  and  having compelled them to surrender at discretion  he treated them with that inhumanity for which the republican army was at that time remarkable   The parli ment still continued to treat with the King  and  apprehending more from the designs of their generals than the attempts of their Monarch  seemed in earnest  for the first time  in their negotiations  but it was now too late  the army soon returned crowned with their accustomed success  and with furious remonstrances demanded justice upon the King  They accused him as the cause of all the misfortunes of the kingdom  and insisted that his partizans and favourites should share with him in his public punishment  This remonstrance was soon after backed by petitions from the garrisons dispersed over different parts of the kingdom  and the counties of Somerset and Norfolk concurred in the same demand  Fairfax  being influenced by Cromwell  and   39 not perceiving that he was the tool of his crafty collegue  transferred his royal prisoner from the Isle of Wight to Hurst castle  The parliament complained of this arbitrary proceeding  but their remonstrances were now but empty sound  They began to issue ordinances for a more effectual opposition  but they received a message from Cromwell  that he intended paying them a visit next day with his army  and in the mean time ordered them to raise him upon the city of London forty thousand pounds  Affrighted at the approaching danger  they complied with his demand  and  in the mean time  the general with his army came and took up his quarters in the skirts of the city  The commons still proceeded in the treaty with the King  but this Cromwell was resolved to oppose  they voted  that the carrying the King prisoner to Hurst castle was without the advice or consent of the house  To punish them for this  Cromwell placed guards round their house  and made those members prisoners whom he judged most opposite to his designs  One of his colonels  whose name was Pride  having a paper of names in his hand  seized upon one and forty  and sent them to the Court of Wards  where they were kept under guard  These were Presbyterians  the original authors of all the troubles  and who now fell victims to the side they had espoused  The next day an hundred more of the members were denied entrance  and that part of the house which now remained was entirely composed of a small body of Independants  ludicrously called the Rump  These soon voted  that the transactions of the house  a few days before  were illegal  and that the general s conduct was just and necessary   This parliament  if it now deserves the name  was nothing but a medley of the most obscure citizens  the slaves of the army  the officers of which  being themselves members  ruled all their proceedings  It   40 was now therefore unanimously resolved in this seditious assembly to erect an High Court of Justice  with power to try the King for treason against the kingdom  For form sake they desired the concurrence of the few remaining Lords in the other house  but even here there still was virtue enough left unanimously to reject so horrid a proposal  This no way abated the ardour of the commons  they voted that the concurrence of the house of Lords was unnecessary  they declared that all power was originally derived from the people
