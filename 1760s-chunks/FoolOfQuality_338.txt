up  the picture of   my Matilda  that was richly enamelled  and set with brilliants to a   great value  suddenly looses from its riband  and dropped through   the bosom of my shirt upon the floor      I stood concerned and greatly abashed by this accident   but my   pupil  still more alarmed  started up  and  catching at it  gazed   upon it intensely  Ha  my friend   said he  I doubt you are an   impostor  The proprietor of this jewel would never set himself out   to hire without some sinister design  Who  sir  and what are you       I own  said I  my sweet fellow  that I am not what I seem    I am of noble descent  and of riches sufficient to purchase a         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  373     principality  And what then could induce you to impose upon   us as you have done  Curiosity at first  and then the strong   inclination which I took both to you and your mother at our first   interview  neither did I propose to reveal myself till we should   reach my native country  where all sorts of honours and affluence   attend you  Tell me then  said he  whose picture is this  a very   lovely one  indeed   Is this the face  sir  of your mistress or your   wife   looking very inquisitively at me   Ah  said I  she was   once mistress of thousands of hearts  nobles waited before her   drawing room  and dukes near her toilet  She was once also my   wife   but the dear saint is now eternally blessed in a more suitable   Bridegroom      Will you indulge me  sir  said he  with the story of your loves     it may atone in a great measure for your late deception  which    however well meant  was very alarming      Here I related to him the short pathetic history that I told you   of my Matilda  with which he was so affected  arid in such agitation    that I was quite affrighted for him  and stopped several times   but   he insisted on my proceeding      Ah   said he  when I concluded  should I ever be comforted in   the manner that you and your Matty were  how blessed I shall   think myself   I have  said I  a little cousin in England  and perhaps   the loveliest child in the world  and if you will marry her  when you   both come to proper years  I will settle ten million of French   money upon you  Mean time  I beseech you to say nothing to   your mamma of what has passed  I will not  said he  unless I see   a discretionary necessity for it      That night I went to the city to settle the affairs of my house    hold  On my return next morning  I met Mr  De Wit at the gate   of his court      Ah  my friend   said he  our amiable guests are departed  Gone     I cried  Gone   which way  where to  I pray you  That also is   a secret  said he  which I am not permitted to tell you  Late in   the evening there arrived a retinue of about twenty servants    strongly armed and mounted  with a flying chaise and six horses    and a packet of letters  The lady did not go to bed  but ordered   all things to be in readiness for their departure against the rising   of the moon  When they were near setting out  and going to bid   me adieu Have you no commands  madam  said I  for the good   young man  your tutor   Not a penny  says she   I cannot afford to   pay wages equivalent to servants of his quality  How  madam    said I  is my friend then detected  But it was a very innocent   and friendly fraud  I assure you   I should not have imposed him   upon your ladyship  did I not know you to be safer in his honour    able hands than those of any other  I then gave them an account   of your family  your vast fortune  nor was I quite silent as   to your merits  my dear Harry   and I added  that I was sensible   you would be deeply afflicted at the departure of persons to   whom you were so strongly attached  There is no help for   it  replied the lady   we have reasons of the utmost import for   not disclosing ourselves to him  Tell him
