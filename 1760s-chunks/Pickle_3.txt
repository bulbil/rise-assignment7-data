 sucking babe  Lord help us  it will do your honour s heart good to hear  him tell a story  as how he lay alongside of the French  yard arm and  yard arm  board and board  and of heaving grapplings  and stink pots   and grapes  and round and double headed partridges  crows and carters   Lord have mercy upon us  he has been a great warrior in his time  and  lost an eye and a heel in the service  Then he does not live like any  other Christian land man  but keeps garrison in his house  as if he  were in the midst of his enemies  and makes his servants turn out in  the night  watch and watch as he calls it  all the year round  His  habitation is defended by a ditch  over which he has laid a draw bridge   and planted his court yard with patereroes continually loaded with shot   under the direction of one Mr  Hatchway  who had one of his legs shot  away while he acted as lieutenant on board the commodore s ship  and  now  being on half pay  lives with him as his companion  The lieutenant  is a very brave man  a great joker  and  as the saying is  hath got the  length of his commander s foot  though he has another favourite in the  house called Tom Pipes  that was his boatswain s mate  and now keeps the  servants in order  Tom is a man of few words  but an excellent hand at  a song concerning the boatswain s whistle  hustle cap  and  chuck farthing  there is not such another pipe in the county  so that  the commodore lives very happy in his own manner  though he be sometimes  thrown into perilous passions and quandaries  by the application of his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   poor kinsmen  whom he can t abide  because as how some of them were the  first occasion of his going to sea  Then he sweats with agony at the  sight of an attorney  just  for all the world  as some people have an  antipathy to a cat  for it seems he was once at law  for striking one of  his officers  and cast in a swinging sum  He is  moreover  exceedingly  afflicted with goblins that disturb his rest  and keep such a racket in  his house  that you would think  God bless us   all the devils in hell  had broke loose upon him  It was no longer ago than last year about  this time  that he was tormented the livelong night by the mischievous  spirits that got into his chamber  and played a thousand pranks about  his hammock  for there is not one bed within his walls  Well  sir   he rang his bell  called up all his servants  got lights  and made  a thorough search  but the devil a goblin was to be found  He had no  sooner turned in again  and the rest of the family gone to sleep  than  the foul fiends began their game anew  The commodore got up in the  dark  drew his cutlass  and attacked them both so manfully  that in  five minutes everything in the apartment went to pieces  The lieutenant   hearing the noise  came to his assistance  Tom Pipes  being told what  was the matter  lighted his match  and going down to the yard  fired all  the patereroes as signals of distress  Well  to be sure the whole parish  was in a pucker  some thought the French had landed  others imagined the  commodore s house was beset by thieves  for my own part  I called up two  dragoons that are quartered upon me  and they swore  with deadly oaths   it was a gang of smugglers engaged with a party of their regiment that  lies in the next village  and mounting their horses like lusty fellows   rode up into the country as fast as their beasts could carry them  Ah   master  These are hard times  when an industrious body cannot earn his  bread without fear of the gallows  Your worship s father  God rest his  soul   was a good gentleman  and as well respected in this parish as  e er a he that walks upon neat s leather  and if your honour should want  a small parcel of fine tea  or a few ankers of right Nantes  I ll be  bound you shall be furnished to your heart s content  But  as I was  saying  the hubbub continued till morning  when the parson being sent  for  conjured the spirits into the Red Sea  and the house has been  pretty quiet ever since  True it is  Mr  Hatchway makes a mock of the  whole affair  and told his commander  in this very blessed spot  that  the two goblins were no other than a couple of jackdaws which had fallen  down the chimney  and made a flapping with their wings up and down the  apartment
