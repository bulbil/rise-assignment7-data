 or the Instigation of the Devil  sometimes prompts Men to Enmity with their Fellow creatures  tempting them to communicate some Portion of that Misery to others  which the evil Spirit of Mischief torments their own Hearts with  In this Case then  I look upon Revenge to be not only Natural  but Moral too  for the Disappointment of Malice  or the Retorting of it with   81 Vengeance  is a more likely Method of curing the vicious Habit  than Non resistance and Forgiveness  which but nourish the Distemper   Your Sentiment    That we should behave well to our Friends out of Love  and to our Enemies out of Picque   is certainly very noble  but give me leave to observe  that this is but a partial Virtue  as it regards intirely our own Advantage  but tends not to the Reformation of another s Manners  This may have an Effect  perhaps  upon some ingenuous Natures  but of such our late Letters have not been conversant  and  in Truth  they are so few  that this can only be considered as a particular  not a general Rule     I may be wrong in my Opinion  but Nature never errs  and  as the Brute Creation is inspired with such a Passion  we may stile it the second Principle  as Self preservation is the First  and I dare say  that Seneca  dying in the Bath  would have smiled  in his last Moments  to have seen Nero pale and breathless at his Feet  Perhaps too  it was some Idea of Revenge on Caesar  that prompted Cato to put himself to Death  otherwise he acted very unaccountably  to disappoint the Conqueror s Triumph  and to draw off the Acclamations of the World  in secret Murmurs  at their Hero s Fate  However  to compound this Dispute upon Revenge  I will agree with you  that  as a Passion    82 it is a Vice  provided you will admit  that  as a Principle  it may be a Virtue   Adieu   F   LETTER XLIX  HENRY to FRANCES   THANKS to your Enquiry  I am much better in Health and Spirits  than I was Yesterday  which I attribute chiefly to your Visit  If you really have any Thing to say  as you hint in your Letter  are you like a Spright  not able to deliver it   till you are first spoken to  I wish you would only give me the Clue  that I may be able to trace your Labyrinth  For I am not ingenious enough to unriddle your Meaning without it  In short  my Dear  you have so speculated away your Senses  that one must have the intuitive Science of an Angel  to converse with you  by the Intelligence of Souls   As for the Antithesis of your Regards for me  it is no other Ways to be accounted for  but by supposing  that you have either imposed on me  or yourself  If you ever loved   83 me  you do so still  I need not add  that you have more Reason for it now  if Reason has any Thing to do in such Affairs  If you never loved me  you are only grown indifferent to me  and  being ashamed to own it  as that is a State  which Lovers never come to  you pretend to hate me   Pray who are those Friends you hint at  who have merited more from you than I  None indeed  thou Child of Fantasy and Caprice  except  by greater Merits  you mean more personal Worth  and  in this Particular  I must confess myself the meanest of your Admirers  tho  the sincerest of your Friends  You have certainly a very whimsical Manner of playing with my Passion for you  and  after the Kindness and Condescension of your Visit Yesterday  I confess myself surprized at the Unaccountableness of your Letter this Morning  I shall do myself the Pleasure of waiting on you this Evening  and  if I have the Happiness of meeting you alone  and at Leisure enough  I design to have some Conversation with you farther upon this Subject   Adieu   ma Bizarre   Henry     84  LETTER L  FRANCES to HENRY   I AM extremely obliged to you for your sprightly Poem  there is an uncommon Fancy in it  which pleases me  and it is something of this Stile in your Character which attaches me so remarkably to you  for  were you but like the best of other Men  you might find me oftener yawning in your Face  as I do at them  The only Variety I find  in the Circle of my Acquaintance  is in the Cornet  who is grown so lively of late  that  as Bayes says  he has  elevated and surprized me   and  as a Man of Gaiety  without a Mistress  is  in the Opinion of the Town  no Man at all  he has bethought himself of throwing his Devoirs at my Feet  and  taking Advantage of your Absence  proceeds with so much unwonted Gallantry  that your poor Iphigenia may be in Danger of being smitten by her Cymon
