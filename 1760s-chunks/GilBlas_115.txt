into her apartment  it was only on the express and reiterated assurance that none but the most innocent favours should be requested at her hands  One night he found her in a state of unusual perturbation  She had been informed that Roger was drawing near his end  and had sent for Siffredi as lord high chancellor of the kingdom  and the legal depository of his last will and testament  Already did she figure to herself her dear Enriquez elevated to royal honours  She was afraid of losing her lover in her sovereign  and that fear had strangely affected her spirits  The tears were standing in her eyes  when the unconscious cause of them appeared before her  You weep  madam  said he  what am I to think of this overwhelming grief  My lord  answered Blanche  it were vain for me to hide my apprehensions  The king your uncle is at the point of death  and you will soon be called to supply his place  When I measure the distance placed between us by your approaching greatness  I will own to you that my mind misgives me  The monarch and the lover estimate objects through a far different medium  What constituted the fondest wish of the individual  while his aspiring thoughts were checked by the control of a superior  fades into insignificance before the tumultuous cares or brilliant destinies of royalty  Be it the misgiving of an anxious heart  or the whisper of a well founded opinion  I feel distracting emotions succeed one another in my breast  which not all my just confidence in your goodness can allay  The source of my mistrust is not in the suspected steadiness of your attachment  but in a diffidence of my own happy fate  Lovely and beloved Blanche  replied the prince  your fears but bind me the more firmly in your fetters  and warrant my devotion to your charms  Yet this excessive indulgence of a fond jealousy borders on disloyalty to love  and  if I may venture to say so  trenches on the esteem to which my constancy has hitherto entitled me  No  no  never entertain a doubt that my destiny can ever be sundered from yours  but rather indulge the pleasing anticipation  that you  and you alone  will be the arbitress of my fate  and the source of all my bliss  Away  then  with these vain alarms  Why must they disturb an intercourse so charming  Ah  my lord  rejoined the daughter of Leontio  your subjects  when they place the crown upon your head  may ask of you a princess queen  descended from a long line of kings  whose glittering alliance shall join new realms to your hereditary estates  Perhaps  alas  you will meet their ambitious aims  even at the expense of your softest vows  Nay  why  resumed Enriquez  with rising passion  why too ready a self tormentor  do you raise so afflicting a phantom of futurity  Should heaven take the king my uncle to itself  and place Sicily under my dominion  I swear to unite myself with you at Palermo  in presence of my whole court  To this I call to witness all which is held sacred and inviolable among men   The protestations of Enriquez removed the fears of Siffredi s daughter  The rest of their discourse turned on the king s illness  Enriquez displayed the goodness of his natural disposition  for he pitied his uncle s lot  though he had no reason to be greatly affected by it  but the force of blood extorted from him sentiments of regret for a prince whose death held out an immediate prospect of the crown  Blanche did not yet know all the misfortunes which hung over her  The constable of Sicily  who had met her coming out of her father s apartment  one day when he was at the castle of Belmonte on some business of importance  was struck with admiration  The very next day  he made proposals to Siffredi  who entertained his offer favourably  but the illness of Roger taking place unexpectedly about that time  the marriage was put off for the present  and the subject had not been hinted at in the most distant manner to Blanche   One morning  as Enriquez had just finished dressing  he was surprised to see Leontio enter his apartment  followed by Blanche  Sir  said this minister  the news I have to announce will in some degree afflict your excellent heart  but it is counteracted by consoling circumstances which ought to moderate your grief  The king your uncle has departed this life  and by his death left you the heir of his sceptre  Sicily is at your feet  The nobility of the kingdom wait your orders at Palermo  They have commissioned me to receive them in person  and I come  my liege  with my daughter to pay you the earliest and sincerest homage of your new subjects  The prince  who was well aware that Roger had been for two months sinking under a complaint gradual in its progress but fatal in its nature  was not astonished at this news  And yet  struck with his sudden exaltation  he felt a thousand confused motions rising up by turns in his heart  He mused for some time  then breaking silence  addressed these words to Leontio    Wise Siffredi  I have always considered
