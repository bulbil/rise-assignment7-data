    safety   nor had he profited so little by his father s example  as to   be moved with a suggestion that evidently appeared  however   true it might be in itself  to spring at that time from resentment    And as he could not expect to reap any great advantage from   being acknowledged for the spurious son of one who had many   legitimate children to inherit his fortune  he thought it better to   confirm the former opinion  by his slights of the claim of Pound    age  and since he must be the bastard of one of them  choose the   lord before his servant      But to return to my master  He was dressed by that time   Poundage came back with the money  when taking the five hundred   for his own use  he went to his appointment      As to the other five hundred  which he had ordered to be paid   to his tailor  for fear of the wretch s applying to the lord himself   in his despair  Poundage did send for him  and  in compassion to   his distresses  advanced him four hundred pounds  of his own   money  for he had not a shilling of his lordship s in his hands     for which piece of service he desired no other consideration  than   a receipt for five hundred pounds  though it might be so long   before he could get it back  that he expected to be a loser by his   friendship  which Mr Buckram need not  as he could bring it up in   his next bill  Of this I came to the knowledge some time after    in the course of my circulation      It was five o clock  and dinner just serving up  when my lord   joined his company  At dinner  and during the reign of the   bottle for a couple of hours after  the conversation turned upon all   the polite topics of the times  wherein there could be no long   disputes  as every difference in opinion was immediately deter    mined by a bet  the supreme decision of peace  war  rehgion and   law  But this dissipated piddling soon gave way to the serious   business of the evening  to which they aU adjourned  with an   intention and anxiety worthy of the consequence at stake      It is impossible to give you any idea of this scene  in which   every moment produced such sudden transitions from despair to   exultation  from shouts of joy to the most blasphemous execra    tion of their very being  on the vicissitudes in the momentary   fortunes of the actors  that the very recollection of it is a pain even   to me      However  it made no such impression upon them  but they   continued at it tiU about six in the morning  when they retired for   the night      In the course of the evening  I often went the circuit of the whole   company round  and at length was carried home by a new master    But  before I say anjrthing of him  I must give you a few slight   sketches of the characters of some others of the company  and   particularly of my late lord  in whose whole appearance and   behaviour there was something so extraordinary      There is scarce a stronger instance of the tyranny of avarice   over the heart of man  than the passion for play  which now   is so general and prevalent  as to seem in a manner to have   drowned every other  The tenderest  the strongest  connections of   friendship and nature  yield to the force of this resistless infatuation          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 41     The persons who esteem each other most in the world this moment    no sooner sitting down to this decision of fate  than they labour   for each other s ruin  with all the assiduity and eagerness of the   most inveterate hatred and revenge      Nor is this practice confined to those alone whom necessity may   seem to stimulate to so desperate a resource   the richest are often   the most infatuated with this passion  who  possessiog already   more than they can enjoy  hazard that  and give themselves up   a prey to anxiety  and often to despair  to indulge a fruitless   desire for more      Of this last class were most of the company  among whom my   late lord had spent this evening   some few indeed there were whom   this foUy had reduced to the former  and necessitated to live by   their experience in the art which had been their ruin          CHAPTER XV     THE COMPAifT EEPBBSENTED IN PEESPBCTIVB â€” SET A
