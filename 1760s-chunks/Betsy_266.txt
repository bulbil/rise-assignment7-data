manner  No   added she  with greater   vehemence than before   I despise the low  the grovelling mind  light   and darkness are not more opposites than we are  and can as easily   agree         You must not think  nor talk in this fashion   said the good lady   all   you can accuse him of will not amount to a separation  besides  consider   how odd a figure a woman makes who lives apart from her husband  there   is an absolute necessity for a reconciliation  and  as it is probable   that neither of you will pursue any measures for that purpose  it is   highly proper your friends should take upon them to interpose in the   affair        It was a considerable time before Mrs  Munden could be persuaded  by all   the arguments Lady Trusty made use of  that either her duty  her   interest  or her reputation  required she should forgive the insults she   had received from this ungrateful and unworthy husband       The good lady would not  however  give over till she had prevailed on   her not only to listen to her reasons  but also to be at last perfectly   convinced by them  this point being gained  the manner in which the   matter should be conducted was the next thing that employed her   thoughts       It seemed best to her that the two Mr  Thoughtlesses should not be made   acquainted with any part of what had passed  if the business she so much   wished to see accomplished could be effected without their knowledge    her reason for it was this  they were both men of pretty warm   dispositions  especially the younger  and as they had been so assiduous   in promoting this match  so early a breach  and the provocations given   for it by Mr  Munden  might occasion them to shew their resentment for   his behaviour in a fashion which would make what was already very bad    much worse        Sir Ralph is a man in years   said she   has been your guardian  and I   am apt to believe that  on both these accounts  his words will have some   weight with Mr  Munden  the friendship which he knows is between us    will also give me the privilege of adding something in my turn  and  I   hope  by our joint mediation  this quarrel may be made up  so far  at   least  as that you may live civilly together        Mrs  Munden made no other reply to what her ladyship had said  than to   thank her for the interest she took in her affairs  and the trouble she   was about to give Sir Ralph on her account       The truth is  this young lady would in her heart have been much better   satisfied that there had been a possibility of being separated for ever   from a person who  she was now convinced  had neither love nor esteem   for her  rather than to have consented to cohabit with him as a wife    even though he should be prevailed upon to request it in the most   seemingly submissive terms       While they were in this conversation  a message came from Mr  Edward   Goodman  containing an invitation to Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty  to an   entertainment that gentleman had ordered to be prepared the next day for   several of his friends  on a particular occasion  which  because the   reader as yet is wholly ignorant of  it is highly proper he should be   made acquainted with                CHAPTER VIII       Presents the reader with some passages which could not conveniently be   told before  and  without all doubt  have been for a long time   impatiently expected          The spirits of Lady Mellasin had for several months been kept up by the   wicked agents she had employed in the management of the worst cause that   ever was taken in hand  those subtle and most infamous wretches  in   order to draw fresh supplies of money from that unhappy woman  had still   found means to elude and baffle all the endeavours of Mr  Goodman s   honest lawyer to bring the manner to a fair trial       But  at last  all their diabolical inventions  their evasions  their   subterfuges  failing  and the day appointed which they knew must   infallibly bring the whole dark mystery of iniquity to light  when all   their perjuries must be explored  and themselves exposed to the just   punishment of such flagitious crimes  not one of them had courage to   stand the
