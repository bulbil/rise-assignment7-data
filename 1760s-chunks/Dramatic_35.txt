what I was  I made interest to be engaged  as one of the subaltern players  belonging to the Theatre in London  only to do trifling parts  and when I was once seen upon the Stage in that capacity  it was impossible any person could suspect I was good for any thing     A brother of our order followed me with fresh instructions  but as his part required he should be introduced at all hours  and in all places  to the very best company  he assumed the character of an Italian fiddler  tooth cleaner and designer  and when we have met to compare notes in an evening  he has made me smile  to hear him relate how every door used to fly open at his approach  and he would gossip for two  Page  106  hours with very great personages  while the anti chamber would be full of colonels and commodores  waiting for an audience     The earthquake was of my projecting  so was the bottle conjurer  it was me who wrote the prophecy for the person called the life guardman  but in reality he was porter to the Fanciscans at Padua     He  as you may remember  foretold the return of the earthquake would happen such a day  and Bloomsbury fields  and Bloomsburysquare  was filled with coaches  and whole families crammed in them  who there set all night  not daring to trust themselves in their own houses  I smiled when I saw them thus huddled together  but was amazed to see many of your preachers hurrying out of town  as if they were panick struck with the dread of leaving this world—when they are certain  there is one so infinitely preferable  and in which  by the doctrines they profess  they must be eternally happy     Are they  thought I  only like physicians  who administer medicines for the good of mankind   as they say  yet have no faith in their own prescriptions     One afternoon  by chance  I met with Elizabeth Canning  she had lost six pence  was crying about  dared not to go home  she said—I observed her  she had the most stupid look  yet on conversing with her  I discovered she possessed cunning and obstinacy     By the promise of making up her loss  a new topknot  and the temptation of riding in a hackney coach  I prevailed upon her to go with me  and when she was perfect in her part  I exhibited  Page  107  her  as you must remember  this scheme answered  to prove English peoples aptness to embrace  or take part with incoherencies     Rejoiced I was  when the gentleman  who endeavoured to detect the imposture  met with such opposition by his example  I was sure other magistrates would be deterred from making any other strict and impartial enquires—for indeed Mr  Trip  thus the Jesuit went on  though your nation is one of the best in the world  yet at present  folly and prejudice have spread themselves so pestilentially among all ranks and denominations  that any person  who now would en deavour to benefit his country from a praiseworthy principle of integrity—So great is the defection throughout all degrees—so epidemic the contagion of self interest  the patriot would be hooted at for a madman  reviled as a pretender  or punished with contempt  and if possible with beggary     Preferment makes the English nation behave  just as the children of Israel did  when the manna fell among them  they snatch up all they can  overload themselves often— no matter  by this method  less is left for their neighbours     After this affair was over  I was sent for back to Rome upon special affairs  relative to our society  but I left a brother of our order full instructions how to proceed  and the plan for a project  that  as soon as he recovered  he was to put in execution  it was the COCK LANE PHANTOM  or what was then called Miss Fanney s Spirit     This was our most favourite scheme  this was our corner stone  we therefore employed  Page  108  more—I suppose he would have said skill  but our ship  at that moment  by the wind shifting  took such a lust  that her lee ruff tree dipped in the water  and the Jesuit was canted overboard out of his hammock  pitched his head upon the trunnion of a four pounder  and never spoke another word     I was overset  but I soon righted  but as for my companion  death clapped a stopper upon his tongue  as quick as one could crack a biscuit     And this is the truth  and the whole truth  and nothing but the truth  as witness my hand     WILLIAM TRIP  Mariner   In the analytical destination of the incorporalities of ghosts  wrote originally in Runic  translated by SAXO GRAMMATICUS into the German  there is one page  which  for the benefit of all true believers  I have taken the trouble to render into English  viz     There are three distinct or separate species  or classes of
