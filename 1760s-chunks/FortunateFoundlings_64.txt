fail to be   at the place you mention  but oh  my dear   count  I hope you will never give me cause to   repent this step   if you should  I must be   the most miserable of all created beings  but I   am resolved to believe you are all that man ought   to be  or that fond tenacious woman can desire    and in that confidence attend with impatience   the hour in which there shall be no more reserve   between us  and I be wholly yours       MELANTHE           Thus every thing being fixed for her undoing  she spent the best part of   the day in preparing for the rendezvous  nothing was omitted in the   article of dress  which might heighten her charms and secure her   conquest   the glass was consulted every moment  and every look and   various kind of languishment essayed  in order to continue in that which   she thought would most become the occasion  As she ordinarily past a   great deal of time in this employment  Louisa was not surprized that she   now wasted somewhat more than usual  and the discourse they had together   while she was dressing  and all the time of dinner  being very much on   the ball and the company who were at it  her thoughts were so much taken   up with the remembrance of du Plessis  that she perceived not the hurry   of spirits which would else have been visible enough to her in all the   words and motions of the other  and which increased in proportion as the   hour of her appointment drew nearer       At length it arrived  and a servant came into the room and acquainted   Louisa a gentleman desired to speak with her  she was a little   surprized  it being usual for all those who visited there to expect   their reception from Melanthe  but that lady  who doubted not but it was   the same person the count had mentioned in his letter  prevented her   from saying any thing  by immediately giving orders for the gentleman to   be admitted       But with what strange emotions was the heart of Louisa agitated  when   she saw monsieur du Plessis come into the room  and after paying his   respects to Melanthe in the most submissive manner  accosted her  with   saying he took the liberty of enquiring of her health after the fatigue   of the last night  but  added he  the question  now I have the happiness   of seeing you  is altogether needless  those fine eyes  and that   sprightly air  declare you formed for everlasting gaiety  and that what   is apt to throw the spirits of others into a languor  serves but to   render yours more sparkling       Louisa  in spite of the confusion she felt within  answered this   compliment with her accustomed ease  and being all seated  they began to   enter into some conversation concerning the state with which the   Magnifico s of Venice are served  the elegance with which they entertain   strangers  and some other topics relating to the customs of that   republic  when all on a sudden Melanthe starting up  cried  bless me  I   had forgot a little visit was in my head to make to a monastery hard   by   you will excuse me  monsieur  continued she  I leave your partner   to entertain you  and fancy you two may find sufficient matter of   conversation without a third person  She had no sooner spoke this than   she went out of the room  and left Louisa at a loss how to account for   this behaviour  as she had not before mentioned any thing of going   abroad  She would have imagined her vanity had been picqued that   monsieur du Plessis had particularized her in this visit  but as she   seemed in perfect good humour at going away  and knew she thought it   beneath her to put any disguise on her sentiments  she was certain this   sudden motion must have proceeded from some other cause  which as yet   she could form no conjecture of       This deceived lady  however  was no sooner out of the room  than   monsieur du Plessis drawing nearer to Louisa  how hard is my fate    madame  said he  in a low voice  that I am compelled to tell you any   other motive than my own inclination has occasioned my waiting on   you   heaven knows it is an honour I should have sought by the lowest   submissions  and all the ways that would not have rendered me unworthy   of it  but I now come  madame  not as myself  but as the ambassador of   another  and am engaged by my word and honour to plead a cause
