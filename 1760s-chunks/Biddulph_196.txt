which I thought I might accomplish  with his assistance  by tying the sheets of my bed together  and so from the window  sliding into the street   We were both pleased with this expedient  but the next thing to be considered was  what place I should go to  as I could not make this attempt till late at night  and must go alone  for my father being in years  and pretty corpulent  I could not think of letting him run the same hazard  which might have put his life into imminent danger  especially as I could not give him the same help which he could afford me  This was a difficulty  till I recollected a mantua maker  who was then making some clothes for me  and I happened to know where she lived  To her house I resolved to go  having first settled all my previous steps  and to remain concealed there till my father should get an opportunity of coming to me  I told him as I was the unhappy object on whom Mr Ware had designs  I supposed he would not detain my father after I was gone  He shook his head  but said  he hoped he would not   Having now settled our little plan  we were more composed  A servant brought breakfast into my apartment at the usual hour  and dinner  and supper  in the like manner  We did not appear  troubled  but as carefully avoided seeming chearful  for fear of giving suspicion   The house keeper was generally the last person up in the family  so that I was either to seize the opportunity before she came up to my    room  or wait till she was asleep  The last I thought was the securest method  as she was an extremely sound sleeper  I lifted up the sash in the bed chamber  to be in readiness  and closed the shutters again   Very fortunately my father having received his quarterly payment from Mr Ware just before we came to town  had fifty guineas in his purse  half of which he insisted on my taking in case of any emergency   About twelve o’clock the house keeper came into the room where we were sitting  as she was obliged to pass through that to go to the room where we lay   We heard her at the door  and my father suddenly changing the subject of our discourse  made me a sign which I understood  and as the woman entered  affected to be representing to me the charms of wealth and grandeur  whilst I seemed to listen  with a sort of pleasure to him  He stopped when the woman came in  but not till he was sure she had heard what he said  for we observed that she staid at the outside of the door a little while  as if to listen to our conversation  On seeing us engaged in discourse  she made a motion to withdraw  saying she would come up again when Mr Price was retired to rest  but I told her she might if she pleased  then go to bed  as we should not sit up long  But as I suppose she had orders to lock me in after my father had left me  she did not chuse to do this  She said she was not sleepy  but would come up in half an hour  and left the room smiling   This was an opportunity which I thought was not to be lost  I repaired to the window  and hearing a watchman cry the hour  I waited till he came under it  and having prepared a piece of paper  in which I had put a weight to carry it down  I lighted it and dropped it at his feet  it was fastened to a string  and at some distance from it above  was fastened another large piece of white paper folded up  in which I put a guinea  and in two lines written in a large plain hand  beseeched him to assist me in getting down  for which I would reward him with another guinea   The lighted paper  as I concluded it would  attracted the man’s notice  he stopped and took it up  and finding another paper hanging to the string  looked up at the window  I leaned my body out as far as I could  and  in a low voice  but loud enough for him to hear me  bid him read it  He opened the paper  and  by the light of his own lantern  read the lines  at the same time taking out the guineas  which I could perceive he also examined by the same light     He then said  I’ll help you  stay a little   He made what haste he could away  and I was now afraid he intended to leave me  and return no more  My terror was inexpressible during the man’s absence  especially as several people in that interval passed by  however  he soon returned with a companion  and the street being now clear  I saw he had brought a sort of plank  or board  under his arm  which he fixed from the iron pallisados a cross to the stone work which jutted out from the bottom of the lower windows  on this he without
