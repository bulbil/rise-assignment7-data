parson owes him four hundred pounds  which is a lie  for though he received that sum from him  it was paid him for value received by agreement  However  as the man can have no redress  I request you would immediately tender him that sum  and get a discharge  for I will have the poor fellow out   I herewith send you inclosed a letter which that scoundrel Ware wrote  pray shew it to him  as a token that the parson’s case is known  and that he has got friends to stand by him   Your speedy execution of this affair  and answer  will oblige   ‘Your friend and servant  ‘Edward Warner ’    To Mr William Blow  merchant  at Bristol   London  March 14  1707 8   My honest kinsman desired I would immediately send this letter off  I suppose his correspondent will have more discretion than to let Mr Ware see the contents  but I hope we shall have a good account of this negotiation   March 22  I have been very impatient  my Cecilia  for an answer to Mr Warner’s odd letter  and this day he received one  His friend at Bristol I take it for granted acted very prudently  for he says  that having waited on Mr Ware  which word Mr Warner took great exceptions to  he acquainted him with his commission  and at the same time produced his letter to Mr Price by way of identifying the person  as Mr Ware at first seemed not to recollect any thing of the matter  He said  Mr Ware blushed upon seeing his own letter  in the hands of a stranger  Aye  I remember the silly affair now  said he  the man is an old hypocrite  and his daughter is a young one  but as I never meant to ruin him  I will forgive him the debt  and accordingly wrote a full acquittal  which the merchant transmitted with his answer   Nothing now remained but to pay the usual fees  and get the poor old gentleman out as fast as we could  Mr Warner undertook to do what was proper on the occasion  and instantly set out it with an alacrity that shewed the goodness of his heart   How wonderfully shame operates on some minds  this wretched man  Ware  whom neither the laws of God nor man could restrain  has  by this single passion alone  been subdued  He found his base conduct was known by people whom he could not impose on  and his forgiving the pretended debt  no doubt  was meant as a bribe to prevent his disgrace from being propagated  for though he could sit down and enjoy himself under the accumulated guilt of fraud  perfidy  cruelty  oppression  and ingratitude  he was not proof against the reproach and ridicule of the world  This shews at least that he was not long practised in crimes of this sort   March 24  I did not see Mr Warner again till this morning  when he entered my room making flourishes with his hands  Mr Price and his daughter were with him—Here they are for you  said he  and it has done my    heart good to deliver such honest people from their misery   The good old man poured forth such fervent prayers  and thanks for my goodness towards them  that my heart exulted with rapture  at being the means of conferring such happiness  as this worthy parent and child seemed to enjoy  The young girl’s gratitude was silent  but not less ardent than her father’s  She had kneeled down before me  and kissed my hands  I was greatly touched with the humility and tenderness of her acknowlegement   I put an end to the grateful effusions of these honest hearts  I have done but little for you  said I  as yet  as Mr Ware had the grace to refuse the offered sum  I shall apply that money which I intended for him to your future use  or your liberty will avail you but little   We shall think of some method of settling you comfortably for life  in the mean while your daughter and you shall be welcome to live with me   I stopped him from renewing his thanks  and insisted on his saying no more on that subject  The poor old gentleman is extremely feeble and languishing from his long confinement  but I hope with proper care  as he is naturally strong  he will recover his health   April 1  What true delight springs from benevolent actions  my dear  I never expected such heart felt satisfaction as I have received from restoring comfort to these truly deserving people  I have bought the young lady some new clothes  plain  but genteel  and you cannot imagine what a pretty creature she is  now she is dressed  I find the old gentleman a man of admirable understanding  and great reading  He has a simplicity in his manner that is truly engaging  but at the same time a politeness that shews he is no stranger to the great world  Of his integrity he has given convincing proofs  Praised be the Lord  who has made me  and honest Mr Warner  the instruments of delivering such a man from the depths of affliction  He mends apace in his health
