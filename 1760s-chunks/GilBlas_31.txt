make free with her own  With our finances thus recruited  we went towards the stable  where I marched in with my pistols cocked  I was of opinion that the old blackamoor  for all his gout and rheumatism  would not let me saddle and bridle my horse peaceably  and my resolution was to put a finishing hand to all his ailments if he took it into his head to play the churl  but  by good luck  he was at that moment in such pain that I stole the steed without his perceiving that the door was open  The lady in the mean time was waiting for me  We were not long in threading the passage leading to the outlet  but reached the grate  opened it  and at last got to the trap  Much ado there was to lift it  which we could not have done  but for the new strength we borrowed from the hopes of our escape   Day was beginning to dawn when we emerged from that abyss  Our first object was to get as far from it as possible  I jumped into the saddle  the lady got up behind me  and taking the first path that offered  we soon gal loped out of the forest  Coming to some cross roads we took our chance  I trembled for fear of its leading to Mansilla  and our encountering Rolando and his comrades  Luckily my apprehensions were unfounded  We got to Astorga by two o clock in the afternoon  The people looked at us as if they had never seen such a sight before as a woman riding behind a man  We alighted at the first inn  I immediately ordered a partridge and a young rabbit to the spit  While my orders were in a train of execution  the lady was shown to a room  where we began to scrape acquaintance with one another  which we had not done on the road  on account of the speed we made  She expressed a high sense of my services  and told me that after so gentlemanly a conduct  she could not allow herself to think me one of the gang from whom I had rescued her  I told her my story to confirm her good opinion  By these means I entitled myself to her confidence  and to the knowledge of her misfortunes  which she recounted to the following effect       CH  XI    The history of Donna Mencia de Mosquera   I WAS born at Valladolid  and am called Donna Mencia de Mosquera  My father  Don Martin  after spending most of his family estate in the service  was killed in Portugal at the head of his regiment  He left me so little property  that I was a bad match  though an only daughter  I was not  however  without my admirers  notwithstanding the mediocrity of my fortune  Several of the most considerable cavaliers in Spain sought me in marriage  My favourite was Don Alvar de Mello  It is true he had a prettier person than his rivals  but more solid qualities determined me in his favour  He had wit  discretion  valour  probity  and in addition to all these  an air of fashion  Was an entertainment to be given  His taste was sure to be displayed  If he appeared in the lists  he always fixed the eyes of the beholders on his strength and dexterity  I singled him out from among all the rest  and married him   A few days after our nuptials  he met Don Andrew de BaÃ«sa  who had been his rival  in a private place  They attacked one another sword in hand  and Don Andrew fell  As he was nephew to the corregidor of Valladolid  a turbulent man  violently incensed against the house of Mello  Don Alvar thought he could not soon enough make his escape  He returned home speedily  and told me what had happened while his horse was getting ready  My dear Mencia  said he at length  we must part  You know the corregidor  let us not flatter ourselves  he will hunt me even to death  You are unacquainted with his influence  this empire will be too hot to hold me  He was so penetrated by his own grief and mine as not to be able to articulate further  I made him take some cash and jewels  then he folded me in his arms  and we did nothing but mingle our sighs and tears for a quarter of an hour  In a short time the horse was at the door  He tore himself from me  and left me in a condition not easily to be expressed  It had been well if the excess of my affliction had destroyed me  How much pain and trouble might I have escaped by death  Some hours after Don Alvar was gone  the corregidor became acquainted with his flight  He set up a hue and cry after him  sparing no pains to get him into his power  My husband  however  eluded his pursuit  and got into safe quarters  so that the judge  finding himself reduced to confine his vengeance to the poor satisfaction of confiscating  where he meant to execute  laboured to good purpose in his vocation  Don Alvar s little property all went to the hammer   I remained
