at that moment threw me off my guard—By the exertion of an irresistable frankness  she rendered me as ingenuous as herself  and I candidly told her that I thought Louisa one of the most charming women   24 I had ever seen  adding however  at the same time  that I fancied she possessed rather too great a consciousness of her own accomplishments to think of domesticating into the mistress of a family   Lady Haversham to this replied  that I was entirely mistaken—that Louisa was at the bottom a woman of fine sense  and would make an admirable wife whenever she altered her condition — I will not indeed   says lady Haversham    take upon me to say  that a young creature so universally admired can be entirely exempted from a little female vanity—You men are strange contradictions  you are for ever endeavouring to fill all the silly girls of your acquaintance with a thousand ridiculous notions of their own beauty  and yet the moment you see this infiduous train of flattery take fire  you   25 despise them for their vanity  without once good naturedly recollecting that this vanity is principally occasioned by yourselves—As to Miss Mild may  if you have no other objection  I promise you there is but little to apprehend on this account—When her affections become once directed to a particular object  her fondness for admiration will naturally cease  so that  with her regard for the man she marries  joined to the sense which she must entertain of her duty  there can be no doubt but what she will perform all the offices of a wife with the strictest propriety  at least this is my opinion of her  and I dare say you are convinced  that  unless she stood very high in my esteem  I should not be so earnest in recommending her to your tenderest consideration     From the solicitude which my sister discovered in this affair  Charles  I was   26 half inclined to think that the beautiful Louisa was already actually struck with my person and address  and had insinuated something to my advantage during her visit in the morning  I therefore dropt a distant hint of this nature  and  with an air half gay and half serious  enquired of lady Haversham  whether she thought there was any hope of Miss Mildmay s concurrence in case a treaty should be opened between the two families —To this lady Haversham replied  that I must first declare myself a lover  before she could think of giving me any satisfactory answer on this head  that  was she even possessed of secrets  she would not sacrifice a lady s delicacy to any consideration  and wondered how I could think of participating in her confidence while I held her at such a distance from mine —Upon the whole  she believed Miss Mildmay might perhaps be disengaged  and that  if I   27 really entertained a passion for her  she did not see why I had a worse chance of succeeding than any body else   This  Charles  is the present situation of affairs—I have since been twice in company with Louisa  and find the young baggage every moment growing on my imagination —I don t know how it is—Matrimony has a frightful sound with it  and yet I am determined some time or other to be married—We are all however for putting the evil day as far off as possible—At what particular period my knot is to be tyed I know not  but I fancy the period is not very remote  for every time I think of Miss Mildmay I begin to be more reconciled to the reasonableness of the marriage ceremony —By and by  perhaps  I shall call it  in my sister s language  a holy institution  and think of bespeaking some such clumsey varlet as yourself   28 to stand godfather to one of my children   Egad  Charles  the plot  as Bays says  begins to thicken —Mr  Mildmay and his lady are just come to Bath  with a view of taking their daughter home in a week  so that what I do must be done speedily—Upon my soul I did not conceive how near this girl was to my heart till I was alarmed with the news of our speedy separation —Lady Haversham s whole soul  I am sensible  is in the affair—and you need not be informed what a tenderness I bear for that amiable sister —You see  Charles  how I want to make a merit of following my own inclination —But adieu  my dear boy—I am preparing to attend the adorable Louisa to an assembly this evening  where I shall have her for a partner —How all the fellows will envy my happiness    29 Melmoth—especially as I shall seize some favourable opportunities of whispering such a story in her ear  as will add considerably more than the nature of our entertainment to heighten the beauty of her complexion   Your s  R  HAROLD     30  LETTER III  Miss LOUISA MILDMAY to Miss HARRIOT BEAUCLERK   THE sweet fellow  my charming friend  has at last declared himself—and in such a manner —Well  if I was at first struck with the elegance of his figure  I am now ravished with the beauties of his conversation  and shall think myself the happiest of all human beings  if an alliance can be fortunately brought about between our families   In my last letter
