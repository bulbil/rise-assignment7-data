By this time my indignation had roused me from the stupefaction in which I had hitherto remained  and I began in this manner    Sir  appearances  I own  condemn me  but you are imposed upon as much as I am abused—I have fallen a sacrifice to the rancour of that scoundrel  pointing to Gawky  who has found means to convey your goods hither  that the detection of them might blast my reputation  and accomplish my destruction —His hatred of me is owing to a consciousness of having wronged me in my own country  for which he in a cowardly manner refused me the satisfaction of a gentleman —he knows moreover  that I am no stranger to his dastardly behaviour in this town  which I have recounted before —and he is unwilling that such a testimony of his ingratitude and pusilanimity should live upon the earth  for this reason he is guilty of the most infernal malice to bring about my ruin —And I am afraid  madam   turning to Mrs  Gawky  you have too easily entered into the sentiments of your husband—I have often found you my enemy  and am well acquainted with the occasion of your being so  which I don t at present think proper to declare —but I would not advise you  for your own sake  to drive me to extremity    This address enraged her so much  that with a face as red as scarlet  and the eyes of a fury  she strutted up to me  and putting her hands in her sides  spit in my face  saying  I was a scandalous villain  but she defied my malice  and that unless her papa would prosecute me like a thief as I was  she would not   179 stay another night under his roof —At the same time  Gawky assuming a big look  told me  he scorned what lies I could invent against him  but that if I pretended to asperse his wife  he would put me to death  by G—d —To this I answered    I wish to God I could meet with thee in a desart  that I might have an opportunity of revenging thy perfidy towards me  and rid the world of such a rascal—What hinders me this moment  said I  seizing an old bottle that stood by  from doing myself that justice    I had no sooner armed myself in this manner  than Gawky and his father in law retired in such a hurry  that the one overturned the other  and rolled together down stairs  while my mistress swooned away with fear  and her daughter asked if I intended to murder her —I gave her to understand that nothing was farther from my intention  that I would leave her to the stings of her own conscience  but was firmly resolved to slit her husband s nose  whenever fortune should offer a convenient opportunity —Then going down stairs  I met Lavement coming up trembling with the pestle in his hand  and Gawky behind armed with his sword pushing him forward —I demanded a parley  and having assured them of my pacific disposition  Gawky exclaimed    Ah  villain  you have killed my dear wife  —  And the apothecary cried    Ah  coquin  vere is my child  —   The lady  said I  is above stairs  unhurt by me  and will a few months hence  I believe  reward your concern  —  Here she called to them herself  and desired they would let the wretch go  and trouble themselves no farther about him —To which her father consented  observing nevertheless    180 that my conversation was fort mysterieux —Finding it impossible to vindicate my innocence  I left the house immediately  and went to the schoolmaster  with an intention of clearing myself to him  and asking his advice with regard to my future conduct  but to my inexpressible vexation  was told he was gone to the country  where he would stay two or three days —I returned with a design of consulting some acquaintance I had acquired in my master s neighbourhood  but my story had taken air  through the officiousness of the servants  and not one of my friends would vouchsafe me a hearing —Thus I found myself  by the iniquity of mankind  in a much more deplorable condition than ever  for though I had been formerly as poor  my reputation was without blemish  and my health unimpaired till now —but at present my good name was lost  my money gone  my friends were alienated  my body infected by a distemper contracted in the course of an amour  and my faithful Strap  who alone could yield me pity and assistance  absent I knew not where     The first resolution I could take in this melancholy conjuncture  was to remove my cloaths to the house of the person with whom I had formerly lodg d  there I remained two days  in hopes of getting another place  by the interest of Mr  Concordance  to whom I made no doubt of being able to vindicate my character —but in this I reckoned without my host  for Lavement took care to be beforehand with me  and when I attempted to explain the whole affair to the schoolmaster  I found him so prepossessed against me  that he would scarce bear me to
