companions  came in upon me  just as you went out   at the back door   Well   to be sure they have a great deal to   answer for   I was just beginning to read my pious exportation you   left me  when in they came  snatched the book out of my hand    and  calling for the ladies  insisted on my sitting with them   so  as   you know I always loved innocent mirth  I could not refuse  But    alas   I paid dearly for it this morning   My poor bones I And   then my head   My poor head is quite gone  quite gone I I can   bear nothing   Oh  what a difference there is between spending an   evening in edifying conversation over a sober bottle  with a pious   friend or two  and these ranting riotous scenes 1 though they   behaved so like gentlemen  and were so good company  that there   was no leaving them   But it is all folly  all vanity   I am resolved   I will leave it off   I will not foDow it much longer  I am resolved     I ll wean myself from this world  and think of nothing but a new   life   I hope the baronet won t use poor Betsy iU   I ddd not like   his refusing to taste the ratafia   I should be ruined if anything   ailed her   She is more inquired for than all the ladies in the   house  And my lord â€”  he is sweet company  But it is a pity he   is so wicked 1 He was going to bum my book of devout exercises     and then  that profane song of yours   what need he sing that   I   wonder what pleasure people can find in profaneness  Where   there is any enjoyment  it is another thing  but this is being   wicked for wickedness  sake  It is a great pity  for he is a very   generous fine gentleman   He gave PoU ten guineas this morning     He is very fond of PoU   he always has her when Betsy is engaged    Oh I oh   oh   shall I ever get rid of these pains   When shall   I be happy in heaven     â€”     While she was running on thus  the doctor was busied in   writing a letter to himself  as from a family in distress  for whom   he intended to solicit a subscription the next day from his congre    gation   and my master was laying glasses on the table  and draw    ing the corks out of several bottles   so that Momus alone attended   to her  by the significant archness of whose look it was easy to   J erceive  that he was laying up a fund for future entertainment          174 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     and would not have interruped her  had she continued her discourse   ever so long   but the doctor s turning to the bottle put a stop to   her  and introduced a general conversation        I am sorry  my friend   said he  addressing himself to her    to   hear you complain so   I left you in a blessed temperature of mind   and body last night  but I much fear that the intemperance you   mentioned must have equally disturbed both  The most pious   man knoweth not what folly he uttereth when he is full of wine    A little is good  and rejoiceth the heart  but too much marreth   the understanding and letteth loose the secrets of the wife        As for that there  dear doctor  never fear me  since the   blessed hour of my call  I have never disclosed one secret about the   matter  I never mentioned a word of it  But  doctor  what did   you do with the young lady whom you would see home last night     I would not refuse you  to be sure   but I hope you have not put   any more idle notions in her head   she is very young  and like to   do a great deal of business  therefore her call need not come this   great while   It will be time enough some years hence   I had a   great deal of trouble to bring her to  and now  if you have   spoiled her  I shall have all the work to do over again  Nobody   knows the trouble and expense I am at for the service of the   public   nobody knows   If it was not for me  gentleman would   be forced to take up with common servant maids  and such
