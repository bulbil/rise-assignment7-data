and can be tolerable company       Now  my dear  I would have you think  and I hope you will have no other   reason  that had I married the first lady in the land  I would not have   treated her better than I will my Pamela  For my wife is my wife  and I   was the longer in resolving on the state  because I knew its requisites    and doubted my conduct in it       I believe I am more nice than many gentlemen  but it is because I have   been a close observer of the behaviour of wedded folks  and hardly   ever have seen it to be such as I could like in my own case  I shall    possibly  give you instances of a more particular nature of this  as we   are longer  and  perhaps  I might say  better acquainted       Had I married with the views of many gentlemen  and with such as my   good sister  supplying the place of my father and mother   would have   recommended  I had wedded a fine lady  brought up pretty much in my own   manner  and used to have her will in every thing       Some gentlemen can come into a compromise  and  after a few struggles    sit down tolerably contented  But  had I married a princess  I could   not have done so  I must have loved her exceedingly well  before I had   consented to knit the knot with her  and preferred her to all her sex    for without this  Pamela  indifferences  if not disgusts  will arise in   every wedded life  that could not have made me happy at home  and there   are fewer instances  I believe  of men s loving better  after matrimony    than of women s  the reason of which  tis not my present purpose to   account for       Then I must have been morally sure  that she preferred me to all men    and  to convince me of this  she must have lessened  not aggravated    my failings  She must have borne with my imperfections  she must have   watched and studied my temper  and if ever she had any points to   carry  any desire of overcoming  it must have been by sweetness and   complaisance  and yet not such a slavish one  as should make her   condescension seem to be rather the effect of her insensibility  than   judgment or affection       She should not have given cause for any part of my conduct to her to   wear the least aspect of compulsion or force  The word command  on my   side  or obedience on hers  I would have blotted from my vocabulary  For   this reason I should have thought it my duty to have desired nothing of   her  that was not significant  reasonable  or just  and that then she   should  on hers  have shewn no reluctance  uneasiness  or doubt  to   oblige me  even at half a word       I would not have excused her to let me twice enjoin the same thing    while I took so much care to make her compliance with me reasonable  and   such as should not destroy her own free agency  in points that ought to   be allowed her  And if I was not always right  that yet she would bear   with me  if she saw me set upon it  and expostulate with me on the right   side of compliance  for that would shew me   supposing small points   in dispute  from which the greatest quarrels  among friends  generally   arise   that she differed from me  not for contradiction sake  but   desired to convince me for my own  and that I should  another time  take   better resolutions       This would be so obliging a conduct  that I should  in justice  have   doubled my esteem for one  who  to humour me  could give up her   own judgment  and I should see she could have no other view in her   expostulations  after her compliance had passed  than to rectify my   motions for the future  and it would have been impossible then  but I   must have paid the greater deference to her opinion and advice in more   momentous matters       In all companies she must have shewn  that she had  whether I deserved   it altogether or not  a high regard and opinion of me  and this the   rather  as such a conduct in her would be a reputation and security   to herself  For if we rakes attempt a married lady  our first   encouragement  exclusive of our own vanity  arises from the indifferent
