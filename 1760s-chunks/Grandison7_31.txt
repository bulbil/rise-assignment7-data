the lot of mortal   She left me  I retired to my pen   THUS far have I written   Tis late  Sir Charles is coming up—And I am here at my pen  I will compliment him with a place in my closet  while I retire —Good night  my dearest grandmamma  Pray for your Harriet  and pray for Clementina   Friday morning   SIR Charles would have withdrawn to his Study    78 when he found me at my pen  I besought him to sit down in my closet   Remove your papers then  my dear   No need  Sir  These  putting what I had been just writing  and those I had written the day before  on one side of my desk  I would not  Sir  except you have a curiosity  wish you to see at present  These  Sir  you may  if you please  amuse yourself with   I will take down one of your books  my Love  I will not look into any of your written papers   Dear  generous Sir  look into them all—Look into both parcels  Something about Lucy  something of what Mr  Lowther has talked of  in that parcel—Read any of the written papers before you   A generous mind  my Love  will not take all that is offered by a generous mind  Hasten  my Harriet  It is late  My mind is a little disturbed  Yours  I am afraid  is generously uneasy  In your faithful bosom  will I repose all my cares   I pressed his hand between both mine  and would have pressed it with my lips  But  kissing my hands  first one  then the other—Condescending goodness  said he  God continue to me my Harriet s Love  and make Clementina not unhappy  and what can befal me  that will not add thankfulness to thankfulness   With what soothing tenderness did he afterwards open his generous heart to his Harriet  He was indeed disturbed  For Mr  Lowther had told him  that the General  I don t love him  was quite cruel—At one time he threatened the excellent creature  He called her ungenerous  ungrateful  undutiful —She fell down at his seet  in a fainting fit  He left her in anger—Staid not to recover or sooth her—Yet returned in about two hours  his conscience stinging him  and on his knees besought her pardon—Received it—The dear saint forgave the soldierly man—Yet he persisted  and turned his threatenings into worse  if possible  than threatenings  into persuasion     79 If I have an enemy  said the dear creature to her brothers  who has conceived a mortal antipathy to me  let him insinuate himself into the favour of those most dear to me  and prevail upon them to attack me with all the powers of persuading Love  in order to induce me to do the thing  whatever it be  most contrary to my heart  And then will the instigator wreak upon me his whole vengeance  and make me think death itself an eligible refuge   Sir Charles sighed at repeating this  I wept  How happy  thought I  more than once  are you  best of men  in your own reflections  that a woman so excellent  who cannot be happy with any other man  herself refused you  and persisted in her refusal  though you sought all ways  and used all arguments  to bring her to a change of determination  What otherwise would have been your regret  And how unhappy should I have been in the consciousness of being in her place  and of having dispossessed her of a heart to which she had so much better pretensions  Now has he no room for remorse  but for friendly pity only  and for wishes to relieve her afflicted heart  Of what a blessing is that man possessed  who  when calamity assails him  can acquit himself  his intentions at least  and say     This I have not brought upon myself  It is an inevitable evil  A dispensation of Providence  I will call it  and submit to it  as such      Methinks  madam  I could spare this excellent woman some of my happiness  Have I not more than mortal ever knew before   Sir Charles mentioned to me  that Lady Olivia  in her last Letter to him  intimated her desire to come over once more to England  But he hoped what he had written to dissuade her from it  would have weight with her  I told him  I wished that Lady the wife of some worthy man  whose gratitude and affection she  by her great fortune  might engage    80 But  Sir  said I  I cannot  cannot wish  be the Count of Belvedere ever so good a man  that Lady Clementina were married   What would my Harriet wish for Lady Clementina  circumstanced as she is   I don t know  But the woman who has loved Sir Charles Grandison  with a heart so pure  can never be happy with any other man   You are ever obliging  my Love  You judge of Clementina as she deserves to be judged of  as to the purity
