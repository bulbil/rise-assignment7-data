is the only time you can have for it  Your father and brothers will be here to morrow—And then  Chevalier  all will be over   Why  madam  I did think I had a great deal to say to him  And  as I thought I had no interest in what I had to say—  Would you wish  my dear  to be left alone with the Chevalier  Can you recollect any thing that you had intended to say to him  had you made him the visit you had designed to make him   I don t know   Then I will withdraw  Shall I  my dear   Ought I  Sir  You have been my tutor  and many excellent lessons have you taught me—tho  I don t know what is become of them —Ought I  to wish my mamma to withdraw  Ought I to have any thing to say to you  that I could not say before her —I think not   The Marchioness was retiring  I beg of you  madam  said I  to slip unobserved into that closet  You must hear all that passes  The occasion may be critical  Let me have the opportunity of being either approved or censured  as I shall appear to deserve  in the conversation that may pass between the dear Lady and me  if you do withdraw   O Chevalier  you are equally prudent and generous  Why won t you be one of us  Why won t you be a Catholic   She went out at the door  Clementina courtesied to her  I led her eye from the door  and the Marchioness re entered  and slipt into the closet   I conducted the young Lady to a chair  which I placed with its back to the closet door  that her mother   307 might hear all that passed —She sat down  and bid me sit by her   I was wiling she should lead the subject  that the Marchioness might observe I intended not to prepossess her   We were silent for a few moments  She seemed perplexed  looked up  looked down  then on one side  then on the other—At last  O Chevalier  said she  they were happy times when I was your pupil  and you were teaching me English   They were indeed happy times  madam   Mrs  Beaumont was too hard for me  Chevalier —Do you know Mrs  Beaumont   I do  She is one of the best of women   Why so I think  But she turned and winded me about most strangely  I think I was in a great fault   How so  madam —How so  Why to let her get out of me a secret that I had kept from my mother  And yet there never was a more indulgent mother —Now you look  Chevalier  But I sha n t tell you what the secret was   I do not ask you  madam   If you did  I would not tell you —Well but I had a great deal to say to you  I thought  I wish that frantic Camilla had not stopt me when I was going to you  I had a great deal to say to you   Cannot you recollect  madam  any part of it   Let me consider—Why  in the first place  I thought you despised me  I was not sorry for that  I do assure you  That did me good  At first it vexed me—You can t think how much  I have a great deal of pride  Sir—But  well  I got over that  and I grew sedate—You see how sedate I am  Yet this poor man  thought I  whether he thinks so or not  I will tell you all my thoughts  Sir  But don t be grieved —You see how sedate I am  Yet I am a silly girl  you are thought to be a wise man  Don t disgrace your wisdom  Fie  a wise man to be weaker than a simple girl —Don t let it be said—What was I saying     308 Yet this poor man  whether he thinks so  or not  you said  madam   True —has a Soul to be saved  He has taken great pains with me  to teach me the language of England  Shall I not take some with him  to teach him the language of Heaven —No heretic can learn that  Sir —And I had collected abundance of fine thoughts in my mind  and many pertinent things from the Fathers  and they were all in my head—But that impertinent Camilla—And so they are all gone—But this one thing I have to say—I designed to say something like it  at the conclusion of my discourse with you—So it is premeditated  you will say  and so it is  But let me whisper it—No I won t neither—But t•rn your face another way—I find my blushes come already—But  and she put her spread hand before her face  as if to hide her blushes  Don t look at me  I tell you—Look at the window  I did   Why  Chevalier  I did intend to say—But stay—I have wrote it down somewhere  She pulled out her pocket book  Here it is  Look another way
