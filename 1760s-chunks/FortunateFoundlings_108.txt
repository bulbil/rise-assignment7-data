  convenient opportunity  he opened  and found these words in French        To the agreeable  HORATIO       SIR           Tho  I have not perhaps so much beauty   as Edella  I have twice her sincerity  and   not many years older  such as I am  however    I fancy you will think a correspondence with   me of too much advantage to be refused   if   you will counterfeit an indisposition  to morrow   I will out of excessive charity visit you  and   bring you a refreshment  I flatter myself  will   not be disagreeable to a man in your circumstances   farewell   be   secret   and love as well as you can        Yours        MATTAKESA           Of all the accidents that had befallen Horatio since his leaving   England  none ever so much surprized him as the prodigious impudence of   this lady  he had heard talk of such adventures  but never till now   believed there could be any such thing in nature  as a woman that   offered herself in this manner  without the least sollicitation from the   person on whom she wished to lavish what ought only to be the reward of   an approved  or at least a shew of the most violent passion       The dilemma he was in how to behave  was also equal to his   astonishment   had she been the most lovely of her sex  as she was very   much the reverse  the ever present idea of his dear Charlotta would have   defended his heart from the invasions of any other charms  but he needed   not that pre engagement to make him look with detestation on a woman of   Mattakesa s principles   when he reflected on what she had said   concerning Edella  he found her base  censorious  and unjust   and when   he considered the manner in which she proceeded in regard to himself  he   saw a lewdness and audacity which rendered her doubly odious  to   him   he doubted not but she was wicked and subtle enough to contrive   some means of revenging herself  in case she met with a disappointment   in her wishes  yet had too great an abhorrence to be able to entertain   one thought of gratifying them       As he was young and unexperienced in the world  he would have been glad   of some advice how to act so as not to incur her resentment  yet avoid   her love  but the strict notions he had of honour remonstrated to him   that he ought not to betray a secret of that nature  tho  confided in   him by an ill woman   Her baseness  cried he to himself  would be no   excuse for mine  and it is better for me to risque whatever her malice   may inflict  than forfeit my character  by exposing a woman who pretends   to love me       These thoughts kept him waking the whole night  and his restlessness   being observed by an old Swedish officer who by with him  he was very   much importuned by him to discover to him the occasion   Horatio   defended himself for a good while by the considerations before recited    but at length reflecting  that the person who was so desirous of being   let into the secret  had a great deal of discretion  he at length   suffered himself to be prevailed upon  and told him what Mattakesa had   wrote to him  for he did not understand a word of French  so could not   read the letter       This officer no sooner heard the story  than he laughed heartily at the   scruples of Horatio  in thinking himself bound to conceal an affair of   this nature with a woman of the character Mattakesa must needs be   he   also rallied his delicacy  as he termed it  in hesitating one moment   whether he should gratify the lady s inclinations   One would imagine    said he  that so long a fall from love as we have had  should render our   appetites more keen   what  tho  Mattakesa be neither handsome nor very   young  she is a woman  and amorous  and methinks there should need no   other excitements to a young man like you       Horatio  tho  naturally gay  was not at present in a disposition to   continue this raillery  and told his friend  he looked on this   inclination of Mattakesa to be as great a misfortune as could happen to   them  for  said he  as it is wholly out of my power to make her any   returns  that violence of temper which has transported
