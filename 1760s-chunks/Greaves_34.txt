most mortifying silence  and enjoying the impatience of the knight  who in vain requested an explanation of this mystery  At length his eyes began to lighten  when  seizing Crabshaw in one hand  and the ostler in the other  he swore by Heaven he would dash their souls out  and raze the house to the foundation  if they did not instantly disclose the particulars of this transaction  The good woman fell on her knees  protesting  in the name of the Lord  that she was innocent as the child unborn  thof she had lent the captain a Prayer Book to learn the Lord s Prayer  a candle and lantern to light him to the church  and a couple of clean sheets  for the use of the other gentlemen  The knight was more and more puzzled by this declaration  when Mr  Clarke  coming into the kitchen  presented himself with a low obeisance to his old patron   Sir Launcelot s anger was immediately converted into surprise  He set at liberty the squire and the ostler  and stretching out his hand to the lawyer   My good friend Clarke   said he   how came you hither  Can you solve this knotty point which has involved us all in such confusion    Tom forthwith began a very circumstantial recapitulation of what had happened to his uncle  in what manner he had been disappointed of the estate  how he had accidentally seen his honour  been enamoured of his character  and become ambitious of following his example  Then he related the particulars of the plan which had been laid down to divert him from his design  and concluded with assuring the knight  that the captain was a very honest man  though he seemed to be a little disordered in his intellects   I believe it   replied Sir Launcelot   madness and honesty are not incompatible—indeed  I feel it by experience    Tom proceeded to ask pardon  in his uncle s name  for having made so free with the knight s armour  and begged his honour  for the love of God  would use his authority with Crowe  that he might quit all thoughts of knight errantry  for which he was by no means qualified  for  being totally ignorant of the laws of the land  he would be continually committing trespasses  and bring himself into trouble  He said  in case he should prove refractory  he might be apprehended by virtue of a friendly warrant  for having feloniously carried off the knight s accoutrements   Taking away another man s moveables   said he   and personal goods against the will of the owner  is furtum and felony according to the statute  Different indeed from robbery  which implies putting in fear in the king s highway  in alta via regia violenter et felonice captum et asportatum  in magnum terrorem  etc   for if the robbery be laid in the indictment  as done in quadam via pedestri  in a footpath  the offender will not be ousted of his clergy  It must be in alta via regia  and your honour will please to take notice  that robberies committed on the river Thames are adjudged as done in alta via regia  for the king s highstream is all the same as the king s highway    Sir Launcelot could not help smiling at Tom s learned investigation  He congratulated him on the progress he had made in the study of the law  He expressed his concern at the strange turn the captain had taken  and promised to use his influence in persuading him to desist from the preposterous design he had formed   The lawyer  thus assured  repaired immediately to the church  accompanied by the squire  and held a parley with his uncle  who  when he understood that the knight in person desired a conference  surrendered up the arms quietly  and returned to the public house   Sir Launcelot received the honest seaman with his usual complacency  and perceiving great discomposure in his looks  said  he was sorry to hear he had passed such a disagreeable night to so little purpose  Crowe  having recruited his spirits with a bumper of brandy  thanked him for his concern  and observed  that he had passed many a hard night in his time  but such another as this  he would not be bound to weather for the command of the whole British navy   I have seen Davy Jones in the shape of a blue flame  d ye see  hopping to and fro on the sprit sail yardarm  and I ve seen your Jacks o  the Lanthorn  and Wills o  the Wisp  and many such spirits  both by sea and land  But to night I ve been boarded by all the devils and d—ned souls in hell  squeaking and squalling  and glimmering and glaring  Bounce went the door—crack went the pew—crash came the tackle—white sheeted ghosts dancing in one corner by the glow worm s light—black devils hobbling in another—Lord have mercy upon us  and I was hailed  Tom  I was  by my grandmother Jane  and my aunt Bridget  d ye see—a couple of d—n d—but they re roasting  that s one comfort  my lad    When he had thus disburdened his conscience  Sir Launcelot introduced the subject of
