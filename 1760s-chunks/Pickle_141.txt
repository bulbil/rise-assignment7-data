dissented  however  from the opinion of Peregrine  who  as a proof of  their excellence  had advanced that some of the English actors fancied  themselves the very thing they represented  and recounted a story from  Lucian  of a certain celebrated pantomime  who  in  acting the part of  Ajax in his frenzy  was transported into a real fit of delirium  during  which he tore to pieces the clothes of that actor who stalked before  him  beating the stage with iron shoes  in order to increase the noise   snatched an instrument from one of the musicians  and broke it over the  head of him who represented Ulysses  and  running to the consular bench   mistook a couple of senators for the sheep which were to be slain  The  audience applauded him to the skies  but so conscious was the mimic of  his own extravagance when he recovered the use of his reason  that he  actually fell sick with mortification  and being afterwards desired to  re act the piece  flatly refused to appear in any such character  saying  that the shortest follies were the best  and that it was sufficient for  him to have been a madman once in his life     6 22 15  3 45 PM   CHAPTER LII    An Adventure happens to Pipes  in consequence of which he is dismissed  from Peregrine s Service  The whole Company set out for Ghent  in the  Diligence  Our Hero is captivated by a Lady in that Carriage  Interests  her spiritual Director in his behalf   The doctor being fairly engaged on the subject of the ancients  would  have proceeded the Lord knows how far  without hesitation  had not he  been interrupted by the arrival of Mr  Jolter  who  in great confusion   told them that Pipes  having affronted a soldier  was then surrounded  in the street  and certainly would be put to death if some person of  authority did not immediately interpose in his behalf   Peregrine no sooner learned the danger of his trusty squire  than   snatching up his sword  he ran down stairs  and was followed by the  chevalier  entreating him to leave the affair to his management  Within  ten yards of the door they found Tom  with his back to a wall  defending  himself with a mopstick against the assault of three or four soldiers   who  at sight of the Maltese cross  desisted from the attack  and were  taken into custody by order of the knight  One of the aggressors  being  an Irishman  begged to be heard with great importunity before he should  be sent to the guard  and  by the mediation of Pickle  was accordingly  brought into the hotel with his companions  all three bearing upon  their heads and faces evident marks of their adversary s prowess and  dexterity  The spokesman  being confronted with Pipes  informed the  company that  having by accident met with Mr  Pipes  whom he considered  as his countryman  though fortune had disposed of them in different  services  he invited him to drink a glass of wine  and accordingly  carried him to a cabaret  where he introduced him to his comrades   but in the course of the conversation  which turned upon the power and  greatness of the kings of France and England  Mr  Pipes had been pleased  to treat his most Christian Majesty with great disrespect  and when he   the entertainer  expostulated with him in a friendly manner about his  impolite behaviour  observing  that he  being in the French service   would be under the necessity of resenting his abuse if he did not put a  stop to it before the other gentlemen of the cloth should comprehend  his meaning  he had set them all three at defiance  dishonoured him in  particular with the opprobrious epithet of rebel to his native king and  country  and even drunk  in broken French  to the perdition of Louis and  all his adherents  that  compelled by this outrageous conduct  he  as  the person who had recommended him to their society  had  in vindication  of his own character  demanded of the delinquent  who  on pretence  of fetching a sword  had gone to his lodging  from whence he all of a  sudden sallied upon them with the mopstick  which he employed in the  annoyance of them all without distinction  so that they were obliged to  draw in their own defence   Pipes  being questioned by his master with regard to the truth of this  account  owned that every circumstance was justly represented  saying   he did not value their cheese toasters a pinch of oakum  and that if the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   gentleman had not shot in betwixt them  he would have trimmed them  to such a tune  that they should not have had a whole yard to square   Peregrine reprimanded him sharply for his unmannerly behaviour  and  insisted upon his asking pardon of those he had injured upon the spot   but no consideration was efficacious enough
