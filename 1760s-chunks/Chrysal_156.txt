apparition â€” interview     BETWEEN THE DOOTOE AND A NOTED BALLAD SINGER â€” THE   HISTORY OT A FAMOUS BALLAD â€” ALL TRADES ALIKE     The person   my master was sent to meet had something so   uncommon in his appearance as instantly struck my attention    Every passion of the human heart was printed in his face so       Hunchback and Squintum are two nicknames of Whitefield   the   latter is the name he goes by in The Minor  because of the cast in Ms   eye      2 Foote s Mrs Cole  in The Minor  identified with Mother Douglas  a   noted procuress  who lived in a splenilidly furnished house in Covent   Oarden  d  1761  Hogarth put her into his   March to Finohley      Foote himself acted the part in The Minor  where her mixture of   religious unction and abandoned morals is horribly comic      Cf  Churchill s description of this Protean mimic   â€”   By turns transform d into all kinds of shapes    Constant to none  Foote laughs  cries  struts  and scrapes     Now in the centre  now in van or rear    The Proteus shifts  bawd  parson  auctioneer    His strokes of humour  and his bursts of sport   Are all contaiu d in tliis one word  distort      The Eoaciad  395 400          170 f        r ADVENTVRES OF A GUINEA     strongly  that he could at pleasure display it in all its force  while   his very look and gesture turned some vice or folly into ridicule        You inquire for number one  sir     said my master  bowing   with the profoundest respect        I do  sir   answered the other  returning his bow  assuming his   look  and imitating his voice  in a manner that would have extorted   laughter from despair    inquire for number one        Itough my master was no stranger to his talents  which he had   often seen him display at the expense of others  this personal   application of them to himself threw him into such confusion  that    in spite of his long practised assurance  a blush broke feebly   through his unimpassioned  lifeless face  and he had scarce power   to show him into the room  The ballad singer  seeing that he had   him at command  would not pursue his advantage any further  at   that time  for fear of frightening him away   but putting on the   exact countenance  and mimicking the voice and manner of the   doctor    I am come  my friend and brother in the Lord    said he     to inquire into thy spiritual estate  to give thee ghostly advice    and commune with thee  for a short space  for our mutual edifica    tion    The surprise and manner of this address had such an effect   upon my master  that he could not refrain bursting into laughter     and immediately recovered from the confusion into which the   ridicule of himself had thrown him      They were scai ce seated  when the doctor entered  and addressing   himself to the stranger    I am glad to see you  sir    said he  taking   him by the hand    and heartily congratulate you on your success    You see  I was not mistaken in my judgment  I knew what   would take with the taste of the pubhc  There is nothing pleases   them so much as a little profaneuesa  and ridicule of religion  a   fling at the clergy never fails to raise a laugh        I acknowledge your judgment  sir   answered the other  raising   up his shoulders  rolling his eyes and echoing every cadence of the   doctor s voice    and thank you for your congratulation   but I must   beg leave to differ in opinion with you  as to the cause of my   success  for I have never had the least fling at the clergy  nor been   guilty of profaneness  or ridiculing religion  in my ballad   the   abuse of religion by hypocrisy  and making the profession of virtue   a sanction for the practice of vice  were the objects of my satire     and the reception it has met with from the public  shows that the   people have a proper sense of such vices        The doctor was so struck at the reflection of himself  when the   other began to speak  that he started  in the utmost astonish    ment
