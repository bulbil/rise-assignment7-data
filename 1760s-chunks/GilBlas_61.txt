 Oh  you are in the right  resumed I  our enemies must not gain this triumph over us  they would say that you were out of conceit with your own systems  and would ruin your reputation for consistency  Perish the people  perish rather our nobility and clergy  But let us go on in the old path  After all  our brethren of the faculty  with all their tenderness about bleeding  have no patent for longevity any more than ourselves  and we may set off their drugs against our specifics   We went on working double tides  and did so much execution  that in less than six weeks we made as many widows and orphans as the siege of Troy  The plague must have got into Valladolid by the number of funerals  Day after day came some father or other to know what was become of his son  who was last seen in our hands  or else a stupid fellow of an uncle  who had a foolish hankering after a deceased nephew  With respect to the nephews and sons  on whose uncles and fathers we had equalized our system of destruction  they thought that least said was soonest mended  Husbands were altogether on their good behaviour  they would not split a hair about the loss of a wife or two  The real sufferers to whose reproaches we were exposed  were sometimes quite savage in their grief  without being mealy mouthed in their expressions  they called us blockheads and assassins  I was concerned at their bad language  but my master  who was up to every circumstance  listened to their abuse with the utmost indifference  Yet I might have grown as callous as himself to popular reproach  if heaven  interposing its shield between the invalids of Valladolid and one of their scourges  had not providentially raised up an incident to disgust me with medicine  which from the outset had been disgusted with me   The idle fellows about town assembled every day in our neighbourhood for a game at tennis  Among the number was one of those professed bullies who set up for great Dons  and are the complete cocks of the tennis court  He was a Biscayan  and assumed the title of Don Roderic de Mondragon  His age might be about thirty  His size was somewhat above the common  but he was lean and bony  Besides two sparkling little eyes rolling about in his head  and throwing out defiance against all bystanders  a very broad nose came in between a pair of red whiskers  which turned up like a hook as high as the temples  His phraseology was so rough and uncouth that the very sound of his voice would throw a quiet man into an ague  This tyrant over both the rackets and the game was lord paramount in all disputes between the players  and there was no appeal from his decisions  but at the risk of receiving a challenge the next day  Precisely as I have drawn Signor Don Roderic  whom the Don in the foreground of his titles could never make a gentleman  Signor Don Roderic was sweet upon the mistress of the tennis court  She was a woman of forty  in good circumstances  as charming as forty can well be  just entering on the second year of her widowhood  I know not how he made himself agreeable  certainly not by his exterior recommendations  but probably by that within which passeth show  However that might be  she took a fancy to him  and began to turn her thoughts towards the holy state of matrimony  but while that great event was in agitation  for the punishment of her sins she was taken with a malignant fever  and with me for a physician  Had the disorder been ever so slight  my practice would have made a serious job of it  At the expiration of four days there was not a dry eye in the tennis court  The mistress joined the outward  bound colony of my patients  and her family administered to her effects  Don Roderic  distracted at the loss of his mistress  or rather disappointed of a good establishment  was not satisfied with fretting and fuming at me  but swore he would run me through the body  or even frown me into a nonentity  A good natured neighbour apprised me of this vow  with a caution to keep at home  for fear of coming across this devil of a fellow  This warning  though taken in good part  was a source of anxiety and apprehension  I was eternally fancying the enraged Biscayan laying siege to the outworks of my citadel  There was no getting a moment s respite from alarm  This circumstance weaned me from the practice of medicine  and I thought of nothing but deliverance from my horrors  On went my embroidered suit once more  Taking leave of my master  who did all he could to detain me  I got out of town with the dawn  not heedless of that terrible Don Roderic  who might waylay me on the road       CH  VI     His route from Valladolid  with a description of his fellow traveller   I TRUDGED on at a great rate  and looked behind from time to time  to see if that dreadful Biscayan was not following me  My imagination was so engrossed by the fellow
