 she was a very extraordinary personage  Nature had gifted her with the singular talent of winning men s hearts in defiance of time  and in contradiction to her own laws  for she was now entering upon the fourth quarter of her century  She had been the reigning toast of the old court  and levied tribute on the passions of the new  Age  though at daggers drawn with beauty  was completely foiled in its assault upon her charms  they might be somewhat faded  but the touch of sympathy they excited in their decline was more pleasing that the vivid glow of their meridian lustre  An air of dignity  a transporting wit and humour  an unborrowed grace in her deportment  perpetuated the reign of passion  and silenced the suggestions of reason   Don Valerio de Luna  one of the Duke of Lerma s secretaries  a young fellow of five and twenty  meeting with Inésilla  fell violently in love with her  He made his sentiments known  enacted all the mummery of despair  and followed up the usual catastrophe of every amorous drama so much according to the unities and rules  that it was difficult  in the very torrent and whirlwind of his passion  to beget a temperance that might give it smoothness  The lady  who had her reason for not choosing to fall in with his humour  was at a loss how to get out of the difficulty  One day she was in hopes to have found the means by calling the young man into her closet  and there pointing to a clock upon the table  Mark the precise hour  said she  just seventy five years ago was I brought upon the stage of this fantastical world  In good earnest  would it sit well upon my time of life to be engaged in affairs of gallantry  Betake yourself to reflection  my good child  stifle sentiments so unsuitable to your own circumstances and mine  Sensible as this language was  the spark  no longer bowing to the authority of reason  answered the lady with all the impetuosity of a man racked by the most excruciating torments  Cruel Inésilla  why have you recourse to such frivolous remonstrances  Do you think they can change your charms or my desires  Delude not yourself with so false a hope  As long as your loveliness or my delusion lasts  I shall never cease to adore you  Well  then  rejoined she  since you are obstinate enough to persist in the resolution of wearying me with your importunities  my doors shall henceforth be shut against you  You are banished  and I beg to be no longer troubled with your company   It may be supposed  perhaps  that after this  Don Valerio  baffled  made good his retreat like a prudent general  Quite the reverse  He became more troublesome than ever  Love is to lovers just what wine is to drunkards  The swain intreated  sighed  looked  and sighed again  when all at once  changing his note from childish treble to the big manly voice of bluster and ravishment  he swore that he would have by foul means what he could not obtain by fair  But the lady  repulsing him courageously  said with a piercing look of strong resentment  Hold  imprudent wretch  I shall put a curb on your mad career  Learn that you are my own son   Don Valerio was thunderstruck at these words  the tempest of his rage subsided  But  conjecturing that Inesilla had only started this device to rid herself of his solicitations  he answered  That is a mere romance of the moment to steal away from my ardent desires  No  no  said she  interrupting him  I disclose a mystery which should have been for ever buried  had you not reduced me to so painful a necessity  It is six and twenty years since I was in love with your father  Don Pedro de Luna  then governor of Segovia  you were the fruit of our mutual passion  he owned you  brought you up with care and tenderness  and having no children born in wedlock  he had nothing to hinder him from distinguishing your good qualities by the gifts of fortune  On my part  I have not forsaken you  as soon as you were of an age to be introduced into the world  I drew you into the circle of my acquaintance  to form your manners to that polish of good company  so necessary for a gentleman  which is only to be gained in female society  I have done more  I have employed all my credit to introduce you to the prime minister  In short  I have interested myself for you as I should have done for my own son  After this confession  take your measures accordingly  If you can purge your affections from their dross  and look on me as a mother  you are not banished from my presence  and I shall treat you with my accustomed tenderness  But if you are not equal to an effort  which nature and reason demand from you  fly instantly  and release me from the horror of beholding you   Inesilla spoke to this effect  Meanwhile Don Valerio preserved a sudden silence  it might have been interpreted into a virtuous struggle  a conquest over the weakness of his heart
