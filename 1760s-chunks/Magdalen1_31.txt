Darnel  and I fancy her circumstances are none of the best—Under an affectation of great gravity I am sure she conceals an   184 insuperable pride  and seems to dispise that glitter from principle  which she is unable to enjoy from the narrowness of her fortune  lady Haversham may therefore set up a chariot for Mrs  Darnel  Louisa you know by residing with her will have it at command  and Mrs  Darnel shall have it rendered worth her while to present her amiable cousin with a sufficient sum of money as opportunities occur  for all her other contingencies  Mrs  Darnel I see has obligations to the Mildmay family  but whatever she loses by her politeness on this occasion  shall be doubled to her by an annuity  or how she pleases  she may talk of a ticket in the lottery  you know  or make any other common excuse for the alteration of appearances   And yet Melmoth  I am some how sorry Louisa is to be at Mrs  Darnel s  she is a woman of whom I entertain no   185 very great opinion  I have been three or four times in her company at accidental visits  and always found her so humble  and so fawning  so religious and so sentimental  that I am fearful my poor Louisa will have but a disagreeable companion  An excess of humility to those who are our superiors in fortune is always a sign of a mean mind  the heart is unworthy of respect  which never seems inclined to assert its natural equality  and I would much sooner commence a friendship with those who are perpetually contradicting me  than with those who have a smile for every thing I say  and never take the liberty to contradict me at all   The master of the vessel has this moment called to take me on board—Till I hear from you I shall take up my residence at the great marshal Turene s in Rotterdam—I have used the house once   186 already  and found the people very careful of my letters  Pray write immediately  and let your pacquet be a large one  enquire minutely into the colonel s situation  and tell me what is said by lady Haversham  and Louisa  O  Charles  adversity is your only forcible moralist  the pangs which I now suffer in consequence of my folly give me a higher veneration for virtue than the works of our most celebrated philosophers  and I find more wisdom is to be obtained from a moment s experience than from a whole eternity of idle speculation—But when reflection comes too late of what service is it to moralize  God bless you therefore my dear Melmoth  and believe me to be with an everlasting attachment  Your Friend ROBERT HAROLD   END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
