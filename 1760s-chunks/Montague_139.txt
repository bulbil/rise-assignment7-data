Mrs  Melmoth s letter brought me my father s commands  if unmarried  to continue so till his return        He added  that he intended me for a relation  to whose family he had obligations  that  his affairs having suffered such a happy revolution  he had it in his power  and  therefore  thought it his duty  to pay this debt of gratitude  and  at the same time  hoped to make me happy by connecting me with an amiable family  allied to him by blood and friendship  and uniting me to a man whom report spoke worthy of all my tenderness       You may remember  my dearest Bell  how strongly I was affected on reading those letters  I wrote to Rivers  to beg him to defer our marriage  but the manner in which he took that request  and the fear of appearing indifferent to him  conquered all sense of what I owed to my father  and I married him  making it  however  a condition that he should ask no explanation of my conduct till I chose to give it        I knew not the character of my father  he might be a tyrant  and divide us from each other  Rivers doubted my tenderness  would not my waiting  if my father had afterwards refused his consent to our union  have added to those cruel suspicions  might he not have supposed I had ceased to love him  and waited for the excuse of paternal authority to justify a change of sentiment       In short  love bore down every other consideration  if I persisted in this delay  I might hazard losing all my soul held dear  the only object for which life was worth my care       I determined  if I married  to give up all claim to my father s fortune  which I should justly forfeit by my disobedience to his commands  I hoped  however  Rivers s merit  and my father s paternal affection  when he knew us both  would influence him to make some provision for me as his daughter       Half his fortune was all I ever hoped for  or even would have chose to accept  the rest I determined to give up to the man whom I refused to marry       I gave my hand to Rivers  and was happy  yet the idea of my father s return  and the consciousness of having disobeyed him  cast sometimes a damp on my felicity  and threw a gloom over my soul  which all my endeavors could scarce hide from Rivers  though his delicacy prevented his asking the cause       I now know  what was then a secret to me  that my father had offered his daughter to Rivers  with a fortune which could  however  have been no temptation to a mind like his  had he not been attached to me  he declined the offer  and  lest I should hear of it  and  from a romantic disinterestedness  want him to accept it  pressed our marriage with more importunity than ever  yet had the generosity to conceal this sacrifice from me  and to wish it should be concealed for ever       These sentiments  so noble  so peculiar to my Rivers  prevented an explanation  and hid from us  for some time  the circumstances which now make our happiness so perfect       How infinitely worthy is Rivers of all my tenderness       My father has sent to speak with me in his apartment  I should have told you  I this morning went to Bellfield  and brought from thence my mother s picture  which I have just sent him       Adieu  Your faithful  EMILY RIVERS     LETTER CCXXVII   227   To Mrs  RIVERS  Bellfield  Rutland   London  Sunday   NO words  my dear Emily  can speak our joy at the receipt of your two last letters       You are then as happy as you deserve to be  we hope  in a few days  to be witnesses of your felicity        We knew from the first of your father s proposal to Rivers  but he extorted a promise from us  never on any account to communicate it to you  he also desired us to detain you in Berkshire  by lengthening our visit  till your marriage  lest any friend of your father s in London should know his design  and chance acquaint you with it       Fitzgerald is Monsieur le Majeur  at your ladyship s service  he received his commission this morning        I once again congratulate you  my dear  on this triumph of tenderness  you see love  like virtue  is not only its own reward  but sometimes intitles us to other rewards too        It should always be considered  that those who marry from love  may grow rich  but those who marry to be rich  will never love       The very idea that love will come after marriage  is shocking to minds which have the least spark of delicacy  to such minds  a marriage which begins with indifference will certainly end in disgust and aversion       I bespeak your papa for my
