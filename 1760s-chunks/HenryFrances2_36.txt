your loving me would make Amends for every Distress  that could befal me  I cannot bear to consider myself as the Cause of any Misfortune to you  Had we not met  at that unlucky Crisis  I should  at this Time  have been happily indifferent to all your Sex  and you  perhaps  might have been fortunately engaged in the laudable Pursuit of some more worthy and amiable Woman —But  as I am so far a Predestinarian  as to believe   whatever is  is right   I think there seems a Kind of Fate in our Reconciliation  We have mutually given up the Prime of our Lives to each other  and  after an Acquaintance of almost six Years  we find our Love  Friendship  and Esteem  increasing every Day —Does not this look as if we should spend the calm Evening  as well as the Noontide of our Lives  together  I will indulge this Hope  cast every black  and gloomy Thought behind  and rely on the Opinion I have of your Love  and the Consciousness of my own  for all my future Happiness  — Do with me what you will  bid me go  or stay  I will chearfully conform to whatever is most agreeable to you     Page  135  My Thoughts shall fix  my latest Wish depend   On thee  Guide  Guardian  Kinsman  Father  Friend   By all these tender Names be Henry known  To Fanny s Heart  and grateful let him own   That she  of all Mankind  has lov d but him alone   I beg you to excuse this wild Rhapsody  My Thoughts are not reduced to any Kind of Form  They are filled with Love  Grief  and you  If I had wrote last Post I would not send this  I am quite ashamed of it  Indeed it is sad incoherent Stuff  Can you blame me for not being Mistress of myself  when I think of parting from you  I have done nothing but weep since I received your last Letter  If you consent to my going  do not write so tenderly  for it will only make our Parting more painful   I have yet a thousand Things to say to you  but cannot speak them  I have already said too much  yet  like a peevish Child  I go on sobbing to myself  after my Reason tells me I should have done   Adieu  my ever dear  my best loved Friend  May Happiness  equal to my Wishes  attend you through every Scene of Life  and may we Page  136 meet  at last  in that Fulness of Bliss  which shall far exceed our fondest Hopes   Frances   LETTER CCXXVI   Dear FANNY   WHEN I said your going to France was contrary to my Inclinations  I did not mean selfishly  it was my Fears and Apprehensions of many Kinds  which made my Sentiments doubtful about the Matter  And when I said it was agreeable to your s  I did not mean to upbraid you for the Want of any  the least Part of that Affection  and kind Regard  you have so generously bestowed upon me  but merely alluded to the great Hopes  and sanguine Expectations  which you had formerly from this Scheme  and which  I thought  depended on too many Hazards  to be hastily ventured upon  For both these Reasons  therefore  I referred a Determination in this Matter to Lady —  because her Patronage and Protection would obviate a good deal of my Fears  and justify a great deal of your Hopes  and in that Case I should submit  though in any Case I could never consent  Be well assured  my Heart s fondest Wish  that no Distance in this World  Page  137 nor Chance in this Life  can ever alter my Love  my Friendship  my tenderest Regard toward you  for  as I think it is impossible they can ever improve  I am certain  from late Experience  and frequent Reflection both upon you and myself  that my warmest Affection  highest Esteem  and sincerest Attachment both to your Person and Merits  will last during our Lives  and can only be increased or improved hereafter   Your mentioning the first Day you came to Belvidere  has made me recollect  that I am but about a Year old  for I cast every Day out of my Aera  before the Time I may be truly said to begin to live  though  as I reckon my whole Existence only with regard to you  I shall thus divide it  The 12th of May  1746  I was born  the 6th of November following I was christened  and the 13th of August  1750  I became of Age  and I should deem that the Day of my Death  upon which we should ever be parted  Your visiting this Recess has made me in Love with Life  and every Enjoyment of it  it has made my own more my own  so that I may say  you have bestowed it on me —   For what Purpose  Love   But to be frank  and give it thee again   Accept then the Dedication of this Temple and these Plains
