been very regardful of my interests  He knew my heart  or he would perhaps have been more solicitous for his daughters  I don t find that my circumstances will be very narrow  And if they are  I will live within compass  and even lay up  I endeavour to make a virtue of my pride  in this respect  I cannot live under obligation  I will endeavour to be just  and then  if I can  I will be generous  That is another species of my pride  I told your Lordship  that if I could not conquer it  I would endeavour to make it innocent at least   Bravo  bravo  again cried my Lord—And threw his arms about his neck  and kissed his cheek  tho  he screamed out at the same time  having hurt his gouty knee with the effort   And then  and then—said my Lord  you will marry yourself  And if you marry with discretion  good Lord  what a great man you will be —And how I shall love you —Have you any thoughts of marriage  kinsman —Let me be consulted in your match —and—and—and—you will vastly oblige me  Now I believe  I shall begin to think the name of Grandison has a very agreeable sound with it  What a fine thing it is  for a young man to be able to clear   232 up his mother s prudence so many years after she is gone  and lessen his father s follies  Your father did not use me well  and I must be allowed sometimes to speak my mind of him   That  my Lord  is the only point on which your Lordship and I can differ   Well  well  we won t differ—Only one thing  my dear kinsman  If you sell  give me the preference  Your father told me  that he would mortgage to any man upon God s earth sooner than to me  I took that very heinously   There was a misunderstanding between you  my Lord  My father had a noble spirit  He might think  that there would be a selfishness in the appearance  had he ask d of your Lordship a favour  Little spirited men sometimes choose to be obliged to relations  in hopes that payment will be less rigorously exacted  than by a stranger —  Ah kinsman  kinsman —That s the white side of the business   Indeed  my Lord  that would be a motive with me to avoid troubling your Lordship in an exigence  were it to happen  For mistrusts will arise from possibilities of being ungrateful  when perhaps there is no room  were the heart to be known  for the suspicion   Well said  however  You are a young man that one need not be afraid to be acquainted with  But what would you do as a lender  Would you think hardly of a man that wanted to be obliged to you   O no —But in this case I would be determined by prudence  If my friend regarded himself as the first person in the friendship  me but as the second  in cases that might hurt my fortune  and disable me from acting up to my spirit  to other friends  I would then let him know  that he thought as meanly of my understanding as of my justice   Lord W  was delighted with his nephew s notions  He over and over prophesied  That he would be a great man     233 Sir Charles  with wonderful dispatch  executed those designs  which he had told Lord W  he would carry into effect  And the sale of the timber he cut down in Hampshire  and which lay convenient for water carriage  for the use of the government  furnished him with a very considerable sum   I have mentioned  that Sir Charles  on his setting out from Florence to Paris  to attend his father s leave for his coming to England  had left his ward Miss Jervois  at the former place  in the protection of good Dr  Bartlet  He soon sent for them both over  and placed the young Lady with a discreet widow gentlewoman  who had three prudent daughters  sometimes indulging her with leave to visit his sisters  who are very fond of her  as you have heard  And now let me add  That she is an humble petitioner to me  to procure her the felicity  as she calls it  to be constantly resident with Miss Grandison  She will be she says  the best girl in the world  if she may be allowed this favour  And not one word of advice  either of her guardian  or of Miss Grandison  or of Lady L  shall be lost upon her—And besides  as good women  said she  as Mrs  Lane and her daughters are  what protection can women give me  were my unhappy mother to be troublesome  and resolve to have me  as she is continually threatening   What a new world opens to me  my Lucy  from the acquaintance I am permitted to hold with this family  God grant that your poor Harriet pay not too dearly for her knowledge —She would  I believe you think  were she to be entangled in an hopeless Love     234
