very much contributed to her consolation       Mr  Goodman having lived without marrying till he had reached an age   which one should have imagined would have prevented him from thinking of   it at all  at last took it into his head to become a husband  The person   he made choice of was called Lady Mellasin  relict of a baronet  who   having little or no estate  had accepted of a small employment about the   court  in which post he died  leaving her ladyship one daughter  named   Flora  in a very destitute condition  Goodman  however  had wealth   enough for both  and consulted no other interest than that of his heart       As for the lady  the motive on which she had consented to be his wife   may easily be guessed  and when once made so  gained such an absolute   ascendancy over him  that whatever she declared as her will  with him   had the force of a law  She had an aversion to the city  he immediately   took a house of her chusing at St  James s  inconvenient as it was for   his business  Whatever servants she disapproved  though of ever so long   standing  and of the most approved fidelity  were discharged  and   others  more agreeable to her  put in their places  In fine  nothing she   desired was denied  he considered her as an oracle of wit and wisdom    and thought it would be an unpardonable arrogance to attempt to set his   reason against hers       This lady was no sooner informed of the trust imposed in him  than she   told him  she thought it would be highly proper for Miss Betsy to be   sent for from the school  and boarded with them  not only as her   daughter would be a fine companion for that young orphan  they being   much of the same age  and she herself was more capable of improving her   mind than any governess of a school could be supposed to be  but that    also  having her under her own eye  he would be more able to discharge   his duty towards her as a guardian  than if she were at the distance of   near an hundred miles       There was something in this proposal which had  indeed  the face of a   great deal of good nature and consideration for Miss Betsy  at least it   seemed highly so to Mr  Goodman  but as Sir Ralph Trusty was joined with   him in the guardianship of that young beauty  and was at that time in   London  he thought it proper to consult him on the occasion  which   having done  and finding no objection on the part of the other  Lady   Mellasin  to shew her great complaisance to the daughter of her   husband s deceased friend  sent her own woman to bring her from the   boarding school  and attend her up to London       Miss Betsy had never seen this great metropolis  but had heard so much   of the gay manner in which the genteel part of the world passed their   time in it  that she was quite transported at being told she was to be   removed thither  Mrs  Prinks  for so Lady Mellasin s woman was called    did not fail to heighten her ideas of the pleasures of the place to   which she was going  nor to magnify the goodness of her lady  in taking   her under her care  with the most extravagant encomiums  it is not    therefore  to be wondered at  that neither the tears of the good   governess  who truly loved her  nor those of her dear Miss Forward  nor   of any of those she left behind  could give her any more than a   momentary regret to a heart so possessed with the expectations of going   to receive every thing with which youth is liable to be enchanted  She   promised  however  to keep up a correspondence by letters  which she   did  till things  that seemed to her of much more importance  put her   L    e acquaintance entirely out of her head       She was met at the inn where the stage put up  by Mr  Goodman  in his   own coach  accompanied by Miss Flora  the good old gentleman embraced   her with the utmost tenderness  and assured her that nothing in his   power  or in that of his family  would be wanting to compensate  as much   as possible  the loss she had sustained by the death of her parents  The   young lady also said many obliging things to her  and they seemed highly   taken with each other at this first interview  which gave the honest   heart of Goodman an infinite satisfaction
