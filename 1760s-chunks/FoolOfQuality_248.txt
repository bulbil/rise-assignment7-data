live  and move  and have their   desolate being      God is already the fulness of all possible things   he has  there    fore  all things to give  but nothing to desire  The creature  while   empty of God  is a wanting desire   it has all things to crave  but         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  261     nothing to bestow  No two things in the universe can be more   opposite  more contrasted      Eemember  therefore  this distinction in yourself and all others     remember that  when you feel or see any instance of selfishness    you feel and see the coveting  grudging  and grappling of the   creature   but that  when you feel or see any instance of benevo    lence  you feel and see the informing influence of your God  All   possible vice and malignity subsists in the one   all possible virtue    all possible beauty  all possible blessedness  subsists in the other      As God alone is love  and nothing but love  no arguments of our   own can reason love into us  no efforts of our own can possibly   attain it  It must spring up within us  from the divine bottom or   source wherein our existence stands  and it must break through   the dark and narrow womb of self  into sentiments and feelings   of good will for others  before this child of God can be born into   the world      Self is wholly a miser it contracts what it possesses  and at the   same time attracts all that it doth not possess  It at once shuts   out others from its own proposed enjoyments  and would draw   into its little whirlpool whatever others enjoy      Love  on th j contrary  is a giving  not a craving   an expansion    not a contraction   it breaks in pieces the condensing circle of self    and goes forth hi the delightfulness of its desire to bless      Self is a poor  dark  and miserable avariciousness  incapable of   enjoying what it hath  through its grappling and grasping at what   it hath not  The impossibility of its holding all things  makes it   envious of those who are in possession of any thing  and envy   kindles the fire of hell  wrath  and wretchedness  throughout its   existence      Love  on the other hand  is rich  enlightening  and full of   delight the bounteousness of its wishes makes the infinity of its   wealth   and  without seeking or requiring  it cannot fail of finding   its own enjoyment and blessedness in its desire to communicate   and diffuse blessing and enjoyment      But is it not  sir  a very terrible thing  said Harry  for poor   creatures to be evil by the necessity of their nature       You mistake this matter  my Harry  you take the emptiness    darkness  and desire in the creature to be the evil of the creature    They are  indeed  the only possible cause of evil in or to any   creature   but they are exceedingly far from being an evil in them    selves  they are  on the contrary  the only  the necessary  and   indispensable foundation whereon any creaturely benefit can be   built  It is extremely good for the creature to be poor and weak    and empty  and dark  and desiring  for hereby he becomes a   capacity for being supplied with all the riches  power  glories  and   blessedness of his God      As God is every where in and of himself  the fulness of all   possible beings and beatitudes  he cannot create any thing inde    pendent or out of himself  they cannot be but by being both in   him and by him  Could it be otherwise   Could any creature be   wise  or powerful  or happy  in and of itself  What a poor and   stinted happiness must that have been  its blessedness  in that         262 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      case  must have been limited like its being   and how infinitely    my child  should we then have fallen short of   that eternal weight   of glory   intended for us  But God has been graciously pleased   to provide better things  If we humbly and desirously depend   upon him  we become entitled to all that he has  and that he is    He will enlighten our darkness with his own illumination   he will   inform our ignorance with his own wisdom   his omnipotence will   become the strength
