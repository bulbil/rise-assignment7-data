FOOL OF QUALITY      shall move  as down a descent  wherever thy goodness would guide   me   till I shall feelingly find and know that all thy ways are   ways of pleasantness  and all thy paths the paths of peace       This  my Lord  may look somewhat like boasting   but it boast    eth of nought excepting Christ crucified  or rather arisen in me    whereby all worldly matters are crucified unto me      Within about a fortnight after my conversion I received a letter   from a friend in London  informing me that my old uncle had   secretly married a young creature who was lately delivered of   a son   that he now openly acknowledged her for his wife   and   that this  as he feared  did not bode me any good      At another time these tidings would have greatly alarmed me     but I was now equally resigned and   ndifferent to all events      In a few days after  as I was stepping out of my lodgings  I   was arrested  in the name and at the suit of my uncle  for  700    the precise sum for which I had drawn upon him about nine   months before  All the consequences of this caption immediately   occurred to me  I perceived that my uncle intended to deprive   me of my patrimony in favour of his new family   and  as I had   no means for opposing his machinations save what lay in his own   hands  I concluded that a jail was to be my portion for life    Wherefore I lifted up my heart  and said within myself To   prison and to death give me cheerfully to follow thee  thou who   in death art the life and resurrection       My spirit had no sooner uttered this short ejaculation  than I   felt such a weight of peace descending upon me  that my heart   leaped within me at the prospect of suffering  and I would not   have exchanged my prison for a throne      While I quietly walked with the officers toward the place of   my durance  they came to a great tavern  where they entered    and proposed to regale themselves at my expense      Mean time a Dutch merchant  of great eminence  happened to   be with his lady in the principal room  and  hearing a bustle in   the house  he inquired the cause  and sent for the chief bailiff      Soon after I was conducted into their presence  They both   rose as I entered  and the gentleman approaching took me fa    miliarly by the hand and said in Dutch Mr  Meekly  I hear   you are in distress  and that is sufficient to recommend you to   my services  but your appearance exacts something more from   my inclinations  Pray  let me know wherein and how far it may be   requisite for you to command me      I muttered somewhat  as I suppose  inarticulately toward an   answer   for I protest  my lord  I was so struck  so awed  so con    founded by his presence  that I was lost for the time to the con    sideration of my own affairs  Mean while he placed me at table    just opposite to the heavenly vision of his bride  and then went and   resumed his seat beside her   while I  gazing in silence and utmost   wonder  recollected those lines of Milton  where  speaking of Adam   and Eve  he calls them      The loveliest pair     That ever since in love s embraces met     Adam  the goodliest man of men since born   His sons   the faireat of her daughters  Eve           THE FOOL OF QUALITY  359     The gentleman perceived my astonishment  and  graciously smil    ing  again asked me what sum was requisite to extricate me from   my present difficulty   Ah  sir   said I  it is a sum that far exceeds   all human bounty   and  indeed  I would not accept the obligation   from any man unless I were assured of being shortly in a capacity   to reimburse him  of which I see no likelihood  I think no pos    sibility      Here I told him  in a few words  how my father had left me an   infant at the disposal of my uncle  who had now put me under   arrest for 700  which  some time since  he had freely remitted to   me  as in my own right      I see  said the gentleman  your uncle is a
