 Now will my fortitude have a call to exert itself  and I warrant I bear  as well as he  an evil that is inevitable  At this instant  this trying instant  however  I found myself thus brave  So  my dear  it was nothing but the too great warmth of the room which overcame me   I endeavoured to assume all my courage  and desired   174 him to proceed  but held by the arm of my chair  to steady me  lest my little tremblings should increase  The faintness had left some little tremblings upon me  Lucy  and one would not care  you know  to be thought affected by any thing in his story  He proceeded   AT Bologna  and in the neighbourhood of Urbino  are seated two branches of a noble family  marquises and counts of Porretta  which boasts its pedigree from Roman princes  and has given to the church two cardinals  one in the latter age  the other in the beginning of this   The Marchese della Poretta  who resides in Bologna  is a nobleman of great merit  His Lady is illustrious by descent  and still more so for her goodness of heart  sweetness of temper  and prudence  They have three sons  and a daughter—   Ah  that daughter  thought I    The eldest of the sons is a general officers  in the service of the king of the two Sicilies  a man of equal honour and bravery  but passionate and haughty  valuing himself on his descent  The second is devoted to the church  and is already a Bishop  The interest of his family  and his own merits  it is not doubted  will one day if he lives  give him a place in the sacred college  The third  Signor Jeronymo  or  as he is sometimes called  the Barone  della Porretta  has a regiment in the service of the king of Sardinia  The sister is the favourite of them all  She is lovely in her person  gentle in her manners  and has high  but just  notions of the nobility of her descent  of the honour of her sex  and of what is due to her own character  She is pious  charitable  beneficent  Her three brothers preferred her interests to their own  Her father used to call her  The pride of his life  her mother  Her other self  her own Clementina    CLEMENTINA —Ah  Lucy  what a pretty name is Clementina      175 I became intimate with Signor Jeronymo at Rome  near two years before I had the honour to be known to the rest of his family  except by his report  which he made run very high in my favour  He was master of many fine qualities  but had contracted friendship with a set of dissolute young men of rank  with whom he was very earnest to make me acquainted  I allowed myself to be often in their company  but  as they were totally abandoned in their morals  it was in hopes  by degrees  to draw him from them  But a love of pleasure had got fast hold of him  and his other companions prevailed over his good nature  He had courage  but not enough to resist their libertine attacks upon his morals   Such a friendship could not hold  while each stood his ground  and neither would advance to meet the other  In short  we parted  nor held a correspondence in absence  But afterwards meeting  by accident  at Padua  and Jeronymo having  in the interim  been led into inconveniencies  he avowed a change of principles  and the friendship was renewed   It however held not many months  A Lady  less celebrated for virtue than beauty  obtained an influence over him  against warning  against promise   On being expostulated with  and his promise claimed  he resented the friendly freedom  He was passionate  and  on this occasion  less polite than it was natural for him to be  He even defied his friend  My dear Jeronymo how generously has he acknowleged since  the part his friend  at that time  acted  But the result was  they parted  resolving never more to see each other   Jeronymo pursued the adventure which had occasioned the difference  and one of the Lady s admirers  envying him his supposed success  hired Brescian bravoes to assassinate him   The attempt was made in the Cremonese  They had got him into their toils in a little thicket at some   176 distance from the road  I  attended by two servants  happened to be passing  when a frighted horse ran across the way  his bridle broken  and his saddle bloody  This making me apprehend some mischief to the rider  I drove down the opening he came from  and soon beheld a man struggling on the ground with two ruff•ans  one of whom was just stopping his mouth  the other stabbing him  I leapt out of the post chaise  and drew my sword  running towards them as fast as I could  and  calling to my servants to follow me  indeed calling as if I had a number with me  in order
