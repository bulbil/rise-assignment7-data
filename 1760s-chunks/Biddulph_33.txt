without her knowlege  had not made such a diminution in the personal estate  that after paying my sister the whole of what was specified in the will  there was scarce any thing likely to remain   Had my mother known this secret  she would not perhaps have been so ready to have made my father devise all my intended fortune to my sister  My father  who was aware of this  durst not however inform her at that juncture  how much she hurt herself  by forcing him to such measures  She insisted upon his leaving the whole of what he designed for me to my eldest sister  as well as to convince him  she said  that she had no self interested views  as to be an example to other rebellious children   My father had no remedy on these occasions  but a patient acquiescence  the will was made  and my mother herself would keep it   My father took an opportunity the same day to inform me what he had done  but assured me  he would immediately make another will  agreeable to his first intentions  and leave it in the hands of a faithful friend   This was his design  but alas he lived not to execute it  He was    seized that night with a paralytic disorder  which at once deprived him of the use of his limbs and his speech  They who were about him believed he retained his senses  but he was not capable of making himself understood even by signs  Alarmed with this dismal account of my beloved father’s situation  I flew to the house without considering my mother’s displeasure  but I was not permitted to see him  I filled the house with my cries  but to no purpose  I had not the satisfaction of receiving even a farewell look from him  which was all he was capable of bestowing on me   He languished for several days in this melancholy condition  and then  in spite of the aid of physic  expired   The loss of this dear father so entirely took up my thoughts  that I never reflected on the loss of the remaining part of my fortune  but it was not so with my father in law  There had been a settlement made on me in consequence of the fortune promised  though not equal to what it demanded  yet superior to the half which was paid  He relied on my father’s word for the remainder  and had no doubt of its being secured to him  knowing his circumstances  as well as his strict integrity  and that my sister had actually received the same fortune which I was promised   Mr Vere had four daughters  and it was on this fortune he chiefly depended to provide for them   The news of my being cut off with a shilling exceedingly surprized and exasperated him  Unluckily I had not mentioned to him  nor even to my husband  the will which my father had been obliged to make  The assurances he gave me  of immediately making another in my favour  prevented me  as I thought it would only be a very severe proof of my mother’s enmity to the family  which I could have wished to conceal from them  especially as I did not imagine it would have affected me afterwards  Mr Vere the elder was from home when my father died  and his business detained him for more than a month after his funeral was over  My husband  on this occasion  shewed the tender and disinterested love he bore me  he affected to make as light as possible of this unexpected disappointment  but at the same time expressed his uneasiness  lest his father should carry matters to an extremity with my mother  from whom we knew we were to expect nothing by mild methods   It was now thought adviseable  that I should write to my mother  to condole with her on my father’s death  again to intreat her forgiveness of my fault  and  as some mitigation of it  to acknowlege    that it was not only with my father’s privity  but even with his consent and approbation  that I had married   I wrote this letter in a strain of the utmost humility  without mentioning a word of my fortune  that I thought it would be time enough for me to do  if I could prevail on my mother to see me  and would at all events come better from my husband or his father  than from me  But I gained nothing by this  only some unkind reflections on my father’s memory  and a message  that since he thought proper to marry his daughter in a manner so highly disagreeable to her mother  he should have taken care of providing for her  as he could not expect a parent  so disobliged as she had been  would take any notice of me   My mother had been left sole executrix to my father’s forced will  and she took care to put my sister  and the other legatees  into possession of what was bequeathed to them in a very short time after his decease  She found there was an unexpected deficiency in his personal fortune  insomuch that there was barely enough to pay his debts  and that her being left the residue  after the specified legacies were paid  amounted
