of the room  where she still continued sitting  I presented my glass full in her face  Here it was that I exulted in my success  no blot  no stain  appeared on any part of the faithful mirror  As when the large  unwritten  presents its snowy spotless bosom to the writer s hand  so appeared the glass to my view  Here  O ye daughters of English ancestors  cried I  turn hither▪ and behold an object worthy imitation  look upon the mirror now  and acknowledge its justice  and this woman s pre eminence  The ladies obeying the summons  came up in a groupe  and  looking on  acknowledged there was some truth in the picture  as the person now represented had been deaf  dumb  and a fool from her cradle   Thus much of my dream I distinctly remember  the rest was filled with chimaeras  enchanted castles  and flying dragons as usual  As you  my dear Fum Hoam  are particularly versed in the interpretation of those midnight warnings  what pleasure should I find in your explanation  but that our distance prevents  I make no doubt  however    202 but that from my description you will very much venerate the good qualities of the English ladies in general  since dreams  you know  go always by contraries  Adieu   LETTER XLVI  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hingpo  a slave in Persia    YOUR last letters betray a mind seemingly fond of wisdom  yet tempested up by a thousand various passions  You would fondly persuade me that my former lessons still influence your conduct  and yet your mind seems not less enslaved than your body  Knowlege  wisdom  erudition  arts and elegance what are they  but the mere trappings of the mind  if they do not serve to encrease the happiness of the possessor  A mind rightly instituted in the school of philosophy  acquires at once the stability of the oak  and the flexibility of the osier  The truest manner of lessening our agonies  is to shrink from their pressure  is to confess that we feel them   The fortitude of European sages is but a dream  for where lies the merit in being insensible to the strokes of fortune  or in dissembling our sensibility  if we are insensible  that arises only from an happy constitution  that is a blessing previously granted by heaven  and which no art can procure  no institutions improve     203If we dissemble our feelings  we only artificially endeavour to persuade others that we enjoy privy leges which we actually do not possess Thus while we endeavour to appear happy  we feel at once all the pangs of internal misery  and all the self reproaching consciousness of endeavouring to deceive   I know but of two sects of philosophers in the world that have endeavoured to inculcate that fortitude is but an imaginary virtue  I mean the followers of Confucius  and those who profess the doctrines of Christ  All other sects teach pride under misfortunes  they alone teach humility  Night  says our Chinese philosopher  not more surely follows day  than groans and tears grow out of pain  when misfortunes  therefore  oppress  when tyrants threaten  it is our interest  it is our duty  to fly even to dissipation for support  to seek redress from friendship  to seek redress from that best of friends who loved us into being   Philosophers  my son  have long declaimed against the passions  as being the source of all our miseries  they are the source of all our mifortunes I own  but they are the source of our pleasures too  and every endeavour of our lives  and all the institutions of philosophy  should tend to this  not to dissemble an absence of passion  but to repel those which lead to vice  by those which direct to virtue   The soul may be compared to a field of battle  where two armies are ready every moment to encounter  not a single vice but has a more powerful opponent  and not one virtue but may be overborne   204 by a combination of vices  Reason guides the bands of either host  nor can it subdue one passion but by the assistance of another  Thus  as a bark on every side beset with storms  enjoys a state of rest  so does the mind  when influenced by a just equipoise of the passions  enjoy tranquility   I have used such means as my little fortune would admit to procure your freedom  I have lately written to the governor of Argun to pay your ransom  though at the expence of all the wealth I brought with me from China  If we become poor we shall at least have the pleasure of bearing poverty together  for what is fatigue or famine  when weighed against friendship and freedom  Adieu   LETTER XLVII  From Lien Chi Altangi to       merchant in Amsterdam   HAPPENING some days ago to call at a painter s to amuse my self in examining some pictures  I had no design to buy  it surprised me to see a young Prince in the working room  dressed in a painter s apron  and assiduously learning the trade  We instantly remembered to have seen each other  and
