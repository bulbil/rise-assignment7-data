went out of my way to meet it  I looked upon it when it came  as an unavoidable evil  and as a call upon me for fortitude  And hence I hardly ever wanted that presence of mind in it  which a man ought to shew  and which sometimes  indeed  was the means of extricating me from it   Sir Har  An instance of which this morning  I suppose you think  has produced   Sir Ch  I had not that in my head  In Italy  indeed  I should hardly have acted as in the instance you   49 hint at  But in England  and  Sir Hargrave  I was willing to think  in Cavendish Square  I could not but conclude myself safe  I know my own heart  I wish d you no Evil  Sir  I was calm  I expected to meet you full of fire  full of resentment  But it is hard  thought I  as some extraordinary step seems necessary to be taken  if I cannot content myself with that superiority  excuse me  Sir Hargrave  which my calmness  and Sir Hargrave s passion  must give me over him  or any man  My sword was in my power  Had I even apprehended assassination  the house of an English gentleman could not have been the place for it  And where a confidence was reposed  But one particular instance  I own  I had in my thought  when I said what I did   All the gentlemen besought him to give it   Sir Charles  In the raging of the war  now  so seasonably for all the powers at variance  concluded  I was passing through a wood in Germany  in my way to Manheim  My servant  at some distance before me  was endeavouring to find out the right road  there being more than one  He rode back affrighted  and told me he had heard a loud cry of murder  succeeded by groans  which grew fainter and fainter  as those of a dying person  and besought me to make the best of my way back  As I was thinking to do so  tho  my way lay through the wood  and I had got more than half way in it  I beheld six Pandours issue from that inner part of the wood  into which  in all probability  they had dragged some unhappy passenger  for I saw an horse bridled and saddled  without a rider  grazing by the road side  They were well armed  I saw no way to escape  They probably knew everyavenue in and out of the wood  I did not  They stopped when they came within two musquetshots of me  as if they had waited to see which way I took  Two of them had dead poultry slung across their shoulders  which shewed them to be common plunderers    50 I took a resolution to ride up to them  I bid my servant  if he saw me attacked  make the best of his way for his own security  while they were employed either in rifling or murdering me  but  if they suffered me to pass  to follow me  He had no portmanteau to tempt them  That  and my other baggage  I had caused to be sent by water to Manheim—I am an Englishman  gentlemen  said I  judging  if Austrians  as I supposed they were  that plea would not disavail me   I am doubtful of my way  Here is a purse  holding it out  As soldiers  you must be gentlemen  It is at your service  if one or two of you will be so kind as to escort and guide me through this wood  They looked upon one another  I was loth they should have time to deliberate—I am upon business of great consequence  Pray direct me the nearest way to Manheim  Take these florins   At last one that seemed of authority among them  held out his hand  and taking the purse  said something in Sclavonian  and two of them  with their pieces slung on their shoulders  and their sabres drawn  led me out of the wood in safety  but hoped  at parting  my farther generosity  I found a few more florins for them  and they rode back into the wood  I suppose to their fellows  and glad I was to come off so well  Had I either seemed afraid of them  or endeavoured to escape  probably I had been lost  Two persons were afterwards found murdered in the wood  one of them  perhaps  the unhappy man whom my servant had heard cry out  and groan   Mr  Jor  I feel now very sensibly  Sir Charles  your danger and escape  Your fortitude indeed was then of service to you   Sir Har  But  Sir Charles  methinks I shall be easier in myself  if you give me one instance of your making  before now  an enemy a friend  Have you one in point     51Sir Ch  Stories of this nature come very ill from a man s own mouth   Sir Har  I must have it  Sir Charles  A brothersufferer will better reconcile me to myself   Sir
