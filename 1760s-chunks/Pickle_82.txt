 then   said the youth    I hope you have prevailed against the flesh  Tunley     Yes  yes    answered the publican   I have cooled his capissens  as the saying is   I have played such a tune about his ears  that I ll be bound he shan t  long for music this month  A goatish  man faced rascal  Why  he s a  perfect parish bull  as I hope to live      6 22 15  3 45 PM   Hatchway  observing that he seemed to have made a stout battle  desired  he would sit down and recover wind  and after he had swallowed a brace  of bumpers  his vanity prompted him to expatiate upon his own exploit in  such a manner  that the confederates  without seeming to know the curate  was his antagonist  became acquainted with every circumstance of the  ambuscade   Tunley had scarce got the better of his agitation  when his wife   entering the room  told them  by way of news  that some waggish body  had sent Mr  Sackbut the curate to pray with her  This name inflamed  the husband s choler anew  and  forgetting all his complaisance for his  spouse  he replied with a rancorous grin   Add rabbit him  I doubt not  but you found his admonitions deadly comfortable   The landlady  looking  at her vassal with a sovereign aspect   What crotchets   said she   have  you got in your fool s head  I trow  I know no business you have to sit  here like a gentleman with your arms akimbo  there s another company  in the house to be served   The submissive husband took the hint  and  without further expostulation sneaked out of the room   Next day it was reported that Mr  Sackbut had been waylaid and  almost murdered by robbers  and an advertisement was pasted upon the  church door  offering a reward to any person that should discover the  assassin  but he reaped no satisfaction from this expedient  and  was confined to his chamber a whole fortnight  by the bruises he had  received   CHAPTER XXX    Mr  Sackbut and his Pupil conspire against Peregrine  who   being apprised of their Design by his Sister  takes measures for  counterworking their Scheme  which is executed by mistake upon Mr   Gauntlet  this young Soldier meets with a cordial reception from the  Commodore  who generously decoys him into his own interest   When he considered the circumstances of the ambuscade  he could not  persuade himself that he had been assaulted by a common thief  because  it was not to be supposed that a robber would have amused himself in  pummeling rather than in rifling his prey  he therefore ascribed his  misfortune to the secret enmity of some person who had a design upon his  life  and  upon mature deliberation  fixed his suspicion upon Peregrine   who was the only man on earth from whom he thought he deserved such  treatment  He communicated his conjecture to his pupil  who readily  adopted his opinion  and advised him strenuously to revenge the wrong by  a like contrivance  without seeking to make a narrower inquiry  lest his  enemy should be thereby put upon his guard   This proposal being relished  they in concert revolved the means of  retorting the ambush with interest  and actually laid such a villainous  plan for attacking our hero in the dark  that  had it been executed  according to their intention  the young gentleman s scheme of travelling  would have been effectually marred  But their machinations were    6 22 15  3 45 PM   overheard by Miss Pickle  who was now in the seventeenth year of her  age  and  in spite of the prejudice of education  entertained in secret  a most sisterly affection for her brother Perry  though she had never  spoken to him  and was deterred by the precepts  vigilance and menaces  of her mother  from attempting any means of meeting him in private  She  was not  however  insensible to his praise  which was loudly sounded  forth in the neighbourhood  and never failed of going to church  and  every other place  where she thought she might have an opportunity of  seeing this amiable brother  With these sentiments it cannot be supposed  that she would hear the conspiracy without emotion  She was shocked at  the treacherous barbarity of Gam  and shuddered at the prospect of the  danger to which Peregrine would be exposed from their malice  She durst  not communicate this plot to her mother  because she was afraid that  lady s unaccountable aversion for her first born would hinder her  from interposing in his behalf  and consequently render her a sort of  accomplice in the guilt of his assassins  She therefore resolved to warn  Peregrine of the conspiracy  on account of which she transmitted to  him in an affectionate letter  by means of a young gentleman in that  neighbourhood  who made his addresses to her at that time  and who
