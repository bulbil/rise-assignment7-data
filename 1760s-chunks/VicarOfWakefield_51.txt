 interrupted I    and were you indeed married by a priest  and in orders    —   Indeed  Sir  we were    replied she    though we were both sworn to conceal his name    —   Why then  my  Page  49  child  come to my arms again  and now you are a thousand times more welcome than before  for you are now his wife to all intents and purposes  nor can all the laws of man  tho  written upon tables of adamant  lessen the force of that sacred connexion     Alas  Papa    replied she    you are but little acquainted with his villainies  he has been married already  by the same priest  to six or eight wives more  whom  like me  he has deceived and abandoned     Has he so    cried I    then we must hang the priest  and you shall inform against him to morrow    —   But Sir    returned she    will that be right  when I am sworn to secrecy    —   My dear    I replied    if you have made such a promise  I cannot  nor will not  tempt you to break it  Even tho  it may benefit the public  you must not inform against him  In all human institutions  Page  50  a smaller evil is allowed to procure a greater good  as in politics  a province may be given away to secure a kingdom  in medicine  a limb may be lopt off  to preserve the body  But in religion the law is written  and inflexible  never to do evil  And this law  my child  is right  for otherwise  if we commit a smaller evil  to procure a greater good  certain guilt would be thus incurred  in expectation of contingent advantage  And though the advantage should certainly follow  yet the interval between commission and advantage  which is allowed to be guilty  may be that in which we are called away to answer for the things we have done  and the volume of human actions is closed for ever  But I interrupt you  my dear  go on     The very next morning    continued she    I found what little expectations I was to have from his sincerity  That very  Page  51  morning he introduced me to two unhappy women more  whom  like me  he had deceived  but who lived in contented prostitution  I loved him too tenderly to bear such rivals in his affections  and strove to forget my infamy in a tumult of pleasures  With this view  I danced  dressed  and talked  but still was unhappy  The gentlemen who visited there told me every moment of the power of my charms  and this only contributed to encrease my melancholy  as I had thrown all their power quite away  Thus each day I grew more pensive  and he more insolent  till at last the monster had the assurance to offer me to a young Baronet of his acquaintance  Need I describe  Sir  how his ingratitude stung me  My answer to this proposal was almost madness  I desired to part  As I was going he offered me a purse  but I flung it at him with indignation  and burst from  Page  52  him in a rage  that for a while kept me insensible of the miseries of my situation  But I soon looked round me  and saw myself a vile  abject  guilty thing  without one friend in the world to apply to    Just in that interval  a stage coach happening to pass by  I took a place  it being my only aim to be driven at a distance from a wretch I despised and detested  I was set down here  where  since my arrival  my own anxiety  and this woman s unkindness  have been my only companions  The hours of pleasure that I have passed with my mamma and sister  now grow painful to me  Their sorrows are much  but mine is greater than theirs  for mine is guilt and infamy       Have patience  my child    cried I    and I hope things will yet be better  Take some repose to night  and to morrow  Page  53  I ll carry you home to your mother and the rest of the family  from whom you will receive a kind reception  Poor woman  this has gone to her heart  but she loves you still  Olivia  and will forget it    Page   unnumbered   CHAP  III     Offences are easily pardoned where there is love at bottom     THE next morning I took my daughter behind me  and set out on my return home  As we travelled along  I strove  by every persuasion  to calm her sorrows and fears  and to arm her with resolution to bear the presence of her offended mother  I took every opportunity  from the prospect
