blackest  circumstance of thy whole life and conversation   The physician   confounded at this address  assured him that he was utterly ignorant  of his meaning  and  when the other gentleman explained it  absolutely  denied the charge  affirming he had said no more than that he had  vomited a quantity of something as black as a crow  The landlord of the  house acknowledged that he might have been mistaken  and thus the whole  mystery was explained   The company seeming to relish the story of the three black crows  which  they considered as an impromptu of Cadwallader s own invention  but   granting it to be true  they unanimously declared that it could have no  weight in invalidating the testimony of divers persons of honour  who  had been witnesses of the magician s supernatural skill  On the next  day of consultation  the necromancer being in the chair  and his friend  behind the curtain  the outward door was scarce opened  when a female  visitant flounced in  and discovered to the magician the features of one  of those inquisitive ladies  whose curiosity  he knew  his confederate  had aroused in the matter above described  She addressed herself to him  with a familiar air  observing  that she had heard much of his great  knowledge  and was come to be a witness of his art  which she desired  him to display  in declaring what he knew to be her ruling passion   Cadwallader  who was no stranger to her disposition  assumed the pen  without hesitation  and furnished her with an answer  importing  that  the love of money predominated  and scandal possessed the next place  in her heart  Far from being offended at his freedom  she commended  his frankness with a smile  and  satisfied of his uncommon talents   expressed a desire of being better acquainted with his person  nay   she began to catechise him upon the private history of divers great  families  in which he happened to be well versed  and he  in a  mysterious manner  dropped such artful hints of his knowledge  that  she was amazed at his capacity  and actually asked if his art was    6 22 15  3 45 PM   communicable  The conjurer replied in the affirmative  but  at the same  time  gave her to understand  that it was attainable by those only who  were pure and undefiled in point of chastity and honour  or such as  by  a long course of penitence  had weaned themselves from all attachments  to the flesh  She not only disapproved  but seemed to doubt the truth  of this assertion  telling him  with a look of disdain  that his art  was not worth having  if one could not use it for the benefit of  one s pleasure  she had even penetration enough to take notice of  an inconsistency in what he had advanced  and asked  why he himself  exercised his knowledge for hire  if he was so much detached from all  worldly concerns   Come  come  doctor   added she   you are in the right  to be cautious against impertinent curiosity  but  perhaps  I may make  it worth your while to be communicative    These overtures were interrupted by a rap at the door  signifying the  approach of another client  upon which the lady inquired for his private  passage  through which she might retire  without the risk of being seen   When she understood he was deficient in that convenience  she withdrew  into an empty room adjoining to the audience chamber  in order to  conceal herself from the observation of the new comer  This was no other  than the inamorata  who came  by appointment  to receive the solution of  her doubts  and the misanthrope  glad of an opportunity to expose her to  the censure of such an indefatigable minister of fame as the person  who he knew would listen from the next apartment  laid her under the  necessity of refreshing his remembrance with a recapitulation of her  former confession  which was almost finished  when she was alarmed by a  noise at the door  occasioned by two gentlemen  who attempted to enter  by force   Terrified at this uproar  which disconcerted the magician himself  she  ran for shelter into the place which was preoccupied by the other lady   who  hearing this disturbance  had closed the window shutters  that she  might have the better chance of remaining unknown  Here they ensconced  themselves in the utmost consternation  while the necromancer  after  some recollection  ordered Hadgi to open the door  and admit the  rioters  who  he hoped  would be over awed by the authority of his  appearance  The janitor had no sooner obeyed his instructions  than  in rushed a young libertine  who had been for some time upon the town   together with his tutor  who was a worn out debauchee  well known to  the magician  They were both in that degree of intoxication necessary to  prepare such dispositions for what they commonly call frolics  and
