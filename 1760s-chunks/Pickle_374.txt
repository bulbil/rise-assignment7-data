that party   made so ridiculous a figure  and gave so absurd  contradictory  and  inconsistent an evidence  as no court or jury could give the least  degree of credit to  On the other hand  it was observed  that the  nephew and Mr  M    his chief manager  being absolute strangers in that  country  and unacquainted with the characters of the persons they had to  deal with  were obliged to lay before the court and jury such evidence  as came to their hand  some of whom plainly appeared to have been  put upon them by their adversaries with a design to hurt  It was also  manifest  that the witnesses produced for Mr  A    were such as could  have no manner of connection with him  nor any dependence whatsoever  upon him  to influence their evidence  for the far greatest part of them  had never seen him from his infancy till the trial began  and many of  them  though poor  and undignified with the title of colonels  were  people of unblemished character  of great simplicity  and such as no man  in his senses would pitch upon to support a bad cause  It is plain that  the jury  whose well known honour  impartiality  and penetration  must  be revered by all who are acquainted with them  were not under the least  difficulty about their verdict  for they were not enclosed above half  an hour  when they returned with it  These gentlemen could not help  observing the great inequality of the parties engaged  the great  advantages that the uncle had in every other respect  except the  truth and justice of his case  over the nephew  by means of his vast  possessions  and of his power and influence all round the place of his  birth  nor could the contrast between the different geniuses of the two  parties escape their observation  They could not but see and conclude   that a person who had confessedly transported and sold his orphan nephew  into slavery   who  on his return  had carried on so unwarrantable and  cruel a prosecution to take away his life under colour of law   and who  had also given such glaring proofs of his skill and dexterity in the  management of witnesses for that cruel purpose   was in like manner  capable of exerting the same happy talent on this occasion  when his all  was at stake  more especially  as he had so many others who were equally  interested with himself  and whose abilities in that respect fell  nothing short of his own  to second him in it  The gentlemen of the  jury had also a near view of the manner in which the witnesses delivered  their testimonies  and had from thence an opportunity of observing  many circumstances  and distinguishing characteristics of truth and  falsehood  from which a great deal could be gathered  that could not  be adequately conveyed by any printed account  how exact soever   consequently  they must have been much better judges of the evidence on  which they founded their verdict than any person who had not the same  opportunity  can possibly be    These  Mr  Pickle  were my reflections on what I had occasion to  observe concerning that famous trial  and  on my return to England  two years after  I could not help pitying the self sufficiency of some  people  who  at this distance  pretended to pass their judgment on that  verdict with as great positiveness as if they had been in the secrets  of the cause  or upon the jury who tried it  and that from no better  authority than the declamations of Lord A   s emissaries  and some  falsified printed accounts  artfully cooked up on purpose to mislead and  deceive    But to return from this digression  Lord A    the defendant in that  cause  was so conscious of the strength and merits of his injured  nephew s case  and that a verdict would go against him  that he ordered    6 22 15  3 45 PM   a writ of error to be made out before the trial was ended  and the  verdict was no sooner given  than he immediately lodged it  though  he well knew he had no manner of error to assign  This expedient was  practised merely for vexation and delay  in order to keep Mr  A   from  the possession of the small estate he had recovered by the verdict   that  his slender funds being exhausted  he might be deprived of other  means to prosecute his right  and by the most oppressive contrivances  and scandalous chicanery  it has been kept up to this day  without his  being able to assign the least shadow of any error    Lord A   was not the only antagonist that Mr  A   had to deal with   all the different branches of the A   family  who had been worrying one  another at law ever since the death of the late earl of A    about the  partition of his great
