very peacable husband  your daughter  I find  is mightily disposed to follow your example  but as I am not quite so tame as my father in law was  I will suffer her to see as little of it as may be  With this he turned from her  and ordering his coach and six to be got ready immediately  with very little ceremony he forced his wife into it  and carried her home directly  leaving lady Grimston foaming with rage  The altercation had been carried on with so little caution  that the servants heard it  and the story is the jest of the neighbourhood   I confess I am not sorry for this breach  it may be the better for poor Mrs Vere  for though her mother’s jointure reverts to a male relation  on whom the estate was settled  yet as lady Grimston has a large personal fortune  it is in her power to make her daughter full amends for the injury she did her   May 20  Mr Arnold is improving his gardens  and taking in a great deal more ground to enlarge them  I do not express the least dissatisfaction at this  tho’ I own I could wish he would not engage in new expences on an estate which is now in litigation  but our lawyers are so sanguin  that they encourage him to proceed    The following is writ in the hand of the lady  who gave the editor these papers  ‘Here follows an interval of four months  in which time  though the Journal was regularly continued  nothing material to her story occured  but the birth of a daughter  after which she proceeds ’   September 25  How delightful are the new sensations  my dear Cecilia  that I feel hourly springing in my heart  Surely the tenderness of a mother can never be sufficiently repaid  and I now more than ever rejoice in having  by an obedience  which perhaps I once thought had some    little merit in it  contributed so much to the repose of a parent  to whom I have such numberless obligations  I never see my little girl  but I think such were the tender sentiments  the sweet anxieties  that my honoured and beloved mother felt when her Sidney was such a brat as this  Then I say  surely I have a right to all the duty  all the filial love that this creature can shew me  in return for my fondness  As for Mr Arnold  he idolizes it  you never saw so good a nurse as he makes  Lady Grimston declares  we are both in a fair way of ruining the child  and advises us to send it out of the house  that we may not grow too fond of it  but we shall hardly take her counsel   September 28  I informed you before that Miss Burchell had been summoned home by her uncle  who was then very ill  She has lately written an account to my mother of his death  and that as she has now her fortune in her own hands  she intends immediately to quit her aunt  and look out for some genteel and reputable family in London  where it seems she chuses to reside  to lodge with   My mother  in her letter to me  expresses great satisfaction at her resolution to leave her aunt  but is not without her fears  that so pretty a young woman  left to her own guidance  may be liable to danger  though she thinks both her natural disposition  and her good sense  sufficient to guard her against actual evil   Our lawyer writes us a word  that he has had an offer of a composition  proposed by the widow Arnold’s people  he says  though the sum they mention is a very round one  yet it plainly indicates the weakness of their hopes  and concludes with telling Mr Arnold  that if six pence would buy them off  he should not  with his consent  give it to them  as it would tacitly admit the legality of their claim  and might be productive of troublesome consequences hereafter  and therefore he would by all means have the issue fairly tried  Mr Arnold laughs heartily at the proposal  but says he is very much obliged to the lady for condescending to give up more than half  when her daughter has a right to the whole  without whose consent he supposes it is not in the mother’s power to make terms   I wish we were rid of this troublesome affair  as it must hurry us to town sooner than we intended  and the country is still delightful   London  October 1  Again we have quitted our sweet retirement for the noise and bustle    of London  but this law business  it seems  must be closely pursued  though our antagonist’s motions seem a little dilatory  We cannot find out the secret spring that sets the machine a going  the wheels however do not seem to move with such alacrity as they did  though the widow still talks big  and says  we shall repent of having rejected her offer   October 3  My brother is arrived in town  but took care to settle himself in handsome commodious lodgings before he paid us a visit  for fear  I suppose
