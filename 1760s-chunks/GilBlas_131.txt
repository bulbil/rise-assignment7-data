was aware of  His words might have been the error of his hand  but his infidelity is the offence of his heart  Faithless man  Now he is held by other ties         But  added she  assuming an air of disdain  let him devote himself unconstrained to his new passion  I shall never cross him  Tell him  however  that he need not have insulted me  I should have left the course open to my rival  without his warning me from the field  for so fickle a lover has not soul enough about him to pay for the degradation of soliciting his return  With this sentiment she gave me my dismissal  and retired in a whirlwind of passion against Don Lewis   My exit was conducted entirely to my own satisfaction  for I conceived that with due cultivation of my talent I might in time become a consummate hypocrite and most successful cheat  I returned home on the strength of it  where I found my worthy masters  Mendoza and Pacheco  supping together  and rattling away as if they had been playfellows from their cradles  Aurora saw at once  by myself sufficient air  that her commission had not been neglected in my hands  Here you are again then  Gil Blas  said she  give us an account of your embassy  Wit and invention was all I had to trust to  so I told them I had delivered the packet into Isabella s own hands  who  after having glanced over the contents of the two letters  so far from seeming disconcerted  burst into a fit of laughter  as if she had been mad  and said    Upon my word  our young men of fashion write in a pretty style  It must be owned they are much more entertaining than scribes of plebeian rank  It was a very good way of getting out of the scrape  exclaimed my mistress  she must be an arrant coquette  For my part  said Don Lewis  I cannot trace a feature of Isabella in this conduct  Her character must have been completely metamorphosed in my absence  She struck me too in a very different light  replied Aurora  It must be allowed some women can assume all modes and fashions at will  I was once in love with one of that description  and a fine dance she led me  Gil Blas can tell you the whole story  She had an air of propriety about her which might have imposed upon a whole synod of old maids  It is true  said I  putting in my oar  it was a face to play the devil with a sworn bachelor  I could scarcely have been proof against it myself   The personated Mendoza and Pacheco shouted with laughter at my manner of expressing myself  the one for the false witness I bore against a culprit of my own creation  the other laughed simply at the phrase in which my anathema was couched  We wait on talking about the versatility of women  and the verdict  after hearing the evidence  all on one side  was given against Isabella  A convicted coquette  and sentence passed on her accordingly  Don Lewis made a fresh vow never to see her more and Don Felix  after his example  swore to hold her in eternal abhorrence  By dint of these mutual protestations a sort of friendship was established on the spur of the occasion  and they promised on both sides to keep    no secrets from each other  The time after supper passed in ingratiating intercourse  and the time seemed short till they retired to their separate apartments  I followed Aurora to hers  where I gave her a faithful account of my conversation with the Doctor s daughter  not forgetting the most trivial circumstance  She had much ado to help kissing me for joy  My dear Gil Blas  said she  I am delighted with your spirit  When one has the misfortune to be engaged in a passion not to be gratified but by stratagems  what an advantage is it to secure on the right side a lad of so enterprising a genius as yourself  Courage  my friend  we have thrown a rival into the background  whose presence in the scene might have marred our comedy  So far  all is well  But as lovers are subject to strange vagaries  it seems to me that we must make short work of it  and bring Aurora de Guzman on the stage to morrow  The idea met with my entire approbation  so leaving Signor Don Felix with his page  I withdrew to bed in an adjoining closet    Note   Ivory fences   Should this phrase appear far fetched in the person of Gil Blas  it may be recollected  that though not much of a student himself  he had waited on students  and might have sucked in  while standing behind their chairs  along with  fates and destinies  and such old sayings  the sisters three  and such branches of learning   that exquisitely characteristic Greek metaphor     a hedge of teeth      TRANSLATOR     CH  VI     Aurora s devices to secure Don Lewis Pacheco s affections   THE two new friends met as soon as they came down
