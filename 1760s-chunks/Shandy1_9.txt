use to you  I insist upon it that you read the two following chapters  which contain such a sketch of his life and conversation  as will carry its moral along with it —When this is done  if nothing stops us in our way  we will go on with the midwife   CHAP  XI   YORICK was this parson s name  and  what is very remarkable in it   as appears from a most antient account of the family  wrote upon strong vellum   Page  50  and now in perfect preservation  it had been exactly so spelt for near —I was within an ace of saying nine hundred years —but I would not shake my credit in telling an improbable truth  however indisputable in itself —and therefore I shall content myself with only saying —It had been exactly so spelt  without the least variation or transposition of a single letter  for I do not know how long  which is more than I would venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom  which  in a course of years  have generally undergone as many chops and changes as their owners —Has this been owing to the pride  or to the shame of the respective proprietors —In honest truth  I think  sometimes to the one  and sometimes to the other  just as the temptation has wrought  But a villainous affair it is  and will one  Page  51  day so blend and confound us all together  that no one shall be able to stand up and swear   That his own great grand father was the man who did either this or that    This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of the Yorick s family  and their religious preservation of these records I quote  which do further inform us  That the family was originally of Danish extraction  and had been transplanted into England as early as in the reign ofHorwendillus  king of Denmark  in whose court it seems  an ancestor of this Mr  Yorick s  and from whom he was lineally descended  held a considerable post to the day of his death  Of what nature this considerable post was  this record saith not —it only adds  That  for near two centuries  it had been totally  Page  52  abolished as altogether unnecessary  not only in that court  but in every other court of the Christian world   It has often come into my head  that this post could be no other than that of the king s chief Jester —and that Hamlet s Yorick  in our Shakespear many of whose plays  you know  are founded upon authenticated facts —was certainly the very man   I have not the time to look into Saxo Grammaticus s Danish history  to know the certainty of this —but if you have leisure  and can easily get at the book  you may do it full as well yourself   I had just time  in my travels through Denmark with Mr  Noddy s eldest son  whom  in the year 1741  I accompanied  Page  53  as governor  riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro  most parts of Europe  and of which original journey perform d by us two  a most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this work  I had just time  I say  and that was all  to prove the truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that country —namely   That nature was neither very lavish  nor was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its inhabitants —but  like a discreet parent  was moderately kind to them all  observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her favours  as to bring them  in those points  pretty near to a level with each other  so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of refin d parts  but a great deal of good plain houshold understanding amongst all ranks of  Page  54  people  of which every body has a share   which is  I think  very right   With us  you see  the case is quite different —we are all ups and downs in this matter —you are a great genius —or  tis fifty to one  Sir  you are a great dunce and a blockhead —not that there is a total want of intermediate steps —no —we are not so irregular as that comes to —but the two extremes are more common  and in a greater degree in this unsettled island  where nature  in her gifts and dispositions of this kind  is most whimsical and capricious  fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her goods and chattels than she   This is all that ever stagger d my faith in regard to Yorick s extraction  who  by what I can remember of him  and by all  Page  55  the accounts I could ever get of him  seem d not to have had one single drop of Danish blood in his whole crasis  in nine hundred years  it might possibly have all run out —I will not philosophize one moment with you about it  for happen how it would  the fact was this —That instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of sense and humours  you
