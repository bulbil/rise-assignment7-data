first exploit  handled his weapon  with astonishing vigour and dexterity  without respect of persons  so  that few or none of them had escaped without marks of his displeasure   when his spirits failed  and he sank down again quite exhausted on his  bed  Favoured by this respite  the discomfited faculty collected their  hats and wigs  which had fallen off in the fray  and perceiving the  assailant too much enfeebled to renew the attack  set up their throats  together  and loudly threatened to prosecute him severely for such an  outrageous assault   By this time the landlord had interposed  and  inquiring into the  cause of the disturbance  was informed of what had happened by the  complainants  who  at the same time  giving him to understand that  they had been severally summoned to attend the colonel that morning  he  assured them that they had been imposed upon by some wag  for his lodger  had never dreamed of consulting any one of their profession   Thunderstruck at this declaration  the general clamour instantaneously  ceased  and each  in particular  at once comprehending the nature of  the joke  they sneaked silently off with the loss they had sustained  in  unutterable shame and mortification  while Peregrine and his friend  who  took care to be passing that way by accident  made a full stop at  sight of such an extraordinary efflux  and enjoyed the countenance and  condition of every one as he appeared  nay  even made up to some of  those who seemed most affected with their situation  and mischievously  tormented them with questions  touching this unusual congregation  then   in consequence of the information they received from the landlord and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the colonel s valet  subjected the sufferers to the ridicule of all the  company in town  As it would have been impossible for the authors of  this farce to keep themselves concealed from the indefatigable inquiries  of the physicians  they made no secret of their having directed the  whole  though they took care to own it in such an ambiguous manner  as  afforded no handle of prosecution   CHAPTER LXXI   Peregrine humbles a noted Hector  and meets with a strange Character at  the House of a certain Lady   Among those who never failed to reside at Bath during the season  was a  certain person  who  from the most abject misery  had  by his industry  and art at play  amassed about fifteen thousand pounds  and though his  character was notorious  insinuated himself so far into the favour  of what is called the best company  that very few private parties of  pleasure took place in which he was not principally concerned  He was  of a gigantic stature  a most intrepid countenance  and his disposition   naturally overbearing  had  in the course of his adventures and success   acquired a most intolerable degree of insolence and vanity  By the  ferocity of his features  and audacity of his behaviour  he had obtained  a reputation for the most undaunted courage  which had been confirmed by  divers adventures  in which he had humbled the most assuming heroes of  his own fraternity  so that he now reigned chief Hector of the place  with unquestioned authority   With this son of fortune was Peregrine one evening engaged at play  and  so successful  that he could not help informing his friend of his  good luck  Godfrey  hearing the description of the loser  immediately  recognized the person  whom he had known at Tunbridge  and  assuring  Pickle that he was a sharper of the first water  cautioned him against  any further connection with such a dangerous companion  who  he  affirmed  had suffered him to win a small sum  that he might be  encouraged to lose a much greater sum upon some other occasion   Our young gentleman treasured up this advice  and though he did not  scruple to give the gamester an opportunity of retrieving his loss  when  he next day demanded his revenge  he absolutely refused to proceed  after he had refunded his winning  The other  who considered him as  a hot headed unthinking youth  endeavoured to inflame his pride to a  continuance of the game  by treating his skill with scorn and contempt   and  among other sarcastic expressions  advised him to go to school  again  before he pretended to engage with masters of the art  Our hero   incensed at his arrogance  replied with great warmth  that he knew  himself sufficiently qualified for playing with men of honour  who deal  upon the square  and hoped he should always deem it infamous either  to learn or practise the tricks of a professed gamester   Blood and  thunder  meaning me  sir   cried this artist  raising his voice  and  curling his visage into a most intimidating frown   Zounds  I ll cut the  throat of any scoundrel who has the presumption to suppose that I don t  play as honourably as e er a nobleman in the kingdom  and I insist upon    6
