with whom he had communication   But these affected airs being assumed in despite of nature  he appeared as aukward as a native of Angola  when he is first hampered with cloaths  or a Highlander  obliged by act of parliament to wear breeches —Indeed  the distance observed by Yakstrot in his behaviour to the nobles of Niphon  was imputed to his being conscious of a sulphureous smell which came from his own body  so that greater familiarity on his side might have bred contempt  He took delight in no other conversation but that of two or three obscure Ximians  his companions and counsellors  with whom he spent all his   121 leisure time  in conferences upon politics  patriotism  philosophy  and the Belles Lettres  Those were the oracles he consulted in all the emergencies of state  and with these he spent many an Attic evening   The gods  not yet tired of sporting with the farce of human government  were still resolved to shew by what inconsiderable springs a mighty empire may be moved  The new Cuboy was vastly well disposed to make his Ximian favourites great men  It was in his power to bestow places and pensions upon them  but it was not in his power to give them consequence in the eyes of the public  The administration of Yakstrot could not fail of being propitious to his own family  and poor relations  who were very numerous  Their naked backs and hungry bellies were now clothed with the richest stuffs  and fed with the fat things   122 of Japan  Every department civil and military was filled with Ximians  Those islanders came over in shoals to Niphon  and swarmed in the streets of Meaco  where they were easily distinguished by their lank sides  gaunt looks  lanthornjaws  and long sharp teeth —There was a fatality that attended the whole conduct of this unfortunate Cuboy  His very partiality to his own countrymen  brought upon him at last the curses of the whole clan   Mr  Orator Taycho and his kinsman Lob kob were not idle in the mean time  They provided their emissaries  and primed all their engines  Their understrappers filled every corner of Meaco with rumours  jealousies  and suspicions  Yak strot was represented as a statesman without discernment  a minister without knowledge  and a man without humanity  He was taxed with insupportable   123 pride  indiscretion  pusillanimity  rapacity  partiality  and breach of faith  It was affirmed that he had dishonoured the nation  and endangered the very existence of the Buponian religion  in withdrawing the annual subsidy from the great Brut an tiffi  that he wanted to starve the war  and betray the glory and advantage of the empire by a shameful peace  that he had avowedly shared his administration with the greatest knave in Japan  that he treated the nobles of Niphon with insolence and contempt  that he had suborned evidence against the antient Cuboy Fika kaka  who had spent a long life and an immense fortune in supporting the temple of Fak ku basi  that he had cruelly turned adrift a great number of helpless families  in order to gratify his own worthless dependants with their spoils  that he had enriched his relations and   124 countrymen with the plunder of Niphon  that his intention was to bring over the whole nation of Ximians  a savage race  who had been ever perfidious  greedy  and hostile towards the natives of the other Japonese islands  Nay  they were described as monsters in nature  with cloven feet  long tails  saucer eyes  iron fangs and claws  who would first devour the substance of the Niphonites  and then feed upon their blood   Taycho had Legion s understanding so much in his power  that he actually made it believe Yak strot had formed a treasonable scheme in favour of a foreign adventurer who pretended to the throne of Japan  and that the reigning Dairo was an accomplice in this project for his own deposition  Indeed  they did not scruple to say that Gio gio was no more than a puppet moved by his own grandmother and this vile Ximian    125 between whom they hinted there was a secret correspondence which reflected very little honour on the family of the Dairo   Mr  Orator Taycho and his associate Lob kob left no stone unturned to disgrace the favourite  and drive him from the helm  They struck up an alliance with the old Cuboy Fika kaka  and fetching him from his retirement  produced him to the beast as a martyr to loyalty and virtue  They had often before this period  exposed him to the derision of the populace  but now they set him up as the object of veneration and esteem  and every thing succeeded to their wish  Legion hoisted Fika kaka on his back  and paraded through the streets of Meaco  braying hoarse encomiums on the great talents and great virtues of the antient Cuboy  His cause was now espoused by his old friends Stiphi rum poo   126 and Nin kom poo poo  who had been turned adrist along with him  and by several other Quos who had nestled themselves in warm places under the shadow of his protection  but it was remarkable  that not one of all the Bonzes who owed their preferment to his favour  had gratitude enough to sollow his fortune  or pay the least respect to
