 that she will not stay  unless I take in her sister and brother  yet will not go  because she will then have no more than the 150l  a year  And that is too much for her deserts for these two years past   Your Lordship sees the inconveniencies of this way of life  and I need not mention to you  how   68 much happier that state is  which binds a man and woman together by interest  as well as by affection  if discretion be not forgotten in the choice  But let me express my surprize  that your Lordship  who has so ample an estate  and no child should seem to value your peace of mind at so low a rate as 100l  a year   I will not let her go away with such a triumph  She has not deserved from me—  Pray  my Lord  was she of reputation when you took her   She was a widow—  But was her character tolerable in the eye of the world  She might be a greater object of pity for being a widow   My gouty disorders made me want a woman about me  I hated men fellows—  Well  my Lord  this regards your motive  But have you any previous or later incontinence to charge her with   I can t say I have  Her cursed temper would frighten  rather than invite  Lovers  I heard  it was no good one  but it broke not out to me till within these two years   Your Lordship  surely  must not dispute the matter with her  If you are determined to part with her  give her the 250l  a year  and let her go   To reward a cursed woman for misbehaviour —I cannot do it   Give me leave to say  that your Lordship has deserved some punishment  Give her the annuity  not as a reward to her  but as a punishment to yourself   You hurt my sore place  nephew   Consider  my Lord  that 250l  a year for life  or even for ever  is a poor price  for the reputation of a woman with whom a man of your quality and fortune condescended to enter into treaty  Every quarterly payment must strike her to the heart  if she live to have compunction seize her  when she thinks that she   69 is receiving  for subsistence  the wages of her shame  Be that her punishment  You intimate  that she has so behaved herself  that she has but few friends  Part with her  without giving her cause of complaint  that may engage pity for her  if not friends  at your expence  A woman who has lost her reputation  will not be regardful of yours  Suppose she sue you for non performance of covenants  Would your Lordship appear to such a prosecution  You cannot be capable of pleading your privilege on such a prosecution as would otherwise go against you  You cannot be in earnest to part with this woman  she cannot have offended you beyond forgiveness  if you scruple 100l  a year to get rid of her   He servently swore  that he was in earnest  and added  I am resolved  nephew  to marry  and live honest   He looked at me  as if he expected that I should be surprised   I believe I could not change countenance  on such an hint as this  You have come to a good resolution  my Lord  and if you marry a prudent woman  your Lordship will find the difference in your own reflexions  as well as in your reputation and interest  And shall the difference of 100l  a year—Don t let me say  that I am ashamed for my Lord W   I knew that you would despise me  Sir Charles   I know  my Lord  that I should despise myself  were I not to deal freely with you in this respect  Indeed  my Lord  you have not had so good reason  forgive me   to think hardly of my father s spirit  as you had to correct your own   I cannot bear this  nephew  He looked displeased   You must not be angry  my Lord  I will not bear anger from any man breathing  and keep him company  who  consulting me  shall be displeased with me for speaking my mind with freedom and sincerity     70 What a man am I talking to —Well  rid me of this torment  You have spirit  nephew  and nobody can reproach you with acting contrary to your own principles  and I will for ever love you  But talk to her  I hardly dare  She whimpers and sobs  and threatens  by turns  and I cannot bear it —Once she was going to tie herself up—Would to God I had not prevented her—And then  O my folly   we went on again   My good Dr  Bartlett  I was ashamed of my uncle  But you see what an artful  as well as insolent woman  this is  What solly is there in wickedness  Folly encounters with folly  or how could it succeed so often as it does —Yet my mother s brother
