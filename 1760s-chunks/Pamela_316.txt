brought upon your judgment  I   won t be long before I see you  added she  I ll assure you  if I come by   myself  That shall be your own fault  madam  said Mrs  Brooks       And so they took leave  and I gave my hand to my dear master  and said    How happy have you made me  generous sir   And the dean  who had just   come up  heard me  and said  And how happy you have made your spouse    I ll venture to pronounce  is hard to say  from what I observe of you   both  I courtesied  and blushed  not thinking any body heard me  And my   master telling him he should be glad of the honour of a visit from him    he said  He would pay his respects to us the first opportunity  and   bring his wife and daughter to attend me  I said  That was doubly kind    and I should be very proud of cultivating so worthy an acquaintance  I   thanked him for his kind discourse  and he thanked me for my attention    which he called exemplary  and so my dear master handed me into the   chariot  and we were carried home  both happy  and both pleased  thank   God       Mr  Martin came in the evening  with another gentleman  his friend  one   Mr  Dormer  and he entertained us with the favourable opinion  he said    every one had of me  and of the choice my good benefactor had made       This morning the poor came  according to my invitation  and I sent them   away with glad hearts to the number of twenty five  There were not above   twelve or fourteen on Sunday  that John divided the silver among  which   I gave him for that purpose  but others got hold of the matter  and made   up to the above number          Tuesday       My generous master has given me  this morning  a most considerate  but   yet  from the nature of it  melancholy instance of his great regard for   my unworthiness  which I never could have wished  hoped for  or even   thought of       He took a walk with me  after breakfast  into the garden  and a little   shower falling  he led me  for shelter  into the little summer house    in the private garden  where he formerly gave me apprehensions  and    sitting down by me  he said  I have now finished all that lies on my   mind  my dear  and am very easy  For have you not wondered  that I have   so much employed myself in my library  Been so much at home  and yet not   in your company   No  sir  said I  I have never been so impertinent as   to wonder at any thing you please to employ yourself about  nor would   give way to a curiosity that should be troublesome to you  And  besides    I know your large possessions  and the method you take of looking   yourself into your affairs  must needs take up so much of your time    that I ought to be very careful how I intrude upon you       Well  said he  but I ll tell you what has been my last work I have taken   it into my consideration  that  at present  my line is almost extinct    and that the chief part of my maternal estate  in case I die without   issue  will go to another line  and great part of my personal will fall   into such hands  as I shall not care my Pamela should be at the   mercy of  I have  therefore  as human life is uncertain  made such a   disposition of my affairs  as will make you absolutely independent and   happy  as will secure to you the power of doing a great deal of good    and living as a person ought to do  who is my relict  and shall put   it out of any body s power to molest your father and mother  in the   provision I design them  for the remainder of their days  And I have   finished all this very morning  except to naming trustees for you  and   if you have any body you would confide in more than another  I would   have you speak       I was so touched with this mournful instance of his excessive goodness   to me  and the thoughts necessarily flowing from the solemn occasion    that I was unable to speak  and at last relieved my mind by a violent   fit of weeping  and could only say  clasping my arms
