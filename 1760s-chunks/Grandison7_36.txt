 And sometimes I trembled at the thought  for I looked back  and said to myself    Wouldst thou  Emily  a year ago  have allowed in thyself but the same lengths that thou hast now run    —No  answered I my own question    Is not this a fair warning of what may be a year hence    —So I put a case  to Dr  Bartlett  as of three persons of my Anne s acquaintance  two young women  one young man  living in one house  The young man contracted to one of the young women  the other knowing it  and tho  a person incapable of a criminal thought  yet finding an increasing regard for the young man  tho  she dearly loved her friend  began to be afraid her heart was not quite as it should be  What  I asked  as for my Anne s friend  would he advise in the case     And what  my dear  was the Doctor s advice   I was a silly creature to put it to him  As I said  he certainly must guess  If you  madam  could without such a case put  he certainly must  We young girls think  if we put our hands before our eyes  nobody can see us  In short  the Doctor pronounced the increasing regard to be a beginning Love  The consequence would be  that the young woman would in time endeavour to supplant her friend  tho  at present she might probably shudder at the thought  He bid me tell Anne to warn her acquaintance against the growing flame  He said  she might entangle her   91 own heart  and without gaining her end  render unhappy a couple  who  according to my representation from my Anne  deserved to be happy  And he advised  by all means  that she should leave the contracted couple to themselves  and for her own honour s  her own heart s sake  remove to as great distance from them as possible   Believe me  madam  I was shocked  I was frighted at myself  I threw the papers in the fire  and have been  ever since I read them  more unhappy than usual  My dear Lady Grandison  then thought I  I will  if you give me encouragement  open my heart to you  You will hear of my folly  my weakness  one day or other —And now  dear good madam  forgive me  Keep my secret  and advise me what to do   What  my dearest creature  can I advise you  I love you  I ever will love you  I will be as careful of your honour as of my own  I will endeavour to cultivate your guardian s affection to you   He never  madam  I hope  guessed at the poor Emily s folly   He never mentioned you to me  but with love and tenderness   Thank God —But say  advise me  madam  my heart shall be in your hand  guide it  as you please   What  my dear  did you think of doing yourself   I must not think of living with you now  madam   Why not  You shall find me ever your true friend   But I am sure Dr  Bartlett s advice to Anne s acquaintance is right  I tell you  madam  that I must every day  and every hour of the day  that I see his tender behaviour to you  that I behold him employed in acts of beneficence  that I see every one adoring him  admire him more  I see that I am less my own mistress than I thought it was possible I could be  And if such a girl as I  have so little command of myself  and his merit every hour spreading itself out before me with increasing lustre  my weak eyes will   92 not be able to bear his glory—O madam  I ought to fly  I am resolved  whatever it cost me to fly   How I admired  how I pitied  how I loved  the dear creature  I clasped both my arms about her  and pressing her to my bosom—What can I say  my Emily  What can I say  Tell me  what would you wish me to say   You are wise  madam  You have a tender and generous heart  O that I were half as good —Advise me something—I see the folly of my wishing to live with you and my guardian   And is it necessary  my dear  to a conquest of yourself  that we should not live together   Absolutely so  I am convinced of it   Suppose  my dear  you go to the London house  and put yourself under Mrs  Grandison s protection   What  madam  my guardian s house still   I hope a few weeks absence  by help of a discretion of which you have  in the present conversation  given shining proofs  will answer all we wish  since you never  my dear  could have thought but of admiring  and that at distance  the great qualities of your guardian   I
