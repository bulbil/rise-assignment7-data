Mrs Gerrarde has eloped from her husband  and is now at Paris in quality of mistress to a young nobleman who maintains her in vast splendour  I had this news in a letter from Mrs Faulkland to day   Poor Pivet wrote his master an account of it  You know the agreement to pay this young man an annual sum was conditional  Upon Mr Arnold’s death  Pivet tired of the termagant spirit  and intolerable coquetry of his wife  was very glad to relax his discipline  and declared  were he to have had a thousand a year  he would not undertake to keep her within bounds  and that nothing but his great respect for Mr Faulkland could have engaged him in the task so long  He acknowleges that he is very glad to be rid of her  and as Mr Faulkland enabled him to set up very handsomely in his business  I really think he is happy in his loss   March 14  I have been deeply affected  my Cecilia  within these two days  If it had not been in my power to relieve the distress I have been a witness    to  how unhappy would it have made me   I was stepping out of my chariot yesterday morning  when a young woman who stood at my door  in an old linnen gown  presented to me a little band box  open and filled with artificial flowers  she spoke not  but the silent anguish in her looks drew my attention  She seemed about eighteen  and very pretty  As an appearance of industry I think doubles the claim which the poor have to our compassion  I took out of her box a small sprig of jessamin  very naturally imitated  and asked the young woman if she made those flowers herself   She modestly replied  she did  And cannot you  child  said I  find any one who would give you constant employment in this way to prevent your wandering about in the streets to dispose of your work   She answered  Yes  Madam  but I have a poor decrepid father in jail  who cannot be without my assistance  I live with him  and only come out once a week to sell my flowers  I might go to service  but he would die if I were to leave him  Her gentle speech  her youth  and the unaffected tender sorrow that appeared in her face  when she spoke of her father  touched me to the heart   I bade her come in  and taking her into the parlour  was desirous to ask her some questions   You look  said I  as if you had not been bred in poverty  pray what is your father   She blushed  and with down cast eyes replied  A clergyman  Madam   A clergyman  I repeated  what misfortunes  for such I must suppose they were  drove him to the distressed situation you mention   It was a misfortune  Madam  and not any crime  answered the girl  with tears in her eyes  my father is as good a man as ever was born   I asked his name  and she told me it was Price   My curiosity was excited by her manner  I desired her to sit down  and relate to me the particulars of her story   She obeyed with a sensible politeness that pleased me   About twelve years ago  said she  my father had a little cure in Berkshire  he was reckoned a fine preacher and a very great scholar  and what was more than either  one of the best of men  In the parish to which my father belonged  lived a gentleman of a very great estate  his name was Ware  he was himself a very worthy man  and had so high an opinion of my father  that he pitched upon him to go abroad in quality of governor to his only son  then a youth of about nineteen  As my father had travelled in the same capacity once before  he was very well qualified for the employment  and had no objection to the    acceptance of it but his leaving my mother  of whom he was very fond  and me his only child  then scarcely more than an infant  The elder Mr Ware assured him he would be a friend and guardian to us both  and so he was  and that he would  in his absence  allow us double the income which my father received from his cure   This  together with the appointment  which he was to receive as his son’s governor was too handsome an offer to be refused  especially as the gentleman promised he should never want a patron in him while he lived  and every body knew he had interest enough to make this promise of consequence  My father was then past fifty  but as he was of a very healthy strong constitution  he did not think it too late to undertake  for the good of his family  what he said was a very troublesome task   I could not help interrupting the young gentlewoman to ask her how it came to pass that her father  such a man as she represented him to be  was no better provided for at this time of life  especially as
