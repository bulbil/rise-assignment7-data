my compliments to her  as every genteel family in the neighbourhood did  and I own I never saw    her without feeling myself shocked to death at the thoughts of the injury I did her  for I really believe Mrs Arnold is a very well meaning woman   Oh  thou scorpion  muttered I to myself  and yet thou hast pursued her to affliction and ruin   That Mrs Arnold is a well meaning woman  said I coldly  I have no doubt  yet you see Mr Arnold’s opinion of her virtue was not strong enough to be proof against suspicions  for it is most certain  that  if he had not given credit to your representations of his wife’s conduct  he would not have gone such lengths as to have parted with her  for Arnold had always some regard to appearances  My representations  Sir  with a look of astonishment  pray do not lay more to my charge than I deserve  what the particular reasons were  which induced Mr Arnold to part with his wife  I will not say  but whatever his suspicions were  they never took their rise from me   I found she intended to brazen this denial out  but as it was absolutely necessary to my design to bring her to a confession of this particular act of perfidy  I resolved to lead her into it in such a way as should be least mortifying to her pride   Come  come  my dear Mrs Gerrarde  said I  I know you are above concealing any past failings that you are resolved to mend  I know very well that it was your insinuations  and your’s only  that kindled the fire of jealousy in Arnold’s breast  Such arts are not uncommon in lovers  You loved him then  and wished to have him intirely to yourself  and a wife  though a forsaken one  is still intitled to so much attention from her husband  as a fond mistress may think robs her of too much  I know this was the case  and it is natural  but were you not an unmerciful little tyrant to involve me in the mischief  and put it into the man’s noddle  that I had designs upon his wife   The easy manner in which I affected to speak of this affair  seemed to reconcile her a little to the charge  but the last part of it  which regarded myself  struck her all of a heap  She had no notion that I knew it  She was going to speak  to deny the accusation I suppose  and therefore I prevented her  and taking her by the hand  Come now  said I  deal with me ingenuously  and if you persuade me that you are really in earnest  and mean to repair those little lapses which you have inconsiderately been led into  tell me truly  did you really believe that I ever had any thoughts of an amour with Mrs Arnold   I chose to give my inquiry this turn  that she might  with less shame to herself  by laying hold on the hint  acknowlege her guilt     She hesitated for an answer  and I guessed she was considering whether to persist in denying the whole charge against her  or avail herself of the handle I had given her  and make a sort of merit of her sincerity  by pretending to believe what she was thoroughly convinced there was not the least foundation even to suspect  but what her own wicked suggestions had encouraged in the unfortunate Arnold  Her silence  thus rightly interpreted by me  made me go on  You see I know all your secrets  and you are not the woman I take you for  if you conceal your real sentiments in this particular  more of my quiet depends on it than you are aware of  and I withdrew my hand from her’s with a serious and almost resenting air   She appeared disturbed  and in a good deal of confusion  but recovering herself  Why really  Mr Faulkland  I can’t say but I had some suspicion of what you mention  I was no stranger to your fondness for Mrs Arnold before she was married  and there was nothing very surprising in a disappointed lover’s renewing his hopes  when he thought the neglect which a lady met with from her husband  might incline her to be less obdurate to a man she was once known to favour so much   This was enough  I did not think it by any means necessary to press her to a farther explanation  what she said was a sufficient acknowlegement of her fault  though the cunning sorceress had turned the hint  which I had thrown out on purpose  to her own advantage  and had the affrontery to avow an opinion which had never before entered into her imagination   I found it necessary now to carry on the farce  by assuring her  I had never entertained a thought to Mrs Arnold’s dishonour  and that though I made no great scruple of robbing a man of his mistress  yet I thought it a crime of the blackest dye to deprive him of the affection or fidelity of his wife   The serious manner in which I spoke this a little disconcerted Mrs Gerrarde  Well  said she  I can only say  that I am very
