 he is always contriving new scenes of pleasure  and hurries me from one to the other  I do not wish to be perpetually fluttering about  The calm domestic life you know was always my choice  but I will not oppose my kind Mr Arnold in his fond desire of pleasing me  besides  I find that by his constantly gallanting me to public places  he begins himself to acquire a sort of relish for them  which he did not use to have  at least his prudence made him so to conform to the necessity of his circumstances  while his fortune was small  that he never indulged himself in any of the fashionable expensive amusements  nor does he now in any  but such as I partake of with him  I find he is by nature open and liberal to excess  I must take care  without his being conscious of it  to be a gentle check upon his bounteous spirit  I mean only so far as it regards myself  indeed this is the most material point  for in every other instance his generosity is regulated by prudence  I am every hour more obliged to him  and should hate myself if I did not find that he had an intire possession of my love     Sir George hardly ever comes near us but by formal invitation  and then his behaviour to Mr Arnold is so very civil  and so very distant  that it mortifies me exceedingly  Mr Arnold cannot but perceive it  but either his tenderness for me makes him take no notice of it  or else  not being well enough acquainted with my brother to know his disposition  he may impute his coldness to his natural temper   My mother says  he never names Mr Faulkland or Miss Burchell to her  I wish Sir George could entirely forget that unhappy affair   February 1  There is a story propagated by the widow Arnold  about the meeting between her and her husband  the circumstances of which are as follows  She says  she had dined one day in the city  and was returning home to her lodgings in York buildings in a hackney coach  that the driver  by his carelessness in coming along the Strand  had one of his fore wheels taken off by a Waggon  which accident obliged her to alight  the footboy  who was behind the coach  had by the jolt been thrown off  and received a hurt  which made it necessary to have him carried into a shop for assistance  That the lady herself  being no otherwise injured than by a little fright  found that she was so near home  that she did not think it worth while to wait for another carriage  but pursued her way on foot  It was a fine dry evening  about nine o’clock  and though there was no light but what the lamps afforded  yet as the streets were full of people  she had no apprehensions of danger   In this situation she was accosted by two gentlemen  who  seeing a lady well dressed and alone  insisted on seeing her safe to her lodgings  However disagreeable such an encounter was  she said she did not give herself much concern about it  as she was so near home  and expected to shake off her new acquaintance at the door of the house where she lodged  and accordingly  when she got there  she told them she was at home  and wished them a good night  but the impertinents were not so easily to be put off  The door having been opened by the maid of the house  they both rushed in  her landlady  a single woman  happened to be abroad and there was no man in the house   Mrs Arnold thought she had no way left  but to run up to her dining room  and lock herself in  but in this she was prevented  as the gentlemen  whom the servant of the house vainly endeavoured to oppose  got up stairs almost as soon as she did  Her own maid  on    hearing the rap at the door  had lighted candles in the dining room  the two sparks entered with her  but how was she surprized to find that one of them was her husband  Her fright  she said  had prevented her from discovering this sooner  as she had not looked in either of their faces  though there was a light in the hall  and Mr Arnold’s being half drunk  she supposed  was the reason of his not perceiving sooner who she was   The astonishment that they both were in  and the exclamation that each made in their turn  soon informed the companion of Mr Arnold who the lady was  He congratulated them both on this fortunate mistake  and saying  since chance had been so propitious to Mr Arnold as to throw him into the arms of so charming a woman  he hoped his discovering her to be his wife would not render her the less agreeable to him  but that this unexpected meeting might be a means of re uniting them in their former amity   Mr Arnold  she says  in the presence of this gentleman  advanced with open arms to embrace her  which she not declining  his friend having again felicitated them on their reconciliation  took his leave
