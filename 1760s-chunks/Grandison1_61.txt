I this taste for foreign performances and compositions from Mr  Greville  for so long time as thou hast been a downright country gentleman    Indeed  thought I to myself  you seem both to have changed characters  But I know how it comes about  Let one advance what he will  in the present humour   147 of both  the other will contradict it  Mr  Greville knows nothing of music  What he said was from hearsay  And Sir Hargrave is no better grounded in it    A downright country gentleman  repeated Mr  Greville  measuring Sir Hargrave with his eye  and putting up his lip   Why  pr ythee now  Greville  thou What shall I call thee  thou art not offended  I hope  that we are not all of one mind  Ha  ha  ha  hah   I am offended at nothing you say  Sir Hargrave   Nor I at any thing you look  my dear  Ha  ha  ha  hah   Yet his looks shewed as much contempt for Mr  Greville  as Mr  Greville s did for him  How easily might these combustible spirits have blown each other up  Mr  Reeves was once a little apprehensive of consequences from the airs of both   Mr  Greville turned from Sir Hargrave to me  Well  Miss Byron  said he  but as to what we were talking about   This he seemed to say  on purpose  as I thought by his air  to alarm the baronet   I beg pardon  said Sir Hargrave  turning with a stiff air to me  I beg pardon  Miss Byron  if I have intruded—  We were talking of indifferent things  Sir Hargrave  answered I—Mere matters of pleasantry   I was more in earnest than in jest  Miss Byron  replied Mr  Greville   We all  I believe  thought you very whimsical  Mr  Greville  returned I   What was sport to you  madam  is death to me   Poor Greville  Ha  ha  ha  hah  affectedly laughed the baronet   But I know you are a joker  You are a man of wit  This a little softened Mr  Greville  who had begun to look grave upon Sir Hargrave  Come  pr ythee  man  give thyself up to me for this night  and I will carry thee to a private concert  where none   148 but choice spirits are admitted  and let us see if music will not divert these gloomy airs  that sit so ill upon the face of one of the liveliest men in the kingdom   Music  Ay  if Miss Byron will give us a song  and accompany it with the harpsichord  I will despise all other harmony   Every one joined in his request  And I was not backward to oblige them  as I thought the conversation bore a little too rough a cast  and was not likely to take a smoother turn   Mr  Greville  who always enjoys any jest that tends to reflect on our Sex  begged me to sing that whimsical song set by Galliard  which once my uncle made me sing at Selby house  in Mr  Greville s hearing  You were not there  Lucy  that day  and perhaps may not have the book  as Galliard is not a favourite with you   CHLOE  by all the pow rs above   To Damon vow d eternal Love   A rose adorn d her sweeter breast   She on a leaf the vow imprest   But Zephyr  by her side at play   Love  vow  and leaf  blew quite away   The gentlemen were very lively on the occasion  and encored it  But I told them  That as they must be better pleased with the jest on our Sex contained in it  than they could be with the music  I would not  for the sake of their own politeness  oblige them   You will favour us  however  with your Discreet Lover  Miss Byron  said Mr  Greville  That is a song written entirely on your own principles   Well then I will give you  said I  set by the same hand   THE DISCREET LOVER   Ye fair  that would be blest in Love   Take your pride a little lower   Let the swain whom you approve   Rather like you  than adore      149 Love  that rises into passion   Soon will end in hate or strife   But from tender inclination   Flow the lasting joys of life   These two light pieces put the gentlemen into good humour  and a deal of silly stuff was said to me  by way of compliment  on the occasion  by Sir Hargrave and Mr  Greville  not one word of which I believed   The baronet went away first  to go to his concert  He was very cold in his behaviour to me at taking leave  as he had been all the time   Mr  Greville soon after left us  intending to set out this morning   He snatched my hand at going  I was afraid
