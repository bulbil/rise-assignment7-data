Lordship thinks I have injured you  take your revenge      And now  that I am at Naples  let me say  that if you are determined  contrary to all my hopes  to accompany me to Rome  or elsewhere  on my return  with an unfriendly purpose  such  and no other  shall be my behaviour to you  if the power be given me to shew it  I will rely on my own innocence  and hope by generosity to overcome a generous man  Let the guilty secure themselves by violence and murder   Superlative pride  angrily said he  and stood still  measuring me with his eye  And could you hope for such an advantage   While I  my Lord  was calm  and determined only upon self defence  while you were passionate  and perhaps rash  as aggressors generally are  I did not doubt it  But could I have avoided drawing  and preserved your good opinion  I would not have drawn  Your Lordship cannot but know my principles   Grandison  I do know them  and also the general report in your favour for skill and courage  Do you think I would have heard with patience of the once proposed alliance  had not your character—And then he was pleased to say many things in my favour    365 from the report of persons who had weight with him  some of whom he named   But still  Grandison  said he  this poor girl—She could not have been so deeply affected  had not some Lover like arts—  Let me  my Lord  interrupt you—I cannot bear an imputation of this kind  Had such arts been used  the Lady could not have been so much affected  Cannot you think of your noble sister  as a daughter of the two houses from which you sprang▪ Cannot you see her  as by Mrs  Beaumont s means we now so lately have been able to see her  struggling nobly with her own heart  Why am I put upon this tender subject   because of her duty and her religion  and resolved to die rather than encourage a wish that was not warranted by both —I cannot  my Lord  urge this subject  But there never was a passion so nobly contended with  There never was a man more disinterested  and so circumstanced  Remember only  my voluntary departure from Bologna  against persuasion  and the great behaviour of your sister on that occasion  great  as it came out to be  when Mrs  Beaumont brought her to acknowlege what would have been my glory to have kown  could it have been encouraged  but is now made my heaviest concern   Indeed  Grandison  she ever was a noble girl  We are too apt perhaps to govern ourselves by events  without looking into causes  But the access you had to her  such a man  and who became known to us from circumstances so much in his favour  both as a man of principle and bravery—  This  my Lord  interrupted I  is still judging from events  You have seen Mrs  Beaumont s Letter  Surely you cannot have a nobler monument of magnanimity in woman  And to that I refer  for a proof of my own integrity   I have that Letter  Jeronymo gave it me  at my   366 taking leave of him  and with these words     Grandison will certainly visit you at Naples  I am afraid of your warmth  His spirit is well known  All my dependance is upon his principles  He will not draw but in his own defence  Cherish the noble visiter  Surely  brother  I may depend upon your hospitable temper  Read over again this Letter  before you see him    —I have not yet read it  proceeded the General  but I will  and that  if you will allow me  now     He took it out of his pocket  walked from me  and read it  and then came to me  and took my hand—I am half ashamed of myself  my dear Grandison  I own I wanted magnanimity  All the distresses of our family  on this unhappy grirl s account  were before my eyes  and I received you  I behaved to you  as the author of them  I was contriving to be dissatisfied with you  Forgive me  and command my best services  I will let our Jeronymo know how greatly you subdued me before I had recourse to the Letter  but that I have since read that part of it which accounts for my sister s passion  and wish I had read it with equal attention before  I acquit you  I am proud of my sister  Yet I observe from this very Letter  that Jeronymo s gratitude has contributed to the evil we deplore  But—Let us not say one word more of the unhappy girl  It is painful to me to talk of her   Not ask a question  my Lord —  Don t  Grandison  don t —Jeronymo and Clementina are my soul s woe—But they are not worse than might be apprehended  You go to court with me to morrow  I will present you to the king   I have had that honour
