own mother  who was said to be at the point of  death  A gentlewoman  one night  was taken in labour on my threshold  At  another time I was disturbed with the cry of murder in the street  and  once I was alarmed by a false fire  But  being still upon my guard  I  baffled all their attempts  and thought myself quite secure from their  invention  when one of those bloodhounds  inspired  I believe  by the  devil himself  contrived a snare by which I was at last entrapped  He  made it his business to inquire into the particulars of my traffic  and   understanding that  among other things  there were several chests of  Florence entered at the custom house on my behalf  he ordered himself  to be enclosed in a box of the same dimensions  with air holes in the  bottom  for the benefit of breathing  and marked upon the cover  and   being conveyed to my door in a cart  among other goods  was  in his  turn  hoisted up to my warehouse  where I stood with a hammer  in order  to open the chests  that I might compare the contents with the invoice   You may guess my surprise and consternation  when  upon uncovering the  box  I saw a bailiff rearing up his head  like Lazarus from the grave   and heard him declare that he had a writ against me for a thousand  pounds  Indeed  I aimed the hammer at his head  but  in the hurry of my    6 22 15  3 45 PM   confusion  missed my mark  before I could repeat the blow  he started  up with great agility  and executed his office in sight of several  evidences whom he had assembled in the street for that purpose  so that  I could not possibly disentangle myself from the toil without incurring  an escape warrant  from which I had no protection  But  had I known  the contents of the chest  by all that s good  I would have ordered my  porter to raise it up as high as the crane would permit  and then have  cut the rope by accident     That expedient   said the knight with the red ribbon   would have  discouraged him from such hazardous attempts for the future  and would  have been an example in terrorem of all his brethren  The story puts me  in mind of a deliverance achieved by Tom Hackabout  a very stout  honest  fellow  an old acquaintance of mine  who had been so famous for  maiming bailiffs  that another gentleman having been ill used at a  spunging house  no sooner obtained his liberty  than  with a view of  being revenged upon the landlord  he  for five shillings  bought one of  Tom s notes  which sold at a very large discount  and  taking out a writ  upon it  put it into the hands of the bailiff who had used him ill  The  catchpole  after a diligent search  had an opportunity of executing the  writ upon the defendant  who  without ceremony  broke one of his arms   fractured his skull  and belaboured him in such a manner  that he lay  without sense or motion on the spot  By such exploits  this hero became  so formidable  that no single bailiff would undertake to arrest him   so that he appeared in all public places untouched  At length  however   several officers of the Marshalsea court entered into a confederacy  against him  and two of the number  attended by three desperate  followers  ventured to arrest him one day in the Strand  near  Hungerford market  He found it impossible to make resistance  because  the whole gang sprung upon him at once  like so many tigers  and  pinioned his arms so fast  that he could not wag a finger  Perceiving  himself fairly overpowered  he desired to be conducted forthwith to  jail  and was stowed in a boat accordingly  by the time they had  reached the middle of the river  he found means to overset the wherry  by accident  and every man  disregarding the prisoner  consulted his own  safety  As for Hackabout  to whom that element was quite familiar  he  mounted astride upon the keel of the boat  which was uppermost  and  exhorted the bailiffs to swim for their lives  protesting before God   that they had no other chance to be saved    The watermen were immediately taken up by some of their own friends   who  far from yielding any assistance to the catchpoles  kept aloof  and  exulted in their calamity  In short  two of the five went to the bottom   and never saw the light of God s sun  and the other three  with  great difficulty  saved themselves by laying hold on the rudder of a  dung barge  to which they were carried by the stream  while Tom   with great deliberation  swam across to the Surrey shore  After this  achievement  he was
