by this time learnt to forgive human frailties  nay  we forgave enormities—Unkind brother  to rake up the unfortunate ashes of my beloved  We have  indeed  learnt to forgive human frailties  but they were the frailties of a husband  a repenting husband  who was seduced to the commission of those crimes which he abhorred  but surely that is no plea for my overlooking the faults of another  to whom I am under no such tie  I am now without fortune  and incumbered with children  Indelicate man  does he think that an argument in favour of his proposal  It is a strong one against it  Shall I  who  when I was in the virgin bloom of youth  flattered with some advantages of person  which time and grief have since impaired  and not destitute of fortune  I  who then rejected Mr Faulkland from motives which still subsist  shall I  now that I have lost those advantages  meanly condescend to accept of this rejected man  This would  indeed  be acknowleging  that the humiliating change had levelled me to those principles which I formerly contemned  would lay me under mortifying obligations to Mr Faulkland  and destroy the merit of that refusal which proceeded from such justifiable motives   No  my sordid brother  if I could recompence Mr Faulkland as he deserves at my hands  I would do it  but  with such a mind as I bear  it cannot be done your way  I say nothing of the promise I made Miss Burchell  if I had never made her such  my sentiments would be the    same from those other considerations  but such a promise  binding as it is  determined my conduct beyond the possibility of a doubt   How unreasonable are Sir George’s prejudices with regard to this unhappy young creature  He is for ever throwing out some invective against her  It is cruel  but I am tempted to forgive him  as I know it proceeds from his attachment to his friend  He need not put me in mind of the gratitude I owe Mr Faulkland  I am thoroughly sensible of it  but Sir George and I differ widely in our ideas of expressing this gratitude  My conduct in this affair is to determine him as to the light in which he is hereafter to consider me  Why  be it so  He has long lost the tenderness of a brother for me  I will not regain it at the expence of my honour  I know the worst that can befall me is poverty  I have already experienced almost every possible ill in life but that  and for that I am prepared  But I will not call myself poor while I have an upright heart to support me  and the means  poor and despicable as they are  of sustaining life  But what do I call despicable  Have I not an estate  my dear  a whole fifty pounds a year  that I can call my own  This much was reserved to me out of my jointure when the rest was sold  and on this  whenever it pleases heaven to take my mother away  will I retire to some cottage in a cheap country  where my two children and I will live  and smile at the rich and the great   My brother’s letter has vexed and disgusted me exceedingly  Lady Sarah presents her service  Vain woman  is that a becoming phrase to the mother of her husband  I am so provoked  I think I shall not answer him  he has no relish for such arguments as I could produce in support of my own opinions  and my writing to him would only bring on disagreeable altercations  My mother is in a downright passion with him  Selfish wretch  she called him  and said  he would sacrifice both honour and justice to his own pride     July 19    Miss Burchell  poor soul  how I pity her  Her anxiety increases every hour  She  you may be sure  keeps a look out on all Mr Faulkland’s motions  for  she tells me  she hears he is arrived in town  I suppose I shall receive a notice of some kind or other from him  The unhappy girl  she grieves me to see her  There was never so extravagant a love as her’s  she has nourished it in solitude  and I believe has a heart naturally tender to an uncommon degree  otherwise she could not  for so long a time  and with so little hopes  have preserved so undiminished a fondness  but some accidents have  I know not how     combined to feed this flame  She acknowleges that Mr Faulkland’s being disappointed in espousing me  gave the first encouragement to her hopes  for  she said  she had reason to believe that I was the only woman in the world that stood between her and her happiness  and Mr Faulkland’s remaining single ever since  confirmed her in that opinion  Then the generous attention that he paid to her welfare  in recommending her to my mother’s notice  when he first left England  the noble supplies that he constantly furnished her with ever since for the child’s use  his behaviour to Mrs Gerrarde  who  she says  is the most ensnaring
