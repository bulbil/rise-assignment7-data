 as they drew near each other   I have   prayed that I might live once more to see you  and Heaven has granted my   petition         I hope  Madam   said he   that Heaven will always be equally propitious   to your desires in things of greater moment     There can scarce be any   of greater moment   answered she   for  at present  I have a request to   make you of the utmost importance to me  though no more than I am   certain you would readily grant to any one you had the least   acquaintance with  But   continued she   this is no proper place for us   to discourse in  Upon the terms we now are  it can be no breach of faith   to the mistress of your vows to step with me  for three minutes  where   we may not be exposed to the view of every passenger        Mr  Trueworth had not been very well pleased with the rencounter  and   would gladly have dispensed with complying with her invitation  but   thought  after what she had said  he could not refuse  without being   guilty of a rudeness unbecoming of himself as well as cruel to her  yet   he did comply in such a manner as might make her see his inclination had   little part in his consent  He told her he was in very great haste  but   would snatch as much time as she mentioned from the business he was   upon  Nothing more was said  and they went together into the nearest   tavern  where  being seated  and wine brought in   Now  Madam   said   he  with a cold civility   please to favour me with your commands         Alas   replied she   it belongs not to me to command  and my request   you have already granted     What  without knowing it   cried he   Yes     resumed she   I thought an intimacy  such as ours had been  ought not to   have been broke off  without a kind farewel  I blame you not for   marrying  yet  sure  I deserve not to be quite forsaken  utterly thrown   off  you might at least have flattered me with the hope that  in spite   of your matrimonial engagement  you would still retain some sparks of   affection for your poor Flora     Be assured   said he   I shall always   think on you with tenderness     And can you then resolve never to see   me more   rejoined she passionately   I hoped   replied he   that you   had acquiesced in the reasons I gave you for that resolution     I hoped   so  too   said she   and made use of my utmost efforts for that purpose    but it is in vain  I found I could not live without you  and only wished   an opportunity to take one last embrace before I leave the world and you   for ever   In speaking these words  she threw herself upon his neck  and   burst into a flood of tears       How impossible was it for a heart such as Mr  Trueworth s to be unmoved   at a spectacle like this  Her love  her grief  and her despair  shot   through his very soul  Scarce could he refrain mingling his tears with   hers   My dear Flora   cried he   compose yourself  by Heaven I cannot   bear to see you thus   He kissed her cheek while he was speaking  seated   her in a chair  and held her hand in his with the extremest tenderness       This wicked creature was not so overcome with the emotions of her love   and grief  as not to see the pity she had raised in him  and  flattering   herself that there was in it some mixture of a passion she more wished   to inspire  fell a second time upon his bosom  crying   Oh  Trueworth    Trueworth  here let me die  for death hath nothing in it so terrible as   the being separated from you        Mr  Trueworth was a man of strict honour  great resolution  and   passionately devoted to the most deserving of her sex  yet he was still   a man  was of an amorous complexion  and thus tempted  who can answer    but in this unguarded moment he might have been guilty of a wrong to his   dear Harriot  for which he would afterwards have hated himself  if an   accident of more service to him than his own virtue  in so critical a   juncture  had not prevented
