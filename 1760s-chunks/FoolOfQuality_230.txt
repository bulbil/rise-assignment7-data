   Mrs  Ruth just then returned  and her countenance looked   something dejected  She took her seat by her husband  and    continuing a while silent  she put her handkerchief before her   eyes  and began in broken words Can you guess  my dear  said   she  what sort of a creature this is whom we have got among us     This little heavenly impostor  to lighten our obligation  would have   persuaded us that the hundred pounds was the gift of another     but it is all his own bounty it is all his own graciousness    Come  my daughters come  my children  kneel down and return   your thanks to this your patron  your benefactor  your little   father here       0  sir  you would have pitied me sadly had you seen me at   this time   The poor dear things came  all in a cluster  pressing    and catching  and clasping  and clinging about me  while my love   and my very heart was torn  as it were  to fritters among them    So I took them one by one in my arms  and kissed and embraced   them very cordially  calling them my brothers and sisters  I then   took out another hundred pound note  and giving it to the eldest   of the daughters Here  my dear  said I  I always loved the   little misses better than the little masters  here is for yourself   and your sisters  to clothe you in a way more becoming your   family  And then taking a note  of equal value  I gave it to   the eldest son  for himself and his brothers  as I said  to help to   educate them in a manner more agreeable to the house from   whence they came      Mr  and Mrs  Kuth looked so astonished at me  and at each   other  that for a while they were not able to utter a syllable     and  just as they began to make their acknowledgments  I cried   Hush  hush   here comes my tutor      Mr  Clement just then entered  followed by several servants    who carried a tea equipage  cold fowl  baked meats  with pastries    and some wine      Having introduced Mr  Clement  we all got round the table  and   after a tea and a further regale  I besought Mr  Kuth to give us   the story of his misfortunes      My father  said he  was baron of Frankford  He left my brother    with the title  four thousand five hundred pounds a year  entailed    however  upon me in case of his dying without male issue   and he   left me a small inheritance of four hundred pounds yearly  to   support in some measure the appearance of a gentleman      As my concern bordered on my brother s estate  we saw one   another every day  and continued for several years ie straight and   tender amity          240 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Being both invited one day to dine with other company  at the   house of a neighbour called Mr  Heartless  a question happened to   be started over the bottle  whether the method of setting an egg   on end was originally the invention of Columbus  or whether it was   communicated to him by some other  and I unhappily espoused   the opinion that was opposite to that of my brother      Now  though the question was not worth the very shell of the   egg about which we debated  yet we entered as warmly into it as   though a province had lain at stake   for it is not truth or in    struction that disputants seek after it is victory alone that is the   object of their contention      After some warm words and personal retorts had passed between   my brother and me  he started into sudden passion  and gave me   the lie   whereupon  reaching across the table  I gave him a tap   on the cheek with the flat of my fingers  then rising furiously from   his seat  he swore a fearful oath  and cried I will ruin you  Harry    though it cost me my estate   I will rum you  Harry Kuth  with all   who are yours      The very next day he mustered his tenants and labourers  and    coming upon me with a little army  he laid most of my fences level   with the earth      When I complained of this violence to my next neighbours  Mr    Heartless and Mr  Hollow  they protested they would stand by me
