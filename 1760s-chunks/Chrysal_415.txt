up with his own scheme to mind anything else  Accordingly    he stepped out when supper was ended  and engaging the chamber    maid in his interest  by a present of half a crown  she showed him   where his mistress was to lie  and promised to settle all things in   the manner most convenient to his designs  by putting her and   her mother in the bed next to the door  there being two in the room    and placing in the other the servant maid  who paid for a bed to   herself  as her modesty would not permit her to sleep with a stranger      As soon as the house was quiet  and my master thought the wine   which he had forced upon the mother had secured her  he got up    and stealing in his shirt to the door of their chamber  found it open    upon which he entered and crept to the bed  where he expected   to find his mistress  without ever considering what must be the   consequence of surprising her in such a manner  Opening the   curtains  therefore  softly  to feel by the difference of size on which   side she lay  he had scarce put his hand upon the clothes  when   it was seized and gripped so hard that he soon lost all thought of   everything but disengaging himself  For this purpose he made   two or three efforts  but finding them ineffectual  and provoked   at the pain his hand suffered in the struggle  he discharged a blow with   the other full in the face of his antagonist  who springing directly   out of bed  returned it with such usury  that my poor master fell   sprawling on the floor  where he roared out murder with all his might    in which he was immediately joined by those who lay in the other   bed  whose cries not only raised the house to his rescue  but also   saved him from further violence  his antagonist desisting to beat   him in order to make his retreat in time      When those who lay nearest were assembled at the door  half   clad  and worse armed with whatever they could catch up in their   confusion  prudential regard to personal safety made them all stop   short  everyone finding some pretence to excuse himself from going   in first  and pressing the post of honour upon his neighbour  till   they at length raised their fears so high that it was uncertain whether   anyone would venture in before daylight  though the cries still   continued  had not tlie smuggler  who did not wake to join them   at first  put an end to the debate        Damn you all    said he  snatching a candle from one  and a   poker from another    for a pack of cowardly lubbers   Will you   stand jawing here  while the people are murdering     Then rushing   in    Hallo     continued he    what s going forward here  in the   devil s name         The first object that presented itself to his view when he entered   was my master  who was still upon the ground  unable  between fright   and beating  to arise  Advancing to him  therefore    Hip  mess    mate     said he  giving him a kick on his naked posterior    what   cheer   Speak if you are alive         The entrance of light restoring my master to some spirit  he   raised his head at this salute  and making an effort to get up    I   scarce know whether I am or not    answered he    I have been so   beaten by that bitch of Babel   but she shall pay for it  if I ever   recover            ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 503     The place where he was found directing this accusation to the   person in that bed  while some of them helped him up  the rest   gathered round it  and asked the servant maid  who lay there    what had induced her to treat the gentleman in such a manner     But the mention of her name saved her the trouble of a reply    Before she could speak    It was not she     exclaimed my master       I mean the old beldam  mother to the young witch  whose baby    face brought mo among you  and who lay in this bed  It was she   who abused me thus   or rather some porter in woman s clothes    who passed for her  for no woman ever had such strength
