relationship may be in a nearer degree of kin   I understand you  replied Don Antonio s widow  with something like a moral tinge of red in her cheek  you are an accurate chronologist  There is no garbling facts in defiance of your memory  Well  then  Lucretia is my daughter by the Marquis of Marialva  it was extremely wrong  but I cannot conceal it from you  The confession must indeed be a shock to your modesty  said I  after telling me yourself what pranks you played with the hospital steward at Zamora  I must tell you moreover that Lucretia is an article of so superior a quality as to render you a public benefactor by having thrown her into the market  It were to be wished that the stolen embraces of all your fraternity might be blessed with fruitfulness  if they could secure to themselves a patent for breeding after your sample   Should any sarcastic reader  comparing this passage with some circumstances related while I was the marquis s secretary  suspect me of being entitled to dispute the honours of paternity with that nobleman  I blush to say  that my claims are entirely out of the question   I laid open my principal adventures to Laura in my turn  as well as the present state of my affairs  She listened with interest  and said  Friend Santillane  you seem to play a principal part on the stage of the world  and I congratulate you most heartily  Should Lucretia be engaged at Madrid  I flatter myself she will find a powerful protector in Signor de Santillane  Doubt it not  answered I  your daughter may have her engagement whenever you please  I can promise you that  without presuming too much on my interest  I take you at your word  replied Laura  and would set out to morrow  were I not under articles to this company  An order from court will cut the knot of any articles  rejoined I  and that I take upon myself  you shall have it within a week  It is an act of chivalry to rescue Lucretia from Toledo  such a pretty little actress belongs to the royal court  as parcel of the manor   Lucretia came into the room just as I was talking of her  The goddess Hebe herself never looked better in her best days  it was nature in the bud  exhaling the sweets of her earliest bloom  but promising a more luxuriant waste of treasure  She was just up  and her natural beauty  without the aid of art  communicated the most rapturous sensations  Come  niece  said her mother  thank the gentleman for all his kindness to us  he is an old friend of mine  who ranks high at court  and undertakes to get us both an engagement at the theatre royal  The little girl seemed to be much pleased  and made me a low curtsey  saying with an enchanting smile  I most humbly thank you for your obliging intention  but  by taking me from a partial audience  are you certain that I shall not be looked down upon by that of Madrid  I may but lose by the exchange  I remember hearing my aunt say  that she has seen players most favourably received in one town  and hissed off the stage in another  this absolutely frightens me  beware therefore of exposing me to the derision of the court  and yourself to its reproaches  Lovely Lucretia  answered I  we have neither of us anything to fear  I am rather apprehensive lest  by the havoc you will make among hearts  you should excite rivalships and kindle discord among the courtiers  My niece s fears  said Laura  are better founded than yours  but I hope they will both prove vain  however feeble may be Lucretia s charms of person  her talents as an actress are at least above mediocrity   We continued the conversation for some time  and I could gather  from Lucretia s share in it  that she was a girl of superior talents  On taking leave  I assured them that they should immediately receive a summons to Madrid       CH  II     Santillane makes his report to the minister  who commissions him to send for Lucretia  The first appearance of that actress before the court   ON my return  I found my lord duke impatient to be informed of my success  Have you seen her  said he  is she worth transplanting  My lord  answered I  fame  which generally runs beyond all discretion in its report of beauty  has erred on the side of parsimony in its estimate of the matchless young Lucretia  she is all that youthful poets fancy when they feign  for personal attractions  and all that veteran managers seek when they sign articles  in scenic qualifications   Is it possible  exclaimed the minister with a satisfaction which involuntarily peeped out at his eyes  and made me think he had some selfish hankerings after the article of my marketing at Toledo  is it possible  and is she really so charming a creature  When you see her  replied I  you will own that any verbal picture of her perfections must be altogether inadequate to their due description  His excellency then requiring a minute account of my journey
