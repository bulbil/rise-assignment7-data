a general clearance  that my secretary and myself  with our respective wives  and our usual establishment  were left in undisturbed possession of our own home   The efforts which we both made to please our ladies were not thrown away  I breathed by degrees into the partner of my joys and sorrows as much love for me as I entertained for her  and Scipio made his better part forget the woes and privations he had occasioned her  Beatrice  who had very winning ways with her  and was all things to all women  had no difficulty about worming herself into the good graces of her new mistress  and gaining her complete confidence  In short  we all four agreed admirably well together  and began to enjoy a bliss above the common lot of humanity  Every day rolled along more delightfully than the last  Antonia was pensive and demure  but Beatrice and myself were enlisted in the crew of mirth  and even though we had been constitutionally sedate  Scipio was among us  and he was of himself a pill to purge melancholy  The best creature in the world for a snug little party  one of those merry drolls who have only to shew their comical faces  and set the table in a roar of inextinguishable laughter   One day  when we had taken a fancy to go after dinner  and doze away the usual interval in the most sequestered spot about the grounds  my secretary got into such exuberant spirits  as to chase away the drowsy god by his exhilarating sallies  Do hold your tongue  my loquacious friend  said I  or else  if you are determined to wage war against this lazy custom of our afternoons  at least tell us something which we shall he the wiser for hearing  With all my heart and soul  sir  answered he  Would you have me go through all fabulous histories of wandering knights  distressed damsels  giants  enchanted castles  and the whole train of legendary adventures  I had much rather hear your own true history  replied I  but that is a pleasure which you have not thought fit to give me so long as we have lived together  and I seem likely to go without it to the end of the chapter  How happens that  said he  If I have not told you my own story  it is because you never expressed the slightest wish to be troubled with the recital  therefore it is not my fault if you are in the dark about my past life  but if you are really at all curious to be let into the secret  my loquacity is very much at your service on the occasion  Antonia  Beatrice  and myself  unanimously took him at his word  and arranged ourselves for listening like an attentive audience  The speculation was a safe one on our parts  for the tale was sure to answer  either as a stimulant or a soporific   I certainly ought to have been descended  said Scipio  from some family of the highest rank and earliest antiquity  or in default of such parentage  from the most distinguished orders of personal merit  such as that of St James or Alcantara  if a man may be permitted to decide on the fittest circumstances his own birth  but as it is not among the privileges of human nature to elect one s own father  you are to know that mine  by name Torribio Scipio  was a subaltern myrmidon of the Holy Brotherhood  As he was going back and fore on the king s highway  and looking after business in his own line  he met once on a time  between Cuen√ßa and Toledo  with a young Bohemian babe of chance  who appeared very pretty in his eyes  She was alone  on foot  and carried her whole patrimony at her back in a kind of knapsack  Whither are you going  my little darling  said he in a philandering tone of voice  unlike the natural hoarseness of his accents  Good worthy gentleman  answered she  I am going to Toledo  where I hope to gain an honest livelihood by hook or by crook  Your intentions are highly commendable  retorted he  and I doubt not but you have many a hook and many a crook among the implements of your trade  Yes  with a blessing on my endeavours  rejoined she  I have several little ways of doing for myself  I know how to make washes and creams for the ladies  faces  perfumes for their noses and their chambers  then I can tell fortunes  can search for things lost with a sieve and shears  and erect figures for the taking in of shadows with a glass   Torribio  concluding that so well provided a girl would be a very advantageous match for a man like himself  who could scarcely scrape wherewithal to support life by his own profession  though he was as good a thief taker as the best of them  made her an offer of marriage  and she was nothing loth  nor prudishly coy  They flew on the wings of inclination and convenience to Toledo  where they were joined together  and you behold in me the happy pledge of holy and lawful matrimony  They fixed themselves in a shop on the outskirts of the town  where my mother commenced her career by selling
