not a Father cordially love a Son  whom he has reclaimed by Discipline  Is not the Penitence of a Sinner accepted of by God  tho  effected by Pain  Poverty  or other Misfortune in this Life  Shall the whole heavenly Host rejoice over a repentant Sinner in this World  and shall the Circumstance of Time or Place deprive them of Charity  when our Page  333 Souls become more nearly allied to them  than in the Flesh     In short  if Punishments  or Misery  either judiciary or consequential  be eternal  in any one Instance  the Devil has triumphed so far  which is Blasphemy  But  according to the Severity of some Divines  there can be but a small Minority saved  which would look like a very paltry Composition for the Redeemer of Mankind to make   If this Doctrine may appear to set Men too free from Terror  to influence their Conduct toward a virtuous Life  I shall consider this Subject in that Light  in another Letter  and do assure you  my dearest Ally  that I am as sincerely attached to you  as if I thought my Salvation depended upon it  Adieu   Henry   LETTER CCCXVIII   SINCE my last Letter I have looked into the Bible  and find some Passages  where eternal Punishments are denounced  but then I find also several other Places  where the Words eternal and everlasting are meant in a limited Sense  for a long and indefinite Time  So that I think these Texts do not preclude me from reasoning upon this Subject   Page  334I own  the first Thing which occurred to me  when I met with Expressions in the Scripture  that seemed to shock my Reason  and my Idea of God  was  to suppose them only Threats in Terrorem  but then this alarmed me about the Consequence  which such a Surmise might draw after it  with regard to the Promises mentioned in the same Scripture  However  upon Recollection  I did not think this Inference should logically follow  for a Promise is a Contract  the virtuous Man a Purchaser  and Justice exacts the Obligation  But the Case is quite different with regard to Threats  A Lord may say to his Steward    Tend well this Farm  till my Return  and I will make thee an Inheritance out of it  but  if you suffer the Soil to be over grown with Briars  I will cause thee to be flayed alive   Now  tho  the Lord must fulfil his Promise out of Justice  he surely may forgive the Penalty out of Mercy     But I do not mean to insist upon this Argument  for  as the Texts I hint at may be so interpreted as to agree with the Reasoning of my former Letters  I should be very tender of charging the least Disingenuousness upon the Words of God  and  if they were express and uncontrovertible in this or any other Particular  against my Sense or Opinion  I would  as becomes me  submit my Reason to my Faith  And indeed  tho  the Distinction I have made Page  335 between Promises and Threats  does sufficiently prove that Justice or Reason does not require the Completion of denounced Vengeance  yet certainly Truth requires that every Thing shall be  as it is affirmed   In order to help us the better to frame a Judgment upon this Subject  let us take the Matter as high as we can  by beginning at original Sin  and yet all the Curse  we hear  upon that Occasion  seems to be Temptation  Labour  and Death   Genesis iii 15  and to the End   That is  it may be apprehended  that the natural Consequence of the first Parent s Sin was the debasing human Nature to a State of Frailty  Mechanics  and Mortality  which imperfect Nature was  from thence  derived down to all their Race    For an evil Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit     Our Redeemer afterwards  at a certain Time   though resolved from the Beginning  takes our Nature upon him   and is thence stiled our second Adam  by which benevolent and godlike Condescension Mankind was retrieved to their former Dignity  so far as to be rendered capable of their former Perfection  perhaps greater  in which the whole Mystery of the Incarnation seems to lie  not in the unaccountable Doctrine of satisfying the Divine Justice  which Doctrine has perplexed the Faith of many well disposed Christians  and  perhaps  has prevented this Page  336 Religion from becoming as universal  as it s other Evidence  and moral Perfection  seems to promise   That Mankind should labour under Guilt  for the Sin of our first Parents  and that they should be redeemed by the Sacrifice of God  the first not our Crime  and the latter not our Merit  seems to be a Scheme of Providence contrary to Sense or Religion  But that a Race of Beings  proceeding from Adam  after his Fall  should consequentially be of too corrupt a Nature to be capable of perfect Bliss  and that our Redeemer  becoming our second Parent  a Man every Way   Sin only excepted  should thereby restore that Purity to our Nature  as may
