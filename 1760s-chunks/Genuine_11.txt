other light than as a friend and relation     To aggravate this misfortune  Lord Rmdash hfmdash d knew Cmdash rke s infamous character  and had seen him kicked out of billiard rooms  and tennis courts  as a gambler   50 and sharper  fired therefore with double resentment at his mistress s connexions with one of the vilest of mankind  he at once upbraided her with the opprobious terms of whore  jilt  and liar  and ordered her the next morning to quit his house   After so severe a reprimand  she endeavoured to appease his anger  but finding that neither tears nor intreaty would prevail  she retired to a separate chamber and spent the night in ruminating on the dismal consequences that were likely to attend the imprudent conduct of herself and Mr  C—rke   Lord R—hf—d no sooner arose in the morning  than he sent his man to call the faithless fair one before him  She came trembling into his presence  and received her dismisson in the following reproachful terms    Ungrateful  despicable wretch  who hast preferred the embraces of a villain  a branded scoundrel  to the esteem of a man of honour  Be gone  with all thy guilt upon thy head  nor   51 dare  on the severest penalty  to set one foot hereafter on my threshold  Take that bundle  which contains cloaths merely necessary  I will not prostitute my valuable effects to deck a worthless woman  but keep them for one more deserving of my favours     Finding her fate in this respect irrevocable  her tears dried up  and the mask of dissimulation was removed  the true woman burst into an immoderate sit of laughter  and the parting scene concluded with her observing  that she always looked on my Lord as a fool  as well as every keeper  who expected a woman to be true to him  in spight of her interest or her passion  and  that to find a whore faithful to any other influence  was very difficult  if possible   She then took her bundle  and went immediately to the tavern where her friend the waiter lived  and there met with Mr  C—rke  according to appointment  Here they regaled themselves with a good dinner  and affecting little concern about her loss  passed some hours in recapitulating   52 the weakness and folly of Lord R—hfmdash d  in being blinded by his passions  and paying so dearly for what might be purchased at a much easier rate   Miss ELLIOT had cautiously concealed all the particulars of her dismission from Mr  C—rke  the latter therefore  being very anxious to know what prizes the former had secured  began immediately  on their arrival at their lodgings  to enquire concerning the manner in which she intended to bring off her rich cloaths  jewels  and other valuable commodities  but great was his surprize when she told him  with a dejected countenance  that his Lordship s knowledge of his life and character greatly added to his resentment  and prevented her bringing off any thing of value  as he had secured all  and told her his property should not be prostituted to the use of scoundrels  pimps  and gamblers   Thus deprived of the booty he expected  he began to look upon Miss ELLIOT with great indifference  and would frequently upbraid her as being the occasion of their appearing in public together  which had proved so fatal to them both     53As she had now no more cloaths than were necessary for a decent appearance  and he had a few days before lost his last guinea at the hazard table  and therefore could not assist her in making a figure for polite company  C—rke began to entertain thoughts of contracting an acquaintance with some woman  whose situation in life might render her more capable of answering his purposes  than Miss Elliot was at present   To promote this design  he visited all places frequented by ladies of pleasure  and being comely in person  and versed in those arts which prevail with women of weak minds  he soon ingratiated himself with a lady who was kept by an old cit at a very genteel allowance  This woman being excessively amorous  and her keeper very impotent  conferred her favours on several young fellows for value received  and was at that time infected with a certain popular distemper  which she communicated to C—rke the very first time he was admitted to her embraces     54As the connexion was not entirely broken off between him and Miss ELLIOT   for she could as yet procure a trifle on her cloaths  she partook of the present  and was at length convinced of the self interestedness of Mr  C—ke  When she upbraided him with the disingenuity of his conduct  instead of a due acknowledgment  he treated her with the utmost disdain  told her to have no farther dependence on him  and packing up the few rags he had lest  bounced out of the room  which he never more entered   Thus did this scandal to humanity act entirely consistent with his character  for  having lived upon a woman as long as she could administer to his idleness and vanity  he left her in circumstances of the utmost distress  in the most deplorable situation  to which he had chiefly contributed to reduce
