 beheld the terrible apparition  This no sooner saluted his view than his hair bristled up  his knees began to knock  and his teeth to chatter  while he cried aloud   In the name of God  where are you bound  ho   To this hail the misanthrope answered   We are the spirits of thy grandmother Jane and thy aunt Bridget    At mention of these names  Crowe s terrors began to give way to his resentment  and he pronounced in a quick tone of surprise  mixed with indignation   What d ye want  what d ye want  what d ye want  ho   The spirit replied   We are sent to warn thee of thy fate    From whence  ho   cried the captain  whose choler had by this time well nigh triumphed over his fear   From Heaven   said the voice   Ye lie  ye b———s of hell   did our novice exclaim   ye are d—ned for heaving me out of my right  five fathom and a half by the lead  in burning brimstone  Don t I see the blue flames come out of your hawse holes —mayhap you may be the devil himself  for aught I know—but I trust in the Lord  d ye see—I never disrated a kinsman  d ye see  so don t come alongside of me—put about on th other tack  d ye see—you need not clap hard a weather  for you ll soon get to hell again with a flowing sail    So saying  he had recourse to his Paternoster  but perceiving the apparitions approach  he thundered out   Avast —avast—sheer off  ye babes of hell  or I ll be foul of your forelights   He accordingly sprung forwards with his hanger  and very probably would have set the spirits on their way to the other world  had he not fallen over a pew in the dark  and entangled himself so much among the benches  that he could not immediately recover his footing  The triumvirate took this opportunity to retire  and such was the precipitation of Ferret in his retreat  that he encountered a post by which his right eye sustained considerable damage  a circumstance which induced him to inveigh bitterly against his own folly  as well as the impertinence of his companions  who had inveigled him into such a troublesome adventure  Neither he nor Clarke could be prevailed upon to revisit the novice  The doctor himself thought his disease was desperate  and  mounting his horse  returned to his own habitation   Ferret  finding all the beds in the public house were occupied  composed himself to sleep in a Windsor chair at the chimney corner  and Mr  Clarke  whose disposition was extremely amorous  resolved to renew his practices on the heart of Dolly  He had reconnoitred the apartments in which the bodies of the knight and his squire were deposited  and discovered close by the top of the staircase a sort of a closet or hovel  just large enough to contain a truckle bed  which  from some other particulars  he supposed to be the bedchamber of his beloved Dolly  who had by this time retired to her repose  Full of this idea  and instigated by the demon of desire  Mr  Thomas crept softly upstairs  and lifting the latch of the closet door  his heart began to palpitate with joyous expectation  but before he could breathe the gentle effusions of his love  the supposed damsel started up and seizing him by the collar with a Herculean gripe  uttered  in the voice of Crabshaw   It wan t for nothing that I dreamed of Newgate  sirrah  but I d have thee to know  an arrant squire is not to be robbed by such a peddling thief as thee—here I ll howld thee vast  an the devil were in thy doublet—help  murder  vire  help    It was impossible for Mr  Clarke to disengage himself  and equally impracticable to speak in his own vindication  so that here he stood trembling and half throttled  until the whole house being alarmed  the landlady and her ostler ran upstairs with a candle  When the light rendered objects visible  an equal astonishment prevailed on all sides  Crabshaw was confounded at sight of Mr  Clarke  whose person he well knew  and releasing him instantly from his grasp   Bodikins   cried he   I believe as how this hause is haunted—who thought to meet with Measter Laawyer Clarke at midnight  and so far from hoam   The landlady could not comprehend the meaning of this encounter  nor could Tom conceive how Crabshaw had transported himself thither from the room below  in which he saw him quietly reposed  Yet nothing was more easy than to explain this mystery  the apartment below was the chamber which the hostess and her daughter reserved for their own convenience  and this particular having been intimated to the squire while he was at supper  he had resigned his bed quietly  and been conducted hither in the absence of the company  Tom  recollecting himself as well as he could  professed himself of Crabshaw s opinion  that the house was haunted  declaring that he could not well account for his being there in the dark  and leaving those that were assembled
