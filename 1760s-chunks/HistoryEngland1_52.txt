produced the paper with the conspirators names  Henry  alarmed at this intelligence  used the most vigorous efforts to dispel the rising storm   The conspirators had  by this time  dressed up one of Richard s servants  named Maudlin  in royal robes  giving out  that he was the deposed King  who  having escaped from prison  was come to implore the assistance of his subjects  Pity is a passion for which the English have ever been remarkable  Majesty  in distress  was sufficient to excite all their loyalty and compassion  and they flocked in great numbers round the conspiring leaders  Their army soon became considerable  and encamped near Cirencester  while the leaders   153 took up their head quarters in that city  but they were so careless  or unexperienced in war  that they neglected to place proper guards at the gates and the avenues of the place  This the mayor soon observed  and  assembling four hundred men in the night  he secured the gates  so as to exclude the troops that were encamped without the walls  and then attacked the chiefs within  The Duke of Surry and Earl of Salisbury  two of the principal conspirators  were taken  after an obstinate defence  and beheaded on the spot  by the mayor s order  while the Duke of Exeter  and Earl of Gloucester  two more of the party  escaped over the tops of the houses into the camp  with a view to storm the town at the head of their forces  but they found the tents and baggage abandoned by the soldiers  who  hearing the noise and tumult within  had concluded that a party of the King s army had privately entered  and  from this persuasion  fled with the utmost precipitation  The two Lords  perceiving it out of their power to execute their design  parted  the better to make their escape  but they had the misfortune to be taken  and  shortly after  lost their heads upon the scaffold   If we compare the times  which I now attempt to give you an idea of  with those of King John  or those of some reigns before him  we shall find a great change  with respect to the insurgent barons  In the former period they made frequent insurrections  were often taken in open rebellion  but as frequently pardoned  in the period now in view  they were seldom taken without suffering the utmost rigour of the law  This plainly shews  how much the power of the barons was sunk in the course of a couple of centuries    154 This revolution of power is  notwithstanding  natural and obvious  as the people began to share the government with the nobles  the King was fixed upon as a third person  to secure the balance  and both were contented to make him great  from a jealousy of each other  Noblemen were therefore now executed  not as petty Monarchs but offending subjects  and none but Kings were considered as exempt from penal laws   In all probability  the ill success of this enterprize hastened Richard s end  One of those assassins  that are found in every court  ready to commit the most horrid crimes for reward  came down to the place of this unfortunate Monarch s confinement  and  with eight other followers  rushed into his apartment  The King  concluding their design was to take away his life  resolved to sell it as dearly as he could  he wrested a poll ax from one of the murderers  and soon laid four of the number dead at his feet  but he was at length overpowered  and struck dead by the blow of a battle ax  Thus died the unfortunate Richard  in the thirty third year of his age  while compassion for his sufferings and death made more converts to his family and cause  than ever his most meritorious actions during life had gained him   The death of Richard was very seasonable to his successor  The King of France had actually raised a vast armament  in order to replace the deposed Monarch  and so much was Henry terrified at his intentions  that he ordered the Bishop of Arundel to arm even the ecclesiastics of his province  The preparations of France might have contributed to hasten the fall of Richard  his death was no sooner known at the French court  than   155 all thoughts of the invasion were laid aside  a truce for eight and twenty years was concluded between the two crowns  and it was agreed that Queen Isabel  who had been married to Richard  but whose marriage had never been consummated  should return to France  her native country   A kingdom  like England  at that time divided in itself  and surrounded by enemies on every side  could not expect a peace of any continuance  accordingly the Scotch began to give new disturbances  and  when the armies of England were marched northward  in order to oppose their invasions  the Welch rose to vindicate their ancient liberties  Owen Glendour  a name among the people of that country  respected even to this day  led them on  and gained several victories  but his successes were only calculated to procure a temporary triumph  and no lasting advantage  Whatever honour the English lost on the side of
