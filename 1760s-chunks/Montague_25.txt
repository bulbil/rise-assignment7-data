usual  and very attentive to his mistress  your brother seemed chagrined at his arrival  Emily perceived it  and redoubled her politeness to him  which in a little time restored part of his good humor  upon the whole  it was an agreable evening  but it would have been more so  if Sir George had come at first  or not at all       The ladies lie here  and we go all together in the morning to Quebec  the gentlemen are going       I steal a moment to seal  and give this to the colonel  who will put it in his packet to morrow     LETTER XXIV   24   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Sept  30   WOULD you believe it possible  my dear  that Sir George should decline attending Emily Montague from Montreal  and leave the pleasing commission to me  I am obliged to him for the three happiest days of my life  yet am piqued at his chusing me for a cecisbeo to his mistress  he seems to think me a man sans consequence  with whom a lady may safely be trusted  there is nothing very flattering in such a kind of confidence  let him take care of himself  if he is impertinent  and sets me at defiance  I am not vain  but set our fortunes aside  and I dare enter the lists with Sir George Clayton  I cannot give her a coach and six  but I can give her  what is more conducive to happiness  a heart which knows how to value her perfections       I never had so pleasing a journey  we were three days coming down  because we made it a continual party of pleasure  took music with us  landed once or twice a day  visited the French families we knew  lay both nights on shore  and danced at the seigneur s of the village       This river  from Montreal to Quebec  exhibits a scene perhaps not to be matched in the world  it is settled on both sides  though the settlements are not so numerous on the south shore as on the other  the lovely confusion of woods  mountains  meadows  corn fields  rivers  for there are several on both sides  which lose themselves in the St  Lawrence   intermixed with churches and houses breaking upon you at a distance through the trees  form a variety of landscapes  to which it is difficult to do justice       This charming scene  with a clear serene sky  a gentle breeze in our favor  and the conversation of half a dozen fine women  would have made the voyage pleasing to the most insensible man on earth  my Emily too of the party  and most politely attentive to the pleasure she saw I had in making the voyage agreable to her       I every day love her more  and  without considering the impropriety of it  I cannot help giving way to an inclination  in which I find such exquisite pleasure  I find a thousand charms in the least trifle I can do to oblige her       Don t reason with me on this subject  I know it is madness to continue to see her  but I find a delight in her conversation  which I cannot prevail on myself to give up till she is actually married       I respect her engagements  and pretend to no more from her than her friendship  but  as to myself  will love her in whatever manner I please  to shew you my prudence  however  I intend to dance with the handsomest unmarried Frenchwoman here on Thursday  and to shew her an attention which shall destroy all suspicion of my tenderness for Emily  I am jealous of Sir George  and hate him  but I dissemble it better than I thought it possible for me to do       My Lucy  I am not happy  my mind is in a state not to be described  I am weak enough to encourage a hope for which there is not the least foundation  I misconstrue her friendship for me every moment  and that attention which is meerly gratitude for my apparent anxiety to oblige  I even fancy her eyes understand mine  which I am afraid speak too plainly the sentiments of my heart       I love her  my dear girl  to madness  these three days       I am interrupted  Adieu   Yours   ED  RIVERS        Tis Capt  Fermor  who insists on my dining at Silleri  They will eternally throw me in the way of this lovely woman  of what materials do they suppose me formed     LETTER XXV   25   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Oct  3  Twelve o clock   AN enchanting ball  my dear  your little friend s head is turned  I was more admired than Emily  which to be sure did not flatter my vanity at all  I see she must content herself with being beloved  for without coquetry  tis in vain to expect admiration       We had more than three hundred persons at the ball  above three fourths men  all gay and well dressed  an elegant
