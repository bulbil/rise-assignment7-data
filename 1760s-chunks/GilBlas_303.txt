possible difference of opinion on that subject  said a knight of Alcantara  The piece is full of strokes which Apollo himself might have aimed  and of perplexities contrived so that none but the author himself could have unravelled them  I appeal to that acute and ingenious stranger  added he  addressing his discourse to the Castilian gentleman  he looks to me like a good judge  and I will lay a wager that he is on my side of the question  Take care how you stake on an uncertainty  my worthy knight  answered the gentleman with a sarcastic smile  I am not of your provincial school  we do not pass our judgment so hastily at Madrid  Far from sentencing a piece on its first representation  we are jealous of its apparent merit while aided by scenic deception  our fancies and our feelings may be carried away for the moment  but our serious decision is suspended till we have read the work  and the most common result of its appeal to the press is a defalcation from its powers of pleasing on the stage   Thus you perceive  pursued he  that it is our practice to examine a work of genius closely before we stamp on it the mark of a stock piece  its author s fame  let it ring as loudly as it may  can never confound our exactness of discrimination  When Lope de Vega himself or Calderona ventured on the boards  they encountered rigid critics  though in an audience which doted on them  critics who would not sign their passport to the regions of immortality till they had sifted their claims to be admitted there   That is a little too much  interrupted the knight of St James  We are not quite so cautious as you  It is not our custom to wait for the printing of a piece in order to decide on its reputation  By the very first performance it sinks or swims  It does not even seem necessary to be inconveniently attentive to the business of the stage  It is sufficient that we know it for a production of Don Gabriel  to be persuaded that it combines every excellence  The works of that poet may justly be considered as commencing a new era  and fixing the criterion of good taste  The school of Lope and Calderona was the mere cart of Thespis  compared with the polished scenes of this great dramatic master  The gentleman  who looked up to Lope and Calderona as the Sophocles and Euripides of the Spaniards  could not easily be brought to acknowledge such wild canons of criticism  This is dramatic heresy with a vengeance  exclaimed he  Since you compel me  gentlemen  to decide like you on the fallacious evidence of a first night  I must tell you that I am not at all satisfied with this new tragedy of your Don Gabriel  As a poem it abounds more with glittering conceits than with passages of pathos or delineations of nature  The verses  three out of four  are defective either in measure or rhyme  the characters  clumsily imagined or incongruously supported  and the thoughts have often the obscurity of a riddle without its ingenuity   The two authors at table  who  with a prudence equally commendable and unusual  had said nothing for fear of lying under the imputation of jealousy  could not help assenting to the last speaker s opinions by their looks  which warranted me in concluding that their silence was less owing to the perfection of the work than to the dictates of personal policy  As for the military critics  they got to their old topic of ringing the changes on Don Gabriel  and exalted him to a level with the under tenants of Olympus  This extravagant association with the demi gods  this blind and stiff necked idolatry  divorced the Castilian from his little stock of patience  so that  raising his hands to heaven  he broke out abruptly into a volley of enthusiasm  O divine Lope de Vega  sublime and unrivalled genius  who has left an immeasurable space between thee and all the Gabriels who would light their tapers from thy bright effulgence  and thou  mellow  soft voiced Calderona  whose elegance and sweetness  rejecting buskined rant and tragic swell  reign with undisputed sway over the affections  fear not  either of you  lest your altars should be overturned by this tongue tied nurseling of the muses  It will be the utmost of his renown  if posterity  before whose eyes your works shall live in daily view  and form their dear delight  shall enrol his name  as  matter of history and curious record  on the list of obsolete authors   This animated apostrophe  for which the company was not at all prepared  raised a hearty laugh  after which we all rose from table and withdrew  An apartment had been got ready for me by Don Alphonso s order  where I found a good bed  and my lordship  lying down in luxurious weariness  went to sleep upon the tag of the Castilian gentleman s impassioned vindication  and dreamed most crustily of the injustice done to Lope and Calderona by ignorant pretenders       CH  VI     Gil Blas  walking about the streets of Valencia  meets with a man of sanctity  whose pious face he has seen somewhere else  What sort of man this
