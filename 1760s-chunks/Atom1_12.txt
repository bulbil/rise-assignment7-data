of a Ximian was in such request at this period  that if the market had been properly managed and supplied  this delicacy would have sold for two    61 Obans a pound  or about four pounds sterling  The troops in the North might have provided at the rate of a thousand head per month for the demand of Meaco  and tho  the other parts of the carcase would not have sold at so high a price as the liver  heart  harrigals  sweet bread  and pope s eye  yet the whole  upon an average  would have fetched at the rate of three hundred pounds a head  especially if those animals  which are but poorly fed in their own country  had been fattened up and kept upon hard meat for the slaughter  This new branch of traffick would have produced about three hundred and sixty thousand pounds annually  for the rebellion might easily have been fomented from year to year  and consequently it would have yielded a considerable addition to the emperor s revenue  by a proper taxation   The philosophers of Japan were divided in their opinions concerning    62 this new taste for Ximian flesh  which suddenly sprung up among the Japonese  Some ascribed it to a principle of hatred and revenge  agreeable to the common expression of animosity among the multitude     You dog  I ll have your liver    Others imputed it to a notion analagous to the vulgar conceit  that the liver of a mad dog being eaten is a preventive against madness  ergo  the liver of a traitor is an antidote against treason  A third sort derived this strange appetite from the belief of the Americans  who imagine they shall inherit all the virtues of the enemies they devour  and a fourth affirmed that the demand for this dainty arose from a very high and peculiar flavour in Ximian flesh  which flavour was discovered by accident  moreover  there were not wanting some who supposed this banquet was a kind of sacrifice to the powers of sorcery     63 as we find that one of the ingredients of the charm prepared in Shakespear s cauldron was   the liver of blaspheming Jew    and indeed it is not at all improbable that the liver of a rebellious Ximian might be altogether as effectual  I know that Fika kaka was stimulated by curiosity to try the experiment  and held divers consultations with his cooks on this subject  They all declared in favour of the trial  and it was accordingly presented at the table  where the Cuboy eat of it to such excess as to produce a surfeit  He underwent a severe evacuation both ways  attended with cold sweats and swoonings  In a word  his agony was so violent  that he ever after loathed the sight of Ximian flesh  whether dead or alive     With the Fatzman Quamba cun dono was connected another Quo called Gotto mio  viceroy of Xicoco  one of the islands of Japan  If    64 his understanding had been as large as his fortune  and his temper a little more tractable  he would have been a dangerous rival to the Cuboy  But if their brains had been weighed against each other  the nineteenth part of a grain would have turned either scale  and as Fika kaka had negative qualities  which supported and extended his personal influence  so Gotto mio had positive powers  that defended him from all approaches of popularity  His pride was of the insolent order  his temper extremely irascible  and his avarice quite rapacious  nay  he is said to have once declined the honour of a kicking from the Dairo  Conceited of his own talents  he affected to harangue in the council of Twenty Eight  but his ideas were embarrassed  his language was mean  and his elocution more discordant than the braying of fifty asses  When Fika kaka addressed himself to speech  an    65 agreeable simper played upon the countenances of all the audience  but soon as Gotto mio stood up  every spectator raised his thumbs to his ears  as it were instinctively  The Dairo Got hama baba  by the advice of the Cuboy  sent him over to govern the people of Xicoco  and a more effectual method could not have been taken to mortify his arrogance  His deportment was so insolent  his oeconomy so sordid  and his government so arbitrary  that those islanders  who are remarkably ferocious and impatient  expressed their hatred and contempt of him on every occasion  His Quanbukuship was hardly safe from outrage in the midst of his guards  and a cross was actully erected for the execution of his favourite Kow kin  who escaped with some difficulty to the island of Niphon  whither also his patron soon followed him  attended by the curses of the people whom he had been sent to rule      66 He who presided at the council of Twenty Eight was called Soo san sin o  an old experienced shrewd politician  who conveyed more sense in one single sentence  than could have been distilled from all the other brains in council  had they been macerated in one alembic  He was a man of extensive learning and elegant taste  He saw through the characters of his fellow labourers in the ad—n  He laughed at the folly of one faction  and
