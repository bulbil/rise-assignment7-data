accuracy  when  resolving to return by Winchester  where he hoped to  meet with some hints of intelligence by which he might profit in his  future search  he struck off the common road to take the benefit of a  nearer cut  and finding himself benighted near a village  took up  his lodgings at the first inn to which his horse directed him  Having  bespoke something for supper  and retired to his chamber  where he  amused himself with a pipe  he heard a confused noise of rustic jollity   which being all of a sudden interrupted  after a short pause his ear  was saluted with the voice of Pipes  who  at the solicitation of the  company  began to entertain them with a song   Hatchway instantly recognised the well known sound  in which  indeed   he could not possibly be mistaken  as nothing in nature bore the least  resemblance to it  he threw his pipe into the chimney  and  snatching  up one of his pistols  ran immediately to the apartment from whence  the voice issued  he no sooner entered  than  distinguishing his old  ship mate in a crowd of country peasants  he in a moment sprang upon  him  and  clapping his pistol to his breast  exclaimed    D  n you   Pipes  you are a dead man  if you don t immediately produce young  master    This menacing application had a much greater effect upon the company  than upon Tom  who  looking at the lieutenant with great tranquility   replied   Why so I can  Master Hatchway     What  safe and sound   cried  the other   As a roach   answered Pipes  so much to the satisfaction  of his friend Jack  that he shook him by the hand  and desired him  to proceed with his song  This being performed and the reckoning  discharged  the two friends adjourned to the other room  where the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   lieutenant was informed of the manner in which the young gentleman had  made his elopement from college  as well as of the other particulars of  his present situation  as far as they had fallen within the sphere of  his comprehension   While they sat thus conferring together  Peregrine  having taken  leave of his mistress for the night  came home  and was not a little  surprised  when Hatchway  entering his chamber in his sea attitude   thrust out his hand by way of salutation  His old pupil received him as  usual  with great cordiality  and expressed his astonishment at meeting  him in that place  but when he understood the cause and intention of  his arrival  he started with concern  and  his visage glowing with  indignation  told him he was old enough to be judge of his own conduct   and  when he should see it convenient  would return of himself  but  those who thought he was to be compelled to his duty  would find  themselves egregiously mistaken   The lieutenant assured him  that for his own part he had no intention to  offer him the least violence  but  at the same time  he represented  to him the danger of incensing the commodore  who was already almost  distracted on account of his absence  and  in short  conveyed his  arguments  which were equally obvious and valid  in such expressions of  friendship and respect  that Peregrine yielded to his remonstrances  and  promised to accompany him next day to Winchester   Hatchway  overjoyed at the success of his negotiation  went immediately  to the hostler and bespoke a post chaise for Mr  Pickle and his man with  whom he afterwards indulged himself in a double can of rumbo  and  when  the night was pretty far advanced  left the lover to his repose  or  rather to the thorns of his own meditation  for he slept not one moment   being incessantly tortured with the prospect of parting with his divine  Emilia  who had now acquired the most absolute empire over his soul  One  minute he proposed to depart early in the morning  without seeing this  enchantress  in whose bewitching presence he durst not trust his own  resolution  then the thoughts of leaving her in such an abrupt and  disrespectful manner interposed in favour of his love and honour  This  war of sentiments kept him all night upon the rack  and it was time to  rise before he had determined to visit his charmer  and candidly impart  the motives that induced him to leave her   He accordingly repaired to her mother s house with a heavy heart  being  attended to the gate by Hatchway  who did not choose to leave him alone   and being admitted  found Emilia just risen  and  in his opinion  more  beautiful than ever   Alarmed at his early visit  and the gloom that overspread his  countenance  she stood in silent expectation of hearing some melancholy  tidings  and it was not till after a considerable pause  that he  collected resolution enough to
