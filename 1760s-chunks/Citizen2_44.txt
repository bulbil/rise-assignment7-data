enough —for those that like them—but to me Thyrsis is one of the most insipid fellows I ever conversed with  and as for Corridon  I do not chuse his company  Elegies and epistles are very fine to those to whom they are addressed  and as for epic poems  I am generally able to discover the whole plan in reading the two first s   Tragedies  however  as they are now made  are good instructive moral sermons enough  and it would be a fault not to be pleased with good things  There I learn several great truths  as  that it is impossible to see into the ways of futurity  that   134 punishment always attends the villain  that love is the fond soother of the human breast  that we should not resist heaven s will  for in resisting heaven s will  heaven s will is resisted  with several other sentiments equally new  delicate and striking  Every new tragedy therefore I shall go to see  for reflections of this nature make a tolerable harmony  when mixed up with a proper quantity of drum  trumpet  thunder  lightening  or the scene shifter s whistle  Adieu   LETTER XCV  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   I HAD some intentions lately of going to visit Bedlam  the place where those who go mad are confined  I went to wait upon the man in black to be my conductor  but I found him preparing to go to Westminster hall  where the English hold their courts of Justice  It gave me some surprize to find my friend engaged in a lawsuit but more so when he informed me that it had been depending for several years  How is it possible  cried I  for a man who knows the world to go to law  I am well acquainted with the courts of justice in China  they resemble rat traps every one of them  nothing more easy to get in  but to get out again is attended with some d•fficu•ty  and more cunning than rats are generally found to possess   Faith  replied my friend  I should not have gone to law  but that I was assured of success before I began  things were presented to me in   135 so alluring a light  that I thought by barely declaring myself a candidate for the prize  I had nothing more to do but to enjoy the fruits of the victory  Thus have I been upon the eve of an imaginary triumph every term these ten years  have travelled forward with victory ever in my view  but ever out of reach  however  at present I fancy we have hampered our antagonist in such a manner  that without some unforeseen demur  we shall this very day lay him fairly on his back   If things be so situated  said I  I don t care if I attend you to the courts  and partake in the pleasure of your success  But prithee  continued I  as we set forward  what reasons have you to think an affair at last concluded  which has given you so many former disappointments  My lawyer tells me  returned he  that I have Salkeld and Ventris strong in my favour  and that there are no less then fifteen cases in point  I understand  said I  those are two of your judges who have already declared their opinions  Pardon me  replied my friend  Salkeld and Ventris are lawyers who some hundred years ago gave their opinion on cases similar to mine  these opinions which make for me my lawyer is to cite  and those opinions which look another way are cited by the lawyer employed by my antagonist  as I observed  I have Salkeld and Ventris for me  he has Coke and Hales  for him  and he that has most opinions is most likely to carry his cause  But where is the necessity  cried I  of prolonging a suit by citing the opinions and reports of others  since the same good sense which determined lawyers in former ages may serve to guide your judges at this day  They at that time gave their opinions only from the light of reason  your judges have the same light at   136 present to direct them  let me even add a greater  as in former ages  there were many prejudices from which the present is happily free  If arguing from authorities be exploded from every other branch of learning  why should it be particularly adhered to in this  I plainly foresee how such a method of investigation must embarrass every suit  and even perplex the student  ceremonies will be multiplied  formalities must encrease  and more time will thus be spent in learning the arts of litigation than in the discovery of right   I see  cries my friend  that you are for a speedy administration of justice  but all the world will grant that the more time that is taken up in considering any subject the better it will be understood  Besides  it is the boast of an Englishman  that his property is secure  and all the world will grant that a deliberate administration of justice is the best way to secure his property  Why have we so many lawyers  but to secure our property  why so many
