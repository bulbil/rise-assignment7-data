bad news   241 to Northamptonshire  without staying a day or two  when he might have carried better   Tis true  they will not permit me to quit my chamber yet  But that is rather for precautionary than necessary reasons  and they have given over chiding me for writing—Their indulgence to me of my pen will convince you  that I am quite well   Lady Clementina most sincerely rejoices in my recovery  Yet she is every day more and more thoughtful and solemn  She is grieved  she tells her mother  who is troubled at her Solemnity  for her brother Jeronymo  who indeed is not well  Mr  Lowther tells us  that he must not expect to be exampt from temporary pains and disorder  But I am sure the worthy man would be easier in his own mind  were his sister to give her hand to the Count of Belvedere   I talked to Sir Charles on this subject an hour ago  Lady Clementina  my dear Sir  said I  is not happy  I question whether she ever will  unless she is allowed her own way  the veil   And that  returned he  has been so long a familyobjection  that the compliance with her wishes  would break the heart of her mother  at least  and greatly afilict all the rest  It must not  for their sakes  be thought of   What then  Sir  can be done   We must have patience  my dearest life  Her malady has unsettled her noble mind  She must try her own schemes  and if she find not happiness in any of them  she will think of new ones  till at last she fixes  Nor  I hope  is the time far off   Do you think so  Sir   Don t you see  my Love  that the poor Lady is more and more uneasy with herself  Something is working in her mind  I have desired her mother to leave that disturbed mind to its own generous workings  Her vehemence  raised by the opposition she met with  which she considered as a persecution  has for some   242 time subsided  and she will probably fall upon reflexions which she had not time to attend to before   Jeronymo thinks  proceeded he  that I might successfully plead in the Count s favour—But did I not draw the articles  Did I not propose the terms  Lady Clementina shall not be prevaricated with  She shuns me of late—In apprehension  perhaps  that I will try my influence over her  She never seems so easy  as when she is with my dearest Love  You must preserve that consequence with her  which delicate minds will ever be of to one another  Some little appearances of her malady will perhaps  now and then  shew themselves  and unsettle her  But I have no doubt  if it please God to preserve her reason  that her present uneasinesses will be productive of some great change in her schemes  which may end in a tranquillity of mind  that will make all us who love her  happy  Meantime  my dear  let this be our rule  if you please  Let her lead  let us only follow—Persuasion against avowed inclination  you and I  my Harriet  have always condemned as a degree of compulsion  Had the admirable Lady been entreated to take the noble measure she fell upon  when she rejected me  however great the motives  she would not have been so happy  as she was  when she found herself absolute mistress of the question  and could astonish and surprise us all by her magnanimity   Who could resist this reasoning  How well does he seem to know this excellent woman  when he considers her unhappy unfixedness  occasioned by a malady  which will now and then  till she can be settled in some quiet and agreeable way  shew itself in her conduct  when she has any great part before her to act   Tuesday Afternoon  May 15   LADY Clementina  soon after dinner  sent up to me her Camilia  for I was not at table  to desire a quarter of an hour s discourse with me in my chamber    243 I gave direction  that nobody should come to me till I rang  She entered  saw me seated  took her seat by me  and immediately  with a noble frankness in her manner  thus began   I could not  my dear Lady Grandison  ask the favour of your ear on the subject I wanted to open my heart upon to you  till I saw you were perfectly recovered  God be praised  that you are  What anxieties did your late indisposition give me  I accused myself as the cause of it —I had engaged you  thoughtlesly  in too long a walk  You know how Lady G  how Lady L  were terrified  I overheard them once that evening talking over their fears to one another  Lady G  looked with visible unkindness upon me  My aid ineffectual  my person in the way  I hurried to my chamber  Good God  said I  every object looking strange about me  Where am I  What am I  Can I be the same Clementina della Porretta
