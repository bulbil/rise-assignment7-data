an action against him for desamation  —  While I was reflecting on this melancholy event  which had made me quite sober  the lady whose favours I had solicited  being piqued at some repartee that passed between us  cried    They are all concerned    and desired the constable to take us all into custody  which was performed instantly  to the utter astonishment and despair of us all  except Jackson  who   142 having been often in such scrapes was very little concerned  and charged the constable in his turn  with the landlady and her whole bevy  Upon which we were carried all together prisoners to the round house  where Jackson  after a word of comfort to us  informed the constable of his being robbed  to which he said he would swear next morning before the justice —   Ay  ay   says the bawd  we shall see whose oath will most signify  —  In a little time the constable calling Jackson into another room  spoke to him thus    I perceive that you and your company are strangers  and am very sorry for your being involved in such an ugly business as this is  I have known this woman a great while  she has kept a notorious house in the neighbourhood these many years  and although often complained of as a nuisance  still escapes thro  her interest with the J—t—ces  to whom she and all of her employment  pay contribution quarterly for protection —As she charged me with you first  her complaint will have the preference  and she can procure evidence to swear whatever she shall please to desire them  So that  unless you make it up before morning  you and your companions may think yourselves happily quit for a month s hard labour in Bridewell —Nay  if she should swear a robbery or assault against you  you will be committed to Newgate  and tried next sessions at the Old Baily for your life    This last piece of information had such an effect upon Jackson  that he agreed to make it up  provided his money might be restored  The constable told him  that instead of restoring what they had stol n  he was pretty certain  it would cost him some more before   143 they would come to any composition —But however  he had compassion on him  and would  if he pleased  sound them about a mutual release —The unfortunate beau thanked him for his friendship  and returned to us  where he acquainted us with the substance of this dialogue  while the constable desiring to speak in private with our adversary  carried her into the next room  and pleaded our cause so effectually  that she condescended to make him umpire  He accordingly proposed an arbitration  to which we gave our assent  and he fined each party in three shillings to be laid out in a bowl or punch  wherein we drowned all animosities  to the inexpressible joy of my two late acquaintances and me  who had been in the state of the damned ever since Jackson mentioned Bridewell and Newgate —By the time we had finished our bowl  to which  by the by  I had contributed my last shilling  it was morning  and I proposed to move homeward  when the constable gave me to understand  he could discharge no prisoners but by order of the justice  before whom we must appear —This renewed my regret  and I coursed the hour in which I had yielded to Jackson s invitation —About nine a clock we were escorted to the house of a certain justice not many miles distant from Covent Garden  who no sooner saw the constable enter with a train of prisoners at his heels  than he saluted him as follows    So  Mr  Constable  you are a diligent man—what den of rogues have you been scouring    Then looking at us  who appeared with a dejected air  he continued    Ay  ay  thieves  I see—old offenders—O your humble servant  Mrs  Harridan  I suppose these fellows have been taken robbing your house—yes  yes  here s an old   144 acquaintance of mine—you have used expedition  said he to me  in returning from transportation  but we shall save you that trouble for the future—the surgeons will fetch you from your next transportation at their expence    I assured his worship he was mistaken in me  for he had never seen me in his life before —To this he replied    How  you impudent rascal  dare you say so to my face  Do you think I am to be imposed upon by that northern accent which you have assumed  but it shan t avail you—you shall find me too far north for you —Here  clerk  write this fellow s mittimus—His name is Patrick Gaghagan  —  Here Mr  Jackson interposed  and told him  I was a Scotchman lately come to town  descended of a good family  and that my name was Random —The justice looked upon this declaration as an outrage against his memory  on which he valued himself much  and strutting up to Jackson  with a fierce countenance  put his hands in his sides  and said    Who are you  Sir —Do you give me the lie —Take notice  gentlemen
