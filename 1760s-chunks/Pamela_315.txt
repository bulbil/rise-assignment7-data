but was   resolved my duty should not be made second to bashfulness  or any other   consideration  and when divine service began  I withdrew to the farther   end of the pew  and left the gentlemen in the front  and they behaved   quite suitably  both of them  to the occasion  I mention this the   rather  because Mr  Martin was not very noted for coming to church  or   attention when there  before       The dean preached again  which he was not used to do  out of compliment   to us  and an excellent sermon he made on the relative duties of   Christianity  And it took my particular attention  for he made many   fine observations on the subject  Mr  Martin addressed himself twice or   thrice to me  during the sermon  but he saw me so wholly engrossed with   hearkening to the good preacher  that he forbore interrupting me  yet I   took care  according to the lessons formerly given me  to observe to   him a cheerful and obliging behaviour  as one of Mr  B     s friends and   intimates  My master asked him to give him his company to supper  and he   said  I am so taken with your lady  that you must not give me too much   encouragement  for I shall be always with you  if you do  He was pleased   to say  You cannot favour us with too much of your company  and as I   have left you in the lurch in your single state  I think you will do   well to oblige us as much as you can  and who knows but my happiness may   reform another rake  Who knows  said Mr  Martin  Why  I know  for I am   more than half reformed already       At the chariot door  Mrs  Arthur  Mrs  Brooks  and Mrs  Chambers  were   brought to me  by their respective spouses  and presently the witty Lady   Towers  who bantered me before   as I once told you   joined them  and   Mrs  Arthur said  she wished me joy  and that all the good ladies  my   neighbours  would collect themselves together  and make me a visit    This  said I  will be an honour  madam  that I can never enough   acknowledge  It will be very kind so to countenance a person who will   always study to deserve your favour  by the most respectful behaviour       Lady Towers said  My dear neighbour  you want no countenance  your own   merit is sufficient  I had a slight cold  that kept me at home in the   morning  but I heard you so much talked of  and praised  that I resolved   not to stay away in the afternoon  and I join in the joy every one gives   you  She turned to my master  and said  You are a sly thief  as I always   thought you  Where have you stolen this lady  And now  how barbarous is   it  thus unawares  in a manner  to bring her here upon us  to mortify   and eclipse us all   You are very kind  madam  said he  that you and all   my worthy neighbours see with my eyes  But had I not known she had so   much excellency of mind and behaviour  as would strike every body in her   favour at first sight  I should not have dared to class her with such of   my worthy neighbours  as now so kindly congratulate us both       I own  said she  softly  I was one of your censurers  but I never liked   you so well in my life  as for this action  now I see how capable your   bride is of giving distinction to any condition   And  coming to me  My   dear neighbour  said she  excuse me for having but in my thought  the   remembrance that I have seen you formerly  when  by your sweet air and   easy deportment  you so much surpass us all  and give credit to your   present happy condition       Dear good madam  said I  how shall I suitably return my acknowledgments    But it will never be a pain to me to look back upon my former days    now I have the kind allowance and example of so many worthy ladies to   support me in the honours to which the most generous of men has raised   me       Sweetly said  she was pleased to say  If I was in another place  I would   kiss you for that answer  Oh  happy  happy Mr  B      said she to my   master  what reputation have you not
