had now need of all his Fortitude  without shutting down the Sash  softly on Tip toe he stepped back again  took the Lanthorn  and hurried up Stairs into the back Garrets in Search for a Trapdoor or Casement  which opened upon   170the Leads  very luckily he found one quickly  out he got  and after a Trial or two  found the Gutter would bear him  along sideling he crept  his Hands upon the Tiles  until he was stopped by a Ladder  which lay standing in his Way  This he conjectured might have some Communication with others lower  and after some Time feeling about  for he had put out his Light  he found a Bundle of scaffolding Cords  one End of which he made fast to the uppermost Ladder  and depending on that  and in Hopes of more Ladders  he began to descend  what with sliding and scrambling  he found himself at last safe landed in a narrow Lane  just then he heard the Minster Clock strike One  guided by that Sound  he walked towards the Church yard  where he expected to find waiting for him a Friend  and a couple of fleet Horses   For  unknown to the Goalor d Lady  after he had fixed the Night and Hour in which he was to leave his Prison  he ordered one in whom he could confide  to be in the Minster yard with a Brace of Geldings when the Clock struck Twelve  and stay till Junior came  Jack rightly judging it was a Place which at that Time of Night few People   171would walk through  therefore his Groom and Cattle might secrete themselves there  and also Junior could find the Place more readily than any other   How did the Person in Waiting rejoice  when he heard Junior whistle the Signal  Not that it was Joy  proceeding from a Heart felt Satisfaction  to hear his Friend was at Liberty—no—he was glad he had got Company  For Mr  Junior s Assistant  tho  one of the boldest Fellows living  nay  had actually fought a Duel  yet began to be very uneasy  as he staid among the Graves and Tomb stones  a cold Sweat bedewed his Face and Breast  and he was at last so far Pannic struck  that when the Clock went Twelve  he would have left Junior to get off alone  as well as he could  but had not Strength to get from the Tomb stone on which he had laid himself at Length upon his Breast  his Hands cross his Eyes   There is something so tremenduously gloomifical as Mr      observes  in a Church yard at Midnight  and only then  as must appal the stoutest among Men  This was what the Person declared to Junior  after they had got the Town upon their Backs  saying  Look ye  Jack Junior  tho  as to Religion  to be sure  I know it all to be Priestcraft    172and as to Parsons  they are no more knowing than other Men—How should they  You know  and every Body else knows  I a nt afeard of nothing  yet  damme  if ever I was so out of Sorts as I was  when I was among them Tomb stones  and if I could have said the Lord s Prayer by Heart  or any Thing about the Bible  I believe I should have pattered nothing else all the Time after the Clock struck Twelve  for  curse me  Jack Junior  tho  Iv e more Sense than to believe a Word what such Fellurs as Parsons Jaw  yet I ll hold five Pound to a Shilling  and I say done first  that no Man in the World can stay in a Church yard at Midnight  without sweating for it   Here would we give you the Answer his Companion made him  but they both began to gallop along so fast  having found themselves on the Turnpike Road  that they were too soon out of Ear shot  for us to take down  even in short Hand  the rest of their Conversation   Now to return to the Prison keeper  after he and his Followers had waited themselves out of all Patience  he dispatched his Wife back  to go into the   173very Place to which she had inducted Junior  and see what was become of him  As soon as she had been all over the House  she bawled out of the Window Jack had left open  Oh Lord  he s got out a Top  he has got out a Top  The empty House Street door they cou dn t force open  Junior had the Key in his Pocket  they were forced to go round through the Goal  and they soon discovered the Trap door open  but not one would venture out  alledging  they had Families  and who d maintain their poor Babes  if any Thing misfortunable was to happen to themselves   The Alarm by this Time was spread through the Neighbourhood  that the Gentleman Murderer had made his Escape  the Mayor was informed of it  and he sent immediately for the Goalor  to be ascertained of the Truth of the Report   When her Spouse went to wait upon the Mayor  Madam  the Goalor s Lady retired to her Bed chamber
