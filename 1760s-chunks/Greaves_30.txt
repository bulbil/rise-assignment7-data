resumed the nephew   consider what people will say—all the world will think you mad    Set thy heart at ease  Tom   cried the seaman   I ll have a trip to and again in this here channel  Mad  what then  I think for my part one half of the nation is mad—and the other not very sound—I don t see why I han t as good a right to be mad as another man—but  doctor  as I was saying  I d be bound to you  if you would direct me where I can buy that same tackle that all arrant must wear  as for the matter of the long pole  headed with iron  I d never desire better than a good boat hook  and could make a special good target of that there tin sconce that holds the candle—mayhap any blacksmith will hammer me a skull cap  d ye see  out of an old brass kettle  and I can call my horse by the name of my ship  which was Mufti    The surgeon was one of those wags who can laugh inwardly  without exhibiting the least outward mark of mirth or satisfaction  He at once perceived the amusement which might be drawn from this strange disposition of the sailor  together with the most likely means which could be used to divert him from such an extravagant pursuit  He therefore tipped Clarke the wink with one side of his face  while the other was very gravely turned to the captain  whom he addressed to this effect   It is not far from hence to Sheffield  where you might be fitted completely in half a day—then you must wake your armour in church or chapel  and be dubbed  As for this last ceremony  it may be performed by any person whatsoever  Don Quixote was dubbed by his landlord  and there are many instances on record  of errants obliging and compelling the next person they met to cross their shoulders  and dub them knights  I myself would undertake to be your godfather  and I have interest enough to procure the keys of the parish church that stands hard by  besides  this is the eve of St  Martin  who was himself a knight errant  and therefore a proper patron to a novitiate  I wish we could borrow Sir Launcelot s armour for the occasion    Crowe  being struck with this hint  started up  and laying his fingers on his lips to enjoin silence  walked off softly on his tiptoes  to listen at the door of our knight s apartment  and judge whether or not he was asleep  Mr  Fillet took this opportunity to tell his nephew that it would be in vain for him to combat this humour with reason and argument  but the most effectual way of diverting him from the plan of knight errantry would be  to frighten him heartily while he should keep his vigil in the church  towards the accomplishment of which purpose he craved the assistance of the misanthrope as well as the nephew  Clarke seemed to relish the scheme  and observed  that his uncle  though endued with courage enough to face any human danger  had at bottom a strong fund of superstition  which he had acquired  or at least improved  in the course of a sea life  Ferret  who perhaps would not have gone ten paces out of his road to save Crowe from the gallows  nevertheless engaged as an auxiliary  merely in hope of seeing a fellow creature miserable  and even undertook to be the principal agent in this adventure  For this office indeed he was better qualified than they could have imagined  In the bundle which he kept under his greatcoat  there was  together with divers nostrums  a small vial of liquid phosphorus  sufficient  as he had already observed  to frighten a whole neighbourhood out of their senses   In order to concert the previous measures without being overheard  these confederates retired with a candle and lantern into the stable  and their backs were scarce turned  when Captain Crowe came in loaded with pieces of the knight s armour  which he had conveyed from the apartment of Sir Launcelot  whom he had left fast asleep   Understanding that the rest of the company were gone out for a moment  he could not resist the inclination he felt of communicating his intention to the landlady  who  with her daughter  had been too much engaged in preparing Crabshaw s supper  to know the purport of their conversation  The good woman  being informed of the captain s design to remain alone all night in the church  began to oppose it with all her rhetoric  She said it was setting his Maker at defiance  and a wilful running into temptation  She assured him that all the country knew that the church was haunted by spirits and hobgoblins  that lights had been seen in every corner of it  and a tall woman in white had one night appeared upon the top of the tower  that dreadful shrieks were often heard to come from the south aisle  where a murdered man had been buried  that she herself had seen the cross on the steeple all a fire  and one evening as she passed a horseback close by the stile at the entrance into the churchyard  the horse stood still  sweating and trembling
