 especially for a man who had not taken   the least pains to inspire it  Sometimes he imagined it was a trick put   upon him  in order to make trial how far his vanity would extend in   boasting of it  it even came into his head  that Miss Betsy herself   might get somebody to personate the amorous incognita  for no other   purpose than to divert herself  and disappoint his high raised   expectation  but this last conjecture dwelt not long upon him  he had   heard she now entertained another lover  which whom she was very much   taken up  and  consequently  would not give herself so much trouble   about one who had entirely quitted her  In fine  he knew not what to   think  as he could not tell how to believe he had made such an   impression upon any woman  without knowing it  as the incognita   pretended  he was apt to imagine he should neither see nor hear any more   of her  This uncertainty  however  employed his mind the whole day  and   he was no less impatient for the proof  than he would have been  if   actually in love with this invisible mistress       The wished for hour at last arrived  and he waited not long before he   was eased of one part of his suspense  by being told a lady in a   hackney coach enquired for him  he was extremely pleased to find  at   last  he had not been imposed upon by a trick of any of his frolicksome   companions  and immediately flew to the coach side  where  seeing it was   indeed his incognita  he jumped directly in  with a transport which   doubtless was very agreeable to her       Though he had often heard some gentlemen speak of houses  where two   persons of different sexes might at any time be received  and have the   privilege of entertaining each other with all the freedom and privacy   they could desire  yet  as he had never been accustomed to intrigues of   this nature  and thought he should have no occasion to make use of such   places  he had not given himself the trouble of asking where they might   be found  therefore he had now no other recourse than either a tavern or   a bagnio  the latter of which he looked upon  for more reasons than one    as the most commodious of the two  so ordered the coachman to drive to   one in Silver Street  he excused himself  at the same time  to the lady    for not having been able to provide a better asylum for her reception    but she appeared perfectly content  told him she had put herself under   his care  relied upon his honour and discretion  and left all to his   direction       Being come into the bagnio  they were shewn into a handsome large room    with a bed chamber in it  Mr  Trueworth had his eye on every thing in an   instant  and finding all was right  ordered a supper to be prepared  and   then told the waiter he would dispense with his attendance till it was   ready  As soon as he found himself alone with his incognita   Now  my   angel   said he  embracing her   I have an opportunity to thank you for   the affection you have flattered me with the hopes of  but  at the same   time  must complain of the little proofs you give me of it  the greatest   stranger to your heart would be allowed the privilege of a salute  yet I   am denied the privilege of touching those dear lips which have denounced   my happiness     Do not reproach me   answered she   with denying what   is not yet in my power to grant  I cannot let you see my face  and you   have promised not to force me     I have   replied he   but that promise   binds me not from indulging my impatient wishes with things you have not   stipulated  your neck  your breasts  are free  and those I will be   revenged upon   With these words he took some liberties with her  which   may better be conceived than described   she but faintly resisted  and    perhaps  would have permitted him to take greater  thus masked  but the   discovery of her face was what he chiefly wanted   You might  at least     cried he   oblige me with a touch of those lovely lips I am forbid to   gaze upon  here is a dark recess   continued he  pointing to the   inner room   will save your blushes   He then raised her from the   chair  and  drawing her gently towards the door  sung in a
