me  my Cecilia  I would wish to be alone for to day  It was not yet a season to administer consolation  and I withdrew   She staid in London but two days after this  when  as she had before resolved  she retired to an estate in Buckinghamshire  which her kinsman had purchased and settled on her for ever   With her brother’s consent  she took Master Faulkland with her     and prevailed on Mr Price to accompany her into the country  to whom she committed the care of the child’s education   Mr Warner  whom she had acquainted by letter with her intention  approved of the step she had taken  He returned to England in about three weeks after her departure from her house in town  which she had left for his reception just as he had fitted it up for her   Before I accompany Mrs Arnold into her solitude  I shall just briefly mention some other persons who were connected with her story   The relations of Mr Faulkland  as he had foreseen  claimed his estate  and at length obtained it  the illegitimacy of the child being proved   The wretched Mrs Faulkland  abandoned and despised  returned to England  but as she was there hated and shunned by every one  she remained in obscurity for a few years  and then died unpitied and unlamented   I now return to Mrs Arnold  who  settled in her quiet retreat in the country  it might be hoped would have passed the remainder of her days undisturbed by any new calamity   That only source of true heroism of soul  religion  had all along supported  and prevented her from sinking under the most trying afflictions  Many and bitter were the sufferings she had already endured  but she was  to use her own words  Set up as a mark  and the deep afflictions that still pursued her  and clouded even her latter days with misfortunes  may serve to shew that it is not here that true virtue is to look for its reward  I saw her at a time when this reflection  as it had been her chief  so was it her last and only consolation   Possessed as she was of an admirable understanding  and an enlarged mind  in the deepest solitude she had always resources of entertainment within herself  Her natural disposition ever sweet and complying  was improved by her sufferings into a patience very rare in woman  and a resignation imbibed at first from a rigid education  was heightened by religion into an almost saint like meekness and humility   I shall pass over the first ten years of her retirement  in which nothing material happened but the marriage of the amiable Patty Main to a gentleman of a large estate  and the death of her worthy kinsman Mr Warner  who bequeathed her his whole fortune   Miss Arnold  her eldest daughter  was now something more than    fifteen  and fulfilled the promise her childhood gave  of her being a perfect beauty  Miss Cecilia was about a year younger  and though not so handsome as her sister  was accounted one of the finest young ladies of her time   With what delight have I seen this excellent mother  while these two charming young creatures were all attention  relate to them the extraordinary and affecting incidents of her life   This  said she  I do  not as a murmurer at my fate  nor to move your pity at my misfortunes  but to teach you by my example  that there is no situation in life exempt from trouble  It found me under the tender care of the best of parents  it pursued me into my husband’s house  In my virgin state  when I was a wife  and in my widowhood  I was equally persecuted   Poverty  I once thought  would have exempted me from every ill  but what its own hand inflicted  and had it remained my companion  the bitterest misfortune of my love would have been prevented  for  if wealth had not accompanied my hand  the world could not have persuaded me to yield it to Mr Faulkland   Do not therefore pride yourselves on the great fortunes you are likely to possess  I have received no other satisfaction in mine  than what arose from the benefits I have conferred on others   By such lessons as these  did this tender parent endeavour to fortify their young minds against the vicissitudes of fortune  and to teach them not to place their confidence in riches   She dwelt so often upon this theme  that she seemed to have a presentiment of those evils  which were now ready to pour in like a torrent upon her   Gracious Heaven  how inscrutable are thy ways  Her affluent fortune  the very circumstance which seemed to promise her  in the eve of life  some compensation for the miseries she had endured in her early days  now proved the source of new and dreadful calamities to her  which  by involving the unhappy daughters of an unhappy mother in scenes of the most exquisite distress  cut off from her even the last resource of hope in this life  and rendered the close of her history still more          Here the lady’s narrative breaks
