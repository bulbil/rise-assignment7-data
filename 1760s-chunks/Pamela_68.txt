and words       He has an apartment in the house  but is mostly at a lodging in the   town  for a conveniency of his little school  only on Saturday afternoon   and Sundays  and he preaches sometimes for the minister of the village    which is about three miles off       I hope to go to church with him to morrow  Sure it is not in her   instructions to deny me  He can t have thought of every thing  And   something may strike out for me there       I have asked her  for a feint   because she shan t think I am so well   provided   to indulge me with pen and ink  though I have been using my   own so freely when her absence would let me  for I begged to be left to   myself as much as possible  She says she will let me have it  but then   I must promise not to send any writing out of the house  without her   seeing it  I said  it was only to divert my grief when I was by myself    as I desired to be  for I loved writing as well as reading  but I had   nobody to send to  she knew well enough       No  not at present  may be  said she  but I am told you are a great   writer  and it is in my instructions to see all you write  So  look you   here  said she  I will let you have a pen and ink  and two sheets of   paper  for this employment will keep you out of worse thoughts  but I   must see them always when I ask  written or not written  That s very   hard  said I  but may I not have to myself the closet in the room where   we lie  with the key to lock up my things  I believe I may consent to   that  said she  and I will set it in order for you  and leave the key   in the door  And there is a spinnet too  said she  if it be in tune  you   may play to divert you now and then  for I know my old lady learnt you    And below is my master s library  you may take out what books you will       And  indeed  these and my writing will be all my amusement  for I have   no work given me to do  and the spinnet  if in tune  will not find my   mind  I am sure  in tune to play upon it  But I went directly and picked   out some books from the library  with which I filled a shelf in the   closet she gave me possession of  and from these I hope to receive   improvement  as well as amusement  But no sooner was her back turned    than I set about hiding a pen of my own here  and another there  for   fear I should come to be denied  and a little of my ink in a broken   China cup  and a little in another cup  and a sheet of paper here and   there among my linen  with a little of the wax  and a few wafers  in   several places  lest I should be searched  and something  I thought    might happen to open a way for my deliverance  by these or some   other means  O the pride  thought I  I shall have  if I can secure my   innocence  and escape the artful wiles of this wicked master  For  if   he comes hither  I am undone  to be sure  For this naughty woman will   assist him  rather than fail  in the worst of his attempts  and he ll   have no occasion to send her out of the way  as he would have done Mrs    Jervis once  So I must set all my little wits at work       It is a grief to me to write  and not to be able to send to you what I   write  but now it is all the diversion I have  and if God will favour my   escape with my innocence  as I trust he graciously will  for all these   black prospects  with what pleasure shall I read them afterwards       I was going to say  Pray for your dutiful daughter  as I used  but    alas  you cannot know my distress  though I am sure I have your prayers    And I will write on as things happen  that if a way should open  my   scribble may be ready to be sent  For what I do  must be at a jerk  to   be sure       O how I want such an
