his manner without which the most sensible sermon has very little effect on the hearers  The organ  which my Lord gave  is excellent  You know I think music an essential part of public worship  used as such by the wisest nations  and commanded by God himself to the Mews  it has indeed so admirable an effect in disposing the mind to devotion  that I think it should never be omitted      Our Sundays here are extremely pleasant  we have  after evening service  a moving rural picture from the windows of the saloon  in the villagers  for whose amusement the gardens are that day thrown open        Our rustic Mall is full from five till eight  and there is an inexpressible pleasure in contemplating so many groups of neat  healthy  happy looking people  enjoying the diversion of waling in these lovely          1 180       shades  by the kindness of their beneficent Lord  who not only provides for their wants  but their pleasures      My Lord is of opinion that Sunday was intended as a day of rejoicing  not of mortification  and meant not only to render our praises to our benevolent Creator  but to give rest and chearful relaxation to the industrious part of mankind  from the labors of the week        On this principle  though he will never suffer the least breach of the laws in being  he wishes the severity of them softened  by allowing some innocent amusements after the duties of the day are past  he thinks this would prevent those fumes of enthusiasm which have had here such fatal effects  and could not be offensive to that gracious Power who delights in the happiness of his creatures  and who  by the royal poet  has commanded them to praise him in the cymbals and dances            1 181          For my own part  having seen the good effect of this liberty in catholic countries  I cannot help wishing  though a zealous protestant  that we were to imitate them in this particular        It is worth observing  that the book of sports was put forth by the pious  the religious  the sober Charles the First  and the law for the more strict observation of Sunday passed in the reign of the libertine Charles the Second        Love of pleasure is natural to the human heart  and the best preservative against criminal ones is  a proper indulgence in such as are innocent        These are my sentiments  and I am happy in finding Lord Belmont of the same opinion  Adio     A  Wilmot           1 182         To George Mordaunt  Esq   Monday      MORDAUNT  the die is cast  and the whole happiness of my life hangs on the present moment  After having kept the letter confessing my passion two days without having resolution to deliver it  this morning in the garden  being a moment alone with Lady Julia in a summer house  the company at some distance  I assumed courage to lay it on a table whilst she was looking out at a window which had a prospect that engaged all her attention  when I laid it down  I trembled  a chillness seized my whole frame  my heart dy d within me  I withdrew instantly  without even staying to see if she took it up  I waited at a little distance hid in a close arbour of woodbines  my heart throbbing with apprehension  and           1 183       by the time she staid in the summer house  had no doubt of her having seen the letter  When she appeared  I was still more convinced  she came out with a timid air  and looked round as if fearful of surprize  the lively crimson flushed her cheek  and was succeeded by a dying paleness  I attempted to follow  but had not courage to approach her  I suffered her to pass the arbor where I was  and advance slowly towards the house  when she was out of sight  I went back to the summer house  and found the letter was gone  I have not seen her  I am called to dinner  my limbs will scarce support me  how shall I bear the first sight of Lady Julia  how be able to meet her eyes      I have seen her  but my fate is yet undetermined  she has avoided my eyes  which I have scarce dared to raise from the ground  I once looked at her when she did          1 184       not observe me  and saw a melancholy on her countenance  which stabbed me to the soul  I have given sorrow to the heart of her  whom I would wish to be ever most happy  and to whose good I would sacrifise the dearest hope of
