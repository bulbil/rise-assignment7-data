be more rife  he was suspected of being a spy of Portugal  and it was thought but fair play to give a hint for my own good  This intimation troubled me  Thought I to myself  should this turn out to be a fact  I stand a chance for seeing the inside of a prison at Madrid  My innocence will be no security  my past ill usage makes me look on justice with antipathy  Twice have I experienced that if the innocent are not condemned in a lump with the guilty  at least the rights of hospitality are too little regarded in their persons to make it pleasant to pass a summer in the purlieus of the law   I consulted Melendez in so delicate a conjuncture  He was at a loss how to advise me  Though he could not bring himself to believe that my master was a spy  he had no reason to be confident on the other side of the question  I determined to watch my employer  and to leave him if he turned out to be an enemy of the state  but then prudence and personal comfort required me to be certain of my fact  I began  therefore  to pry into his actions  and to sound him  Sir  said I one evening while he was undressing  I do not know how one ought to live so as to be secure from reflections  The world is very scurrilous  We  among others  have neighbours not worth a curse  Sad dogs  You have no notion how they talk of us  Do they indeed  Gil Blas  quoth he  Be it so  but what can they say of us  my friend  Ah  truly  replied I  evil tongues never want a whet  Virtue herself furnishes weapons for her own martyrdom  Our neighbours say that we are dangerous people  that we ought to be looked after by government  in a word  you are taken for a spy of Portugal  In throwing out this hint  I looked hard at my master  just as Alexander squinted at his physician  and pursed up all my penetration to remark upon the effect of my intelligence  There seemed to be a hitch in the muscles of my mysterious lord  altogether in unison with the suspicions of the neighbourhood  and he fell into a brown study  which bore no very auspicious interpretation  However  he put a better face on the matter  and said with sufficient composure  Gil Blas  leave our neighbours to discourse as they please  but let not our repose depend on their judgments  Never mind what they think of us  provided our own consciences do not wince   Hereupon he went to bed  and I did the like  without knowing what course to take  The next day  just as we were on the point of going out in the morning  we heard a violent knocking at the outer door on the staircase  My master opened the inner  and looked through the grate  A well dressed man said to him  Please your honour  I am an alguazil  come to inform you that Mr Corregidor wishes to speak a word with you  What does he want  answered my pattern of secrecy  That is more than I know  sir  replied the alguazil  but you have only to go and wait on him  you will soon be informed  I am his most obedient  quoth my master  I have no business with him  At the tail of this speech  he banged the inner door  then  after walking up and down a little while  like one who pondered on the discourse of the alguazil  he put my six rials into my hand  and said  Gil Blas  you may go out  my friend  for my part  I shall stay at home a little longer  but have no occasion for you  He made an impression on my mind  by these words  that he was afraid of being taken up  and was therefore obliged to remain in his apartments  I left him there  and  to see how far my suspicions were founded  hid myself in a place whence I could see if he went out  I should have had patience to have staid there all the morning  if he had not saved me the trouble  But an hour after  I saw him walk the street with an ease and confidence which dumb  founded my sagacity  Yet far from yielding to these appearances  I mistrusted them  for my verdict went to condemnation  I considered his easy carriage as put on  and his staying at home as a finesse to secure his gold and jewels  when probably he was going to consult his safety by speedy flight  I had no idea of seeing him again  and doubted whether I should attend at his door in the evening  so persuaded was I  that the day would see him on the outside of the city  as his only refuge from impending danger  Yet I kept my appointment  when  to my extreme surprise  my master returned as usual  He went to bed without betraying the least uneasiness  and got up the next morning with the same composure   Just as he had finished dressing  another knock at the door  My master looked through
