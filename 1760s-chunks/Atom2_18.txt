the Buponian religion  which must fall of course with its great protector Brutan tiffi  whom he foresaw the new ministry would immediately abandon   This address threw Legion into such a qnandary  that it rolled itself in the dirt  and yelled hideously  Mean while the Orator retreating to a cell in the neighbourhood of Meaco  hired the common crier to go round the streets and proclaim that Taycho  being no longer in a condition to afford any thing but the bare necessaries of life  would by public sale dispose of his ambling mule and furniture  together with an ermined robe of his wife  and the greater part of his kitchen utensils  At this time he was well known   103 to be worth upwards of twenty thousand gold Obans  nevertheless  the Mobile discharging this circumstance entirely from their reflection  attended to nothing but the object which the Orator was pleased to present  They thought it was a piteous case  and a great scandal upon the government  that such a patriot  who had saved the nation from ruin and disgrace  should be reduced to the cruel necessity of selling his mule and his houshold furniture  Accordingly they raised a clamour that soon rung in the ears of Gio gio and his favourite   It was supposed that Mura clami suggested on this occasion to his countryman Yak strot  the hint of offering a pension to Taycho  by way of remuneration for his past services     If he refuses it   said he  the offer will at least reflect some credit upon the Dairo and the administration  but  should he accept of it   which is   104 much more likely  it will either stop his mouth entirely  or expose him to the censure of the people  who now adore him as a mirrour of disinterested integrity    The advice was instantly complied with  the Dairo signed a patent for a very ample pension to Taycho and his heirs  which patent Yak strot delivered to him next day at his cell in the country  This miracle of patriotism received the bounty as a turnpike man receives the toll  and then slapped his door full in the face of the favourite  yet  nothing of what Mura clami had prognosticated  came to pass  The many tailed monster  far from calling in question the Orator s disinterestedness  considered his acceptance of the pension as a proof of his moderation  in receiving such a trifling reward for the great services he had done his country  and the generosity of the Dairo  instead of exciting   105 the least emotion of gratitude in Taycho s own breast  acted only as a golden key to unlock all the sluices of his virulence and abuse     These  however  he kept within bounds until he should see what would be the fate of Brut an tiffi  who now seemed to be in the condition of a criminal at the foot of the ladder  In this dilemma  he obtained a very unexpected reprieve  Before the army of the Mantchoux could take the least advantage of the settlement they had made on his frontiers  their empress died  and was succeeded by a weak prince  who no sooner ascended the throne than he struck up a peace with the Tartar freebooter  and even ordered his troops to join him against the Ostrog  to whom they had hitherto acted as auxiliaries  Such an accession of strength would have cast the balance   106 greatly in his favour  had not Providence once more interposed  and brought matters again to an equilibrium   Taycho no sooner perceived his ally thus unexpectedly delivered from the dangers that surrounded him  than he began to repent of his own resignation  and resolved once more  to force his way to the helm  by the same means he had so successfully used before  He was  indeed  of such a turbulent disposition as could not relish the repose of private life  and his spirit so corrosive  that it would have preyed upon himself  if he could not have found external food for it to devour  He therefore began to prepare his engines  and provide proper emissaries to bespatter  and raise a hue and cry against Yak strot at a convenient season  not doubting but an occasion would soon present itself  considering the temper  inexperience  and prejudices of this Ximian politician    107 together with the pacific system he had adopted  so contrary to the present spirit of the blatant beast   In these preparations he was much comforted and assisted by his kinsman and pupil Lob kob  who entered into his measures with surprizing zeal  and had the good luck to light on such instruments as were admirably suited to the work in hand  Yak strot was extremely pleased at the secession of Taycho  who had been a very troublesome collegue to him in the administration  and run counter to all the schemes he had projected for the good of the empire  He now found himself at liberty to follow his own inventions  and being naturally an enthusiast  believed himself born to be the saviour of Japan  Some efforts  however  he made to acquire popularity  proved fruitless  Perceiving the people were  by the Orator s instigations    108 exasperated against the king of Corea  he sent a peremptory message to that prince demanding a categorical answer
