of affectation in her particular attention to me  I cannot help thinking her artful       Perhaps I am prejudiced  she may be amiable  but I will own she does not please me       Rivers begged me to have a friendship for her  I am afraid this is more than is in my power  friendship  like love  is the child of sympathy  not of constraint       Adieu  Yours   EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CXI   111   To Miss MONTAGUE   Monday   THE inclosed  my dear  is as much to you as to me  perhaps more  I pardon the lady for thinking you the handsomest  Is not this the strongest proof I could give of my friendship  perhaps I should have been piqued  however  had the preference been given by a man  but I can with great tranquillity allow you to be the women s beauty       Dictate an answer to your little Bell  who waits your commands at her bureau   Adieu     To Miss FERMOR  at Silleri   Monday        You and your lovely friend obliged me beyond words  my dear Bell  by your visit of yesterday  Madame Des Roches is charmed with you both  you will not be displeased when I tell you she gives Emily the preference  she says she is beautiful as an angel  that she should think the man insensible  who could see her without love  that she is touchant  to use her own word  beyond any thing she ever beheld        She however does justice to your charms  though Emily s seem to affect her most  She even allows you to be perhaps more the taste of men in general        She intends paying her respects to you and Emily this afternoon  and has sent to desire me to conduct her  As it is so far  I would wish to find you at home        Yours    ED  RIVERS      LETTER CXII   112   To Miss FERMOR   ALWAYS Madame Des Roches  but let her come  indeed  my dear  she is artful  she gains upon him by this appearance of generosity  I cannot return it  I do not love her  yet I will receive her with politeness       He is to drive her too  but  tis no matter  if the tenderest affection can secure his heart  I have nothing to fear  loving him as I do  it is impossible not to be apprehensive  indeed  my dear  he knows not how I love him   Adieu   Your EMILY     LETTER CXIII   113   To Miss FERMOR   Monday evening   SURELY I am the weakest of my weak sex  I am ashamed to tell you all my feelings  I cannot conquer my dislike to Madame Des Roches  she said a thousand obliging things to me  she praised my Rivers  I made her no answer  I even felt tears ready to start  what must she think of me  there is a meanness in my jealousy of her  which I cannot forgive myself       I cannot account for her attention to me  it is not natural  she behaved to me not only with politeness  but with the appearance of affection  she seemed to feel and pity my confusion  She is either the most artful  or the most noble of women       Adieu   Your  EMILY     LETTER CXIV   114   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  March 29   WE are going to dine at a farm house in the country  where we are to meet other company  and have a ball  the snow begins a little to soften  from the warmth of the sun  which is greater than in England in May  Our winter parties are almost at an end       My father drives Madame Des Roches  who is of our party  and your brother Emily  I hope the little fool will be easy now  Lucy  she is very humble  to be jealous of one  who  though really very pleasing  is neither so young nor so handsome as herself  and who professes to wish only for Rivers s friendship       But I have no right to say a word on this subject  after having been so extremely hurt at Fitzgerald s attention to such a woman as Madame La Brosse  an attention too which was so plainly meant to pique me       We are all  I am afraid  a little absurd in these affairs  and therefore ought to have some degree of indulgence for others       Emily and I  however  differ in our ideas of love  it is the business of her life  the amusement of mine   tis the food of her hours  the seasoning of mine       Or  in other words  she loves like a foolish woman  I like a sensible man  for men  you know  compared to women  love in about the proportion of one to twenty        Tis a mighty wrong thing
