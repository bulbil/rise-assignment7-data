  CHAPTER XIV       Shews that Miss Betsy  whenever she pleased to exert herself  had it in   her power to be discreet  even on occasions the most tempting to her   honour and inclinations          Soon after Miss Betsy had sent away what she thought would be a final   answer to Sir Frederick  her brother Frank came in  she immediately   shewed him the letter she had received that morning  and related to him   in what manner she had behaved concerning it  with which he was   extremely pleased  and said more tender things to her than any she had   heard from him since he came to town        This is a way of acting  my dear sister   said he   which  if you   persevere in  will infallibly gain you the esteem of all who know you    for while you encourage the addresses of every idle fop  believe me  you   will render yourself cheap  and lose all your merit with the sensible   part of mankind        If she was not quite of his opinion in this point  she offered no   arguments in opposition to the remarks he made  and assured him  as she   had done once before  that she would never give any man the least   grounds to hope she approved his pretensions  till she had first   received the sanction of both his and her brother Thoughtless s   approbation       He then told her that they had received intelligence  that the India   ship  which they heard was to bring Mr  Edward Goodman  was safely   arrived in the Downs  so that  in all likelihood  that gentleman would   be in London in two or three days at farthest   Which I am very glad   of   said he   for  though I believe the lawyer a very honest  diligent   man  as any can be of his profession  the presence of the heir will give   a life to the cause  and may bring things to a more speedy issue        He also told her that a gentleman of her brother s acquaintance had the   day before received a letter from Sir Ralph Trusty  intimating that he   should be obliged  by the death of Mr  Goodman  there being affairs of   consequence between them  to come to town much sooner than he had   intended  and that he should bring his lady with him   And then  my dear   sister   said he   you will be happy  for a time at least  in the   conversation and advice of one who  I am certain  in her good wishes for   you  deserves to be looked upon by you as a second mother        He was going on in some farther commendations of that worthy lady  when   Miss Betsy s man came to the dining room door  and told her that Mr    Munden was below in the parlour  and would wait on her if she was at   leisure  Mr  Francis perceiving she was hesitating what answer to make    cried hastily   Pray  sister  admit him  This is lucky  now I shall see   how much he excels Mr  Trueworth in person and parts     I never told   you   answered she   that he did so in either  but perhaps he may in his   good opinion and esteem for me  however  I think you promised never to   mention Trueworth again to me  I wish you would keep your word     Well    I have done   said he   do not keep the gentleman waiting   On which she   bade the footman desire Mr  Munden to walk up       That gentleman was a good deal disconcerted in his mind concerning the   little progress his courtship had made with Miss Betsy  he had followed   her for a considerable time  been at a great expence in treating and   making presents to her  he had studied her humour  and done every thing   in his power to please her  yet thought himself as far from the   completion of his wishes as when he began his addresses to her  he had   not for several days had an opportunity of speaking one word to her in   private  she was either abroad when he came  or so engaged in company   that his presence served only to fill a vacant seat in her   dining room  he therefore determined to know what fate he was to expect   from her       As he had not been told any body was now with her  and had never seen   Mr  Francis before  he was a little startled on his coming into the   room  to
