 for we   were all to blame  to make madam  here  fly the pit  as she did  Little   did we think we made her quit her own house       Thou always  said my lady  sayest too much  or too little       Mrs  Worden said  I have been treated with so much goodness and   condescension since you went  that I have been beforehand  sir  in   asking pardon myself       So my lady sat down with me half an hour  and told me  that her brother   had carried her a fine airing  and had quite charmed her with his kind   treatment of her  and had much confirmed her in the good opinion she had   begun to entertain of my discreet and obliging behaviour  But  continued   she  when he would make me visit  without intending to stay  my old   neighbours   for  said she  Lady Jones being nearest  we visited her   first  and she scraped all the rest of the company together   they were   all so full of your praises  that I was quite borne down  and  truly  it   was Saul among the prophets       You may believe how much I was delighted with this  and I spared not my   due acknowledgments       When her ladyship took leave  to go to bed  she said  Goodnight to you    heartily  and to your good man  I kissed you when I came in  out of   form  but I now kiss you out of more than form  I ll assure you       Join with me  my dear parents  in my joy for this happy turn  the   contrary of which I so much dreaded  and was the only difficulty I had   to labour with  This poor Miss Sally Godfrey  I wonder what s become   of her  poor soul  I wish he would  of his own head  mention her   again   Not that I am very uneasy  neither   You ll say  I must be a   little saucy  if I was       My dear master gave me an account  when we went up  of the pains he had   taken with his beloved sister  as he himself styled her  and of all   the kind things the good families had said in my behalf  and that he   observed she was not so much displeased with hearing them  as she was   at first  when she would not permit any body to speak of me as his wife    And that my health  as his spouse  being put  when it came to her  she   drank it  but said  Come  brother  here s your Pamela to you  But I   shall not know how to stand this affair  when the Countess      and the   young ladies  come to visit me  One of these young ladies was the person   she was so fond of promoting a match for  with her brother   Lady Betty    I know  she said  will rally me smartly upon it  and you know  brother    she wants neither wit nor satire  He said  I hope  Lady Betty  whenever   she marries  will meet with a better husband than I should have   made her  for  in my conscience  I think I should hardly have made a   tolerable one to any but Pamela       He told me that they rallied him on the stateliness of his temper  and   said  They saw he would make an exceeding good husband where he was    but it must be owing to my meekness  more than to his complaisance  for    said Miss Darnford  I could see well enough  when your ladyship detained   her  though he had but hinted his desire of finding her at our house    he was so out of humour at her supposed noncompliance  that mine and my   sister s pity for her was much more engaged  than our envy       Ay  said my lady  he is too lordly a creature  by much  and can t bear   disappointment  nor ever could       Said he  Well  Lady Davers  you should not  of all persons  find fault   with me  for I bore a great deal from you  before I was at all angry       Yes  replied she  but when I had gone a little too far  as I own I did    you made me pay for it severely enough  You know you did  sauce box  And   the poor thing too  added she  that I took with me for my advocate  so   low had he brought
