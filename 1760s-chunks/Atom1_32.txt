always in concert with the extravagance    177 of the Tartar s demands  and the absurdity of the Dairo s predilection  Fika kaka was astonished at these phaenomena  while Mura clami hoped in secret  that the orator s brain was disordered  and that his insanity would soon stand confessed  even to the conviction of the people —   If   said he to himself  they are not altogether destitute of human reason  they must  of their own accord  perceive and comprehend this plain proposition  A cask of water that discharges three by one pipe  and receives no more than two by another  must infallibly be emptied at the long run  Japan discharges three millions of obans every year for the defence of that blessed farm  which  were it put up to sale  would not fetch one sixth part of the sum  and the annual ballance of her trade with all the world brings in two millions  ergo  it runs out faster than it runs    178 in  and the vessel at the long run must be empty    Mura clami was mistaken  He had studied philosophy only in profile  He had endeavoured to investigate the sense  but he had never fathomed the absurdities of human nature  All that Taycho had done for Yesso  amounted not to one third of what was required for the annual expence of Japan while it maintained the war against China in different quarters of Asia  A former Cuboy   rest his soul   finding it impossible to raise within the year the exorbitant supplies that were required to gratify the avarice and ambition of the Dairo  had contrived the method of funding  which hath been lately adopted with such remarkable success in this kingdom  You know  Peacock  this is no more than borrowing a certain sum on the credit of the nation  and laying a    179 fresh tax upon the public  to defray the interest of every sum thus borrowed  an excellent expedient  when kept within due bounds  for securing the established government  multiplying the dependants of the m—ry  and throwing all the money of the empire into the hands of the administration  But those loans were so often repeated  that the national debt had already swelled to an enormous burthen  such a variety of taxes was laid upon the subject  as grievously inhanced all the necessaries of life  consequently the poor were distressed  and the price of labour was raised to such a degree  that the Japonese manufactures were every where undersold by the Chinese traders  who employed their workmen at a more moderate expence  Taycho  in this dilemma  was seized with a strange conceit  Alchemy was at that period become a favourite    180 study in Japan  Some bonzas having more learning and avarice than their brethren  applied themselves to the study of certain Chaldean manuscripts  which their ancestors had brought from Assyria  and in these they found the substance of all that is contained in the works of Hermes Trismegistus  Geber  Zosymus  the Panapolite  Olympiodorus  Heliodorus  Agathodaemon  Morienus  Albertus Magnus  and  above all  your countryman Roger Bacon  who adopted Geber s opinion  that mercury is the common basis  and sulphur the cement of all metals  By the bye  this same friar Bacon was well acquainted with the composition of gun powder  though the reputation arising from the discovery  has been given to Swartz  who lived many years after that monk of Westminster  Whether the Philosopher s stone     181 otherwise called the Gift Azoth  the fifth Essence  or the alkahest  which last Van Helmont pilfered from the tenth book of the Archidoxa  that treasure so long deposited in the occiput of the renowned Aureolus  Philippus  Paracelsus  Theophrastus  Bombast  de Hohenheim  was ever really attained by human adept  I am not at liberty to disclose  but certain it is  the philosophers and alchemists of Japan  employed by orator Taycho to transmute baser metals into gold  miscarried in all their experiments  The whole evaporated in smoke  without leaving so much as the scrapings of a crucible for a specific against the itch  Tickets made of a kind of bamboo  had been long used to reinforce the circulation of Japan  but these were of no use in Tartary  the mercenaries and allies of that country would receive nothing but gold    182 and silver  which  indeed  one would imagine they had a particular method of decomposing or annihilating  for  of all the millions transported thither  not one copan was ever known to revisit Japan    It was a country  as Hamlet says  from whose bourn no travelling copan e er returned    As the war of Yesso  therefore  engrossed all the specie of Niphon  and some currency was absolutely necessary to the subsistence of the Japonese  the orator contrived a method to save the expence of solid food  He composed a mess that should fill their bellies  and  at the same time  protract the intoxication of their brains  which it was so much his interest to maintain —He put them upon a diet of yeast  where this did not agree with the stomach  he employed his emissaries to blow up the patients à posteriori  as the dog was blown up by
