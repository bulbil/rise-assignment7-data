the country knew the English force  and learned to fear it  Since that time nothing considerable has been done against us  Our East India company have become the arbiters of Empire  The Mogul himself has been defeated  and taken prisoner  The British Empire begins to vie even with that of ancient Rome  the extent of its dominions on land is as wide  and its force at sea is infinitely greater  Happy if we know when to bound our successes  happy if we can distinguish between victories and advantages  if we can be convinced that when a nation shines brightest with conquest  it may then  like a wasting taper  be only hastening to decay     I am   c   LETTER XXVIII   VICTORY  which thus first dawned upon us  from the East  seemed to extend even to Europe and America  But some steps led to these successes which had been long wished for  and  at length  were effected  The affairs of war were directed by a ministry which seemed utterly unequal to the weight and importance of such a charge  they were but feebly held together among each other  and clamoured against by the united voice of the people  It had long been their method to rule by party  and  surrounding the throne  it was said  they attempted only to fill the royal ear with whatever suggestions they thought most to their interests  When any   235 new measure was proposed  which could not receive their approbation  or any new member was introduced into government  whom they did not nominate  it was their method to throw up their places with a secret view of resuming them with greater lustre  Thus all hope of preferment was to be expected only from them  public favours were conferred only for private services  they were thought to govern in the senate and in the field  the strength of the crown was actually declining  that of the people was scarce any  while aristocracy filled up every avenue to the throne with pride  ignorance  and faction   The state of the King and nation  at that time  was truly deplorable  the defeat of Braddock in America  the loss of Oswego  the delay of armaments  the absurd destination of fleets and armies  all served to reduce the people almost to a state of desperation  and brought addresses to the throne from every part of the kingdom  The general voice was  at length  too loud not to reach the throne  and the ministry were  at length  obliged to admit some gentlemen into a share of the government  whose talents and integrity might  in some measure  counterbalance their own deficience  At the head of these newly introduced were Mr  Pitt and Mr  Legge  the former of these was appointed Secretary of State  the other Chancellor of the Exchequer  To draw the characters of men still living  would necessarily subject me to the imputation of adulation or satyr  it is enough to say  that the people had high expectations from their abilities  and  in the end  they were not disappointed   The pleasure of the nation  however  was but of short continuance  a ministry composed of such jarring principles could not long continue united  being constituted of persons espousing different measures  and actuated by different motives  The old juncto courted the Sovereign s favour by their pretended attachment   236 to his foreign dominions  the new clamoured against all continental connexions as utterly incompatible with the interest of the nation  Both  perhaps  might have been wrong  but it is obvious  that these sentiments were sufficient to sink the latter in the royal esteem  and this dislike was artfully kept up  and increased by their old rivals in power  A few months  therefore  after Mr  Pitt had been put into office  he was obliged to resign the seals  by his Majesty s command  and Mr  Legge was dismissed from being Chancellor of the Exchequer  The old ministry now thought themselves secure in the unmolested possession of former power  but this very step which they took for their own security turned out to them as unfortunate as those they planned for the public were unsuccessful  The whole nation seemed to rise up as one man in vindication of that part of the ministry that was lately excluded  And the King  at length  thought proper to comply with the general solicitation  Mr  Pitt and Mr  Legge were again restored  and a train of successes soon began to dignify their designs   For some time  however  the measures planned by the former ministry were pursued in America  and though the English were superior to the enemy  yet still they felt all the inconvenience of irresolute councils and ill planned operations  Our women and children in that part of the world were exposed to the unparalleled cruelty of the Indian savages  and  what is still more remarkable  two thousand Britons with arms in their hands  continued tame spectators of these inhumanities  Bad success ever produces complaint on all sides  and England now heard nothing but invective and accusation  The Generals sent over to manage the operations of war  loudly accused the timidity and the slowness of the natives  who were to unite in their own defence  the natives
