 tempests      Hero  heros  and ijpws  in the three languages  signify a demigod    or one who is superior to mere man  But how can this superiority   or distinction be shewn   The serene acts of beneficence  the small   and still voice of goodness  are neither accompanied by noise nor   ostentation  It is uproar  and tumult rather  the tumbling of   sacked cities  the shrieks of outraged matrons  and the groans of   dying nations  that fill the trump of fame  Men of power and   ambition find distinction and glory very readily attainable in this   way  as it is incomparably more easy to destroy than to create  to   give death than to give life  to pull down than to build up  to bring   devastation and misery rather than plenty and peace and prosperity   upon earth      Friend  Were not mankind  in this instance  as blind to their   own interests  as they were iniquitous in giving glory where shame   alone was due      Author  In so doing  they proved at once the dupes and victims   of their own folly  Praise a child for his genius in pranks of   mischief and malevolence  and you quicken him in the direct road         46 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      to the gallows  It is just so that this wise world has bred up its   heroic reprobates  by ascribing honour and acclamation to deeds   that called loudly for infamy and the gibbet   for the world was an   ass from its very commencement  and it will continue a dunderhead   to the end      From the beginning of things  a long time ago  the joint invention   of mankind has discovered but two methods of procuring sustenance   on earth   the first by the labour of their own hands  the second by   employing the hands of others      All therefore are excluded  or at least ought to be excluded  from   such a world  who refuse to labour  or  what is still worse  who   disturb and prevent the labour of others      Among those who will not labour  we may number all who have   the happiness of being born to no manner of end   such as the   Monks of every country  the Dervises of Persia  the Brahmins of   India  the Mandarins of China  and the Gentlemen of these free and   polished nations      These have nothing to do but to sleep it  to wake it   to eat it    to drink it   to dance it  to doze it   to riot it  to roar it   and to   rejoice in the happy earnest which this world has given them of the   jollities of the next      Among those who disturb the labour of others  I reckon all your   rascally Alexanders and Caesars  whether ancient or modern  who in   their fits of frenzy and folly scamper about  breaking the lanterns   and beating the watch of this world  to the great amazement of   women and terror of little children   and who seem to think that   Heaven gave noses and heads for no end in nature but to be   blooded and cracked  In short  I have no patience when I hear   talk of these fellows  I am not half so fretted when I hear my   own works read  Go on  I request you  it may happen to put me   in temper      CHAPTER V      THE young gentlemen were now upon their return  and as they   approached the house they crowded about Harry to keep him from   being seen  till he took an opportunity of slipping away and stealing   up to his chamber  He now grew stiff and sore   and his nurse    having got an intimation of what had happened  hurried up to him    and wept over him with abundant tears of cordial affection  She   straight undressed and put him to bed   and having ordered some   white wine whey  of which she made him drink plentifully  she   also undressed and went to bed to him   and Harry  casting his   little arm about her neck  and putting his head in her bosom  was   fast asleep in a twinkling      By this time John had returned from the execution of his com    mission  He had been fully apprized by Tommy  on the road  of   all the circumstances relating to this bloody business   and  going   to his lord and lady  he gave them the whole detail  occasionally   dwelling and expatiating on Harry s courage  his prowess  his   honour  and his
