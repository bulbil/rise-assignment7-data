 it would be very agreeable to me if my dear Mr  Mandeville would think of offering himself a candidate to succeed him  I will however be so plain as to tell him  he will have no assistance from me except my wishes  and has nothing to trust to but          1 96       his merits and the name of Mandeville  it being a point both of conscience and honor with me  never to intermeddle in elections  The preservation of our happy constitution depends on the perfect independence of each part  of which it is composed  on the other two  and the moment  Heaven grant that moment to be far distant  when the House of Lords can make a House of Commons  liberty and prerogative will cease to be more than names  and both prince and people become slaves      I therefore always  though the whole town is mine  leave the people to their free and uninfluenced choice  never interfering farther than to insist on their keeping themselves as unbiassed as I leave them  I would not only withdraw my favor from  but prosecute  the man who was base enough to take a bribe  tho  he who offered it was my nearest friend            1 97          By this means I have the pleasure also of keeping myself free  and at liberty to confer favours where I please  so that I secure my own independence by not invading that of others        This conduct  I cannot help thinking  if general  would preserve the balance of our glorious constitution  a balance of much greater consequence to Britons than the balance of power in Europe  tho  so much less the object of their attention  In this we resemble those persons  who  whilst they are busied in regulating the domestic concerns of their neighbours  suffer their own to be ruined        But to return from this unintended digression  You will perhaps object to what I have proposed  that  during your father s life  you are not qualified for a seat in Parliament  I have obviated this objection  Lady Mary  the only sister of my father           1 98       has an ample fortune in her own power to dispose of  some part of it was originally her own  but much the larger part was left her by her lover  Sir Charles Barton  who was killed in Queen Anne s wars  the very morning before he was to have set out for England to complete his marriage  Being the last of his family  he had made a will  in which he left his estate to Lady Mary  with a request  that  if she did not marry  she would leave it to one of the name of Mandeville  As she loves merit  and has the happiness and honor of our house warmly at heart  I have easily prevailed on her to settle 500 L   a year on you at the present  and to leave you a good part of the rest at her death  Her design hitherto  I will not conceal from you  has been to leave her fortune to my daughter  of whom she is infinitely fond  but Julia has enough  and by leaving it to you she more exactly fulfils the will of Sir Charles  who  tho  he has not expressly made the        1 99       distinction  certainly meant it to a male of the Mandeville name  The estate is about 2000 L   a year  her own fortune of 14000 L   I shall not oppose her leaving to my daughter      I know too well the generous sentiments of your heart to doubt that  in procuring this settlement  I give to my country a firm and unshaken patriot  at once above dependance on the most virtuous court  and the mean vanity of opposing the just measures of his Prince  from a too eager desire of popularity  not that I would have you insensible to praise  or the esteem of your country  but seek it only by deserving it  and tho  it be in part the reward  let it not be the motive of your actions  let your own approbation be your first view  and that of others only your second        You may observe  my dear Mr  Mandeville  I only caution you against being led          1 100       away  by youthful vanity  to oppose the just measures of your Prince  I should wrong the integrity of your heart  if I supposed you capable of distressing the hands of government for mercenary or ambitious purposes  a virtuous senator will regard  not men  but measures  and will concur with his bitterest enemies in every salutary and honest purpose  or rather  in a public light  he will have no enemies  but the enemies of his country      It is with caution I
