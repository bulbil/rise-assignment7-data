crown    another a red hat  and another a coronet  by means that deserved   the gibbet of Haman  they instantly become the presumptive   proprietors of I know not what catalogue of fine qualities and   accomplishments  Wherefore  as I am so singular  so perverse  or   so unhappy  as to differ from the judgment of so wise a world in   this matter  it is the more incumbent upon me to bring proofs that   are self evident  at the same time that I treat so reverable a subject   with all possible delicacy      In the first ages of ACOENS  when all that sustained the simple   nature of man lay open and in common  like light and air  as people   knew of nothing further that was to be had  they thought there   was nothing further to be desired  As they had no wishes  they   felt no wants  and neither pride  envy  covetousness  nor debauchery   could commence  before they contrived the distinctions of property   and materials of intemperance  and thereby contrived the causes   of quarrel and corruption      But  as Horace say    quum oppida coeperunt munire  when they   began to build and set out landmarks  to plough and to sow  to   spin and to weave  to handle the file and hammer   in proportion   to the advancement of invention and arts  on necessity con    venience arose  upon convenience elegance  upon elegance luxury    new desires increased and multiplied with the means of gratifi    cation  real wishes became the offspring of imaginary wants    as those wishes waxed warm  the passions were enkindled  and         144 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      the vices  lastly  grew in mathematical proportion to the growth   of the passions      All histories  as well profane as sacred  in every age  in every   nation  and in every instance  bear unquestionable testimony to the   above state of facts   and hence ensues the necessity of our growing   worse and worse  till the pinnacle of art shall put a limit to desire    till invention shall be exhausted  and no longer prolific of new   wants and additional wishes in man      But so long as untried allurements  so long as untasted pleasures    so long as new objects can be set up to our imagination in our   eager pursuit after happiness on earth  our wishes will inflame our   impatience to reach the prize   in proportion to that impatience   our endeavours will be exerted   in proportion to such exertion  the   fences of law and morals will be broke through or trampled down     and in proportion to the insufficiency of moral restraints  all sorts   of fraud and violence  of licentiousness and corruption  of debauchery   and profligacy  must prevail throughout the world      Friend  From what you say  I should conclude that people of   wealth  of station  and power are the least impassioned and the   most virtuous of all living   forasmuch as they are already in   possession of what their inferiors so earnestly continue to thirst    and to chase  and to labour after  The great are above temptation    the world has nothing further to exhibit for their seduction   and in   this light also they are become the most respectable of all people      Author  Whenever you can make it evident that  to humble the   spirit of man  you ought to place him in authority   that  to con    vince him of personal defaults and infirmities  you ought to enclose   him with sycophants and servile dependants   that  to make him   temperate  you should seat him at the table of Lucullus   and that    to humanize his disposition  you should remove him as far as possible   from a sense of the miseries of his fellow creatures   when  to cure   a man of distempers incident to his nature  you would place him in   the midst of adventitious contagion then  and not till then  will   wealth  station  and power be productive of reformation and virtue   in man      Your error lay in supposing that sensual appetite and spiritual   ambition would cease and abate on gratification or indulgence  But   this is not possible  The spirit of man is a deathless desire   its   cravings cannot be satiated till it is possessed of some object that is   adequate to its nature   and  as this world has no such object to   exhibit  gratifications only serve to provoke to further desire  or   finally to sink us into utter despondence  And this makes the moral   that was intended by the philosophers  when they
