FOOL OF QUALITY      brother  I shall more particularly recommend him to your regard    by telling you that he is an exceedingly pious Christian      She then turned  and taking the little Abenamin by the hand    led him up and placed him before her brother   when the youth    suddenly dropping on his knees  looked up to Mr  Clinton with   eyes that spoke love and reverential awe  and besought his   blessing      The old gentleman found himself surprisingly affected  and  lifting   up his hands  cried God be gracious to you  my child  and make   your soul as bright as your countenance is sable   and may the Sun   of Bighteousness shine with power upon you  and soon disperse   or illumine every shade that is about you   The prince embraced   his legs  kissed his knees  and arose      Soon as the coffee was removed You may remember  my dearest   cousin  said the duchess  in what a hurry I last parted from you    Mr  Fairface  with whom the bulk of my fortune was deposited    went off with above a hundred thousand pounds of my substance    beside four times that value intrusted to him by others      I traced him to Paris  and there he had the impudence to give   me an interview   but  at the same time  had the impudence also   to bid me defiance      Immediately I commenced suit  and sent despatch to London for   my papers and witnesses      On the opening of my cause in court  I was summoned by the   title of Countess of Maitland  otherwise Frances Goodall  On   hearing the name  a gentleman who was near me started  and   turning and coming up Pray  madam  says he  are you any way   related to the Honourable Harry Clinton  who once went by that   name in this city  I am  sir  said I  almost the nearest relation   that he has upon earth  He is  madam  my dearest friend and   brother  Pray  speak to your advocates to postpone your suit   for a few days  till I am informed of the nature and merits of your   cause      This was accordingly done  He desired to know where I lodged    and in less than an hour his chariot was at my door      Except yourself  my cousin  the marquis had the most lovely and   winning aspect and person that ever I beheld  I soon convinced   him of the equity of my demand  and of the villany of my trustee    and made him perfect master of tho whole affair  But he still con    tinued to visit  and to stay with me a considerable part of every   day  under colour of being better informed touching this and the   other particular  the remaining time was spent in soliciting   for me      At length a hearing came on  and  after a short trial  honest   Fairface was cast in principal and double costs  He was instantly   taken into custody  and put under confinement  till he discharged the   whole amount of the judgment in my favour  No sooner was one   suit over  wherein I was plaintiff  but another was commenced    wherein I happened to prove but a very weak defendant  The   marquis now became solicitor for himself  but with such a sweet   timidity as seemed to doubt and greatly dread the success of his   cause          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  409     I could not refuse my time to him who had devoted the whole of   his time and assiduity to me  We spent whole days together  But   O  what floods of tears did that time often cost both him and me    while he pathetically and feelingly related your history  from the   place where you broke off to the death of your Louisa  and your   precious infants       I believe  my cousin  that  as grief is a greater softener  so it is   a greater cementer  of hearts than any other passion  I gave the   marquis  in my turn  my little story  and dwelt on every tender   minuteness of my infant passion for you  Ah  said he  what a pity   that a heart so susceptible of all divine and human feelings  should   sit as a lonely turtle  without a suitable mate       I took him for that mate  my cousin   and in a husband I found   the truest and teiiderest of lovers  I became pregnant  for the   first time in my life  and was delivered of
