which  if   I succeed in  must be my own destruction       Louisa was in the utmost consternation at the mystery which seemed   contained in these words  she looked earnestly upon him while he was   uttering the latter part  and saw all the tokens of a serious perplexity   in his countenance  as well as in the accents with which he delivered   them  but not being willing to be the dupe of his diversion  thought it   best to answer as to a piece of railery  and told him  laughing  she   imagined this was some new invention of the frolics of the season  but   that she was a downright English woman  understood nothing beyond plain   speaking  and could no ways solve the riddle he proposed       What I say  may doubtless appear so  madame  replied she  and I could   wish it had not been my part to give the explanation  but I cannot   dispense with the promise I have made  and must therefore acquaint you   with the history of it       After the ball  continued he  monsieur the count de Bellfleur desired me   to accompany him to his lodgings  and  as soon as we were alone  told   me  he had a little secret to acquaint me with  but that  before he   revealed it  he must have the promise of my assistance  As he spoke this   with a gay and negligent air  I imagined it a thing of no great   consequence  or if it were  he was a man of too much honour  and also   knew me too well to desire or expect I would engage in any thing   unbecoming that character  indeed I could think of nothing but an amour   or a duel  tho  I was far from being able to guess of what service I   could be to him in the former  I was  however  unwarily drawn in to give   my word  and he then made me the confident of a passion  which  he said    had received its birth from the first moment he beheld the Belle   Angloise  for by that term  pursued he  bowing  he distinguished the   adorable Louisa  that he had made some discovery of his flame  but that   finding  himself rejected  as he thought  in too severe a manner  and   without affording him opportunity to attest his sincerity  he had   converted his addresses  tho  not his passion  to a lady who  he   perceived  had the care of her  acting in this manner  partly thro    picque at your disdain  and partly to gratify his eyes with the sight of   you  which he has reason to fear you had totally deprived him of but for   this stratagem  He confessed to me that he found the object of his   pretended ardours infinitely more kind than she who inspires the real   ones  but this gratification of his vanity is of little consequence to   his peace   he engaged me to attend you this day  to conjure you to   believe his heart is incapable of being influenced by any other charms    and whatever he makes shew of to Melanthe  his heart is devoted wholly   to you   begs you to permit him to entertain you without the presence of   that lady  the means of which he will take care to contrive  and charged   me to assure you  that there is no sacrifice so great  but he will   readily offer it to convince you of the sincerity of his attachment       This  madame  added he  is the unpleasing task my promise bound me to   perform  and which I have acquitted myself of with the same pain that   man would do who  by some strange caprice of fate  was constrained to   throw into the sea the sum of all his hopes       The indignation which filled the virtuous foul of Louisa  while he was   giving her this detail of the count s presumption  falsehood  and   ingratitude  prevented her from giving much attention to the apology   with which he concluded  Never  since the behaviour of mr  B    n at   mrs  C  g   s  had she met with any thing that she thought so much   merited her resentment   so great was her disdain she had not words to   express it  but by some tears  which the rising passion forced from her   eyes   Heaven  cried she  which of my actions has drawn on me this   unworthy treatment   This was all she was able to utter  while she   walked backward and forward in the room endeavouring to compose herself    and form some answer befitting of the message       Monsieur du Plessis looked on her
