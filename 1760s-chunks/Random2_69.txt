when I began to consider  that without further opportunities of improving my success  all the progress I had hitherto made could not much avail  and that such opportunities could not be enjoyed without the mother s permission  I concluded it would be requisite to vanquish her coldness and suspicion by my assiduities and respectful behaviour on the road  and she would in all likelihood invite me to visit her at Bath  where I did not fear of being able to cultivate her acquaintance as much as would be necessary to the accomplishment of my purpose —And indeed accident furnished me with an opportunity of obliging her so much  that she   202 could not with any appearance of good manners  forbear to gratify my inclination   When we arrived at our dining place  we found all the eatables in the inn bespoke by a certain nobleman  who had got the start of us  and in all likelihood  my mistress and her mother must have dined with Duke Humphrey  had I not exerted myself in their behalf  and bribed the landlord with a glass of wine to curtail his lordship s entertainment of a couple of fowls and some bacon  which I sent with my compliments to the ladies  they accepted my treat with a great many thanks  and desired I would favour them with my company at dinner  where I amused the old gentlewoman so successfully  by maintaining a seemingly disinterested ease  in the midst of my civility  that she signified a desire of being better acquainted  and hoped I would be so kind as to see her sometimes at Bath —While I enjoyed myself in this manner  the precise lady had the good fortune to meet with her husband  who was no other than gentleman  or in other words  valet de chambre to the very nobleman  whose coach stood at the door  Proud of the interest she had in the house  she affected to shew her power by introducing the captain to her spouse  as a person who had treated her with great civility  upon which he was invited to a share of their dinner  while the poor lawyer  finding himself utterly abandoned  made application to me  and was  through my intercession  admitted into our company —Having satisfied our appetites  and made ourselves very merry at the expence of the person of honour  the civil captain  and complaisant husband  I did myself the pleasure of discharging the bill by stealth  for which I received a great   203 many apologies and acknowledgments from my guests  and we reimbarked at the first warning —The officer was obliged  at last  to appease his hunger with a luncheon of bread and cheese  and a pint bottle of brandy  which he dispatched in the coach  cursing the inappetence of his lordship  who had ordered dinner to be put back a whole hour   Nothing remarkable happened during the remaining part of our journey  which was ended about twelve a clock  when I waited on the ladies to the house of a relation  in which they intended to lodge  and passing that night at the inn  took lodgings next morning for myself   The forenoon was spent in visiting every thing that was worth seeing in the place  which I did in company with a gentleman to whom Banter had given me a letter of introduction  and in the afternoon I waited on the ladies  and found Miss a good deal indisposed with the fatigues of the journey —As they foresaw they would have occasion for a male acquaintance to squire them at all publick places  I was received with great cordiality  and had the mother s permission to conduct them next day to the long room  which we no sooner entered  than the eyes of every body present were turned upon us  and when we had suffered the martyrdom of their looks for some time  a whisper circulated at our expence  which was accompanied with many contemptuous smiles  and tittering observations  to my utter shame and confusion —I did not so much conduct as follow my charge to a place where she seated her mother and herself with astonishing composure  notwithstanding the unmannerly behaviour of the whole company    204 which seemed to be assumed meerly to put her out of countenance —The celebrated Mr  N—h  who commonly attends in this place  as master of the ceremonies  perceiving the disposition of the assembly  took upon himself the task of gratifying their ill nature still further  by exposing my mistress to the edge of his wit —With this view he approached us  with many bows and grimaces  and after having welcomed Miss Snapper to the place  asked her  in the hearing of all present  if she could inform him of the name of Tobit s dog —I was so much incensed at his insolence  that I should certainly have kicked him where he stood  without ceremony  had not the young lady prevented the effects of my indignation  by replying with the utmost vivacity     His name was N—sh  and an impudent dog he was    This repartee  so unexpected and just  raised such an universal laugh at the aggressor  that all his assurance was insufficient to support him under their derision  so that after he had endeavoured to compose himself  by taking snuff  and forcing a smile  he was obliged to sneak off in a
