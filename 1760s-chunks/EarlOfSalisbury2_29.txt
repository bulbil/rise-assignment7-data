 guests arose in confusion and amazement  Tyrrel trembled in an agony of  terror  nor was his consternation unobserved —  Treason   cried  Chauvigny  seizing the false host       and this sword shall revenge it —But what revenge on thee  thou wretched  slave —Say  Hast thou indeed murdered this noble Lord  Hath thy vile  hand dealt him poison  Confess thy villainy  or this moment is thy last         The abject Tyrrel had fallen on his knees  and now loudly and  vehemently asserted his innocence  but  when terrified by the view of  instant death  he scrupled not to confess  that by the direction of Lord  Hubert  he had invited the Earl to his house  but that he was not privy  to any deadly purpose  if such had heen concerted  the Monk alone was  privy  the Monk alone had executed it  Reginhald was sought for  but he  had fled  which confirmed their suspicions  and filled the  hall with grief and dismay  William alone seemed unmoved  He gently  pressed the hand of Les Roches   my enemies have prevailed   said he       the snares of Hubert have caught me — Alas  thou knowest him not —Visit  my castle  comfort my wife  and Oh  continue thy kind protection to my  son         The grief of Lord Chauvigny was outrageous  that of Les Roches had  choaked his voice  He hung over the languid Earl  in silence and  consternation  whilst  on the other hand  the boy clung passionately  round the knees of his father  The scene was affecting  and even the  rough soldier  to whom death had been long familiar  melted into  tears — Poisoned  and by Lord Hubert   was repeated with sorrow and  indignation  The dismal tidings were soon caught by busy tongues  spread  abroad  and propagated thro  the land  to aggravate the disgrace the  wicked favourite was soon to experience     His afflicted friends conveyed the Earl to his couch  And now  the good  old Randolph  whose venerable face had worn the deepest marks of sorrow   seemed to be suddenly enlivened by a gleam of hope  He paused  appeared  earnest to collect his dissipated thoughts  and now looked as a man  unexpectedly visited by comfort  The eyes of his friends were fixed  upon him  as if demanding an explanation  when  addressing himself  hastily to Lord William  he asked of his present state  whether his pain  was encreased or his languor more oppressing  He thanked the gentle  Knight  and declared  that now he seemed more at ease — Yes   cried  Randolph         and soon shall this malady cease  and still shall William live         —The Frenchmen were astonished  but the Knight confidently repeated his  joyful assurances  Experienced and sagacious  and accustomed to survey  all objects with more calmness and composure than young Chauvigny  he  revolved all the incidents  since their arrival at the house of Tyrrel   He had marked the aspect of the Monk  and from thence had formed the  blackest suspicions of his temper and designs  He had marked his  officious cares  and obsequious zeal in attending on the Earl  He had  marked how  at the first entrance of Les Roches  the cup had dropt from  the hands of Salisbury  He recollected  that after this the Monk had not  been seen  and justly concluded  that this was the fatal cup which had  been prepared for his friend  that the fell purpose of Hubert had been  happily deseated by his sudden surprise  and that the poisonous mixture   which  if drunk must have instantly proved fatal  had now  when but just  scarcely tasted  raised a temporary disorder in the frame of William   which nature  still free from deep infection  would soon be able to  overcome  These thoughts  which he communicated to his noble  companions  were received with joy  and soon were they confirmed by that  ease and vigour which the Earl gradually recovered  Tyrrel had been  secured  and was now examined at more leisure  His discoveries served to  convince them of what was really the truth  that he indeed connived at  the base design  but had not been directly an assistant  But he was not  an object worthy of noble revenge  Against Lord Hubert was vengeance  loudly denounced  and the soul of Salisbury was on fire to inflict the  full severity of justice on his treachery and unrelenting malice   His resentment and indignation were still to be more inflamed  The  unhappy Oswald  who had for some time groaned under a severe captivity   at length had found means to make some impression on the heart of his  keeper  who kindly consented to relax his hardships  When the  messengers of Lord William were confined  he had desired  and was  secretly admitted to hold some conference with them  The keeper was
