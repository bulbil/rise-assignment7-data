public house where Scipio had been accustomed to put up  whence our first visit was to my banker  Salero  He received us very cordially  and expressed the highest satisfaction at my release  Indeed  added he  your untoward fate touched me so nearly as to change my views of a political alliance  The fortunes of courtiers are like castles in the air  so I have married my daughter Gabriela to a wealthy trader  You have acted very wisely  answered I  for besides that a bird in the hand is worth two in a bush  when a plodding citizen aspires to the honour of bringing a man of fashion into his family  he very often has an impertinent puppy for his son in law   Then changing the topic  and coming to the point  Signor Gabriel  pursued I  we came to talk a little about the two thousand pistoles which        Your money is all ready  said the goldsmith  interrupting me  He then took us into his closet  and delivered the two bags  carefully labelled with my name on them   I thanked Salero for his exactness  and heaven in my sleeve for my escape from his daughter  At our inn we counted over the money  and found it right  deducting fifty doubloons for the expenses of my enlargement  Our thoughts were now wholly bent upon Arragon  My secretary undertook to buy a carriage and two mules  It was my office to provide household and body linen  During my peregrinations for that purpose  I met Baron Steinbach  the officer in the German Guards with whom Don Alphonso had been brought up   I touched my hat to him  he knew me again  and returned my greeting warmly  My joy is extreme  said I  at seeing your lordship in such fine health  to say nothing of my wish to inquire after Don Caesar and Don Alphonso de Leyva  They are both in Madrid  answered he  and staying at my house  They came to town about three months ago  to be presented on occasion of Don Alphonso s promotion  He has been appointed Governor of Valencia  on the score of old family claims  without having in any shape pushed his interest at court  Nothing could be more grateful to his feelings  or prove more strongly our royal master s goodness  who delights to recognize the merits of ancestry in the persons of their descendants   Though I knew more of this matter than Steinbach  I kept my knowledge in the background  Yet so lively was my impatience to hail my old masters  that he would not damp my ardour by delay  I had a mind to try Don Alphonso  whether he still retained his regard for me  He was playing at chess with Baroness Steinbach  On my entrance  he started up from his game  ran towards me  and squeezing me tight in his embrace  Santillane  said he  with demonstrations of the sincerest joy  at length  then  you are restored to my heart  I am delighted at it  It was not my fault that we ever parted  You may remember how strongly I urged you not to withdraw from the Castle of Leyva  You were deaf to my entreaties  But I must not chide your obstinacy  because its motive was the peace of the family  Yet you ought to have let me hear from you  and to have spared my fruitless inquiries at Grenada  where my brother in law  Don Ferdinand  sent me word that you were  And now tell me what you are doing at Madrid  Of course you have some situation here  Be assured that I shall always take a lively interest in your concerns  Sir  answered I  it is but four months since I occupied a considerable post at court  I had the honour of being the Duke of Lerma s confidential secretary  Can it be possible  exclaimed Don Alphonso  as if he could scarcely believe his ears  What  were you so near the person of the prime minister  I then related how I had gained and lost his favour  and ended with avowing my determination to buy a cottage and garden with the wreck of my shattered fortunes   The son of Don Caesar heard me attentively  and made this answer  My dear Gil Blas  you know how I have always loved you  nor shall you longer be fortune s puppet I will set you above her vagaries  by securing you an independence  Since you declare for a country life  a little estate of ours near Lirias  about four leagues from Valencia  shall be settled on you  You are acquainted with the spot  Such a present we can make  without putting ourselves to the least inconvenience  I can answer for my father s joining in the act  and for Seraphina s entire approbation   I threw myself at Don Alphonso s feet  who raised me immediately  More penetrated by his affection than by his bounty  I pressed his hand and said  Sir  your conduct charms me  Your noble gift is the more welcome  as it precedes the knowledge of a service it has been in my power to render you  and I had rather owe it to your generosity  than to your gratitude  This
