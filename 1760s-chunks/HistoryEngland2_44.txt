 acting by the immediate commands of their Sovereign  are afterwards to be made accountable for their proceedings  it may  one day or other  be the case of all the members of this august assembly  I do not doubt therefore  that  out of regard to yourselves  your Lordships will give me an equitable hearing  and I hope  that in the prosecution of this inquiry it will appear  that I have merited  not only the indulgence  but also the favour of this government  My Lords  I am now to take my leave of your Lordships  and of this honourable house  perhaps  for ever  I shall lay down my life with pleasure  in a cause favoured by my late dear royal mistress  And  when I consider that I am to be judged by the justice  honour  and virtue of my Peers  I shall acquiesce  and retire with great content  And  my Lords  God s will be done    On his return from the house of Lords to his own house  where he was  for that night  permitted to go  he was followed by a great multitude of people  crying out  High church Ormond and Oxford for ever  Next day he was brought to the bar  where he received a copy of his articles  and was allowed a month to prepare his answer    118 Though Doctor Mead declared  that if the Earl should be sent to the Tower  his life would be in danger  it was carried  that he should be sent there  whither he was attended by a prodigious concourse of people  who did not scruple to exclaim against his prosecutors  Tumults grew more frequent  and this only served to increase the severity of the legislature  An act was made  decreeing  that if any persons  to the number of twelve  unlawfully assembled  should continue together one hour  after being required to disperse by a Justice of Peace  or other officer  and heard the proclamation against riots read in public  they should be deemed guilty of felony  without benefit of the clergy  An act of this kind carries its own comment with it  legislators should ever be averse to enacting such laws as leave the greatest room for abuse     A committee was now appointed to draw up articles of impeachment  and prepare evidence against him and the other impeached Lords  he was confined in the Tower  and there remained for two years  during which time  the kingdom was in a continual ferment  several other Lords  who had broke out into actual rebellion  and were taken in arms  being executed for treason  the ministry seemed weary of executions  and he  with his usual foresight  presented  upon this occasion  a petition for coming to his tryal  A day was therefore assigned him  The commons appointed a committee to enquire into the state of the Earl s impeachment  and demanded a longer time to prepare for the tryal  The truth is  they had now began to relax in their former asperity  and the intoxication of party was not quite so strong now as when he had been first committed  At the appointed time the Peers repaired to the court in Westminster Hall  where Lord Cowper presided as Lord Steward  The commons were assembled  and the King and royal family assisted   119 at the solemnity  The prisoner was brought from the Tower  and his articles of impeachment read  with his answers and the replies of the commons  Sir Joseph Jekyl  one of the agents for the commons  standing up to enforce the first article of his Lordship s accusation  one of the Lords adjourning the house  observed  that much time would be consumed in going through all the articles of the impeachment  that nothing more remained than for the commons to make good the two articles of high treason contained in his charge  and that this would at once determine the tryal  His advice was agreed to by the Lords  but the commons delivered a paper containing their reasons for asserting it as their undoubted right to carry on the impeachment in the manner they thought most conducive to their aim  On the other hand  the house of Lords insisted on their former resolution  considering it as the privilege of every judge to hear each cause in the manner he thinks most fitting  The dispute grew still more violent  a message was at length sent to the commons  intimating that the Lords intended to proceed immediately to the Earl of Oxford s tryal  and  soon after repairing to the Hall of Justice  they took their places  The commons  however  did not think fit to appear  and the Earl  having waited a quarter of an hour at the bar  was dismissed for want of accusers  To this dispute  perhaps  he owed his safey  though it is probable they would have acquitted im of high treason  as none of his actions could ustly suffer such an imputation  With the same crimony prosecutions were carried on against Lord Bolingbroke and the Duke of Ormond  but they ound safety in flight   Such vindictive proceedings as these naturally ex…ted indignation  the people groaned to behold a ew great ones close up all the avenues to royal faour  and rule the
