 indifferent to him  in reality  than he had ever been to her  to which   another motive  perhaps  might also be added  viz  that of his indulging   himself with amusements with other fair ones  of a more kind complexion    for continency  as will hereafter appear  was not among the number of   that gentleman s virtues       But enough of Mr  Munden for the present  It is now highly proper to   give the reader some account what Mr  Trueworth was doing while Miss   Betsy was entertaining sentiments for him  which he had long since   ceased the ambition of inspiring her with       Difficult was it for him to get over the mingled astonishment and   vexation which the detection of the wickedness of Miss Flora had   involved him in  The remembrance of those guilty moments  in which he   had indulged a tender intercourse with a woman of her abandoned   principles  filled him with the most bitter remorse  and rendered him   almost hateful to himself       To recollect that he had been the instrument of her base designs on   Miss Betsy  and how cruelly he had wronged that lady by a too rash   belief  was  of itself  sufficient to inflame his rage  but when he   reflected on this last act of baseness  which  if not providentially   discovered  might have made his dear Harriot entertain suspicions of him   fatal to her peace  if not totally destructive of their mutual   happiness  the shock of such a misfortune  though happily frustrated    was more than he could bear with any tolerable degree of patience       Rage  disdain  and revenge  for the vile contriver of so black an   attempt  were the first emotions that took possession of his mind  but   the violence of those passions evaporating by degrees  he began to think   more coolly  and to reason with himself  from which that depravity of   morals and manners  women are sometimes guilty of  proceeded        Chastity   said he   is but one branch of virtue  but a material one    and serves as a guard to all the others  and if that is once overcome    endangers the giving entrance to a thousand vices  A woman entirely free   from those inordinate desires  which are  indeed  but the disgrace of   love  can scarce be capable of envy  malice  or revenge  to any excess        That sex   cried he again   are endued by nature with many perfections   which ours cannot boast of  it is their own faults when they sink   beneath us in value  but the best things  when once corrupted  become   the worst  How dear  therefore  ought a woman to prize her innocence  As   Shakespeare says                They are all white  a sheet        Of spotless paper  when they first are born         But they are to be scrawl d upon  and blotted        By every goose quill        He was in the midst of these contemplations  when a letter from Miss   Flora was brought to him  she still flattered herself with being able to   work on his good nature by submissions  and a seeming contrition for   what she had done  and had accordingly wrote in the most moving terms   she was mistress of  but he knowing  by the hand writing on the   superscription  from whom it came  would not even open it  and his   indignation rekindling afresh  he took a piece of paper  in which he   wrote only this line              I read no letters from incendiaries        This served as a cover to the letter  which he sent directly by the   messenger that brought it       If the mind of Mr  Trueworth had been less taken up than it was at   present  this ugly accident would doubtless have dwelt much longer upon   it  but affairs of a more important  and more pleasing nature  demanded   his whole attention       The day prefixed for the celebration of his marriage with Miss Harriot    and also of that of Sir Bazil and Miss Mabel  had been delayed on   account of Mrs  Blanchfield s death  None of these generous persons   could think of indulging the joys they so much languished for till all   due rites were paid to the memory of that amiable lady       Mr  Trueworth and Miss Harriot went into deep mourning  Sir Bazil and   Mrs  Wellair also put on
