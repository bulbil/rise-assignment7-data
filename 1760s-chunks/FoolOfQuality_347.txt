 my lord sent for Louisa  and gave her instant and absolute   orders to prepare for her nuptials   but she full as positively and   peremptorily replied  that her soul was already wedded   that she   would never prostitute her body where her heart was an alien     and that all the tortures of the Inquisition should not change her   resolution  Her father thereupon rose to such ungovernable fury    that with one blow of his hand he struck her senseless to his feet     but when he saw my lamb  my darling  all pale  and as dead before   him  the tide of nature returned  and the conflict of his passions   became so violent that an imposthume broke in his stomach  and   falling  he was suffocated  and expired on the spot      Soon after the prince arrived  He had never seen my daughter     but his ambition to possess a beauty  of whom the grand monarch   himself was said to have been enamoured  had caused him to   demand her in marriage  for that purpose he also did us the   honour of a visit  Louisa refused to appear  and I told his   highness  with the best grace I could  that she happened to be   pre engaged  In a few days after he met my son on the Tuileries    and accosted him to the same intent  but my son had been   previously prejudiced in your favour  my Harry  and answered the         384 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      prince with so cold or so haughty an air  that further words   ensued  they both drew  and his highness was slightly wounded    but  as company interposed  the affair was hushed up  and  shortly   after  the prince was killed in a nightly broil upon the Pont Neuf    We then wrote to our friend  De Wit  to advertise you of these   matters  and to hasten you hither   but you arrived  my child you   arrived before there could be any expectation of an answer      Two days ago  as I observed that my lamb s spirits were some    thing dejected  I prevailed upon her to take an airing to our country   villa  On our return this morning  we were struck half dead with   the news that our Lewis was wounded  and dangerously ill in his   bed  We flew into his room  and were still more alarmed to find   him in a fury that is not to be imagined   while Jacome  his old   steward  was on his knees  all pale and quaking  at a distance before   him  Villain  he cried  what have you done with my friend    What have you done with my champion   the preserver of my   life  Please your lordship  said he  trembling  I took him for a   highwayman   I saw my lady s ring and my young mistress s watch   in his custody   I will swear to the property before the parliament   of Paris  and so I lodged him in prison till till     Go  wretch   cried my son  recall your information   take all your   fellows with you  and instantly bring me back my friend  or your   ears shall be the forfeit   but conduct him to his own chamber   I   cannot yet bear to see him  I cannot bear the reproach that his   eye must cast upon me      All afflicted  and yet more astonished  my Louisa and I sat down   by the side of my son  casting looks of surprise and inquiring doubt   on each other  At length I said What is this that I hear of our   ring and our watch   Alas   he is no highwayman who took them   from us   they were our own free gift  a mite in return for a million   of services  But do you know any thing of the possessor   I know    answered Lewis  that he is the loveliest of mankind  the preserver   of my life  and that his name is Goodall  Ah   screamed out Louisa    there we are lost again  This Goodall must certainly have mur    dered our precious Clinton  and possessed himself of our gifts   he   would never have parted with them while he had life  Oh  my   sister  said my son  when you see my friend Goodall  you will   think nothing of your Harry Clinton   Why  why were you so   hasty  so precipitate in your choice   A robber  a murderer   No     had I a thousand lives  I would pawn them all for the probity that   heaven has made
