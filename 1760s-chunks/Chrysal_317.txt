error too common in the heat of argumentation    they concluded from the abuse  against the use of the stage  and   branded with the mark of reprobation all future actors  for the   faults of the present          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 375         CHAPTER XV     CONTINUED   THE COMMON CONSBQUBNCB Or EXCESS OF ZEAL â€”   THE PROFESSED INTENT OF THE THBATBICAL EBPEBSENTATIONS   DEFEATED BY THIS ABSURD PREJUDICE AGAINST ACTORS â€” THE   VICES AGAINST WHICH THIS PREJUDICE IS LEVELLED  IN REALITY   THE EFFECTS OF IT  WITH THE MEANS OF REMEDYING THIS AND   OTHER ABUSES     However the occasion might then seem to justify this excess of   zeal  when the cause ceased  the efieot should in reason have ceased   also  and these general censures have been repealed  The supersti    tions which were the foundation of the first charge against the   stage have been long abolished  nor are the absurdities and im    moralities which gave offence to reason and virtue any longer   practised there  On the contrary  the professed intent of thea    trical representations at present is to insinuate instruction under   the pleasing appearance of entertainment  to encourage virtue by   example  and inculcate the practice of it  by showing the evils   inseparably attendant on vice  to regulate the passions  by dis    playing the danger of indulging them too far  and to put folly out   of countenance  by holding it up to ridicule  Now  as experience   has proved the stage capable of answering these great ends  what   can be more injudicious than to attempt to bring it into disrepute    what more unjust than to consign to infamy those who exert the   finest powers of the human mind and body to accomplish this end   in the most pleasing manner   Yet  such is the absurdity of man    that while persons of the most exalted rank and sacred characters   not only frequent the theatre  but also compose works to be repre    sented on it  and evidently value themselves more on possessing   the abilities requisite to compose them  than oq all their other   distinctions in life  those from whose action such compositions   receive their force and beauty are held in disrepute  and subject   to the severest disadvantages only for acting them  If it is no   disgrace to write a play  why should it be any to act it   It is   true  the consequences of this prejudice are not so severe here as in   other countries  but still they are such as reason is ashamed of    If actors are not literally excluded from the protection of the laws    they want support to avail themselves of that protection  as in the   case which gave rise to these reflections  If they are not actually    for literally they are  excluded from the rites of religion  they want   encouragement to participate in them  I see you are ready to   object to the utility of the stage  the faults in many of the perform    ances exhibited upon it  and to justify the disrepute affixed to the   character of an actor  from the general immorality of their conduct   in private life  as if it arose solely from their profession  But a   moment s reflection would suggest answers to both these objections    If there is any improper exhibition upon the stage  surely the blame   should fall on those who have a legal power to prevent such abuse of   the institution of it  If the actors are immoral in their lives  should   it not be considered that they are prejudiced from their profession          376 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     and deprived of one of the strongest mducements of virtue  that is    reputation  before they are proved to be guilty of vice  The con    sequence of this is  that too few enter into the profession till aftÂ«r   they have lost their reputation  or are driven by mere necessity  by   which means they reflect that disgrace upon it  which they are   thought to suffer from it   and as they are sensible that they are   precluded by this prejudice from all possibility of recovering or   preserving it by the most careful deportment  they become desperate    and proceed till they even lose the sense of imavailing shame    Whereas  if a different conduct was observed to them  if the brand   of reputation was taken off  and the profession established in that   credit which the abilities indispensably necessary to eminence in   it deserves  genius would be no longer damped by apprehension of   reproach   more persons of good character would not scruple going   on the stage  as they could preserve it there  nor vice seem to receive   encouragement
