he professed an enthusiastic admiration   He swore  that the pleasure he felt was equal to that of a Mussulman  on  the last day of his pilgrimage to Mecca  and that he already considered  himself a native of Antwerp  being so intimately acquainted with their  so justly boasted citizen  from whom  at certain junctures  he could  not help believing himself derived  because his own pencil adopted the  manner of that great man with surprising facility  and his face wanted  nothing but a pair of whiskers and a beard  to exhibit the express  image of the Fleming s countenance  He told them he was so proud of this  resemblance  that  in order to render it more striking  he had  at one  time of his life  resolved to keep his face sacred from the razor   and in that purpose had persevered  notwithstanding the continual  reprehensions of Mrs  Pallet   who  being then with child   said  his  aspect was so hideous  that she dreaded a miscarriage every hour  until  she threatened in plain terms  to dispute the sanity of his intellects   and apply to the chancellor for a committee   The doctor  on this occasion  observed  that a man who is not proof  against the solicitations of a woman  can never expect to make a great  figure in life  that painters and poets ought to cultivate no wives but  the Muses  or  if they are by the accidents of fortune encumbered with  families  they should carefully guard against that pernicious weakness   falsely honoured with the appellation of natural affection  and pay no  manner of regard to the impertinent customs of the world   Granting that  you had been for a short time deemed a lunatic   said he   you  might have acquitted yourself honourably of that imputation  by some  performance that would have raised your character above all censure   Sophocles himself  that celebrated tragic poet  who  for the sweetness  of his versification  was styled Melitta  or  the Bee   in his old age   suffered the same accusation from his own children  who  seeing him    6 22 15  3 45 PM   neglect his family affairs  and devote himself entirely to poetry   carried him before the magistrate  as a man whose intellects were so  much impaired by the infirmities of age  that he was no longer fit to  manage his domestic concerns  upon which the reverend bard produced his  tragedy of Oidipus epi Kolono  as a work he had just finished  which  being perused  instead of being declared unsound of understanding   he was dismissed with admiration and applause  I wish your beard and  whiskers had been sanctioned by the like authority  though I am afraid  you would have been in the predicament of those disciples of a certain  philosopher  who drank decoctions of cummin seeds  that their faces  might adopt the paleness of their master s complexion  hoping that  in  being as wan  they would be as learned as their teacher   The painter   stung by this sarcasm  replied   or like those virtuosi  who  by  repeating Greek  eating sillikicaby  and pretending to see visions   think they equal the ancients in taste and genius   The physician  retorted  Pallet rejoined  and the altercation continued until they  entered the gates of Antwerp  when the admirer of Rubens broke forth  into a rapturous exclamation  which put an end to the dispute and  attracted the notice of the inhabitants  many of whom by shrugging up  their shoulders and pointing to their foreheads  gave shrewd indications  that they believed him a poor gentleman disordered in his brain   They had no sooner alighted at the inn  than this pseudo enthusiast  proposed to visit the great church  in which he had been informed some  of his master s pieces were to be seen  and was remarkably chagrined   when he understood that he could not be admitted till next day  He rose  next morning by day break  and disturbed his fellow travellers in such a  noisy and clamorous manner  that Peregrine determined to punish him with  some new infliction  and  while he put on his clothes  actually  formed the plan of promoting a duel between him and the doctor  in the  management of which  he promised himself store of entertainment  from  the behaviour of both   Being provided with one of those domestics who are always in waiting  to offer their services to strangers on their first arrival  they were  conducted to the house of a gentleman who had an excellent collection  of pictures  and though the greatest part of them were painted by his  favourite artist  Pallet condemned them all by the lump  because Pickle  had told him beforehand that there was not one performance of Rubens  among the number   The next place they visited was what is called the Academy of Painting   furnished with a number of paltry pieces  in which our painter  recognised the style of Peter Paul  with many expressions of admiration   on the
