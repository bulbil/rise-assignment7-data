s hand  kissed it eagerly  crying   God for ever bless your honour  I am your name son  sure enough—but what of that  I can earn my bread without being beholden to any man    When the knight raised him up  he turned to the woman of the house  saying   I want to see mother  I m afraid as how times are hard with her  and I have saved some money for her use   This instance of filial duty brought tears into the eyes of our adventurer  who assured him his mother should be carefully attended  and want for nothing  but that it would be very improper to see her at present  as the surprise might shock her too much  considering that she believed him dead   Ey  indeed   cried the landlady   we were all of the same opinion  being as the report went  that poor Greaves Oakley was killed in battle    Lord  mistress   said Oakley   there wan t a word of truth in it  I ll assure you —What  d ye think I d tell a lie about the matter  Hurt I was  to be sure  but that don t signify  we gave  em as good as they brought  and so parted — Well  if so be I can t see mother  I ll go and have some chat with Suky  —What d ye look so glum for  she an t married  is she    No  no   replied the woman   not married  but almost heart broken  Since thou wast gone she has done nothing but sighed  and wept  and pined herself into a decay  I m afraid thou hast come too late to save her life    Oakley s heart was not proof against this information  Bursting into tears  he exclaimed   O my dear  sweet  gentle Suky  Have I then lived to be the death of her whom I loved more than the whole world   He would have gone instantly to her father s house  but was restrained by the knight and his company  who had now joined him in the kitchen   The young man was seated at table  and gave them to understand  that the ship to which he belonged having arrived in England  he was indulged with a month s leave to see his relations  and that he had received about fifty pounds in wages and prize money  After dinner  just as they began to deliberate upon the measures to be taken against Gobble  that gentleman arrived at the inn  and humbly craved admittance  Mr  Fillet  struck with a sudden idea  retired into another apartment with the young farmer  while the justice  being admitted to the company  declared that he came to propose terms of accommodation  He accordingly offered to ask pardon of Sir Launcelot in the public papers  and pay fifty pounds to the poor of the parish  as an atonement for his misbehaviour  provided the knight and his friends would grant him a general release  Our adventurer told him  he would willingly waive all personal concessions  but  as the case concerned the community  he insisted upon his leaving off acting in the commission  and making satisfaction to the parties he had injured and oppressed  This declaration introduced a discussion  in the course of which the justice s petulance began to revive  when Fillet  entering the room  told them he had a reconciling measure to propose  if Mr  Gobble would for a few minutes withdraw   He rose up immediately  and was shown into the room which Fillet had prepared for his reception  While he sat musing on this untoward adventure  so big with disgrace and disappointment  young Oakley  according to the instructions he had received  appeared all at once before him  pointing to a ghastly wound  which the doctor had painted on his forehead  The apparition no sooner presented itself to the eyes of Gobble  than  taking it for granted it was the spirit of the young farmer whose death he had occasioned  he roared aloud   Lord have mercy upon us   and fell insensible on the floor  There being found by the company  to whom Fillet had communicated his contrivance  he was conveyed to bed  where he lay some time before he recovered the perfect use of his senses  Then he earnestly desired to see the knight  and assured him he was ready to comply with his terms  inasmuch as he believed he had not long to live  Advantage was immediately taken of this salutary disposition  He bound himself not to act as a justice of the peace  in any part of Great Britain  under the penalty of five thousand pounds  He burnt Mrs  Oakley s note  paid the debts of the shopkeeper  undertook to compound those of the publican  and to settle him again in business  and  finally  discharged them all from prison  paying the dues out of his own pocket  These steps being taken with peculiar eagerness  he was removed to his own house  where he assured his wife he had seen a vision that prognosticated his death  and had immediate recourse to the curate of the parish for spiritual consolation
