 threw her into such agonies  that Leonora had much ado to keep her from   falling into fits   she conjured her again and again  never to betray   what she had entrusted her with  assuring her  that if it were so much   as guessed at  she should be exposed to the worst treatment  and   punished as an enemy to the order of which she was a member  Louisa as   often assured her that nothing should either tempt or provoke her to   abuse that generous friendship she had testified for her  but as she was   not able to command her countenance  tho  she could her words  she   resolved to pretend herself indisposed and keep her bed  that she might   be the less observed  or the change in her should seem rather the   effects of ill health than any secret discontent       It was no sooner mentioned in the convent that she was out of order    than the abbess herself  as well as the whole sisterhood  came to her   chamber  and shewed the greatest concern  the tender care they took of   her would have made her think herself infinitely obliged to them  and   perhaps gone a great way in engaging her continuance among them  had she   not been apprized of their falshood in a point so little to be forgiven       So great an enemy was she to all deceit herself  that it was difficult   for her to return the civilities they treated her with  as they might   seem to deserve  but whatever omissions she was guilty of in this   particular  were imputed to her disposition  and the whole convent   continued to be extremely assiduous to recover her       During the time of her feigned illness  her thoughts were always   employed on the means of getting away  Whenever Leonora and she were   together  a hundred contrivances were formed  which seemed equally alike   impracticable  but at length they hit upon one which had a promising   aspect and Louisa  after some scruples  resolved to make trial of    It was this       As hypocrisy was made use of to detain her  hypocrisy was the only   method by which she could hope to get her liberty   pretending    therefore  to be all at once restored to her former health  she sent to   entreat the abbess  and some other of the most zealous of the sisterhood   to come into her chamber  where  as soon as they entered  they found her   on her knees before the picture of the virgin  and seeming in an extacy   of devotion  Yes  holy virgin  cried she  as if too much taken up to see   who entered  I will obey your commands   I will devote myself entirely   to thee   I will follow where thou callest me  thou  who hast restored   me  shalt have the first fruits of my strength   and oh that Lorretto   were at a greater distance   to the utmost extent of land and sea would   I go to seek thee   In uttering these ejaculations she prostrated   herself on the floor   then rising again  as transported in a manner out   of herself   I come   I come  cried she   still do I hear thy   heavenly voice       In this fit of enthusiasm did she remain for above half an hour  and so   well acted her part  that the abbess  who would not offer to interrupt   her  believed it real  and was in little less agitation of spirit than   Louisa pretended to be       At length seeming  to come to herself  she turned towards the company    as tho  she but just then discovered they were in the room  Oh  madam    said she to the abbess  how highly favoured have I been this blessed   night   The virgin has herself appeared to me  whether in a vision  or   to my waking eyes  I cannot well determine  but sure I have been in such   extacies  have felt such divine raptures  as no words can express       Oh my dear daughter  cried the abbess  how my soul kindles to behold   this change in thee   but tell me what said the holy virgin       She bad me wait on her at Lorretto  answered she  and gave me hopes of   doing something wonderful in my favour   I will therefore  with your   permission  undertake a pilgrimage and at her shrine expiate the   offences of my past life in tears of true contrition  and then return a   pure and fearless partaker of the happiness you enjoy in an   uninterrupted course of devotion   oh  exclaimed she  exalting her   voice
