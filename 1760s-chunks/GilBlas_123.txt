interruption  To attain this end  it seemed the most feasible plan to get rid of the constable  He therefore determined to have him arrested  as a person suspected of treasonable designs  in the then unsettled state of public affairs  This commission was given to the captain of his guard  who went immediately to Belmonte  secured the person of his prisoner just as the evening was closing in  and carried him to the castle of Palermo   This occurrence spread an alarm at Belmonte  Siffredi took his departure forthwith  to offer his own responsibility to the king for the innocence of his son in law  and to represent in their true colours the unpleasant consequences attending such arbitrary exertions of power  The prince  who had anticipated such a proceeding on the part of his minister  and was determined at least to secure himself a free interview with Blanche before the release of the constable  had expressly forbidden any one to address him till the next day  But Leontio  setting this prohibition at defiance  contrived so well as to make his way into the king s chamber  My liege  said he  with an air of humility tempered with firmness  if it is allowable for a subject full of respect and loyalty to complain of his master  I have to arraign you before the tribunal of your own conscience  What crime has my son in law committed  Has your majesty sufficiently reflected what an everlasting reproach is entailed on my family  Are the consequences of an imprisonment calculated to disgust all the most important officers of the state with the service  a matter of indifference  I have undoubted information  answered the king  that the constable holds a criminal correspondence with the Infant Don Pedro  A criminal correspondence  interrupted Leontio  with surprise  Ah  my liege  give no ear to the surmise  Your majesty is played upon  Treason never gained a footing in the family of Siffredi  It is sufficient security for the constable that he is my son in law  to place him above all suspicion  The constable is innocent  but private motives have been the occasion of your arresting him   Since you speak to me so openly  replied the king  I will adopt the same sincerity with you  You complain of the constable s imprisonment  Be it so  And have I no reason to complain of your cruelty  it is you  barbarous Siffredi  who have wrested my tranquillity from me  and reduced your sovereign  by your officious cares  to envy the lowliest of the human race  For do not so far deceive yourself as to believe that I shall ever enter into your views  My marriage with Constance is quite out of the question         What  my liege  interrupted Leontio  with an expression of horror  is there any doubt about your marrying the princess  after having flattered her with that hope in the face of your whole people  If their wishes are disappointed  replied the king  take the credit to yourself  Wherefore did you reduce me to the necessity of giving them a promise my heart would not allow me to make good  Where was the occasion to fill up with the name of Constance an instrument designed for the elevation of your own daughter  You could not be a stranger to my design  need you have completed your tyranny by devoting Blanche to the arms of a man to whom she could not give her heart  And what authority have you over mine to dispose of it in favour of a princess whom I detest  Have you forgotten that she is the daughter of that cruel Matilda  who  trampling the rights of consanguinity and human nature under foot  caused my father to breathe his last under all the rigours of a hard captivity  And should I marry her  No  Siffredi  throw away that hope  Before the lurid torch of such an hymeneal shall be kindled in your presence  you shall behold all Sicily in flames  and the expiring embers quenched in blood   Do not my ears deceive me  exclaimed Leontio  Ah  sovereign  what a scene do you present me with  Who can hear such menaces without shuddering  But I am too forward to take the alarm  continued he in an altered voice  You are in too close a union with your subjects to be the instrument of a catastrophe so melancholy  You will not suffer passion to triumph over your reason  Virtues like yours shall never lose their lustre by the tarnish of human and ordinary weakness  If I have given my daughter into the arms of the constable  it was with the design  my liege  of securing to your majesty a powerful subject  able by his own valour  and the army under his command  to maintain your party against that of the Prince Don Pedro  It appeared to me that by connecting him with my family in so close a bond         Yes  yes  This bond  exclaimed Prince Enriquez  this fatal bond has been my ruin  Unfeeling friend  to aim a wound at my vital part  What commission had you to take care of my interests at the expense of my affections  Why did you not leave me to support my pretensions by my own arm
