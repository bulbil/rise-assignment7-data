it should be taken  It was to YOU  they said  and you would know how to receive as you ought the distinction paid you  I have a soul  Sir  not unworthy of the spirit of my ancestors  Tell me what you fear —I only fear one thing  and that is  that I should be thought to be more in your power than in my own   Noble Lady  And think you  that while my happiness is not yet absolutely resolved upon  I have not reason to fear —You will always  madam  be in your own power  You will be most so when in mine  My gratitude will ever prompt me to acknowlege your goodness to me as a condescension   But say  tell me  Sir  Did you not  at first receiving the invitation  despise  in absence  the Clementina  that now perhaps  in presence  you have the goodness to pity   O that the high soul d Clementina would not think   261 so contemptibly of the man before her  as she must think  when she puts a question that would intitle him to infamy  could he presume to think an answer to it necessary   Well  Sir  I shall see how far the advances made an the wrong side will be justified  or rather countenanced  by the advances  or  shall I say  I will if you please  condescensions to be made on yours    What a petulance  thought I  But can the generous  the noble Clementina  knowing that terms will be proposed  with which in honour and conscience I cannot comply  put my regard for her on such a test as this —I will not suppose that she is capable of mingling art with her magnanimity    Is this  madam  said I  a generous anticipation  Forgive me  But when your friends are so good as to think me incapable of returning ingratitude for obligation  I hope I shall not be classed  by their beloved daughter  among the lowest of mankind   Excuse me  Sir  the woman who has been once wrong  has reason to be always afraid of herself  if you do not think meanly of me  I will endeavour to think well of myself  and then  Sir  I shall think better of you  if better I can think  For  after all  did I not more mistrust myself than I do you  I should not perhaps be so capricious as  I am afraid  I sometimes am   The Marquis has hinted to me  madam  That your brother the Bishop is to discourse with me on the subject now the nearest to my heart of all others  May I presume to address myself to their beloved daughter upon it  without being thought capable of endeavouring to prepossess her in my favour before my Lord and I meet   I will answer you frankly  Sir  There are preliminaries to be settled  and  till they are  I that know there are  do not think myself at liberty to hear you upon any subject that may tend to prepossession     262 I acquiesce  madam  I would not for the world be thought to wish for the honour of your attention  while it is improper for you to favour me with it    I did not know  Dr  Bartlett  but upon a supposition of a mutual interest between us  as I had hoped she would allow  Clementina might wish that I would lead to some particular discourse  Tho  modesty becomes ours as well as the other sex  yet it would be an indelicacy not to prevent a Lady  in some certain cases  But thus discouraged   Perhaps  madam  said I  the attendance I do myself the honour to pay you here  may not be agreeable to the Marquis   Then  Sir  you will choose  perhaps  to withdraw  But don t—Yes  do   I respectfully withdrew  but she taking a winding alley  which led into that in which I slowly walked  we met again  I am afraid  said she  I have been a little petulant  Indeed  Sir  I am not satisfied with myself  I wish —And there she stopt   What  madam  do you wish  Favour me with your wishes  If it be in my power—  It is not  interrupted she  I wish I had not been at Florence  The Lady I was with  is a good woman  but she was too hard for me  Perhaps  and she sighed  had I not been with her  I had been at rest  and happy  before now  but if I had not  there is a pleasure  as well as pain  in melancholy  But now I am so fretful —If I hated the bitterest enemy I have  as much as at times I hate myself  I should be a very bad creature   This was spoken with an air so melancholy  as greatly disturbed me  God grant  thought I  that the articles of Religion and residence may be agreed upon between the Bishop and me   Here  my good Miss Byron  I close this Letter  Sir Charles has told you
