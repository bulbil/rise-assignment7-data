name  Do you know that the heiress in question will bring a hundred thousand ducats in her pocket  Is not that a pretty little sprig of jewellery  To the resounding echo of so large a sum  my ears were instantly symphonious  The day is your own  said I to the secretary  the fortune determines the case in the lady s favour  When do you mean to put me in possession  Fair and softly  sir  answered he  the more haste the worse speed  It will be necessary for me first to communicate the affair to the father  and instil the advantage of it into his capacity  Good  rejoined I with a burst of laughter  is it thereabouts you are  The match is far advanced in its progress towards consummation  Much nearer than you suppose  replied he  But one hour s conversation with the goldsmith  and I pledge myself for his consent But  before we go any further  let us come to an agreement  if you please  Supposing that I should transfer a hundred thousand ducats to you  what would my commission be  Twenty thousand  was my answer  Heaven be praised therefore  said he  I guessed your gratitude at ten thousand  so that it doubles mine in a similar case  Come on then  I will set this negotiation on foot to morrow morning  and you may count upon its success  or I am little better than one of the foolish ones   In fact  he said to me two days afterwards  I have spoken to Signor Gabriel Salero  my friend the goldsmith  On the loud report of your high desert and credit  he has lent a favourable ear to my offer of you for a son in law  You are to have his daughter with a hundred thousand ducats  provided you can make it appear clearly that you are in possession of the minister s good graces  Since that is the case  said I confidently to Scipio  I shall soon be married  But  not entirely to forget the girl  have you seen her  is she pretty  Not quite so pretty as her fortune  answered he  Between ourselves  this heiress s looks are as hard as her cash  Luckily  you are perfectly indifferent about that  Stone blind  by the light of the sun  my good fellow  replied I  As for us whimsical fellows about court  we marry merely for the sake of marrying  When we want beauty  we look for it in our friends  wives  and if  by fates and destinies  the sweets are wasted on our own  their flavour is so mawkish to our palate  that there is some merit in their not carrying the commodity to a foreign market   This is not all  resumed Scipio  Signor Gabriel hopes for the pleasure of your company to supper this evening  By agreement  there is to be no mention of marriage  He has invited several of his mercantile friends to this entertainment  where you will take your chance with the rest  and to morrow he means to sup with you on the same terms  By this you will perceive his drift of looking before he leaps  You will do well to be a little on your guard before him  Oh  for the matter of that  interrupted I with an air of confidence  let him scrutinize me as closely as he pleases  the result cannot fail to be in my favour   All this happened as it was foretold  I was introduced at the goldsmith s  who received me with the familiarity of an old acquaintance  A vulgar dog  but warm  and as troublesome with his civility as a prude with her virtue  He presented me to Signora Eugenia his wife  and the youthful Gabriela his daughter  I opened wide my budget of compliments  without infringing the treaty  and prattled soft nothings to them  in all the vacuity of courtly dialogue   Gabriela  with submission to my secretary s better taste  was not altogether so repulsive  whether by dint of being outrageously bedizened  or because I looked at her in the raree shew box of her fortune  A charming house this of Signor Gabriel  There is less silver  I verily believe  in the Peruvian mines  than under his roof  That metal presented itself to the view in all directions  under a thousand different forms  Every room  and especially that where we were entertained  was a fairy palace  What a bird s eye view for a son in law  The old codger  to do the thing genteelly  had collected five or six merchants about him  all plodding spirit wearing personages  Their tongues could only talk of what their hearts were set upon  it was high change all supper time  but unfortunately wit was at a discount   Next night  it was my turn to treat the goldsmith  Not being able to dazzle him with my sideboard  I had recourse to another artifice  I invited to supper such of my friends as made the finest figure at court  hangers on of state noted for the unwieldiness of their ambition  These fellows could not talk on common topics  the brilliant and lucrative posts at which they aimed were all canvassed in detail  this too made its
