to defeat the one and to punish the other    It was now in his power instantly to consummate his marriage  as a   priest might be procured without a moment s delay  and as ALMEIDA S   consent was already given  he would then obtain the possession of her   person  by the very act in which she perfidiously resigned it to his   rival  to whom he would then leave the beauties he had already   possessed  and cast from him in disdain  as united with a mind that he   could never love  As his imagination was fired with the first conception   of this design  he caught her to his breast with a fury  in which all   the passions in all their rage were at once concentered   Let the   priest   said he   instantly unite us  Let us comprize  in one moment    in this instant  NOW  our whole of being  and exclude alike the future   and the past   Then grasping her still in his arms  he looked up to   heaven   Ye powers   said he   invisible but yet present  who mould my   changing and unresisting form  prolong  but for one hour  that   mysterious charm  that is now upon me  and I will be ever after   subservient to your will        ALMEIDA  who was terrified at the furious ardor of this unintelligible   address  shrunk from his embrace  pale and trembling  without power to   reply  HAMET gazed tenderly upon her  and recollecting the purity and   tenderness with which he had loved her  his virtues suddenly recovered   their force  he dismissed her from his embrace  and turning from her  he   dropped in silence the tear that started to his eye  and expressed  in a   low and faultering voice  the thoughts that rushed upon his mind   No     said he  HAMET shall still disdain the joy  which is at once sordid and   transient  in the breast of HAMET  lust shall not be the pander of   revenge  Shall I  who have languished for the pure delight which can   arise only from the interchange of soul with soul  and is endeared by   mutual confidence and complacency  shall I snatch under this disguise    which belies my features and degrades my virtue  a casual possession of   faithless beauty  which I despise and hate  Let this be the portion of   those  that hate me without a cause  but let this be far from me   At   this thought  he felt a sudden elation of mind  and the conscious   dignity of virtue  that in such a conflict was victorious  rendered him    in this glorious moment  superior to misfortune  his gesture became   calm  and his countenance sedate  he considered the wrongs he suffered    not as a sufferer  but as a judge  and he determined at once to discover   himself to ALMEIDA  and to reproach her with her crime  He remarked her   confusion without pity  as the effect not of grief but of guilt  and   fixing his eyes upon her  with the calm severity of a superior and   offended being   Such   said he   is the benevolence of the Almighty to   the children of the dust  that our misfortunes are  like poisons    antidotes to each other        ALMEIDA  whose faculties were now suspended by wonder and expectation    looked earnestly at him  but continued silent   Thy looks   said HAMET    are full of wonder  but as yet thy wonder has no cause  in comparison   of that which shall be revealed  Thou knowest the prodigy  which so   lately parted HAMET and ALMEIDA  I am that HAMET  thou art that   ALMEIDA   ALMEIDA would now have interrupted him  but HAMET raised his   voice  and demanded to be heard   At that moment   said he   wretched as   I am  the child of error and disobedience  my heart repined in secret at   the destiny which had been written upon my head  for I then thought thee   faithful and constant  but if our hands had been then united  I should   have been more wretched than I am  for I now know that thou art fickle   and false  To know thee  though it has pierced my soul with sorrow  has   yet healed the wound which was inflicted when I lost thee  and though I   am now compelled to wear the form of ALMORAN  whose vices are this   moment disgracing mine  yet in the balance I shall be weighed as HAMET    and I shall suffer only as I am found wanting        ALMEIDA  whose mind was now in a tumult that bordered upon distraction
