 with persecuting us  left us to perish in peace  He supposed my father    could not hold out long  and he then concluded I should be at his mercy  for as I never stirred out of the jail  he had no hopes of getting me into his power whilst my poor father lived   If I had even a place of refuge to go to  I could not think of leaving him in the wretched hopeless condition to which he was now reduced  I thought therefore of applying myself to something  by which I could obtain bread for our support  I set about making those little artificial flowers  which had formerly been one of my amusements  and a woman  who was confined in the same prison with us  and worked for some shops  undertook to dispose of them for me  She had a daughter  who came often to see her  and used to carry her work and mine to the people who bespoke it   In this manner we have languished  Madam  near eighteen months  when hearing lately that Mr Ware was gone to Bath  and the girl who used to visit her mother being sick  I ventured out myself with the work  The person who employs us did live in the city  but has lately taken a shop in this street  and though it is a journey from what I now call my dismal home  I have come to her once a week  for this month past  with the product of my own  and  I may say  my fellow prisoner’s labours  She told me this day she was overstocked with such flowers as I brought her  and  having picked out a few of the best of them  she left those  which you see in my band box  upon my hands  I was returning home very disconsolate  when  to avoid your chariot  which drew up close to the house  I stood up on one of your steps  not knowing it was going to stop  and something in your countenance  Madam  I know not how  encouraged me to offer my little ware to you   I have given you this affecting story  my Cecilia  pretty nearly in the girl’s own words  I was much moved by it  If this be all fact  said I  what monsters are there among mankind   She replied  It was all very true   Though the girl was very young  and  as I told you  had a modest and ingenuous look  yet as I had seen such cheating faces before  I would not yield up my belief implicitly  This story might be invented to move compassion  at least  the most material circumstances of it  and though I could not suppose she had contrived it on the spot  yet I did not know but it might have been contrived for her   I have a mind to see your father  child  said I   She answered  quite composed  Then  Madam  you will see an object  that would greatly move your pity     She rose up as she spoke this  saying  her poor father would be very uneasy at her staying so long  and was preparing to go   I was seized with a strong inclination to visit this unhappy father directly  If  said I  the case be as she represents it  I cannot be too speedy in my relief  and  if she has falsified in any thing  I shall probably detect her  by not giving her an opportunity of seeing and preparing him first   It was not more than eleven o’clock  and I resolved not to defer the charity I intended  I desired the young woman to stay a while  and ordering Patty to bring down a plain black silk hood and scarf of her own  I made the poor girl  to her great astonishment  put them on  I then ordered a hackney coach to be called  and said  I would go with her to her father  She looked surprized  but not startled  which made a favourable impression on me  She appeared decent  and I desired her to get into the coach  which I ordered  according to her direction  to drive to the jail  where her father was confined   When we arrived at this mansion of horror  for so it appeared to me  I let her go up stairs before me  She stopped at a door  and said that was the room where her father lay  I bid her go in first  she entered  and I stood without side the door  where  as the lobby was dark  I could not readily be perceived   I saw there a man of about sixty  and as she had told me her father was corpulent  I did not at first take him to be the person  for he looked worn out  pale  and emaciated  He wore his own grisled hair  and had on a cassock  girded about him with silk sash  One of his hands was slung in a black crape  he sat pensively  leaning on a table  with a book open before him  which seemed to be the Bible   Upon his daughter’s going into the
