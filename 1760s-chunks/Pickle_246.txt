of  whom despaired of my life  and took his leave accordingly  but Dr   S    who was the other  persisted in his attendance  and  in all human  appearance  saved my life  a circumstance by which he acquired a great  share of reputation  Yet  notwithstanding all his assistance  I was  confined to my bed for ten weeks  during which Lord B   s grief was  immoderate  his care and generosity unlimited  While I lay in this  extremity  Mr  S    penetrated by my melancholy condition  which revived  his tenderness  begged leave to be admitted to my presence  and Lord B    would have complied with his request  had I not been judged too weak to  bear the shock of such an interview  My constitution  however  agreeably  disappointed my fears  and the fever had no sooner left me  than I was  removed to a hunting seat belonging to my lover  from whence  after I  had recovered my strength  we went to B   castle  where we kept open  house  And  while we remained at this place  Lord B   received a letter  from Lord     dated in November  challenging him to single combat in  May  upon the frontiers of France and Flanders  This defiance was  sent in consequence of what had passed between them long before my  indisposition  at a meeting in a certain tavern  where they quarrelled   and in the fray  my lover threw his antagonist under the table  I  counselled him to take no notice of this rhodomontade  which I knew was  void of all intention of performance  and he was wise enough to follow  my advice  resolved  however  should the message be repeated  to take  the challenger at his word     6 22 15  3 45 PM    Having resided some time at this place  we returned to the other  country house which he had left  where Lord B   addicted himself so  much to hunting  and other male diversions  that I began to think he  neglected me  and apprised him of my suspicion  assuring him  at the  same time  that I would leave him as soon as my opinion should be  confirmed  This declaration had no effect upon his behaviour  which  became so remarkably cold  that even Mr  R    who lived with us   imagined that his affection was palpably diminished  When I went to  town  I was usually attended by his cousin  or this gentleman  or both   but seldom favoured with his company  nay  when I repaired to Bath  for  the re establishment of my health  he permitted me to go alone  so that  I was quite persuaded of his indifference  and yet I was mistaken in my  opinion  But I had been spoiled by the behaviour of my first husband   and Mr  S    who never quitted me for the sake of any amusement  and  often resisted the calls of the most urgent business  rather than part  from me  though but for a few hours  I thought every man who loved me  truly would act in the same manner  and  whether I am right or wrong  in my conjectures  I leave wiser casuists to judge  Certain it is   such sacrifice and devotion is the most pleasing proof of an admirer s  passion  and  Voyez moi plus souvent  et ne me donnez rien  is one of my  favourite maxims  A man may give money  because he is profuse  he may  be violently fond  because he is of a sanguine constitution  But  if he  gives me his time  he gives me an unquestionable proof of my being in  full possession of his heart    My appearance at Bath  without the company of Lord B    occasioned a  general surprise  and encouraged the men to pester me with addresses   every new admirer endeavouring to advance his suit by demonstrating the  unkind and disrespectful behaviour of his lordship  Indeed  this was  the most effectual string they could touch  My pride and resentment were  alarmed  I was weak enough to listen to one man  who had like to have  insinuated himself into my inclinations  He was tall and large boned   with white hair  inclining to what is called sandy  and had the  reputation of being handsome  though I think he scarce deserved that  epithet  He possessed a large fortune  loved mischief  and stuck  at nothing for the accomplishment of his designs  one of his chief  pleasures being that of setting any two lovers at variance  He employed  his address upon me with great assiduity  and knew so well how to  manage my resentment  that I was pleased with his manner  heard his vows  without disgust  and  in a word  promised to deliberate with myself upon  his proposals  and give him an account of my determination in writing    Thus resolved  I went to
