soon as I got ashore  about my generous companion Mr  Thomson  and hearing that he lived in a flourishing condition  upon the estate lest to him by his wife s father  who had been dead some years  I took horse immediately  with the consent of Don Rodriguez  who had heard me mention him with great regard    338 and in a few hours reached the place of his habitation   I should much wrong the delicacy of Mr  Thomson s sentiments  to say barely he was glad to see me  He felt all that the most sensible and disinterested friendship could feel on this occasion  introduced me to his wife  a very amiable young lady  who had already blessed him with two fine children  and being as yet ignorant of my circumstances  frankly offered me the assistance of his purse and interest  I thanked him for his generous intention  and made him acquainted with my situation  on which he congratulated me with great joy  and after I had staid with him a whole day and night  accompanied me back to Kingston  to wait upon my father  whom he invited to his house  Don Rodriguez complied with his request  and having been handsomely entertained during the space of a week  returned extremely well satisfied with the behaviour of my friend and his lady  to whom at parting  he presented a valuable diamond ring  as a token of his esteem  During the course of my conversation with Mr  Thomson  he let me know  that his and my old commander captain Oakhum was dead some months  and that immediately after his death  a discovery had been made of some valuable effects that he had feloniously secreted out of a prize  by the assistance of Dr  Mackshane  who was now actually in prison on that account  and being destitute of friends  subsisted solely on the charity of my friend  whose bounty he had implored in the most abject manner  after having been the barbarous occasion of driving him to that terrible extremity on board of the Thunder  which we   339 have formerly related —Whatsoever this wretch might have been guilty of  I applauded Mr  Thomson s generosity towards him in his distress  which wrought so much upon me also  that I sent him ten pistoles  in such a private manner  that he could never know his benefactor   While my father and I were caressed among the gentlemen on shore  captain Bowling had wrote to his owners  by the packet  which sailed a few days after our arrival  signifying his prosperous voyage hitherto  and desiring them to ensure his ship and cargo homeward bound  after which he applied himself so heartily to the loading his ship  that with the assistance of Mr  Thomson  she was full in less than six weeks  This kind gentleman likewise procured for Don Rodriguez  bills upon London for the greatest part of his gold and silver  by which means it was secured against the risk of the seas and the enemy  and before we sailed  supplied us with such large quantities of all kinds of stock  that not only we  but the whole ships company  fared sumptuously during the voyage   Every thing being ready  we took our leave of our kind entertainers  and going on board at Port Royal  set sail for England on the first day of June —We beat up to windward  with fine easy weather  and one night  believing ourselves near Cape Tiberoon  lay to  with an intention to wood and water next morning in the bay  While we remained in this situation  a sailor having drank more new rum than he could carry  staggered over board  and notwithstanding all the means that could be used to preserve him  went to the bottom and disappeared  About two hours   340 after this melancholy accident happened  as I enjoyed a cool air on the quarter deck  I heard a voice rising  as it were  out of the sea  and calling     Ho  the ship  a hoy    Upon which one of the men upon the forecastle cried    I ll be d—n d  if that an t Jack Marlinspike  who went over board    Not a little surprized at this event  I jumped into the boat that lay along side  with the second mate and four men  and rowing towards the place  from whence the voice  which repeated the hail  seemed to proceed  we perceived something floating upon the water  when we had rowed a little farther  we discerned it to be a man riding upon a hencoop  who seeing us approach  pronounced with a hoarse voice    D—n your bloods  why did you not answer when I hailed    Our mate  who was a veritable seaman  hearing this salute  said    By G—d  my lads  this is none of our man—This is the devil—pull away for the ship    The fellows obeyed his command  without question  and were already some fathoms on our return  when I insisted on their taking up the poor creature  and prevailed upon them to go back to the wreck  which when we came near the second time  and signified our intention  we received an answer
