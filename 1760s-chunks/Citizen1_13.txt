receive company  this is called lying in state  To this disagreeable spectacle all the idlers in town flock  and learn to loath the wretch dead  whom they despised when living  In this manner you see some who would have refused a shilling to save the life of their dearest friend  bestow thousands on adorning their putrid corpse  I have been told of a fellow  who grown rich by the price of blood  left it in his will that he should lie in state  and thus unknowingly gibbeted himself into infamy  when he might have otherwise quietly retired into oblivion   When the person is buried  the next care is to make his epitaph  they are generally reckoned best which flatter most  such Relations therefore as have received most benefits from the defunct  discharge this friendly office  and generally flatter in proportion to their joy  When we read those monumental histories of the dead  it may be justly said  that all men are equal in the dust  for they all appear equally remarkable for being the most sincere Christians  the most benevolent neighbours  and   40 the honestest men of their time  To go through an European cemetery  one would be apt to wonder how mankind could have so basely degenerated from such excellent ancestors  every tomb pretends to claim your reverence and regret  some are praised for piety in those inscriptions who never entered the temple until they were dead  some are praised for being excellent poets  who were never mentioned  except for their dulness  when living  others for sublime orators  who were never noted except for their impudence  and others still for military atchievements  who were never in any other skirmishes but with the watch  Some even make epitaphs for themselves  and bespeak the readers good will  It were indeed to be wished  that every man would early learn in this manner to make his own  that he would draw it up in terms as flattering as possible  and that he would make it the employment of his whole life to deserve it   I have not yet been in a place called Westminster Abbey  but soon intend to visit it  There I am told I shall see justice done to deceased merit  none  I am told  are permitted to be buried there  but such as have adorned as well as improved mankind  There no intruders by the influence of friends or fortune  presume to mix their unhallowed ashes with philosophers  heroes  and poets  Nothing but true merit has a place in that awful sanctuary  the guardianship of the tombs is committed to several reverend priests  who are never guilty for a superior reward of taking down the names of good men  to make room for others of equivocal character  nor ever prophane the sacred walls with ants  that posterity cannot know  or shall blush to own     41I always was of opinion  that sepulchral honours of this kind should be considered as a national concern  and not trusted to the care of the priests of any country  how respectable soever  but from the conduct of the reverend personages  whose disinterested patriotism I shall shortly be able to discover  I am taught to retract my former sentiments  It is true  the Spartans and the Persians made a fine political use of sepulchral vanity  they permitted none to be thus interred  who had not fallen in the vindication of their country  a monument thus became a real mark of distinction  it nerved the heroe s arm with tenfold vigour  and he fought without fear  who only fought for a grave  Farewell   LETTER XIII  From the same   I AM just returned from Westminster abbey  the place of sepulture for the philosophers  heroes  and kings of England  What a gloom do monumental inscriptions and all the venerable remains of deceased merit inspire  Imagine a temple marked with the hand of antiquity  solemn as religious awe  adorned with all the magnificence of barbarous profusion  dim windows  fretted pillars  long colonades  and dark cielings  Think then  what were my sensations at being introduced to such a scene  I stood in the midst of the temple  and threw my eyes round on the walls filled with the statues  the inscriptions  and the monuments of the dead     42Alas  I said to myself  how does pride attend the puny child of dust even to the grave  Even humble as I am  I possess more consequence in the present scene than the greatest heroe of them all  they have toiled for an hour to gain a transient immortality  and are at length retired to the grave  where they have no attendant but the worm  none to flatter but the epitaph   As I was indulging such reflections  a gentleman dressed in black  perceiving me to be a stranger  came up  entered into conversation  and politely offered to be my instructor and guide through the temple  If any monument  said he  should particularly excite your curiosity  I shall endeavour to satisfy your demands  I accepted with thanks the gentleman s offer  adding  that    I was come to observe the policy  the wisdom  and the justice of the English  in conferring rewards upon deceased merit  If adulation like this  continued
