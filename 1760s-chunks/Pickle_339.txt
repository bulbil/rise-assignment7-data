pleased to term his account of the matter a very  ingenious explanation   The curiosity was circulated through the hands of all present  and every  virtuoso  in his turn  licked the copper  and rung it upon the hearth   declaring his assent to the judgment which had been pronounced  At  length it fell under the inspection of our young gentleman  who  though  no antiquarian  was very well acquainted with the current coin of his  own country  and no sooner cast his eyes upon the valuable antique  than  he affirmed  without hesitation  that it was no other than the ruins of  an English farthing  and that same spear  parazonium  and multicium  the  remains of the emblems and drapery with which the figure of Britannia  is delineated on our copper money  This hardy asseveration seemed to  disconcert the patron while it incensed the medallist  who  grinning  like an enraged baboon   What d ye tell me of a brass farthing   said  he   Did you ever know modern brass of such a relish  Do but taste it   young gentleman  and sure I am  if you have ever been conversant with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   subjects of this kind  you will find as wide a difference in the savour  between this and an English farthing as can possibly be perceived  betwixt an onion and a turnip  Besides  this medal has the true  Corinthian ring  then the attitude is upright  whereas that of Britannia  is reclining  and how is it possible to mistake a branch of palm for a  parazonium    All the rest of the company espoused the virtuoso s side of the  question  because the reputation of each was concerned  The patron   finding himself in the same circumstance  assumed a solemnity of  feature  dashed with a small mixture of displeasure  and told Peregrine   that as he had not made that branch of literature his particular  study  he was not surprised to see him mistaken in his opinion  Pickle  immediately understood the reproof  though he was shocked at the vanity  or infatuation of his entertainer and fellow guests  asked pardon for  his presumption  which was accordingly excused  in consideration of his  inexperience  and the English farthing was dignified with the title of a  true antique   The next person that addressed himself to the chief was a gentleman of a  very mathematical turn  who valued himself upon the improvements he had  made in several domestic machines  and now presented the plan of a new  contrivance for cutting cabbages  in such a manner as would secure the  stock against the rotting rain  and enable it to produce a plenteous  aftercrop of delicious sprouts  In this important machine he had united  the whole mechanic powers  with such massy complication of iron and  wood  that it could not have been moved without the assistance of  a horse  and a road made for the convenience of the draught  These  objections were so obvious  that they occurred at first sight to the  inspector general  who greatly commended the invention  which  he  observed  might be applied to several other useful purposes  could it  once be rendered a little more portable and commodious   The inventor  who had not foreseen these difficulties  was not prepared  to surmount them  but he took the hint in good part  and promised to  task his abilities anew  in altering the construction of his design  Not  but that he underwent some severe irony from the rest of the virtuosi   who complimented him upon the momentous improvement he had made  by  which a family might save a dish of greens in a quarter  for so trifling  an expense as that of purchasing  working  and maintaining such a  stupendous machine  but no man was ever more sarcastic in his remarks  upon this piece of mechanism than the naturalist  who next appealed to  the patron s approbation for a curious disposition he had made touching  the procreation of muck flies  in which he had laid down a curious  method of collecting  preserving  and hatching the eggs of these  insects  even in the winter  by certain modifications of artificial  heat  The nature of this discovery was no sooner communicated  than  Peregrine  unable to contain himself  was seized with a fit of laughter   which infected every person at the table  the landlord himself not  excepted  who found it impossible to preserve his wonted gravity of  face   Such unmannerly mirth did not fail to mortify the philosopher  who   after some pause  during which indignation and disdain were painted in  his countenance  reprehended our young gentleman for his unphilosophical  behaviour  and undertook to prove  that the subject of his inquiry  was of infinite consequence to the progress and increase of natural    6 22 15  3 45 PM   knowledge  But he found no quarter from the vengeful engineer  who now  retorted his ironical compliments  with great emphasis  upon this hotbed  for the generation of vermin  and advised him to lay
