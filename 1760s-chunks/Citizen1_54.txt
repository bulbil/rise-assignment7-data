that and our ribbons cheated us as if she had no conscience  and so to quiet mine I cheated her  All this is fair you know  I remain  my dear Yaya   Your ever faithful  YAOUA     169  LETTER XXXIX  From the same   YOU have always testified the highest esteem for the English poets  and thought them not inferior to the Greeks  Romans  or even the Chinese in the art  But it is now thought even by the English themselves that the race of their poets is extinct  every day produces some pathetic exclamation upon the decadence of taste and genius  Pegasus  say they  has slipped the bridle from his mouth  and our modern bards attempt to direct his flight by catching him by the tail   Yet  my friend  it is only among the ignorant that such discourses prevail  men of true discernment can see several poets still among the English  some of whom equal if not surpass their predecessors  The ignorant term that alone poetry which is couched in a certain number of syllables in every line  where a vapid thought is drawn out into a number of verses of equal length  and perhaps pointed with rhymes at the end  But glowing sentiment  striking imagery  concise expression  natural description  and modulated periods are full sufficient entirely to fill up my idea of this art  and make way to every passion   If my idea of poetry therefore be just  the English are not at present so destitute of poetical merit as they seem to imagine  I can see several poets in disguise among them  men furnished with that strength of soul  sublimity of sentiment  and grandour of expression  which constitutes the character    170 Many of the writers of their modern odes  sonnets  tragedies or rebusses  it is true  deserve not the name  though they have done nothing but clink rhymes and measure syllables for years together  their Johnson s and Smollet s are truly poets  tho  for aught I know they never made a single verse in their whole lives   In every incipient language the poet and the prose writer are very distinct in their qualifications  the poet ever proceeds first  treading unbeaten paths  enriching his native funds  and employed in new adventures  The other follows with more cautious steps  and though slow in his motions  treasures up every useful or pleasing discovery  But when once all the extent and the force of the language is known  the poet then seems to rest from his labour  and is at length overtaken by his assiduous pursuer  Both characters are then blended into one  the historian and orator catch all the poet s fire  and leave him no real mark of distinction except the iteration of numbers regularly returning  Thus in the decline of ancient European learning  Seneca  though he wrote in prose  is as much a poet as Lucan  and Longinus  though but a critic  more sublime than Apollonius   From this then it appears that poetry is not discontinued  but altered among the English at present  the outward form seems different from what it was  but poetry still continues internally the same  the only question remains whether the metric feet used by the good writers of the last age  or the prosaic numbers employed by the good writers of this  be preferable  And here the practice of the last age appears to me superior  they   171 submitted to the restraint of numbers and similar sounds  and this restraint  instead of diminishing  augmented the force of their sentiment and stile  Fancy restrained may be compared to a fountain which plays highest by diminishing the aperture  Of the truth of this maxim in every language  every fine writer is perfectly sensible from his own experience  and yet to explain the reason would be perhaps as difficult as to make a frigid genius profit by the discovery   There is still another reason in favour of the practice of the last age  to be drawn from the variety of modulation  The musical period in prose is confined to a very few changes  the numbers in verse are capable of infinite variation  I speak not now from the practice of modern verse writers  few of whom have any idea of musical variety  but run on in the same monotonous flow through the whole poem  but rather from the example of their former poets  who were tolerable masters of this variety  and also from a capacity in the language of still admitting various unanticipated music   Several rules have been drawn up for varying the poetic measure  and critics have elaborately talked of accents and syllables  but good sense and a fine ear which rules can never teach  are what alone can in such a case determine  The rapturous flowings of joy  or the interruptions of indignation  require accents placed entirely different  and a structure consonant to the emotions they would express  Changing passions  and numbers changing with those passions make the whole secret of western as well as eastern poetry  In a word  the great faults of the modern professed English   172 poets are  that they seem to want numbers which should vary with the passion  and are more employed in describing to the imagination than striking at the heart  Adieu   LETTER XL
