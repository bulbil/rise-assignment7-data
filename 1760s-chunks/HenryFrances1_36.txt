FRANCES  Wrote on the Death of J  K  Esq  HE was a Man of most excellent Composition —His Characteristicks were many and extraordinary  He was generous  without Extravagance  Oeconomist  without Parsimony    116 had Pride  without Vanity  and was friendly  without Professing  A Libertine  without Vice  Religious  without Bigotry  and an Enthusiast  without Fanaticism    He was a Man  take him for all in all  you shall not find his Fellow   or  to have examined him by Parts  you would have found each Character perfect  like the Division of Matter  where every Atom contains  in itself  the Dimensions of Solidity     He is dead  — but thou art alive  The Lord s Will was done in the first Instance  and mine in the Second  Accept now an undivided Heart  and live long to help me to forget my Grief   Henry   LETTER LXIX   THE Pleasure that I received from my dear Harry s Letter  could alone compensate for the Pain I felt from your unusual Silence  but you have made me large Amends  and I can readily forget all that is past  provided you do not repeat your Fault  I am so thoroughly persuaded of your Tenderness for me  that I know  I need but tell how much your Silence affects me  never to feel the Effects of it more   In short  my Heart s dear Harry  I am quite charmed with that manly Fondness  that Elegance   117 of Love  which you express in your last dear Letter  and  for the future  I shall say  with Emma    Doubt shall for ever quit my strengthen d Heart   And anxious Jealousy s corroding Smart   Nor other Inmate shall inhabit there   But soft Belief  young Joy  and pleasing Care     In spite of Medicines  I grow worse every Day  and am really reduced to a most melancholy State  but you  my dearest Harry  have brought back calm Content to visit me  and all may yet be well  I have not known a Flight of Spirits  since you left Town   till I received your last  and then I could not help bursting into Othello s Exclamation    If I were now to die  I were now to be most happy   c      I cannot help thinking that Fate seems averse to my Recovery  for the Sun    as if the Sun could envy   denies his wonted Beams  nor with more Regret beholds me drooping  than the Bells of Lillies  I have  for this Month past  had a severe Cough  and constant Pain across my Chest  I am worn to a Skeleton  and yet look as well as I ever did  but far more delicate  My Disorder is extremely polite  for  tho  it deprives me of the Reality  it leaves me the Appearance of Health  and I am so much a Woman  to forgive the Substance  for the Shadow       118I think you have done the strictest Justice to our fair Friend s Character  she is indeed a charming Girl — Pray tell me when you think of coming to Town — I fear you are grown so passionately fond of Belvidere  that you have no Wish for any Thing beside  nor even send a Sigh  in Pity to your banished Friends  However  let the Time of our Exile be limited  and  when we have a Goal in View  the Race will seem less tedious   My Hand trembles so violently  that I can scarce hold my Pen  I dare say  you will find it difficult to decypher my Hebrew Characters  I will therefore leave Puzzling  and in the plainest  which are generally the sincerest Terms  assure you  that  I am  and ever shall be  Your faithfully affectionate Frances   LETTER LXX   Dear FANNY   I RECEIVED two Letters from you since my last  and am heartily sorry to find you still continue ill  You give me great Comfort   119 however  by saying you have Hopes from Regularity  and the Waters  Because I am very certain  they jointly will cure you  I have often told you so  and it is some Satisfaction to find you  at length  profiting  like Hudibras  of Ralpho s Gifts  If I could perfectly master the Tenderness I have for you  and only attend to the Friendship I bear you  I should rejoice to hear you are so far ill  as to require severe and speedy Assistance  as I was at the taking of Bergen  and other Towns belonging to the Dutch  because I was then in Hopes  as I am now for you  that they would exert their utmost Vigour and Resolution  when Destruction was coming so home to them  tho  they were shamefully careless  and lukewarm about their Safety before   I am sorry to find you still continue to give an unfair Turn to every Thing I say and do  In your first Letter  you twist and warp my Meaning in the Allusion of Prior  and play Shuttle Cock with my
