P S  I have charged the man who brings you this  to find you        wherever you are  and not to leave you without an answer        Mr  Trueworth was in the utmost perplexity of mind on reading this   distracted epistle  Of all the hours of his past life he could not   recollect any one which gave him so much cause of repentance as that   wherein he had commenced an amour with a woman of so violent a temper    he had never loved her  and all the liking he ever had for her being now   utterly erased by a more laudable impression  the guilty pleasures he   had enjoyed with her were now irksome to his remembrance  and the more   she endeavoured to revive the tender folly in him  the more she grew   distasteful to him       It so little becomes a woman  whose characteristick should be modesty    to use any endeavours to force desire  that those who do it are sure to   convert love into indifference  and indifference into loathing and   contempt  even she who  with the greatest seeming delicacy  labours to   rekindle a flame once extinguished  will find the truth of what Morat   says in the play             To love once pass d we cannot backward move        Call yesterday again  and we may love        Mr  Trueworth  however  had so much pity for that unfortunate creature    that he would have given  perhaps  good part of his estate that she no   longer loved him  but how to turn the tide of so extravagant a passion    he could not yet resolve  and it being near the time in which he knew   they would expect him at Sir Bazil s  where he now dined every day  and   the messenger who brought him the letter also growing impatient to be   dispatched  he wrote in haste these few lines             To Miss Flora Mellasin            Madam            Business of the greatest consequence now calls upon me  and I have        no time to write as I would do  but depend upon it I will send to        you to morrow morning  and either appoint a meeting  or let you        know my real sentiments in a letter  till when  I beg you will make        yourself more easy  if you desire to oblige him who is  with the        most unfeigned good wishes  Madam  your most humble  and most        obedient servant            C  TRUEWORTH            P S  I shall take it as a favour  Madam  that you will henceforward        forbear to make any enquiry concerning me at the coffee house  or        elsewhere        Having given this to Miss Flora s porter  he hasted away to Sir Bazil s    there to compose his mind  after the embarrassments it had sustained   that morning                CHAPTER IX       Contains very little to the purpose          Mr  Francis Thoughtless had no sooner left the lodgings of Mr    Trueworth  than he went directly to those of his sister Betsy  where  in   the humour he then was  the reader will easily suppose  he could not be   very good company  After telling her he had seen Mr  Trueworth  and had   had some conversation with him on her account   I am now convinced     said he   of what before I doubted not  that by your own ill management    and want of a just sense of what is for your interest and happiness  you   have lost an opportunity of establishing both  which can never be   retrieved  nor is this all  your manner of behaviour not only ruins   yourself  but involves all belonging to you in endless quarrels and   perplexities        These were reproaches which Miss Betsy had too much spirit to have borne   from any one but a brother  and even to him she was far from yielding   that she had in any measure deserved them   I defy Trueworth himself     cried she  with all the resentment of a disappointed lover in her heart     to accuse me of one action that the strictest virtue could condemn
