are moved by the same passions  all the blows given to the malefactor did violently strike the  Page  9  mother s imagination  and by the counterblow  the tender and soft brain of the child —The fibres of the child s brain  not being able to resist the torrent of the spirits  were broken  that s the reason why he came into the world without understanding  The violent course of the mother s animal spirits went with force from her brains to the several parts of her body  which answered to the parts of the malefactor   twas the same in the child—but because the bones of the mother were capable to resist the violence of the spirits  they were not wounded  But this rapid stream of the spirits was capable to carry away the soft and tender parts of the bones of the child  and  tis to be observed  that if the mother had determined the motion of the spirits  toward any other part of the body  her child had not had his bones broke  but that part which answered to the part towards which the mother determined her spirits had been sorely wounded     VI  A gentlewoman of Helsenor  says Bartholin  was delivered of a great cat  which  to the astonishment of the assistants  ran away with great celerity  and was never seen afterwards—because the lady was frightened with one     VII  Bartholin also relates  I have it  he says from John Naborousky  a gentleman of Poland  and my good friend  that a woman of that country was brought to bed of two small fishes  without scales  which were no sooner born  but they swam in the neighbouring waters  as naturally as others do  because the lady did long for them  so that you see  my friend Thomas   Page  10  look you  it is all the same  according to the opinions of these learned people  whether a lady is frighted  or whether a lady longs     THOMAS   Well  let us hear some more stories  in the Name of God —I do love to hear such things  to be sure  but God help me  for my own sake  but to be sure I cannot believe all these things  so well as the scholars do  because I have not their learning  but go on  do my friend  do go on     Which request David obeyed immediately   VIII  Philippus Meurs  apostolical prothonotary  and cannon of St  Peter s in Louvain  a reverend ancient man  affirmed unto me  and several others  says our author  Thomas Fienus  that he had a sister compleat in the rest of her body  but without a head  Instead of which  was joined to her neck a shell fish  in the likeness of a sea muscle  made up of two shells  which shut and opened  and by which  from a spoon  she took her nourishment  And this he said was occasioned  for that the mother with child with her had a strong desire after some muscles she beheld in the market  but could not procure at that instant  This sister of his lived in this monstrous condition  to be eleven years old  and then  by accident  happening angrily  and very strongly  to bite the spoon they fed her with  and breaking the shells  died quickly after     IX  Schenkius tells of a woman very big  who  among other discourses with her neighbours  mention being made of her great belly  she told them  she reckoned about the time of Epiphany   Page  11  or festival of the three kings  Upon which the good woman wishing she might bring forth three kings  she merrily answered  with all her heart  and accordingly  at the time  she bore three sons  one of them an Ethiopian  or of a black colour  as usually one of those kings are painted  The same relation is confirmed by Cornel  Gemma  being seen  as he says  by great multitudes  in the city of Louvain  and authenticated by undoubted testimony     X  There was a lady  a kinswoman of mine  says Sir Kenelm Digby  who used much to wear black patches upon her face  a fashion among young women  which I  to put her from  used to tell her in jest  that the next child she should go with  should come into the world with a great black spot in the midst of its forehead  and the apprehension was so lively in her imagination  that she had a daughter born  and marked just as the mother had fancied  with a great black spot upon her     XI  There lived amongst us at Bern in Switzerland  says Gul  Fabricius  an honest woman  who  about ten years since  being great with child  and quarrelling with another woman  put herself into such a passion  that she was unable to contain herself  After which  falling into labour  she was brought to bed of a daughter  of a couragious and heroick mind  but her feet and hands contracted  as if ready to fight
