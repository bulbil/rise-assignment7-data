make the prettiest milk maid in the county       I am serious  and think we could live very superbly all together in the country  consider it well  my dear Ned  for I cannot bear to see my mother so unhappy as your absence makes her  I hear her on the stairs  I must hurry away my letter  for I don t chuse she should know I write to you on this subject       Adieu   Your affectionate  LUCY RIVERS       Say every thing for me to Bell Fermor  and in your own manner to your Emily  in whose friendship I promise myself great happiness     LETTER LXVIII   68   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Silleri   Montreal  Feb  10   NEVER any astonishment equalled mine  my dear Emily  at hearing you had broke an engagement of years  so much to your advantage as to fortune  and with a man of so very unexceptionable a character as Sir George  without any other apparent cause than a slight indelicacy in a letter of his mother s  for which candor and affection would have found a thousand excuses  I will not allow myself to suppose  what is however publicly said here  that you have sacrificed prudence  decorum  and I had almost said honor  to an imprudent inclination for a man  to whom there is the strongest reason to believe you are indifferent  and who is even said to have an attachment to another  I mean Colonel Rivers  who  though a man of worth  is in a situation which makes it impossible for him to think of you  were you even as dear to him as the world says he is to you       I am too unhappy to say more on this subject  but expect from our past friendship a very sincere answer to two questions  whether love for Colonel Rivers was the real motive for the indiscreet step you have taken  and whether  if it was  you have the excuse of knowing he loves you  I should be glad to know what are your views  if you have any  I am       My dear Emily   Your affectionate friend   E  MELMOTH     LETTER LXIX   69   To Mrs  MELMOTH  at Montreal   Silleri  Feb  19       My dear Madam   I AM too sensible of the rights of friendship  to refuse answering your questions  which I shall do in as few words as possible  I have not the least reason to suppose myself beloved by Colonel Rivers  nor  if I know my heart  do I love him in that sense of the word your question supposes  I think him the best  the most amiable of mankind  and my extreme affection for him  though I believe that affection only a very lively friendship  first awakened me to a sense of the indelicacy and impropriety of marrying Sir George       To enter into so sacred an engagement as marriage with one man  with a stronger affection for another  of how calm and innocent a nature soever that affection may be  is a degree of baseness of which my heart is incapable       When I first agreed to marry Sir George  I had no superior esteem for any other man  I thought highly of him  and wanted courage to resist the pressing solicitations of my uncle  to whom I had a thousand obligations  I even almost persuaded myself I loved him  nor did I find my mistake till I saw Colonel Rivers  in whose conversation I had so very lively a pleasure as soon convinced me of my mistake  I therefore resolved to break with Sir George  and nothing but the fear of giving him pain prevented my doing it sooner  his behaviour on the receipt of his mother s letter removed that fear  and set me free in my own opinion  and I hope will in yours  from engagements which were equally in the way of my happiness  and his ambition  If he is sincere  he will tell you my refusal of him made him happy  though he chuses to affect a chagrin which he does not feel       I have no view but that of returning to England in the spring  and fixing with a relation in the country       If Colonel Rivers has an attachment  I hope it is to one worthy of him  for my own part  I never entertained the remotest thought of him in any light but that of the most sincere and tender of friends  I am  Madam  with great esteem    Your affectionate friend         and obedient servant   EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER LXX   70   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Feb  27   THERE are two parties at Quebec in regard to Emily  the prudent mammas abuse her for losing a good match  and suppose it to proceed from her partiality to your brother  to the imprudence of which they give no quarter  whilst the misses admire her generosity and spirit  in sacrificing all for love  so impossible it is to please every body  However  she has  in my opinion  done the wisest thing in the world
