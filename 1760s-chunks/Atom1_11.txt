Nature produced a serpent without ever a head at all   The fourth who contributed his credit and capacity to this coalition  was Foksi Roku  a man who greatly surpassed them all in the science of politicks  bold  subtle  interested  insinuating  ambitious  and indefatigable  An adventurer from his cradle  a latitudinarian in principle  a libertine in morals  without the advantages of birth  fortune  character  or interest  by his own natural sagacity  a close attention to the follies and foibles of mankind  a projecting spirit  an invincible assurance  and an obstinacy of perseverance proof against all the shocks of disappointment and repulse  he forced himself as it were into the scale of preferment  and being found equally capable and compliant  rose to high offices of trust and profit  detested by the people  as one of the most desperate    56 tools of a wicked administration  and odious to his colleagues in the m—y  for his superior talents  his restless ambition  and the uncertainty of his attachment   As interest prompted him  he hovered between the triumvirate we have described  and another knot of competitors for the ad—n  headed by Quamba cun dono  a great Quo related to the Dairo  who had bore the supreme command in the army  and was stiled Fatzman   〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  or  by way of eminence  This accomplished prince was not only the greatest in his mind  but also the largest in his person of all the subjects of Japan  and whereas your Shakespeare makes Falstaff urge it as a plea in his own favour  that as he had more flesh  so likewise he had more frailty than other men  I may justly convert the proposition in favour of Quamba cun dono  and affirm    57 that as he had more flesh  so he had more virtue than any other Japonese  more bowels  more humanity  more beneficence  more affability  He was undoubtedly  for a Fatzman  the most courteous  the most gallant  the most elegant  generous  and munificent Quo that ever adorned the court of Japan  So consummate in the art of war  that the whole world could not produce a general to match him in foresight  vigilance  conduct  and ability  Indeed his intellects were so extraordinary and extensive  that he seemed of sentimentize at every pore  and to have the faculty of thinking disfused all over his frame  even to his fingers ends  or  as the Latins call it ad unguem  nay  so wonderful was his organical conformation  that  in the opinion of many Japonese philosophers  his whole body was enveloped in a kind of poultice of brain  and that if he had lost his head in battle     58 the damage with regard to his power of reflection would have been scarce perceptible  After he had atchieved many glorious exploits  in a war against the Chinese on the continent  he was sent with a strong army to quell a dangerous insurrection in the northern parts of Ximo  which is one of the Japonese islands  He accordingly by his valour crushed the rebellion  and afterwards  by dint of clemency and discretion  extinguished the last embers of disaffection  When the insurgents were defeated  dispersed  and disarmed  and a sufficient number selected for example  his humanity emerged  and took full possession of his breast  He considered them as wretched men misled by false principles of honour  and sympathized with their distress  he pitied them as men and fellow citizens  he regarded them as useful fellow subjects  who might be reclaimed and reunited to the community     59 Instead of sending out the ministers of blood  rapine  and revenge  to ravage  burn  and destroy  without distinction of age  sex  or principle  he extended the arms of mercy to all who would embrace that indulgence  he protected the lives and habitations of the helpless  and diminished the number of the malcontents much more effectually by his benevolence than by his sword   The southern Japonese had been terribly alarmed at this insurrection  and in the first transports of their deliverance  voluntarily taxed themselves with a considerable yearly tribute to the hero Quamba cun dono  In all probability  they would not have appeared so grateful  had they stayed to see the effects of his merciful disposition towards the vanquished rebels  for mercy is surely no attribute of the Japonese  considered as a people  Indeed  nothing could form a more striking contrast     60 than appeared in the transactions in the northern and southern parts of the empire at this juncture  While the amiable Quamba cun dono was employed in the godlike office of gathering together  and cherishing under his wings the poor  dispersed  forlorn  widows and orphans  whom the savage hand of war had deprived of parent  husband  home  and sustenance  while he  in the North  gathered these miserable creatures  even as a hen gathereth her chickens  Sti phi rum poo  and other judges in the South  were condemning such of their parents and husbands as survived the sword  to crucifixion  cauldrons of boiling oil  or exenteration  and the people were indulging their appetites by feasting upon the viscera thus extracted  The liver
