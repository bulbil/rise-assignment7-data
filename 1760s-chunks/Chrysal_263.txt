attack   upon the principal redoubt that defended the fortress  and gave   the command of it to him  The plan laid down by the general   was  that an officer  with a party of men  should go from another   post  just before the dawn  to reconnoitre the redoubt  and if he   found that the fii e of the night had made the impression expected    a signal was to be given for this officer to advance and make the         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 305     attack  The other accordingly marched  but missed his way  and   falling in with a lesser redoubt  mistook it for the object of his   designation  and inconsiderately attacked it  upon which the signal   was given for this officer to proceed  The alarm had set the soldiers   in the principal redoubt upon their guard  which he perceived before   he came within their shot  and being sensible that his attempt could   succeed only by surprise  by one of those instantaneous efforts of   genius which mark the true military character  he resolved  without   a moment s hesitation that might discover his disappointment  to   try a stratagem of his own  since that of his general had been frus    trated by this mistake  and directed his march regularly towards   the attack that was begun upon the lesser redoubt  as if he had   been sent on purpose to support it      Deceived by this feint  the officer who commanded in the principal   redoubt  knowing the force there to be too weak to make resistance    sent the greater part of his own to their relief  This was what he   had foreseen  He therefore continued his march slowly  till they   had got beyond him  and then  facing suddenly about  pushed with   all speed for the redoubt they had just abandoned  The moment   they saw this motion  they turned back  but the narrowness of the   entrenchment in which they were prevented their making such   expedition  and coming up in a body  as his men did on the plain    so that he entered with the very foremost man of them  and made   himself master of the place with inconsiderable loss      The importance of this redoubt  the taking of which greatly   facilitated the operations of the siege  enhanced the merit of the   action  Nothing else was talked of in the army  where the fortune   of this officer was looked upon to be made  But no opportunity   offered for promoting him during the remainder of the expedition    so that the only reward in the general s power to give him  was   thanking him publicly at the head of the army  which he did in the   strongest terms  Resolved  however  to be the instrument of his   promotion  though he could not promote him himself  he represented   him  on his return  in so advantageous a light to one  whose inclina    tion it was known to be  and who  from his office  should have had   it in his power to reward merit  that he promised to do him justice      But the delicacy of this officer s sense of honour defeated these   generous intentions  He would not accept of the preferment   offered him  without having  at the same time  reparation for the   injustice he had suffered  by an honorary rank  superior to those   who had been put over him   and  when this was refused  for reason   of convenience  insisted on quitting the service  in the permission   for which his patron did justice to his character in the most authentic   manner  before he himself resigned an office  which he would hold   no longer than it was in his power to fulfil the declaration he had   made on accepting it â€”   that while he should be in that office  he   would not only be a vigilant servant of the Crown  but also a faithful   trustee for the honest claim of the brave and deserving officer        1 Charles Townshend  then a member of the government   went into   opposition for a short space  and afterwards succeeded Fox as Paymaster   of the Forces          306 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XLVII     CHEYSAi ACCOUNTS CUEIOTJSLY FOE SOME INTEEESTINO POINTS OF   POLICY â€” HE StJPPOETS HIS EEASON FOR NOT ENTEEINO INTO THE   PAETICITLAES OF THE SIEGE  BY SOME Elr  MAB  Tra ON WAE  MOEE   JUST  PERHAPS  THAN POPULAR  AND ASSIGNS A MOTIVE FOB   COURAGE NOT LIKELY TO BE MEANT BY THOSE WHO GIVE IT     I HAVE been so particular in the story of this officer  in order to   give
