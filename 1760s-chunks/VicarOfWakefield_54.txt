mock our foresight  If example be necessary to prove this  I ll give you a story  my child  told us by a grave  tho  sometimes a romancing  historian    Matilda was married very young to a Neapolitan nobleman of the first quality  and found herself a widow and a mother at the age of fifteen  As she stood one day caressing her infant son in the open window of an apartment  which hung over the river Volturna  the child  with a sudden spring  leaped from her arms into the flood below  and disappeared in a moment  The mother  struck with instant surprize  and making an effort to save him  plunged in after  but  far  Page  68  from being able to assist the infant  she herself with great difficulty escaped to the opposite shore  just when some French soldiers were plundering the country on that side  who immediately made her their prisoner      As the war was then carried on between the French and Italians with the utmost inhumanity  they were going at once to perpetrate those two extremes  suggested by appetite and cruelty  This base resolution  however  was opposed by a young officer  who  tho  their retreat required the utmost expedition  placed her behind him  and brought her in safety to his native city  Her beauty at first caught his eye  her merit soon after his heart  They were married  he rose to the highest posts  they lived long together  and were happy  But the felicity of a soldier can never be called permanent  after an interval of several years   Page  69  the troops which he commanded having met with a repulse  he was obliged to take shelter in the city where he had lived with his wife  Here they suffered a siege  and the city at length was taken  Few histories can produce more various instances of cruelty  than those which the French and Italians at that time exercised upon each other  It was resolved by the victors  upon this occasion  to put all the French prisoners to death  but particularly the husband of the unfortunate Matilda  as he was principally instrumental in protracting the siege  Their determinations were  in general  executed almost as soon as resolved upon  The captive soldier was led forth  and the executioner  with his sword  stood ready  while the spectators in gloomy silence awaited the fatal blow  which was only suspended till the general  who presided as judge  should give the signal  It was in this interval of anguish and exall  Page  70  pectation  that Matilda came to take her last farewell of her husband and deliverer  deploring her wretched situation  and the cruelty of fate  that had saved her from perishing by a premature death in the river Volturna  to be the spectator of still greater calamities  The general  who was a young man  was struck with surprize at her beauty  and pity at her distress  but with still stronger emotions when he heard her mention her former dangers  He was her son  the infant for whom she had encounter d so much danger  He acknowledged her at once as his mother  and fell at her feet  The rest may be easily supposed  the captive was set free  and all the happiness that love  friendship  and duty could confer on each  were united      In this manner I would attempt to amuse my daughter  but she listened with divided attention  for her own misfortunes engrossed  Page  71  the pity she once had for those of another  and nothing gave her ease  In company she dreaded contempt  and in solitude she only found anxiety  Such was the colour of her wretchedness  when we received certain information  that Mr  Thornhill was going to be married to Miss Wilmot  for whom I always suspected he had a real passion  tho  he took every opportunity before me to express his contempt both of her person and fortune  This news only served to encrease poor Olivia s affliction  such a flagrant breach of fidelity  was more than her courage could support  I was resolved  however  to get more certain information  and to defeat  if possible  the completion of his designs  by sending my son to old Mr  Wilmot s  with instructions to know the truth of the report  and to deliver Miss Wilmot a letter  intimating Mr  Thornhill s conduct in my family  My son went  in pursuance of my directions  and in three days returned  assuring us of the truth of  Page  72  the acount  but that he had found it impossible to deliver the letter  which he was therefore obliged to leave  as Mr  Thornhill and Miss Wilmot were visiting round the country  They were to be married  he said  in a few days  having appeared together at church the Sunday before he was there  in great splendour  the bride attended by six young ladies drest in white  and he by as many gentlemen  Their approaching nuptials filled the whole country with rejoicing  and they usually rode out together in the grandest equipage that had been seen in the country for many years
