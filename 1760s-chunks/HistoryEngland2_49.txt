such large interest yearly  Sir Robert Walpole conceived a design of lessening these national debts  by giving the several companies an alternative  either of accepting a lower interest  namely  five per cent  for their money  or of being paid the principal  The different companies chose rather to accept of the diminished interest than their capital  and the South Sea company accordingly having made up their debt to the government ten millions  instead of six hundred thousand pounds which they usually received   131 as interest  were satisfied with five hundred thousand  In the same manner the governors and company of the Bank  and other companies  were contented to receive a diminished annuity for their several loans  all which greatly lessened the debts of the nation  It was in this situation of things that Sir John Blount  who had been bred a scrivener  and was possessed of all the cunning and plausibility requisite for such an undertaking  proposed to the ministry  in the name of the South Sea company  to lessen the national debt still further  by permitting the South Sea company to buy up all the debts of the different companies  and thus to become the principal creditor of the state  The terms offered the government were extremely advantageous  The South Sea company was to redeem the debts of the nation out of the hands of the private proprietors  who were creditors to the government  upon whatever terms they could agree on  and  for the interest of this money  which they had thus redeemed  and taken into their own hands  they should be allowed for six years five per cent  and then the interest should be reduced to four per cent  and be redeemable by parliament  For these purposes a bill passed both houses  and as the directors of the South Sea company could not of themselves alone be supposed to be possessed of money sufficient to buy up these debts of the government  they were impowered to raise it by opening a subscription  and granting annuities to such proprietors as should think proper to exchange their creditors  namely  the Crown for the South Sea company  with the advantages that might be made by their industry  The superior advantages with which the proprietors were flattered  by thus exchanging their property in the funds for South Sea stock were a chimerical prospect of having their money urned to great advantage  by a commerce to the outhern parts of America  where it was reported    132 that the English were to have some new settlements granted them by the King of Spain  The directors books therefore were no sooner opened for the first subscription  but crowds came to make the exchange  the delusion spread  subscriptions in a few days sold for double the price they had been bought for  The scheme succeeded  and the whole nation was infected with a spirit of avaricious enterprize  The infatuation prevailed  the stock increased to a surprising degree  but after a few months  the people awaked from their delirium  they sound that all the advantages to be expected were merely imaginary  and an infinite number of families were involved in ruin  Many of the directors whose arts had raised these vain expectations  had amassed surprising fortunes  it was  however  one consolation to the nation  to find the parliament stripping them of their ill acquired wealth  and orders were given to remove all directors of the South Sea company from their seats in the house of commons  or the places they possessed under the government  The delinquents being punished by a forfeiture of their estates  the parliament next converted its atention toward redressing the sufferers  Several useful and just resolutions were taken  and a bill was speedily prepared towards repairing the mischiefs  Of the profits arising from the South Sea scheme  the sum of seven millions was granted to the ancient proprietors  several additions also were made to their dividends out of what was possessed by the company in their own right  the remaining capital stock also was divided among all the proprietors at the rate of thirty three pounds per cent  In the mean time petitions from all parts of the kingdom were presented to the house  demanding justice  and the whole nation seemed exasperated to the highest degree  During these transactions  the King  with serenity and wisdom presided at the helm  influenced his parliament to pursue equitable   133 measures  and  by his councils  endeavoured to restore the credit of the nation   The discontents occasioned by these public calamities  once more gave the disaffected party hopes of rising  But  in all their councils they were weak  divided  and wavering  Their present designs therefore could not escape the vigilance of the King  who had emissaries in every court  and who had made  by his alliances  every potentate a friend to his cause  He was therefore informed  by the Duke of Orleans  Regent of France  of a new conspiracy raised against him by several persons of distinction  which postponed his intended journey to Hanover  Among those against whom the most positive evidence was obtained  was Mr  Christopher Layer  a young gentleman of the Middle Temple  He was convicted of having inlisted men for the pretender s service  and received sentence of death  which he underwent  after having been often examined  and having strenuously refused  to the
