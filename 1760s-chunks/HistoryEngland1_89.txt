such severe oppressions   But all the Protector s promises and endeavours could not effectually redress their grievances  he therefore was obliged to have recourse to violence  These were not the compact bodies of men that we have seen in former rebellions  headed by some discontented or ambitious courtier  and led on with conduct and success  Henry VII  had effectually suppressed all such  these were now only a tumultuous rabble  without arms and without discipline  led on by some obscure desperado  unreasonable in their demands  and divided among each other  the unhappy wretches were therefore easily overthrown  Above a thousand of them   261 were slain near Exeter by Lord Russel  and two thousand more near Norwich by the Earl of Warwick   The kingdom was now again inclining to an aristocracy  the nobility  by the late increase of their possessions  were grown powerful  and oppressed the people at pleasure  They now began to find that they had a separate interest from that of the commons  and conspired to carry on their power by union among themselves  while the rest of the kingdom was divided  The Duke of Somerset  however  opposed this project  as he was ever a favourer of the people  and it was incumbent therefore to destroy his power before they could establish their own  With this view they placed the Earl of Warwick  afterwards made Duke of Northumberland  at their head  and began by spreading reports to destroy the Protector s reputation  they next won over the common council of London to favour their projects  and lastly had him accused of high treason  The interest of the Protector was overpowered by that of his rival  he was condemned  and lost his head upon Tower hill   In all this struggle for power  the young King  by reason of his age  was barely passive  he was only made the executor of the resentment and ambition of the contending ministers  as either happened to prevail  and at one time signed the order for execution on this side  at another time on that  but ever with tears in his eyes  a tenderness of disposition was one of this amiable youth s conspicuous qualities  to these were added a sagacity far surpassing his years and learning  that amazed all such as happened to converse with him  When the dignity of the throne was to be supported  he   262 behaved like a man  and  at other times  was gentle and affable as became his age  In short  he had such great qualities  or was said to have such  that mankind had reason to lament his short continuance among them  It is very probable  however  that flattery would have contributed to destroy those talents  as it had those of his father  for few Princes  except his father  had received more flattery than he  He died of a defluxion upon his lungs  his death being hastened by medicines given by a woman who confidently pretended she could cure him  His death made way for another scene of horrid barbarity  in which the kingdom was to be ruled by a weak and bigotted woman  who was herself ruled by merciless priests  who received their orders from the court of Rome   I am   c   LETTER XXXIII   YOU have hitherto seen the succession to the throne of England  partly obtained by lineal descent  and partly by the aptitude for government in the person chosen  neither wholly hereditary  nor quite elective  it has ever made ancestry the pretext of right  but  in fact  the people sued for the support of these pretensions  And this is the best species of succession that can be conceived  it prevents that aristocracy  which is ever the result of a government entirely elective  and that tyranny which is too often established where there is never an infringement upon hereditary claims   Whenever a Monarch of England happened to be arbitrary  he generally considered the kingdom as his property  and not himself as a servant of   263 the kingdom  In such cases it was natural for him  at his decease  to bequeath his dominions as he thought proper  Henry  in conformity to this practice  made a will  in which he settled the succession merely according to his usual caprice  Edward VI  was first nominated to succeed him  whose reign you have just seen  then Mary  his eldest daughter by Catharine of Spain  but with a mark of special condescension  by which he would intimate her illegitimacy  the next that followed was Elizabeth  his daughter by Anna Bullen  with the same marks of her not being legitimate  after his own children his sister s children were mentioned  his younger sister the Duchess of Suffolk s issue were preferred before his elder sister the Queen of Scotland s  which preference was thought by all to be neither founded in justice nor supported by reason   Edward VI  as has been seen  succeeded him  He also made a will  in which he gave the kingdom away from Mary and Elizabeth to the Duchess of Suffolk s daughter  the lady Jane Grey  a girl of sixteen  By these dispositions there were  after the death of young Edward  no less than four Princesses who could lay claim to the crown  Mary
