Life  but a true Taste for every Thing in it  which is worth living for  And  as you have given me Happiness  I look upon it  on some Occasions  as an ungenerous Act  to interrupt  or endeavour to destroy that Bliss   till I consider you in   249 the Light of a Woman who has brought a great Fortune to a Beggar  and has consequently a natural Right to squander what Part she pleases  From you  my charming Muse  I have learned particularly three Things  more valuable than all the Science of the Sorbonne — Chearfulness  without Mirth  Gravity  without Spleen  and  oh  take it for your Pains  Love  with Esteem  the warmest Love  with the highest Esteem   Farewel  Farewel indeed  I shall conclude your s in Haste — to fly to you   Henry   LETTER CXXIX  HENRY to FRANCES   I Have spent my Time very ill since I saw you  I have been reading a Collection of Letters from Swift  Pope  Gay  Bolingbroke   c  which have spoiled my Relish for Writing  by giving me too good a Taste for it  However  this Humility of mine cannot defend me from being a punctual Correspondent  since I have had the Assurance to answer your Letters constantly  and  as Hudibras says    What is Worth in any Thing   But so much Money as  twill bring   I may presume that my Letters are of inestimable Value  while they purchase your s     I am now more entertained with the private Letters of eminent Men  than I am with their   250 more public Writings  because  in the former Case  I fancy I am conversing with them  but in the latter  I only hear of them  for which Reason too  I am fonder of Biography than of History   I must tell you a Circumstance of my Weakness  that I dropt a Tear  upon reading the Account of Gay s Death  in these Letters  tho  I knew he had been dead above twenty Years   LETTER CXXX   My dear FANNY   THE Irksomeness of our Separation needs not the Addition of your Repinings  It is said  that all Unhappiness is lessened by Participation  but your Complaints double mine  My Philosophy is prepared for any Misfortune  which falls on me alone  but I feel its natural Weight ten fold  when rebounded from you   Your Apprehension that Absence may  in Time  create Indifference  may be true of human Nature in general  but I think my Mind is particularly framed  for all the Effect I am sensible of  is  what Slaves feel  when they attempt to part  — For Distance in Love but stretches the Chain  to make me perceive the Alliance more strongly   You can be in no Danger from my Inconstancy  if what a French Wit has said be true  that   Absence to Lovers  like Wind to the Fire  extinguishes a small Flame  but increases a great one       251However  to shew you I do not mean  as Shakespear has beautifully expressed it    to patch up Grief with Proverbs   I shall be in Town on the 12th of next Month  and believe me  that nothing but the Exigency of my Affairs prevents me that Pleasure sooner     Henry   LETTER CXXXI   My dear HARRY   I Reached this Place without stopping  which is above Half my Journey   After Dinner I finished Montaigne s long Essay on Raymond de Sebonde  or rather intitled  his Apology for Raymond de Sebonde  for a very little Portion of it relates to that Author  As you design soon to read it  I shall give you some Criticisms by the Way  which  as they can be no Way necessary for you  I do  only to shew you  that I read not for my own Improvement alone  but for your Amusement   About the Beginning of the Essay he says  speaking of the new Doctrines of Luther  that  by staggering our Belief  they were likely to run us into Atheism  See the whole Passage at large  Now this Argument is bad  by proving too much  for it is equally strong to support all Religions  nay  the Errors too of all Religion  But the Christian Religion is the only true one  —Shall we not prune away the Errors and Mistakes  which the Frailty of Man has ingrafted   252 on it  for Fear of hurting the Root  Must Truth then avail itself of Falshood  and must the Imperfections of Man be sanctified by the Perfection of God  Let a Man be first convinced of the Truth and Reason of any Doctrine  and then let him boldly speak out  even in Religion itself  nay  more freely there  for Truth cannot contradict Truth  and Religion is our greatest Concern here  as it must necessarily be our greatest Concern hereafter  The Christian Religion is indeed founded  and very properly so  upon Faith  and the strongest Reasons  next to Demonstration  for the Belief  But all its Doctrines are  and ought to be  founded
