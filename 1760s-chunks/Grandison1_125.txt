shall be deserved to be said of your Harriet   Then again rises to your pen  smothering and escaped sparks  and I am desired to hurry myself to get cold water to quench the flame—Dear  dear madam  what images are here  And applied—To whom —And by whom —Have I written any thing so very blazing —Surely I have not  But you should not say you will all forgive me  if this be my sad situation  You should not say  How much you are yourselves  all of you  in love with this excellent man  and talk of Mr  Dawson  and of what he says of him  But you should have told me  that if I suffer my gratitude to grow into Love  you will never forgive me  then should I have had a call of duty to check or controul a passion  that you were afraid could not be gratified   Well  and there is no way left me  it seems  but to fly for it  To hurry away to Northamptonshire  and either to begin a new treaty with Lord D  or to give hope to an old Lover  Poor Harriet Byron  And is it indeed so bad with thee  And does thy aunt Selby think it is     308 But is there no hope  that the man will take pity of thee  When he sees thee so sadly entangled  will he not vouchsafe to lend an extricating hand   Oh  no —Too much obliged  as thou already art  how canst thou expect to be further obliged  Obliged in the highest degree   But let me try if I cannot play round this bright  this beamy taper  without singeing my wings  I fancy it is not yet quite so bad with me  At least  let me stand this one visit of to morrow  And then if I find reason to think I cannot stand it  I may take the kind advice  and fly for it  rather than add another hopeless girl to the half score that perhaps have been long sighing for this best of men   But even then  my aunt  that is to say  were I to fly and take shelter under your protecting wings  I shall not  I hope  think it absolutely necessary  to light up one flame  in order to extinguish another  I shall always value Mr  Orme as a friend  but indeed I am less than ever inclined to think of him in a nearer light   As to Lady D s proposal  it admits not with me of half a thought  You know  my dearest aunt  that I am not yet rejected by one with whom you are all in love—But this seriously I will own  and yet I hope nothing but my gratitude is engaged  and that indeed is a very powerful tie  that since I have seen and known Sir Charles Grandison  I have not only  as before  an indifference  but a dislike  to all other men  And I think  if I know my own heart  I had rather converse but an hour in a week with him  and with Miss Grandison  than be the wife of any man I have ever seen or known   If this should end at last in Love  and if I should be entangled in an hopeless passion  the object of it would be Sir Charles Grandison  He could not insult me  and  mean as the word pity in some cases founds  I had rather have his pity  than the love of any other man     309 You will  upon the strength of what I have said  be so good  dear madam  as to let the Countess of D  know  that I think myself highly obliged to her  for her favourable opinion of me  That she has by it interested all my good wishes in her son s happiness  and that I was always of opinion  that equality of fortune and degree  tho  not absolutely necessary to matrimonial felicity  was however a circumstance not to be slighted  But you  madam  can put my meaning in better  in fitter words  when you are assured  that it is my meaning  to give an absolute  tho  grateful  negative to this proposal  And I do assure you  that such is my meaning  and that I should despise myself  were I capable of keeping one man in suspense  even had I hope of your hope  while I was balancing in favour of another   I believe  madam  I have been a little petulant  and very saucy  in what I have written  But my heart is not at ease  And I am vexed with these men  one after another  when Sir Hargrave has given me a surfeit of them  and only that the bad has brought me into the knowledge of the best  or I could resolve never more to hear a man talk to me  no not for one moment  upon a subject  that is become so justly painful to one who never took pleasure in their any adulation   I know you will  with your usual goodness  and so will my grandmamma  and so will my uncle Selby  pardon all the imperfections of
