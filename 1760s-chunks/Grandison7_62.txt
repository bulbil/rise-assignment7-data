intimation of the likelihood of their arrival at a particular port  and was actually set out with coaches  in hopes of accommodating them  when they did arrive  and to bring them to the house which had been  as she knew before  got ready for their reception   She looked by turns on me  and on Lady L  in speechless terror  At last  Then I am sure  said she  you know they are come  Tell me  tell me  are they indeed arrived  And are they all well   I owned they were  and at Dover  and waited there to refresh themselves  and to be informed of her health and safety before they would proceed further   She wept  even to sobbing  inveighed against herself  Her tears were tears of duty and tenderness  She comforted herself  that Sir Charles would be able to soften their resentments against her  and she was sure he would make the best conditions for her  that could be obtained   Lord L  is all goodness  all compassion  to her  He greatly admires her  But we observe  that there are some little traces of wildness now and then in her talk  which carries her into high language and exclamation  May her mind be quieted  May her intellects be preserved entire  in the affecting scenes before her —I am sent for home in haste   Tuesday night   METHINKS I am half afraid of telling even you  my grandmamma  at this distance  to whom I was sent for  It was to the Count of Belvedere  Signor Sebastiano was with him  Lord G  happened to call in at St  James s Square  when they arrived  and sending for me  entertained them till I came   I asked Lord G  half out of breath with fear  at   158 my first alighting  If he had said any thing of the Lady  Not a syllable  said he  I avoided answering questions  The gentlemen were full of impatience to know something about her  And this made me send for you  For  tho  cautioned  I was afraid of blundering —Honest  modest  worthy Lord G —I prevailed on them to stay supper with me  Lord G  was so obliging  as to send home to excuse himself to his Lady  at my request   They are both fine young gentlemen  extremely polite  We have been told  that the Count is a handsome man  Indeed he is  Any Lady  with such a character as he has  if she were not prepossessed  might like him  He is certainly a gentle dispositioned and good natured man  He looks the man of quality  He seems not to be above five or six and twenty  Has a foreign aspect  and a complexion a sallowish brown  yet has a healthy look  His eyes  however  as I knew his case  appeared to me to have a cast like those of a man whose mind is disturbed   I behaved to them with the greatest frankness I could shew  I told them  that Sir Charles set out in the morning  on the receipt of a letter from Dover  for that port  and with what equis  They gave but a poor account of the health of the Marchioness  But if she could but hear good tidings  he said  and stopt—  Sir Charles  I answered  would do his utmost to set their hearts at ease   May I not ask a question  madam  said the Count  I find your Ladyship knows every thing of us  and our affairs  We heard in Italy  that you were all goodness  and find you to be an angel  I make no compliment  said he  laying his spread hand on his heart   Lord G  with kind officiousness  said  that was the universal voice     159 I answered in French  the language in which he spoke to me—That I had the pleasure of informing him  that Letters had passed between Lady Clementina and Sir Charles  The account she gives of herself  said I  makes us not quite unhappy   Makes Us  said the Count to Signor Sebastiano  in Italian  his hands lifted up  Heavenly goodness   I imagined that he thought I understood not that tongue  and that I might not mislead them into undue compliments  I said  in my broken accented Italian  We all here  Signors  are as much interested in the health and happiness of Lady Clementina  as any of her friends in Italy can be   They applauded all of us  who were  as they said  so generously interested in the happiness of one of the most excellent of women   I told the Count  that Sir Charles had  as desired  provided lodgings for him  I hoped he would find them convenient  tho  Sir Charles thought them not befitting his quality  He said  before he set out this morning  hearing that their Lordships were then probably on their journey from Dover to London  ordered his gentleman to attend him to them  You  Signor  said I  are  if you please  with Signor Juliano  to be Sir Charles s
