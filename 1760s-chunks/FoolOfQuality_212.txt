otherwise Barnabas  continued to linger for about a fort    night longer  and then departed quite happy  and without a groan    During the same space  also  James W 7 as daily attended by my   own physician  and was nearly re established in his health      Being then intent on my departure  I sent for Mrs  Tirrell    Mrs  Tirrell  says I  I should be much inclined to take your James   along with me  if I did not think you would grieve overmuch in   his absence  No  no  sir  said she  I would to heaven I were   myself a young man for your sake  I desire no better either of   him or for him  than that he should live and die faithfully and   lovingly in your service      When Mr  Clinton came to this part of his story  a messenger   entered in fearful haste  and delivered a letter to Lady Maitland    As soon as she had run it over My dearest sir  she cried  I must   leave you this instant  I lately made you an offer of a hundred   thousand pounds   and now I know not that I have so many   shillings upon earth  I am here informed that the trustee of all   my affairs has absconded  and made his escape to France   but I   must hurry to town  and inquire after this business  So saying    she curtsied and suddenly withdrew  without giving her cousin   time to make a tender of his services      The next morning Mr  Ch nton ordered his chariot to the door    and hastened to attend her ladyship at her house in London  but   there he was told that she had set out for Dover about an hour         218 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      before   and he returned much dejected and grieved on her   account      In about three weeks after  Mr  Clement with his young pupil   came home  quite lightened of the money they had  ken abroad    Mr  Fenton  for so we shall call him again  gave Clement a friendly   embrace  and took Harry to his caresses  as though he had re    turned from a long and dangerous voyage      Well  Clement  said Mr  Fenton  what account have you to give   us of your expedition  An account  sir  that would be extremely   displeasing to any man living except yourself  in short  our young   gentleman here  has plunged you above a thousand pounds in debt    over the large sums that we carried with us  I hope the objects   were worthy  said Mr  Fenton  Wonderfully worthy  indeed  sir     I never saw such tender and affecting scenes  Then I shall be   overpaid and enriched by the narration      Here  Harry inquired impatiently for Mrs  Clement and his friend   Ned   and being told that they were on a visit to the Widow   Neighbourly  he took a hasty leave for the present  and away   he flew to embrace them      As soon as he was gone Sir  said Mr  Clement  I cannot think   that there is in the world such another boy as yours  I will leave   to himself the detail of our adventures hi the several prisons   they   had such an effect on his heart  that they cannot but have made a   deep impression on his memory   so I shall only tell you of what   happened in our way to London      As we were chatting and walking leisurely along the road  a poor   man before us happened to drop in a fit of the falling sickness    When Harry saw the writhings and convulsions in which he lay  he   turned pale  and looked vastly frightened  and seizing me under the   arm  he cried Come come away   and hurried me off as fast as he   could  But we had not gone far till his pace began to abate  and   stopping  and hesitating Let us turn  let us turn  Mr  Clement  he   cried   let us go back again and help the poor man   We then   returned hastily  and  raising his head  we kept him from bruising   it against the ground  I then forced open his clenched hands  and   having chafed the palms awhile  he began to recover  and soon came   to himself  Mean while Harry s fright was not yet quite over  He   seemed willing to get away from the object of his terror  and   putting his hand in his pocket  and giving him all the silver he had    he wished
