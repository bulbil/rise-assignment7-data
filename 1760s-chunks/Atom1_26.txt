spectator in favour of his morals  Had an accurate observer beheld him without any exterior distinctions  in the streets of this metropolis  he would have naturally clapped his hands to his pockets  Thou hast seen the character of Gibbet represented on the stage by a late comedian of expressive feature  Nature sometimes makes a strange contrast between the interior workmanship and the exterior form  but here the one reflected a true image of the other  His heart never felt an impression of tenderness  his notions of right and wrong did not refer to any idea of benevolence  but were founded entirely on the convenience of human commerce  and there was nothing social in the turn of his disposition  By nature he was stern  insolent  and rapacious  uninfluenced by any motive of humanity  unawed by any precept of    142 religion  With respect to religion  he took all opportunities of exposing it to ridicule and contempt  Liberty of conscience he allowed to such extent  as exceeded the bounds of decorum and disgraced all legislation  He pardoned a criminal convicted of bestiality  and publickly declared that all modes of religion  and every species of amour  might be freely practised and prosecuted through all his dominions  His capacity was of the middling mould  and he had taken some pains to cultivate his understanding  He had studied the Chinese language  which he spoke with fluency  and piqued himself upon his learning  which was but superficial  His temper was so capricious and inconstant  that it was impossible even for those who knew him best  to foresee any one particular of his personal demeanour  The same individual he would caress and insult by turns  without the least apparent change of    143 circumstance  He has been known to dismiss one of his favourites with particular marks of regard  and the most flattering professions of affection  and before he had time to pull off his buskins at his own house  he has been hurried on horseback by a detachment of cavalry  and conveyed to the frontiers  Thus harrassed  without refreshment or repose  he was brought back by another party  and reconveyed to the presence of Brut an tiffi  who embraced him at meeting  and gently chid him for having been so long absent —The fixed principles of this Tartar were these  insatiable rapacity  restless ambition  and an insuperable contempt for the Japonese nation  His maxims of government were entirely despotic  He considered his subjects as slaves  to be occasionally sacrificed to the accomplishment of his capital designs  but  in the mean time  he indulged them with the protection    142 of equitable laws  and encouraged them to industry for his own emolument   His virtues consisted of temperance  vigilance  activity  and perseverance  His folly chiefly appeared in childish vanity and self conceit  He amused himself with riding  reviewing his troops  reading Chinese authors  playing on a musical instrument in use among the Tartars  trifling with buffoons  conversing with supposed wits  and reasoning with pretended philosophers  but he had no communication with the female sex  nor  indeed  was there any ease  comfort  or enjoyment to be derived from a participation of his pastime  His wits  philosophers  and buffoons  were composed of Chinese refugees  who soon discovered his weak side  and flattered his vanity to an incredible pitch of infatuation  They persuaded him that he was an universal genius  an invincible    145 hero  a sage legislator  a sublime philosopher  a consummate politician  a divine poet  and an elegant historian  They wrote systems  compiled memoirs  and composed poems  which were published in his name  nay  they contrived witticisms  which he uttered as his own —They had  by means of commercial communication with the banks of the Ganges  procured the history of a Western hero  called Raskalander  which  indeed  was no other than the Memoirs of Alexander wrote by Quintus Curtius  translated from the Indian language  with an intermixture of Oriental fables  This they recommended with many hyperbolical encomiums to the perusal of Brut an tiffi  who became enamoured of the performance  and was fired with the ambition of rivalling  if not excelling Raskalander  not only as a warrior  but likewise as a patron of taste and    146 a protector of the liberal arts  As Alexander deposited Homer s Iliad in a precious casket  so Brut an tiffi procured a golden box for preserving this sophistication of Quintus Curtius  It was his constant companion  he affected to read it in public  and to lay it under his pillow at night   Thus pampered with adulation and intoxicated with dreams of conquest  he made no doubt of being able to establish a new empire in Tartary  which should entirely eclipse the kingdom of Tum ming qua  and raise a reputation that should infinitely transcend the fame of Yan  or any emperor that ever sat upon the throne of Thibet  He now took the field against the Amazon of the house of Ostrog  penetrated into her dominions  defeated one of her generals in a pitched battle  and undertook the siege of one of her principal    147 cities  in full confidence of seeing her kneeling at his gate before the end of the campaign  In the mean time  her scattered troops
