 she took care to avail herself of his absence  for being now her own mistress  she admitted the visits of a croud of young fellows  and led a life of uninterrupted pleasures till his return  which she esteemed one of the most unfortunate accidents   85 that could befal her  though she was as successful in counterfeiting joy upon seeing him again  as she had been in affecting grief at being separated from him   She lived with him till the time of his death  which happened about two years after  when she was again obliged to look out for a new keeper   The life of a kept mistress is constantly ebbing and flowing  subject to perpetual vicissitudes  and so many scenes of complicated woe  that were is not for that infallible remedy the bottle  so many could not be deluded by fantastic prospects  and airy expectations  into an abyss of misery and despair  But to leave moralizing  and return to the story   As our heroine was very fortunate  she was taken into keeping by Mr  G—  a gamester  who took a genteel lodging near Leicester fields  where they lived in a very elegant manner  She lived with Mr  G— very agreeable for some months  assured that her lover was a man of fortune   87 as they lived in a splendor that could not be supported at a small expence  But Mr  G— suddenly disappeared  and poor Miss ELLIOT was arrested by the landlady for board and lodging  and conveyed to the Fleet  the too frequent residence of whores and authors   The confined life of a jail appeared very tedious and insipid to a woman of our heroine s sprightly disposition  but she had not languished a considerable time  till good fortune sent her a companion capable of alleviating the uneasiness of her situation   A gentleman was brought to prison  who  though too far advanced in years to be amiable  had a very genteel person  and there was something extremely engaing and agreeable in his conversation  It was very lucky that she met with this new acquaintance  but her happiness received a considerable addition  when a servant in livery one morning brought him a letter  by which he received intelligence  that a friend of his had advanced the sum in question  and that he should be set at liberty that very day  Mr  F— was   86 overjoyed at the news  and Miss ELLIOT had no less reason to be so  as he had proposed to take her home as soon as he was released   She regained her liberty the same day as Mr  F—  with whom she lived in great tranquillity  esteeming this the happiest part of her life  for though the sensual enjoyments were not so strong in her lover  she was free from those inquietudes that ever attend the strong passion of jealousy  with which the minds of some of her keepers had been infested   In about four years Mr  F— died  having settled an unnuity of forty pounds per annum on his dear Nancy  With this income she proposed settling in some way of business  which the bounty of her keeper had enabled her to do  Her intention  however  was soon diverted from this resolution  by a new acquaintance which she made a short time after  and which intercourse paved the way to a state  to which her most exalted expectations could never have aspired     88Being once more to be disposed of in the auction of love  and as her annuity made her able to preserve her consequence  none dared to approach the spot  where she dispensed her charms  but those who were amply furnished with the all prevailing metal   At this juncture  Sir George B—  returned from his travels  and had not been in town two days before he was stopped  by a livery servant  in Bond street  who told him  that his lady desired to speak with him  His surprise was very great on this occasion  but much greater  when on enquiry he found that she who had sent him that polite message  was no other than the celebrated Miss ELLIOT  whose same had reached his ears  After innumerable protestations of love  he asked her if she was content to live with him as a mistress  and she consenting  filled him with inexpressible joy and delight   She now thought of devoting herself to the person of her lover alone  and he was equally happy and content in the embraces of a woman he esteemed before her   89 whole sex  They lived together about six months in all the endearments of mutual affection  when Sir George was informed  by a letter  of the decease of his brother abroad  and of his having left him sole executor to an estate of immense value  A separation hereby became unavoidably necessary  so that Miss ELLIOT soon parted with the only man she loved  but not without receiving from him manifest tokens of his affection and generosity   There came to England  with Sir George  a young gentleman of fortune  whose name was Ed—ds  very amorous  but very petulant  He had often observed our heroine  on his visits to Sir George  with an eye of desire  and judging his absence a very convenient opportunity for making
