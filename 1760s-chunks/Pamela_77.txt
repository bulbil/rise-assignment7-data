We had a great   many words about it  for I told her  it was very hard I could not be   trusted to walk by myself in the garden for a little air  but must be   dogged and watched worse than a thief       She still pleaded her instructions  and said she was not to trust me   out of her sight  And you had better  said she  be easy and contented  I   assure you  for I have worse orders than you have yet found  I remember    added she  your asking Mr  Williams  If there were any gentry in the   neighbourhood  This makes me suspect you want to get away to them  to   tell your sad dismal story  as you call it       My heart was at my mouth  for I feared  by that hint  she had seen my   letter under the tiles  O how uneasy I was  At last she said  Well    since you take on so  you may take a turn  and I will be with you in a   minute       When I was out of sight of her window  I speeded towards the hopeful   place  but was soon forced to slacken my pace  by her odious voice    Hey day  why so nimble  and whither so fast  said she  What  are you   upon a wager  I stopt for her  till her pursy sides were waddled up to   me  and she held by my arm  half out of breath  So I was forced to pass   by the dear place  without daring to look at it       The gardener was at work a little farther  and so we looked upon him    and I began to talk about his art  but she said  softly  My instructions   are  not to let you be so familiar with the servants  Why  said I  are   you afraid I should confederate with them to commit a robbery upon my   master  May be I am  said the odious wretch  for to rob him of yourself    would be the worst that could happen to him  in his opinion       And pray  said I  walking on  how came I to be his property  What right   has he in me  but such as a thief may plead to stolen goods   Why    was ever the like heard  says she   This is downright rebellion  I   protest   Well  well  lambkin   which the foolish often calls me   if   I was in his place  he should not have his property in you long   questionable  Why  what would you do  said I  if you were he   Not stand   shill I shall I  as he does  but put you and himself both out of your   pain   Why  Jezebel  said I   I could not help it   would you ruin me by   force   Upon this she gave me a deadly slap upon my shoulder  Take that    said she  whom do you call Jezebel       I was so surprised   for you never beat me  my dear father and mother    in your lives   that I was like one thunder struck  and looked round  as   if I wanted somebody to help me  but  alas  I had nobody  and said  at   last  rubbing my shoulder  Is this also in your instructions   Alas  for   me  am I to be beaten too  And so fell a crying  and threw myself upon   the grass walk we were upon   Said she  in a great pet  I won t be   called such names  I ll assure you  Marry come up  I see you have   a spirit  You must and shall be kept under  I ll manage such little   provoking things as you  I warrant ye  Come  come  we ll go in a doors    and I ll lock you up  and you shall have no shoes  nor any thing else    if this be the case       I did not know what to do  This was a cruel thing to me  and I blamed   myself for my free speech  for now I have given her some pretence  and   O  thought I  here I have  by my malapertness  ruined the only project I   had left       The gardener saw this scene  but she called to him  Well  Jacob  what do   you stare at  Pray mind what you re upon  And away he walked  to another   quarter  out of sight       Well  thought I  I must
