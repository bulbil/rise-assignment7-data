am not alarmed at the discovery  you know I am the very reverse  and I hope in time  by gentle methods  in some measure to subdue it in Mr Faulkland  His own good sense and good nature must incline him to wish it corrected  My brother says  he has often lamented this vice of his nature to him  and said he had taken infinite pains to get the better of it  and had so far succeeded  that he seldom was surprized by it  but on very sudden and extraordinary occasions  such as  I suppose  he looked upon this to be  which I have related   We passed the day delightfully at Kensington  and did not return to town till late  I think I have got cold  as we walked a long time in the gardens   July 13  I have got an ugly sore throat  my mother insists on my being let blood  I am afraid of alarming her by complaining  though I had very little rest all night  Mr Faulkland came early this morning to enquire after my health  my mother told him I was not well  How tenderly dejected were his looks  when I came into the room  Sir George made him stay to breakfast  he scarce tasted any thing  he was quite cast down  My brother rallied him  I thought it unreasonable  on the chance he had the day before of losing his wife  Mr Faulkland answered  I wish I had followed the first motion of my thoughts  and discharged that wicked fellow a month ago  Sir George said  as it happened  there had been no harm done  but he thought Mr Faulkland would do well to dismiss such an insolent rogue from his service  He has saved me that trouble  said Mr Faulkland  he has dismissed himself  but took care to first to rob me  To rob you  we all repeated in the same breath  Yes  said Mr Faulkland  I told him  after I got home  that he was to deliver up such things as he had in his charge to my own man  as I meant to discharge him in the morning  He made me no reply  for he was a sullen fellow  but when the family were asleep  he contrived to pick the lock of a bureau in my dressing room  where I sometimes keep money  I believe what induced him to it was  his having seen me yesterday morning  when I was going to ride  a precaution which I generally use   put my pocket book into this place  and I suppose he concluded there were bank notes in it  for he took that  I presume without staying to examine it  and all the money he could find besides  and very cleverly made his escape out of a back window  which was found open this morning   My mother lectured Mr Faulkland a little  for suffering a servant     whose fidelity he was not sure of  to see where he deposited his money  which  she said  might prove a temptation to one  who was not so ill inclined as this man  Mr Faulkland acknowleged it was careless in him  but said  in his justification  he had been accustomed to very honest people about him  which rendered him less suspicious   He appeared so anxious and unhappy about my indisposition  that I affected to make as light of it as possible  though indeed I find myself very much out of order  With what a kind sorrow did he observe my looks  sighs now and then stole from him  as his eyes were fixed on my face  I am obliged to him  yet I think I should be as much concerned for him  if he were ill   Here is a whole cargo of silks and laces just sent in to me—Heigh ho  I can’t look at them—I am not well—and I have such a gantlope to run of visiting and racketting  that the thought makes me sicker   July 27  After a fortnight’s  a dreadful fortnight’s intermission  I reassume my pen  I have often told you  Cecilia  I was not born to be happy  Oh  I prophesied when I said so  though I knew not why I said it   I will try to recollect all the circumstances of this miserable interval  and relate them as well as I can  The last line in my journal  which I have not yet ventured to send you  as your stay at Paris is so uncertain  informs you that I was ill  I was let blood  but my disorder increased  and I was in a high fever before next morning  I remember what my reflections were  and am sure my apprehensions of death were not on my own account afflicting  but grievously so at the thoughts of what those should feel whom I was to leave behind   My mother and Mr Faulkland  I believe  chiefly engaged my mind  but I did not long continue capable of reflection  The violence of my disorder deprived me of my senses on the fourth day  and they tell me I raved of Mr Faulkland  I remember nothing  but that  in my intervals of reason  I always saw my poor mother in tears
