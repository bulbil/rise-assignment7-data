  and honourable regards      I perceive  sir  said Mr  Clement  by your own account  that he   must be a very learned proficient in the study of physiognomy who   can decide  with any kind of certainty  on an art that requires   such attention and penetration      I beg leave to differ  answered Mr  Fenton  The science is much   more obvious than you may imagine   and I fancy there are very   few persons who do not trust  without reflecting  to their own skill   in this way  and who do not inadvertently form a character to them    selves of almost all the people with whom they are conversant      I am persuaded that there is not a single sentiment  whether   tending to good or evil in the human soul  that has not its distinct   and respective interpreter in the glance of the eye  and in the   muscling of the countenance  When nature is permitted to express   herself with freedom by this language of the face  she is understood   by all people  and those who never were taught a letter  can   instantly read her signatures and impressions   whether they be of   wrath  hatred  envy  pride  jealousy  vexation  contempt  pain  fear    horror  and dismay  or of attention  respect  wonder  surprise    pleasure  transport  complacence  affection  desire  peace  lowliness    and love      Now  all persons are born with propensities  whether they be   mental or constitutional  to some passions and affections  rather than   to others  I will take two instances   the one of a male infant  who   is born with a propensity to pride and arrogance   the other of a   female infant  who is born with a propensity to bashfulness and   lowliness  In either case  it is evident that  from the first occasion   that may serve to excite these several affections in these several   infants  the sentiments of their souls will be suitably and intelligibly   expressed in their aspects   and every further occasion of renewing         130 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      the same impressions will render them more obvious and legible to   every eye  Insomuch that  if no future influence  arising from   accident or education  shall check the pride of the one  or divert   the lowliness of the other  the male will be seen to look on those   about him with an habitual self sufficiency and contempt of his   species   and the female will be seen to regard human kind with   an amiable diffidence and a complacent respect      Let us see  however  how far education may be able to change   these sentiments   and how far a change of sentiments may pro    duce a change of face      If the scorner should be so happy as to meet with worthy tutors    wise and diligent to inculcate the insufficiency of all creatures  and   more particularly the wants  weaknesses  and vileness of pur lapsed   natures  and that no honour can belong to man in this state of   depravity   but  above all  should this scorner prove so happy as to   be educated in the never failing school of Christian meekness even   the school of adversity  of pain  sickness  depressing poverty and   mortification his lofty crest by degrees will be effectually un    plumed  his sufficiency and high mindedness will sink to an humble   prayer and look out for relief  and he will respect even the   wretched  because he will acquire a social sense and fellow feeling   of their wretchedness      Here then is another man  as new made and as different from   his former self as he can possibly be supposed from any other of the   human species  But will this total change of sentiment produce no   change of aspect  think ye   Will this benevolent and lowly man   retain the same front of haughtiness  the same brow of over    bearance  the same eye of elevation  the same lip of ridicule  and   the same glance of contempt  It cannot be said  it cannot be   imagined      When God  by his inspired penmen  expresses his detestation of   a lofty look  was he quarrelling  do you think  with the natural and   unavoidable cast of an unhappy countenance  No  no  my dear   friends  In condemning a proud aspect  he condemned a proud   heart   forasmuch as he knew that a loftiness of look and a sauci    ness of soul could not be divided      But to clear up this question from any remaining doubt  let us
