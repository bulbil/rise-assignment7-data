letters to my master  He employed me for   that purpose  and he saw every one  before I carried them to your father   and mother  and then scaled them up  and sent me with them  I had some   business that way  but not half so often as I pretended  and as soon   as I heard how it was  I was ready to hang myself  You may well think I   could not stand in your presence  O vile  vile wretch  to bring you to   this  If you are ruined  I am the rogue that caused it  All the justice   I can do you  is to tell you  you are in vile hands  and I am afraid   will be undone in spite of all your sweet innocence  and I believe   I shall never live  after I know it  If you can forgive me  you are   exceeding good  but I shall never forgive myself  that s certain    Howsomever  it will do you no good to make this known  and may hap I   may live to do you service  If I can  I will  I am sure I ought   Master   kept your last two or three letters  and did not send them at all  I am   the most abandoned wretch of wretches   J  ARNOLD         You see your undoing has been long hatching  Pray take care of your   sweet self  Mrs  Jewkes is a devil  but in my master s t other house you   have not one false heart  but myself  Out upon me for a villain           My dear father and mother  when you come to this place  I make no doubt   your hair will stand on end as mine does   O the deceitfulness of the   heart of man   This John  that I took to be the honestest of men  that   you took for the same  that was always praising you to me  and me to   you  and for nothing so much as for our honest hearts  this very fellow   was all the while a vile hypocrite  and a perfidious wretch  and helping   to carry on my ruin       But he says so much of himself  that I will only sit down with this   sad reflection  That power and riches never want tools to promote their   vilest ends  and there is nothing so hard to be known as the heart   of man   I can but pity the poor wretch  since he seems to have great   remorse  and I believe it best to keep his wickedness secret  If it lies   in my way  I will encourage his penitence  for I may possibly make some   discoveries by it       One thing I should mention in this place  he brought down  in a   portmanteau  all the clothes and things my lady and master had given me    and moreover two velvet hoods  and a velvet scarf  that used to be worn   by my lady  but I have no comfort in them  or any thing else       Mrs  Jewkes had the portmanteau brought into my closet  and she shewed   me what was in it  but then locked it up  and said  she would let me   have what I would out of it  when I asked  but if I had the key  it   might make me want to go abroad  may be  and so the confident woman put   it in her pocket       I gave myself over to sad reflections upon this strange and surprising   discovery of John s  and wept much for him  and for myself too  for now   I see  as he says  my ruin has been long hatching  that I can make no   doubt what my master s honourable professions will end in  What a heap   of hard names does the poor fellow call himself  But what must they   deserve  then  who set him to work  O what has this wicked master to   answer for  to be so corrupt himself  and to corrupt others  who would   have been all innocent  and to carry on a poor plot  I am sure for a   gentleman  to ruin a poor creature  who never did him harm  nor wished   him any  and who can still pray for his happiness  and his repentance       I can t but wonder what these gentlemen  as they are called  can think   of themselves for these vile doings  John had some inducement  for he   hoped to please his master  who rewarded him and was bountiful to him    and the same may be said  bad as she is  for this same odious Mrs    Jewkes
