 Nevertheless  I insisted upon his dismissing Mr  C    on  pain of my leaving the house  as I could not help thinking he had used  his endeavours to prejudice me in the opinion of my lord  If his conduct  was the result of friendship for his patron  he certainly acted the part  of an honest and trusty adherent  But I could not easily forgive  him  because  a few weeks before  he had  by my interest  obtained a  considerable addition to his allowance  and even after the steps he had  taken to disoblige me  I was not so much his enemy but that I prevailed  upon Lord B   to double his salary  that his leaving the family might  be no detriment to his fortune  His lordship having complied with my  demand  this gentleman  after having stayed three days in the house   to prepare for his departure  during which I would not suffer him to be  admitted into my presence  made his retreat with a fine young girl  who  was my companion  and I have never seen him since that time    Sir T   still continued furious  and would not take a denial  except  from my own mouth  upon which  with the approbation of Lord B    I  indulged him with an interview  He entered the apartment with a stern  countenance  and told me I had used him ill  I pleaded guilty to the  charge  and begged his pardon accordingly  I attempted to reason the  case with him  but he would hear no arguments except his own  and even  tried to intimidate me with threats  which provoked me to such a degree   that I defied his vengeance  I told him  that I feared nothing but the  report of my own conscience  that  though I had acted a simple part  he  durst not say there was anything criminal in my conduct  and that  from  his present frantic and unjust behaviour  I thought myself happy in  having escaped him  He swore I was the most inflexible of all creatures   asked if nothing would move me  and when I answered   Nothing   took his  leave  and never after persecuted me with his addresses  though I have  heard he was vain and false enough to boast of favours  which  upon  my honour  he never received  as he himself  at one time  owned to Dr   Cantwell  at Paris    While he underwent all this frenzy and distraction upon my account  he  was loved with the same violence of passion by a certain Scotch lady of  quality  who  when he followed me to France  pursued him thither with  the same eagerness and expedition  Far from being jealous of me as a  rival  she used to come to my house  implore my good offices with the  object of her love  and  laying herself on the floor at full length  before the fire  weep and cry like a person bereft of her senses  She  bitterly complained that he had never obliged her but once  and  begged  with the most earnest supplications  that I would give her an  opportunity of seeing him at my house  But I thought proper to avoid her  company  as soon as I perceived her intention    We continued at Paris for some time  during which I contracted an  acquaintance with the sister of Madame de la T    She was the  supposed mistress of the prince of C    endowed with a great share of  understanding  and loved pleasure to excess  though she maintained her  reputation on a respectable footing  by living with her husband and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   mother  This lady  perceiving that I had inspired her lover with a  passion  which gave me uneasiness on her account  actually practised all  her eloquence and art in persuading me to listen to his love  for it  was a maxim with her to please him at any rate  I was shocked at her  indelicate complaisance  and rejected the proposal as repugnant to my  present engagement  which I held as sacred as any nuptial tie  and much  more binding than a forced or unnatural marriage    Upon our return to England  we lived in great harmony and peace  and  nothing was wanting to my happiness  but the one thing to me the most  needful  I mean the enchanting tenderness and delightful enthusiasm of  love  Lord B   s heart  I believe  felt the soft impressions  and  for  my own part  I loved him with the most faithful affection  It is not  enough to say I wished him well  I had the most delicate  the most  genuine esteem for his virtue  I had an intimate regard and anxiety for  his interest  and felt for him as if he had been my own son  But still  there was a vacancy in my heart  there was not that fervour  that  transport  that ecstasy of passion
