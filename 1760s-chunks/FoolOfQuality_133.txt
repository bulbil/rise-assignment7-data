said  WOMAN is strongest   and then the   advocate for the bottle thus began       O ye princes   bear me testimony that wine gives and takes   away according to its mightiness  It takes away the strength and   capacities of nature   and gives powers  virtues  and talents of its   own acquiring      It trips up the wrestler  and lays a giant low   and bears the   feeble and the fearful into the midst of the battle      Wine is an opener of hearts and a revealer of secrets  It raises   hopes into certainty  and gives jollity and enjoyment in exchange   for care      It unfolds the purse of the usurer and enriches the needy   and   frees the prisoner from his chain and the debtor from his obligation      It levels the rich and the poor  the high and the low  the king   and the clown  to one temper and condition  It can set com    panions  friends  and brothers at variance   and cause rivals  com    petitors  and enemies to embrace      Wine enlarges the narrow heart and thaws the frozen under    standing  it instructs the ignorant in arts  and to the silent and   illiterate gives phrase and elocution      It can elevate the peasant from a cottage to a throne  for he   who is drunk is as great as an emperor      O ye princes   what in nature can be stronger than that by which   all the powers of nature are inverted or surpassed           THE FOOL OF QUALITY  121     And having so spoken  lie held his peace      Then arose the advocate for kingly dominion  and  waving his   hand  thus addressed the assembly       O princes   how short and sickly is the influence of wine   it   passes away as a vapour at the dawning  we recollect it with   disgust  or remember nothing thereof  But all power that is   stable or durable subsists in majesty      The king is but one man among a hundred and twenty seven   nations of men   yet he overseeth  connects  and governs the   whole  His are the honours  counsels  and strength of all his   people      The sun  who from on high looketh down on the wide world    beholdeth not at once the extent of our king s dominion  He   must travel for the prospect through the blue expanse of heaven    and leave the western nations  involved in night  when his beam   begins to rise on their fellow subjects in the orient      For the king they plough  they sow  and they reap and plant   vineyards  For him the stars shine and shed influences upon earth    and the seasons change to yield our monarch variety of pro    duction  For him the fruits ripen  the shrubs drop their balm    and the blossoms breathe their odours  all winds blow incense   to him   and the four quarters of the world pay him tribute day   by day      If he bids to build  they build   and if he bids to lay waste    the nations are made desolate  Bliss and bane  life and death    ruin and restoration  are in the breath of his lips      If he cries War   it is war   the banners of blood are let loose   to the wind  and the sound of the clarion kindles all men to battle    His hosts clothe themselves in harness  and range in terrible array     and his horses begin to neigh and tear up the ground  and his   chariots to roll as distant thunders  They move and cover the   earth wide as the eye can reach  The forests are laid flat  the   mountains shake beneath them  and neither the rocks nor rivers   impede the march of his armies  They trample into dust the fruits   of the field  and the labours of the industrious   houses  vineyards    and standing corn  the villages and towns smoke and flame on   every side      Yet none ask the king  Wherefore is peace  or wherefore is war     for he stands exalted in ruin  and is glorified in destruction   his   word is the bolt of irresistible power  and his will makes the   appointment and sanctitude of law      And having so said  he sat down amid the applauses of the   whole assembly      Lastly  slow and bashful  arose the young advocate for the FAIR
