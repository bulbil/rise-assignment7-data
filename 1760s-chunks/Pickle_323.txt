22 15  3 45 PM   would make interest with you  for I believe  from my soul  you are one  of its most favoured ministers upon earth   With these words  he flung  out of the room  leaving Cadwallader very well satisfied with the  chastisement he had bestowed   Peregrine having cooled himself with a solitary walk in the park   during which the violence of his choler gradually evaporated  and his  reflection was called to a serious deliberation upon the posture of his  affairs  he resolved to redouble his diligence and importunity with his  patron and the minister  in order to obtain some sinecure  which would  indemnify him for the damage he had sustained on their account  He  accordingly went to his lordship and signified his demand  after having  told him  that he had suffered several fresh losses  which rendered  an immediate provision of that sort necessary to his credit and  subsistence  His noble friend commended him for the regard he manifested  for his own interest  which he considered as a proof of his being at  last detached from the careless inadvertency of youth  he approved of  his demand  which he assured him should be faithfully transmitted to the  minister  and backed with all his influence  and encouraged his hope  by  observing  that some profitable places were at that time vacant  and  so  far as he knew  unengaged   This conversation helped to restore the tranquility of Pickle s breast   though he still harboured resentment against Cadwallader  on account of  the last insult  and on the instant he formed a plan of revenge  He knew  the misanthrope s remittances from his estate in the country had been of  late very scanty  in consequence of repairs and bankruptcies among his  tenants  so that  in spite of all his frugality  he had been but barely  able to maintain his credit  and even that was engaged on the strength  of his running rent  Being therefore intimately acquainted with the  particulars of his fortune  he wrote a letter to Crabtree  subscribed  with the name of his principal farmer s wife  importing that her husband  being lately dead  and the greatest part of her cattle destroyed by the  infectious distemper  she found herself utterly incapable of paying the  rent which was due  or even of keeping the farm  unless he would  out  of his great goodness  be pleased to give her some assistance  and allow  her to sit free for a twelvemonth to come  This intimation he found  means to convey by post from a market town adjoining to the farm   directed in the usual style to the cynic  who  seeing it stamped with  the known marks  could not possibly suspect any imposition   Hackneyed as he was in the ways of life  and steeled with his boasted  stoicism  this epistle threw him into such an agony of vexation  that  a double proportion of souring was visible in his aspect  when he was  visited by the author  who  having observed and followed the postman  at a proper distance  introduced a conversation upon his own  disappointments  in which  among other circumstances of his own  ill luck  he told him  that his patron s steward had desired to be  excused from paying the last quarter of his interest precisely at the  appointed term  for which reason he should be utterly void of cash  and  therefore requested that Crabtree would accommodate him with an hundred  pieces of his next remittance from the country   This demand galled and perplexed the old man to such a degree  that  the muscles of his face assumed a contraction peculiarly virulent  and  exhibited the character of Diogenes with a most lively expression  he  knew that a confession of his true situation would furnish Pickle with    6 22 15  3 45 PM   an opportunity to make reprisals upon him  with intolerable triumph   and that  by a downright refusal to supply his wants  he would for ever  forfeit his friendship and esteem  and might provoke him to take ample  vengeance for his sordid behaviour  by exposing him  in his native  colours  to the resentment of those whom he had so long deceived  These  considerations kept him some time in a most rancorous state of suspense   which Peregrine affected to misinterpret  by bidding him freely declare  his suspicion  if he did not think it safe to comply with his request   and he would make shift elsewhere   This seeming misconstruction increased the torture of the misanthrope   who  with the utmost irritation of feature   Oons   cried he   what  villainy have you noted in my conduct  that you treat me like a rascally  usurer   Peregrine very gravely replied  that the question needed no  answer   for   said he   had I considered you as a usurer  I would have  come with a security under my arm  but  all evasion apart  will you  stead me  will you pleasure me  shall I have the money     Would it were
