action  on which  looking sternly at him   I would have them warriors   said she   and therefore feed them with the food of men         This anecdote may perhaps disgust you with the Indian ladies  who certainly do not excel in female softness  I will therefore turn to the Canadian  who have every charm except that without which all other charms are to me insipid  I mean sensibility  they are gay  coquet  and sprightly  more gallant than sensible  more flatter d by the vanity of inspiring passion  than capable of feeling it themselves  and  like their European countrywomen  prefer the outward attentions of unmeaning admiration to the real devotion of the heart  There is not perhaps on earth a race of females  who talk so much  or feel so little  of love as the French  the very reverse is in general true of the English  my fair countrywomen seem ashamed of the charming sentiment to which they are indebted for all their power       Adieu  I am going to attend a very handsome French lady  who allows me the honor to drive her en calache to our Canadian Hyde Park  the road to St  Foix  where you will see forty or fifty calashes  with pretty women in them  parading every evening  you will allow the apology to be admissible   ED  RIVERS     LETTER V   5    To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  July 4   WHAT an inconstant animal is man  do you know  Lucy  I begin to be tir d of the lovely landscape round me  I have enjoy d from it all the pleasure meer inanimate objects can give  and find  tis a pleasure that soon satiates  if not relieved by others which are more lively  The scenery is to be sure divine  but one grows weary of meer scenery  the most enchanting prospect soon loses its power of pleasing  when the eye is accustom d to it  we gaze at first transported on the charms of nature  and fancy they will please for ever  but  alas  it will not do  we sigh for society  the conversation of those dear to us  the more animated pleasures of the heart  There are fine women  and men of merit here  but  as the affections are not in our power  I have not yet felt my heart gravitate towards any of them  I must absolutely set in earnest about my settlement  in order to emerge from the state of vegetation into which I seem falling       But to your last  you ask me a particular account of the convents here  Have you an inclination  my dear  to turn nun  if you have  you could not have applied to a properer person  my extreme modesty and reserve  and my speaking French  having made me already a great favourite with the older part of all the three communities  who unanimously declare colonel Rivers to be un tres aimable homme  and have given me an unlimited liberty of visiting them whenever I please  they now and then treat me with a sight of some of the young ones  but this is a favor not allow d to all the world       There are three religious houses at Quebec  so you have choice  the Ursulines  the Hotel Dieu  and the General Hospital  The first is the severest order in the Romish church  except that very cruel one which denies its fair votaries the inestimable liberty of speech  The house is large and handsome  but has an air of gloominess  with which the black habit  and the livid paleness of the nuns  extremely corresponds  The church is  contrary to the style of the rest of the convent  ornamented and lively to the last degree  The superior is an English woman of good family  who was taken prisoner by the savages when a child  and plac d here by the generosity of a French officer  She is one of the most amiable women I ever knew  with a benevolence in her countenance which inspires all who see her with affection  I am very fond of her conversation  tho  sixty and a nun       The Hotel Dieu is very pleasantly situated  with a view of the two rivers  and the entrance of the port  the house is chearful  airy  and agreeable  the habit extremely becoming  a circumstance a handsome woman ought by no means to overlook   tis white with a black gauze veil  which would shew your complexion to great advantage  The order is much less severe than the Ursulines  and I might add  much more useful  their province being the care of the sick  the nuns of this house are sprightly  and have a look of health which is wanting at the Ursulines       The General Hospital  situated about a mile out of town  on the borders of the river St  Charles  is much the most agreeable of the three  The order and the habit are the same with the Hotel Dieu  except that to the habit is added the cross  generally worn in Europe by canonesses only  a distinction procur d for them by their founder  St
