against you  The Quickness of my Apprehension  which is  or should be my best Help to study  is turned to melancholy Prospects  and my Attention to any Thing I read continually interrupted  as I never am one Moment alone     I am ashamed to send this Letter  I would not let it go  but for fear you should think me lazy  Adieu  Life  Love  adieu   Frances   Page  314  LETTER CCCX   My Dear Pet   YOU cannot imagine what Pleasure your Critique upon Brown gives me  Your Sentiments are extremely clever and just  and would become a greater Adept in Philosophy  than you are  but are really surprizing for a young Woman upon so abstruse a Subject  I am pleased to find  that your Remarks have taken a different Turn from mine  tho  we both agree in the same Opinion  and am glad I did not see your s  before I wrote my own  lest I should have rested there  and thought that no farther Criticism was necessary upon the Subject   Indeed  my Dear  I intreat you to exert your Talents a little oftener in this Way  for you may be assured  that  if I did not think you equal to the Task  I would not recommend it to you  Your short and impartial Character is this  You have a very good natural Understanding  a lively Fancy  a quick Apprehension  and an easy Expression  Your Judgment is rather delicate than strong  and may be better stiled a refined Taste than a logical Reason  In short  you need no farther Helps from Nature  and all the Assistance you want from Art  is to be directed to a Course of reading  proper to furnish Page  315 you with Subjects fit for your Reflection  and a letter d Converse  to exercise your Mind   till it attains that Health and Vigour  which it is originally capable of   Adieu   my Life   LETTER CCCXI   AS my dear Harry knows the Uneasiness  which his Silence gives me  I cannot help saying it is more than unkind  it is absolutely cruel  to neglect writing  There was a Report last Week  that you died suddenly  I heard it last Friday  and my not receiving a Letter from you that Day almost distracted me  Tho  your Letters are the most sensible and elegant Pleasure I can receive in your Absence  yet is my Affection so much stronger than my Understanding  that I would willingly give up the Entertainment they afford me  to be certain of a single Line by every Post  which should barely tell me you are well  I know it is a Weakness to expect such exact Punctuality  but it is the natural Effect of a greater  the having so entirely given up my Heart  as to render my Happiness wholly dependent on you  a Trust  for which  contrary to the general Opinion  you can  with Ease  give me sufficient Security   Page  316I received your two Letters of the former Posts  and think it is really something extraordinary  that a Person  who was bred and has lived like you  should  at your Time of Life   immersed in Business  and involved in disagreeable Circumstances  without any outward Call  or visible Help  become so great a Proficient in a Science  which to the Generality of the World appears so tedious and abstruse  as to deter them from being at all acquainted with it  and in which many learned  and from thence called wise  Men have passed their Lives  without either making themselves  or the World  one whit the better for it  In short  I look upon it as a particular Mark of the Almighty s Goodness  that has been pleased to give you a Turn of Mind  which must render you superior to the common Accidents of Life  and that he has thought proper to make you an Instance  among the few  that neither Riches  Power  nor Honours are necessary to constitute the real Happiness of a rational Being  since  with a Taste and Relish for them all  yet unpossessing any of them  your State is infinitely preferable to those  who  in the full Enjoyment of them all  are unblest with true Religion and Philosophy   May my sweet Love long taste those Blessings  which Virtue can alone bestow  and may it  both in this World and the next  be to him Page  317 an Addition of his Bliss  that he has made me better  wiser  and  of course  happier   Adieu   my Heart s  my Soul s dear Harry   LETTER CCCXII   My Dear FANNY   YOU desired to hear from me on Friday  but those  who love  are fond of Works of Supererogation   I am reading one of the Books  I brought away from you  intitled Manners  and am well pleased with it  I remember the Reason of my throwing it aside  when I bought it for you  was  upon looking a little into it  I observed the Author had alluded to a great Number of private Characters  to illustrate general Theorems  and  as I had
