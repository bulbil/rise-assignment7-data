 on the contrary  as warmly expostulated against the   237 pride  avarice  or incapacity of those sent over to command them  General Shirley  who was appointed to that command  had been superseded by Lord London  and this nobleman soon after returning to England  three several commanders were put at the head of separate operations  the most important being that designed against Cape Breton  was commanded by General Amherst  The taking possession of this island  and its fortress  was a conquest greatly wished by all our colonies  as it had always been a convenient harbour to the enemy  which  from thence annoyed our trade with impunity  It was also a convenient situation for carrying on their fishery  a branch of commerce of the utmost benefit to the French nation  The fortress of Louisburg was strengthened with all the assistance of art  the garrison was numerous  the commander vigilant  and every precaution taken to prevent a descent  An account of the operations of a siege is tedious  be it sufficient to say  that the English surmounted every obstacle with the most amazing intrepidity  their former timidity seemed now converted into persevering resolution  the place was surrendered by capitulation  and our troops  long used to disappointment and repulse began to boast of victory in their turn   Two other operations were carried on in America at the same time  the one under General Abercrombie  against Crown Point and Ticonderago  the other  more to the southward  against fort Du Quesne  the latter expedition was successful  but that against Crown Point and Ticonderago was attended with its usual bad fortune  This was now the second time that the English army had attempted to penetrate into those hideous wilds by which nature had secured the French encroachments in that remote part of America  Braddock was fallen in the attempt  his rashness contributed to his defeat  and too much caution  perhaps  was the fault of his successor    238 Much time was spent in marching to the place of action  and the enemy were thus perfectly prepared to give the English troops a warm reception  They were found intrenched under the fort of Ticonderago  behind a breast work raised eight feet high  and still farther secured by felled trees  with their branches pointing outwards  These difficulties  however  the English attempted to surmount  but as the enemy  being secure themselves  took aim at leisure  a terrible carnage of the assailants ensued  and the General  after repeated efforts  was obliged to order a retreat  The English army  however  was still superior to that of the enemy  and might  it was supposed  have gone onward with success  if supported by their artillery  which had not yet arrived  but the General felt  too sensibly  the terrors of the late defeat  to remain in the vicinity of a victorious enemy  he therefore reimbarked his troops  and returned to his camp at Lake George  from whence he had taken his departure   The success of this campaign  however  was  upon the whole  greatly in favour of the English  The taking of fort Du Quesne served to remove from our colonies the terror of the incursions of barbarians  and interrupted that continued correspondence  which by a chain of forts  one part of the French settlements had with the other  The ministry too discovered a spirit of vigorous resolution hitherto unknown  in this part of the world  and the next campaign promised more brilliant successes   Accordingly  in the opening of the next session  1759  the ministry seemed sensible that a single effort carried in such wide extended dominions  would never bring the enemy into subjection  it was therefore resolved to attack them in several different parts of this extensive Empire at once  It was therefore proposed to attack the French in all their places of strength at the same time Preparations were therefore made    239 and expeditions went forward against three different parts of the northern continent of America  General Amherst  commander in chief  with a body of twelve thousand men  was to attack Crown Point that had hitherto been the reproach of the English army  General Wolfe was  at the opposite quarter  to enter the river St  Lawrence  and undertake the siege of Quebec  the capital of the French dominions in this part of the world  while General Prideaux and Sir William Johnson were to attempt a fort near the cataract of Niagara  This last expedition was the first successful  The fort of Niagara was a place of great importance  and served to command all the communication between the northern and western French settlements  The siege was soon commenced by the English  but General Prideaux was killed in the trenches by the bursting of a cohorn  so that the whole success of the expedition fell to General Johnson  and his good fortune  He omitted nothing to promote the vigorous measures of his predecessor  but added all his own popularity  The French knew the importance of this fort  and attempted to relieve it  Johnson attacked them with his usual intrepidity and success  in less than an hour their whole army was put to the route  and the garrison  beholding the defeat of their countrymen  surrendered prisoners of war  Nor was General Amherst less successful  though  without meeting an
