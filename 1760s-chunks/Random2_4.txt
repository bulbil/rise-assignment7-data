men  especially to surgeons  whom he considered as unnecessary animals on board of a ship —In consequence of these sentiments  he never consulted the doctor  notwithstanding his being seized with a violent fit of the gout and gravel  but applied to a cask of Holland gin  which was his sovereign prescription against all distempers  But whether he was at this time too sparing  or took an overdose of his cordial  certain it is  he departed in the night  without any ceremony  which indeed was a thing he always despised  and was found stiff  next morning  to the no small satisfaction of Crampley  who succeeded to the command of the vessel —For that very reason  Mr  Tomlins and I had no cause to rejoice at this event  fearing that the tyranny of our new commander would now be as unlimited as his power —The first day of his command justified our apprehension  For on pretence that the decks were too much crowded  he ordered the surgeon s hen coops  with all his fowls  to be thrown over board  and at the same time  prohibited him and me from appearing on the quarter deck  Mr  Tomlins could not help complaining of these injuries  and in the course of his expostulation dropped some hasty words  of which Crampley taking hold    3 confined him to his cabbin  where  in a few days  for want of air  he was attacked by a fever  which soon put an end to his life  after having made his will  by which he bequeathed all his estate  personal and real  to his sister  and left to me his watch and instruments  as remembrances of his friendship —I was penetrated with grief on this melancholy occasion  the more because there was no body on board  to whom I could communicate my griefs  or of whom I could receive the least consolation or advice —Crampley was so far from discovering the least remorse for his barbarity  at the news of the surgeon s death  that he insulted his memory in the most abusive manner  and affirmed he had poisoned himself out of pure fear  dreading to be brought to a court martial for mutiny  for which reason  he would not suffer the service of the dead to be read over his body before it was thrown over board   Nothing but a speedy deliverance could have supported me under the brutal sway of this bashaw  who to render my life the more irksome  signified to my mess mates  a desire that I should be expelled from their society —This was no sooner hinted  than they granted his request  and I was fain to eat in a solitary manner by myself during the rest of the passage  which however soon drew to a period   We had been seven weeks at sea  when the gunner told the captain  that by his reckoning we must be in soundings  and desired he would order the lead to be heaved —Crampley swore  he did not know how to keep the ship s way  for we were not within a hundred leagues of soundings  and therefore he would not give himself the trouble to cast the lead —Accordingly  we continued   4 our course all that afternoon and night  without shortening sail  although the gunner pretended to discover Scilly light  and next morning protested in form against the captain s conduct  for which he was put in confinement —We discovered no land all that day  and Crampley was still so infatuated as to neglect sounding  But at three o  clock in the morning  the ship struck  and remained fast on a sand bank  This accident alarmed the whole crew  the boat was immediately hoisted out  but as we could not discern which way the shore lay  we were obliged to wait for day light  In the mean time  the wind increased  and the waves beat against the sloop with such violence  that we expected she would have gone to pieces  The gunner was released and consulted  He advised the captain to cut away the mast  in order to lighten her  this was performed without success  The sailors seeing things in a desperate situation  according to custom  broke up the chests belonging to the officers  dressed themselves in their cloaths  drank their liquors without ceremony  and drunkenness  tumult  and confusion ensued —In the midst of this uproar  I went below to secure my own effects  and found the carpenter s mate he wing down the purser s cabbin with his hatchet  whistling all the while  with great composure  When I asked his intention in so doing  he replied very calmly     I only want to taste the purser s rum  that s all  master  —  At that instant the purser coming down  and seeing his effects going to wreck  complained bitterly of the injustice done to him  and asked the fellow what occasion he had for liquor  when in all likelihood he would be in eternity in a few minutes    5   All s one for that  said the plunderer  let us live while we can —Miserable wretch that thou art   cried the purser  what must be thy lot in the other world  if thou diest in the commission of robbery  —   Why
