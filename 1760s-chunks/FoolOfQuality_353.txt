Louisa  and I   will marry  and be blessed  without delay      In the mean while my angel made me the joyful father of a   little son  who was also said to be the happier resemblance of   his happy father  Then  though I had long disregarded the   world and all its concerns  as I saw a family increasing upon   me  and also considered the poor as my appointed and special   creditors  I resolved once more to return and settle my long    suspended accounts      As for the marchioness  she protested that she could not think   of parting with her little Eloisa  and that she should not be able         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  391     to survive her absence ten days  So my Louisa and I  and my   little Bichard  who was named after you  my lord  set out by sea    and after a favourable voyage arrived in England   comforted    however  with the promise that our friends would join us as soon   as possible in Britain      Within the ten subsequent months we received the joyful tidings   that our brother was married to the third daughter of the Duke   of Alenijon that they were all in the highest triumph  and would   speedily be with us in a joint jubilate on the banks of the Avon      Soon after  as my Louisa and I rode along the river  pleasing   ourselves with the prospect of a speedy union with persons so   dear to us  and talking and laughing away at the cares of the   covetous  and the ambition of the high minded  a fowler inadvert    ently fired a shot behind us  and my horse  bounding aloft  plunged   with me into the current  from whence however I was taken  and   unwillingly reserved to years of inexpressible misery of a misery   that admitted not of a drop of consolation      Mean while my love had fallen  with a shriek  from her horse    and lay senseless on the sod  Some of my people flew back  and   bringing a carriage conveyed us gently home  where my Louisa was   undressed and put into a bed  from whence she never rose  Her   fright had given such a shock to her blood and spirits as threw   her into a violent fever      On the second day  while I sat with the physicians by her side    James put in his head and beckoned me forth  Ah  my dearest   master   says he  I pray God to give you the strength and patience   of Job   you have great need of them  for your calamities  like his    come all in a heap upon you  Here is a messenger despatched from   France with very heavy tidings that my sweet young lady  your   darling Eloisa  was cast away in a sloop  upon a party of pleasure    and that the good old marchioness did not outlive her five days    Then lifting my eyes to heaven Strip  strip me  my God  I cried   to the skin to the bone   leave but my Louisa  and I will bless   thy dispensations       On the next day  my little Dickey was taken ill of a severe   cold that he caught  through want of due attention during the   sickness of his mother  As he was of a florid complexion  his   disorder fell suddenly in an inflammation on his lungs  and in less   than twenty lour hours he went to join his little brothers and   sisters in their eternity  Did I not feel these losses  Yes  yes    my friends  they wrung they rent my vitals  yet I still lifted   my heart in an eager prayer  and repeatedly cried Take  take   all even the last mite   leave  leave me but my Louisa  and I will   bless thee  O my Creator       Alas  what could this avail  Can an insect arrest the motion   whereby the round universe continues its course  On the fifth   day I perceived that the eyes of my Louisa the lamps of my   life began to lose their lustre  The breath that was the balm   of all my cares and concerns  grew difficult and short  The roses   of my summer died away on her cheek  All agonizing  I felt and   participated her changes  and she expired while I dropped and   lay senseless beside her          392 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      I knew not what our people did with her or me afterwards    For three weeks I lay in a kind of dosing but uneasy stupor     neither do I
