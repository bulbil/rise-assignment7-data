I let every   accident break my peace  Yet it will do so  while I stay here       Mrs  Jewkes is mightily at me  to go with her in the chariot  to visit   Mr  Williams  She is so officious to bring on the affair between us    that  being a cunning  artful woman  I know not what to make of it  I   have refused her absolutely  urging  that except I intended to encourage   his suit  I ought not to do it  And she is gone without me       I have strange temptations to get away in her absence  for all these   fine appearances   Tis sad to have nobody to advise with   I know not   what to do  But  alas for me  I have no money  if I should  to buy any   body s civilities  or to pay for necessaries or lodgings  But I ll go   into the garden  and resolve afterwards             I have been in the garden  and to the back door  and there I stood  my   heart up at my mouth  I could not see I was watched  so this looks   well  But if any thing should go bad afterwards  I should never forgive   myself  for not taking this opportunity  Well  I will go down again    and see if all is clear  and how it looks out at the back door in the   pasture          To be sure  there is witchcraft in this house  and I believe Lucifer is   bribed  as well as all about me  and is got into the shape of that nasty   grim bull to watch me   For I have been again  and ventured to open the   door  and went out about a bow shot into the pasture  but there stood   that horrid bull  staring me full in the face  with fiery saucer eyes    as I thought  So I got in again  for fear he should come at me  Nobody   saw me  however   Do you think there are such things as witches and   spirits  If there be  I believe  in my heart  Mrs  Jewkes has got   this bull of her side  But yet  what could I do without money  or a   friend   O this wicked woman  to trick me so  Every thing  man  woman    and beast  is in a plot against your poor Pamela  I think   Then I   know not one step of the way  nor how far to any house or cottage    and whether I could gain protection  if I got to a house  And now the   robbers are abroad too  I may run into as great danger as I want to   escape  nay  greater much  if these promising appearances hold  And sure   my master cannot be so black as that they should not   What can I do   I   have a good mind to try for it once more  but then I may be pursued and   taken  and it will be worse for me  and this wicked woman will beat me    and take my shoes away  and lock me up       But  after all  if my master should mean well  he can t be angry at   my fears  if I should escape  and nobody can blame me  and I can more   easily be induced  with you  when all my apprehensions are over    to consider his proposal of Mr  Williams  than I could here  and he   pretends  as you have read in his letter  he will leave me to my choice    Why then should I be afraid  I will go down again  I think  But yet my   heart misgives me  because of the difficulties before me  in escaping    and being so poor and so friendless   O good God  the preserver of the   innocent  direct me what to do       Well  I have just now a sort of strange persuasion upon me  that I   ought to try to get way  and leave the issue to Providence  So  once   more  I ll see  at least  if this bull be still there          Alack a day  what a fate is this  I have not the courage to go  neither   can I think to stay  But I must resolve  The gardener was in sight last   time  so made me come up again  But I ll contrive to send him out of the   way  if I can   For if I never should have such another opportunity    I could not forgive myself  Once
