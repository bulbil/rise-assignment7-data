to go in a hurry  Abate  my bear Charlotte  of half your other visits  and favour me with your company a little longer   Give me some chocolate then  and let me see your cousin Reeves s  I like them  Of the ten visits  six of the ladies will be gone to sales  or to plague tradesmen    270 and buy nothing  Any where rather than at home  The devil s at home  is a phrase  And our modern ladies live as if they thought so  Two of the other four called upon me  and hardly alighted  I shall do so by them  The other two I shall have paid my compliments to in one quarter of an hour   I rang for chocolate  and to beg my cousins company   They wanted but the word  In they came  My apartment  which the was pleased to admire  then became the subject of a few moments conversation  And then a much better took place  Sir Charles  I mean   I asked  if her brother had any relations at Canterbury   I protest I don t know  said she  But this I know  That I have none there  Did I not hint to you  that Sir Charles has his secrets —But he sometimes loves to play with my curiosity  He knows  I have a reasonable quantity of that   Were I his sister—  Then you must do as he would have you  Harriet  I know him to be steady in his purposes  But he is besides so good  that I give up any thing to oblige him—  Your entanglement  Charlotte  asked I  smiling  Mr  Reeves knows nothing from that word   Why  yes  my entanglement  and yet I hate to think of it  So no more of that  It is the only secret I have kept from him  and that is  because he has no suspicion of the matter  if he had  tho  my life were to be the forfeit  I believe he would have it   She told us  that she expected us soon to dine with her in St  James s Square  But that she must fix Sir Charles  I hope  said she  you will often drop in upon me  as I will upon you  From this time  we will have nothing but conversation visits between us  and we will leave the modern world to themselves  and be Queen Elizabeth s women  I am sorry to tell you—Let me whisper it —    271 And she did  but loud enough for every one to hear  Altho  I follow the fashion  and make one fool the more for it  I despise above one half of the women I know   Miss Grandison  affectedly whispered I again  should not do so  because her example is of weight enough to mend them   I ll be hang d if Miss Byron thinks so  re whisper d she  The age is too far gone  Nothing but a national calamity can do it  But let me tell you  that  at the same time  I despise more than one half of the men  But  speaking out  you and I will try to think ourselves wiser than any body else  and we shall have this comfort  we shall not easily find any of our sex  who by their superior wisdom will give us reason to think ourselves mistaken   But adieu  adieu  and adieu  my agreeable friends  Let me see you  and you  and you  turning to each of the three  as often as is convenient  without ceremony  And remember we have been acquainted these hundred years   Away she hurried  forbidding me to go out of my apartment  Mrs  Reeves could not overtake her  Mr  Reeves had much ado to be in time to make his compliments  She was in her chariot before he could offer his hand   How pretty it was  my Lucy  in Miss Grandison  to remember the names of all my dear friends  She told me indeed  on Sunday  that she should   If travelling into foreign countries gives ease and politeness  would not one think that Miss Grandison has visited every European court  as well as her brother  If she has not  was it necessary for Sir Charles to go abroad to acquire that freedom and ease which his sister has so happily attained without stirring out of the kingdom   These men had not best despise us  Lucy  There is not  I hope  so much difference in the genius s of   272 the two sexes as the proud ones among theirs are apt to imagine  especially when you draw comparisons from equal degrees in both   O Mr  Walden  take care of yourself  if ever again you and I meet at Lady Betty s —But this abominable Sir Hargrave  Not one word more of meeting at Lady Betty s  There saw I first the wretch that still  on recollection  strikes terror into my heart   Wednesday  a visit from Miss Clements and Lady Betty took me off my writing about two hours  yet I over writ myself  and was obliged to
