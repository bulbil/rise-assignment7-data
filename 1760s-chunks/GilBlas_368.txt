 direct his studies  and make him an accomplished gentleman  I would willingly have declined the office  as never having exercised the craft of a pedagogue  which required much more genius and solidity than mine  but he shut my mouth by saying it was his absolute determination that I should be tutor to this adopted son  whom he designed for the first offices of the monarchy  As a bribe for my compliance  his lordship increased my little income with a pension of a thousand crowns on the commandery of Mambra       CH  V     The son of the Genoese is acknowledged by a legal instrument  and named Don Henry Philip de Guzman  Santillane establishes his household  and arranges the course of his studies   THE act of adoption was soon legalized with the king s consent and good pleasure  Don Henry Philip de Guzman  as this descendant from a committee of fathers was named  became acknowledged successor to the earldom of Olivarez and the duchy of San Lucar  The minister  to give the act all possible publicity  communicated it through Carnero to the ambassadors and grandees of Spain  who were somewhat startled  The jokers of Madrid were not insensible to the ridicule  and the satirical poets made their harvest of so fine a subject for their pen   I asked my lord duke where my pupil was  Here in town  answered he  with an aunt from whom I shall remove him as soon as you have got a house ready  This I did immediately  and furnished it magnificently  When my establishment was complete in servants and officers  his excellency sent for this equivocal production  this spurious offset from the renowned stock of the Guzmans  The lad was tall and personable  Don Henry  said his lordship  pointing to me  this gentleman is to be your tutor and introduce you into the world  he has my entire confidence  and an unlimited authority over you  After much good advice  and many compliments to me  the minister retired  and I took Don Henry home   As soon as we got thither  I introduced him to his household  and explained the nature of each individual s employment  He did not seem at all disconcerted at the change of circumstances  but received the obeisances of his dependants as if he had been a lord by nature  and not by chance  He was not without mother wit  but ignorant in a deplorable degree  he could scarcely read and write  I gave him masters for the Latin grammar  geography  history  and fencing  A dancing master of course was not forgotten  but in an affair of the first consequence  selection was difficult  for there were more eminent professors of that art in Madrid than of all the languages and sciences put together   While I was pondering on this difficulty  a man gaudily dressed came into the court yard and inquired for me  I went down  supposing him to be at least a knight of some military or privileged order  Signor de Santillane  said he  with a profusion of bows which anticipated his line in life  I am come to offer you my services as Don Henry s governor  My name is Martin Ligero  and I have  thank heaven  some reputation in the world  I have no occasion to canvass for scholars  that is all very well for petty dancing masters  My custom is to wait till I am sent for  but being a sort of appendage to the house of Guzman  and having taught its various branches for a long period  I thought it a point of respect to wait on you first  I perceive  answered I  that you are just the man we want What are your terms  Four double pistoles a month  answered he  and I give but two lessons a week  Four doubloons a month  cried I  that is an exorbitant price  Exorbitant  rejoined he with astonishment  why  it is not more than eight times as much as you would give to a mathematical master or a Greek professor   There was no resisting so ludicrous a comparison of merit  I laughed out right  and asked Signor Ligero whether he really thought his talents worth more than those of the first proficients in learning and science  Most assuredly  said he  at least  if you measure our pretensions by their respective utility  What sort of machines may those be which are fashioned under their hands  Jointless puppets  unlicked cubs  open mouthed and impenetrable shell fish  but our lessons supple and render pliant the intractable stiffness of their component parts  and bring them insensibly into shape  in short  we communicate to them a graceful motion  a polite address  the carriage of good company  and the outward marks of elevated rank   I could not but give way to such cogent arguments in favour of the dancing master s occupation  and engaged him about Dun Henry s person without haggling as to terms  since those specified were only at the rate established by the leading professors of the art       CH  VI     Scipio s return from New Spain  Gil Blas places him about Don Henry s person  That young nobleman s course of study  His career
