  my coming  but he says  he told you he hoped something would happen to   hinder it       I am glad you did not tell him the occasion of my coming away  for if   my fellow servants should guess  it were better so  than to have it from   you or me  Besides  I really am concerned  that my master should   cast away a thought upon such a poor creature as me  for  besides the   disgrace  it has quite turned his temper  and I begin to believe what   Mrs  Jervis told me  that he likes me  and can t help it  and yet   strives to conquer it  and so finds no way but to be cross to me       Don t think me presumptuous and conceited  for it is more my concern   than my pride  to see such a gentleman so demean himself  and lessen   the regard he used to have in the eyes of all his servants  on my   account   But I am to tell you of my new dress to day       And so  when I had dined  up stairs I went  and locked myself into my   little room  There I tricked myself up as well as I could in my new   garb  and put on my round eared ordinary cap  but with a green knot    however  and my homespun gown and petticoat  and plain leather shoes    but yet they are what they call Spanish leather  and my ordinary hose    ordinary I mean to what I have been lately used to  though I shall think   good yarn may do very well for every day  when I come home  A plain   muslin tucker I put on  and my black silk necklace  instead of the   French necklace my lady gave me  and put the ear rings out of my ears    and when I was quite equipped  I took my straw hat in my hand  with   its two blue strings  and looked about me in the glass  as proud as any   thing  To say truth  I never liked myself so well in my life       O the pleasure of descending with ease  innocence  and   resignation   Indeed  there is nothing like it  An humble mind  I   plainly see  cannot meet with any very shocking disappointment  let   fortune s wheel turn round as it will       So I went down to look for Mrs  Jervis  to see how she liked me       I met  as I was upon the stairs  our Rachel  who is the house maid  and   she made me a low courtesy  and I found did not know me  So I smiled    and went to the housekeeper s parlour  and there sat good Mrs  Jervis at   work  making a shift  and  would you believe it  she did not know me at   first  but rose up  and pulled off her spectacles  and said  Do you want   me  forsooth  I could not help laughing  and said  Hey day  Mrs  Jervis    what  don t you know me   She stood all in amaze  and looked at me   from top to toe  Why  you surprise me  said she  What  Pamela thus   metamorphosed  How came this about       As it happened  in stept my master  and my back being to him  he thought   it was a stranger speaking to Mrs  Jervis  and withdrew again  and did   not hear her ask  If his honour had any commands for her   She turned me   about and about  and I shewed her all my dress  to my under petticoat    and she said  sitting down  Why  I am all in amaze  I must sit down    What can all this mean  I told her  I had no clothes suitable to my   condition when I returned to my father s  and so it was better to begin   here  as I was soon to go away  that all my fellow servants might see I   knew how to suit myself to the state I was returning to       Well  said she  I never knew the like of thee  But this sad preparation   for going away  for now I see you are quite in earnest  is what I know   not how to get over  O my dear Pamela  how can I part with you       My master rung in the back parlour  and so I withdrew  and Mrs  Jervis   went to attend him  It seems  he said to her  I was coming in to let   you know  that I shall go to Lincolnshire  and
