conversation   Just this moment she sent for me to her bedside  having been some minutes awake  and seeing my fingers marked with ink— I suppose  my love   says she    you have been writing to poor Louisa   I replied in the affirmative  and insinuated what a consolation it would be to you  if you were honoured   13 with her remembrance   My dear Miss Beauclerk   returned she   have not I already told you  that she is still my child  that she even may write to me if she pleases  and that I shall always consider her unhappy fall with a much greater share of pity than resentment  To be candid with you  my obliging love   continued the dear lady   I am more to be blamed for leaving Sir Robert Harold and Louisa so frequently together  than either is for abusing the confidence which I reposed in their discretion  Young people  where they tenderly love each other  and where a day is set apart for their marriage  are very dangerous companions  the woman loses all her fear  and the man all his veneration  they become insensibly more and more familiar  till their imaginations are intensely heated  and their recollection totally lost—In such   14 a situation  the consequence is but too obvious  the woman wakes into distraction  and the man into doubt or disgust—She trembles for his constancy  and he fears for her virtue  recriminations naturally ensue  and they either go to the altar with sentiments very little calculated to preserve their future felicity  or break off in such a manner as draws a general disgrace upon the woman and her family  O  Miss Beauclerk  why did nt I consider this matter with propriety  when such a consideration would have been essential to my happiness  Why would I expose the darling of my heart to dangers which it was scarcely possible for her to avoid  or ensnare the inexperience of my child with unecessary temptations—But  alas  because she was my child  I must foolishly suppose her above the reach of human infirmities  and be guilty   15 of an inattention in my own conduct  which I would have severely censured in the mother of any body else  O  my sweet Louisa  your doating mother s extravagant fondness has been the cause of all our calamities  and your indiscretion was nothing more than the natural result of her mistaken partiality     In this manner  my beautiful friend  did the generous minded lady proceed  while my tears could only testify the warmth of my approbation  She was pleased to see me touched  and  more than once kissing away the drops from my cheeks  declared she was never sorry to see a young lady miserable at a scene of distress  because those only could continue unmov d  who were utterly destitute of humanity and understanding—Your father came in about this time  and seeing both our eyes red  assigned    16 in the fury of his resentment  a very different cause from the real one —   What do you cry for  my dear   says he to your venerable mother   If the villain  who has brought all this affliction upon our heads is not yet sacrificed  be satisfied that justice shall overtake him in the end  for I have a gallant boy still living  who shall pursue him with unceasing vengeance till he has washed away the disgrace of our family in his blood  O  had the inhospitable monster but fallen to day  how light should I have made of my son s misfortune  but he shall yet feel me—By the great God of heaven and earth he shall  and so  my dear  be pacified      O  Mr  Mildmay   replied your mother    too much blood has been spilled already  and  if something which I have casually heard from Miss Beauclerk  of Sir Robert s repentance    17 be true  I must say that it would be much better to think of an accommodation than to expose ourselves to any additional share of distress  lady Haversham is an excellent woman  and I have strong reason to imagine  that her influence will have every weight we could wish with the thoughtless young man  her brother  suffer me  therefore  my dear  to make an enquiry into the foundation of Miss Beauclerk s intelligence  that if we find—     Find what  madam    interrupted your father  with an uncommon degree of vehemence    You would not surely have the dishonour of your family pass unpunished  nor think of receiving a villain as your son in law  who has covered you with the most infamous disgrace  Would you give your daughter to a ruffian  who has possibly   18 murdered your son  or would you basely beg of lady Haversham to speak a good word for us to her scoundrel of a brother  Are we reduced at once so low as to kneel where we have been barbarously injured  and must we think of supplicating a monster for compassion  whose hands have been equally steeped in our reputation and our blood  Fie  Mrs  Mildmay  fie  this is a language unworthy both of your character and your descent  and could
