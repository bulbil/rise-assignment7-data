I was  I must be for surprising them too  with my fine fancy   Then I laid out a good deal more than I intended  in milanery matters  Not but I had my pennyworths for my penny  But the milaners are so very obliging  they shew one this pretty thing  and that fashionable one  and are so apt to praise one s taste  and one is so willing to believe them  and to be thought mighty clever  that there is no resisting the vanity they raise  I own all my folly  I ever will  Sir  when I am guilty   246 of any greater silliness than ordinary  for I have no bad heart  I hope  tho  I am one of the flowers I once heard you compare some of us to  who are late before they blow into discretion   But now  good Sir  came on my distress  For the bespoken chariot was ready  ready sooner by a fortnight  than I expected  I thought my quarter would be nearer ended  and I had made a vast hole in my money  I pulled up a courage  I had need of it  and borrowed fifty guineas of Lady G   but  from this foolish love of surprizes  cared not to tell her for what  And having occasion to pay two or three bills  I was a thoughtless creature  to be sure  which unluckily  tho  I had asked for them before  were brought in just then  I borrowed another sum  but yet told not Lady G  for what  and the dear Lady  I believe  thought me an extravagant girl  I saw she did  by her looks   But  however  I caused the new chariot to be brought privately to me  I went in it  and it carried me to Soho  and there  on my knees  made my present to my mother   But do you think  Sir  that she and Mr  O Hara  when I confessed that I had not consulted you upon it  and that neither Lady L  nor Lady G  nor yet Mrs  Eleanor Grandison  knew a syllable of the matter  would accept of it  They would not  But yet they both cried over me for joy  and blessed me   It is put up somewhere And there it lies  till I have obtained your pardon first  and your direction afterwards  And what shall I do  if you are angry at your por ward  who has done so inconsiderate a thing  and run herself into debt   Chide me  honoured Sir  if you please  Indeed you never yet did chide me  But yours will be chideings of Love  of paternal Love  Sir   But if you are angry with me more than a day  if you give me reason to believe you think meanly of me    247 tho   alas  I may deserve it  and that this rashness is but a prelude to other rash or conceited steps  for that is the fear which most terrifies me  and is therefore to be resented with severity  then will I fly to my dear Miss Byron  that now is —And if she cannot soften your displeasure  and restore me to your good opinion— Mere pardon will not be enough for your truly penitent ward  then will I say  Burst  heart  Ingrateful  inconsiderate Emily  Thou hast offended thy Guardian  What is there left in this life  that is worth thy cares   And now  Sir  I have laid my troubled heart open before you  I know you will not so much blame the thing  even should you not approve of it  as the manner  doing it  after you had been so extremely generous and inconsiderate to my mother  without consulting either you  or your sisters  O my vanity and conceit  They  they have misled me  They never shall again  whether you forgive me  or not   But good  indulgent  honoured Sir  my Guardian  my Protector  let not my punishment be the reversing of the gracious grant which my heart has been so long wishing to obtain  and which you had consented to  of being allowed to live immediately in your own eye  and in the presence of my dear Miss Byron  that now is  This rash action should rather induce you to confirm  than reverse it  And I promise to be very good  I ever loved her  I shall add filial honour  as I may say  to my love of her  I never will do any thing without consulting her  and but what you  the kindest Guardian that ever poor Orphan had  would wish me to do   And now  Sir  honour me with a few lines from your own hand  were it but to shew me that this impertinence has not so far tired you  as  should you think it just to banish me from your presence for some time   248 to make you discourage applications to you  by pen and ink  from  Sir   Your truly sorrowful Ward  and ever obliged and grateful EMILY JERVOIS   LETTER XXXVII  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Miss JERVOIS
