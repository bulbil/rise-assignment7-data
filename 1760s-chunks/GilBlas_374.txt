seemed to me there was some deeper cause  which it behoved a sincere friend to fathom  Taking advantage of our being alone together  My lord  said I  in a tone of mingled respect and affection  whence is it that you are no longer so cheerful as heretofore  Has your philosophy lost ground  or has the world recovered its allurements  Surely you would not plunge again into that gulf  where your virtue must inevitably be shipwrecked  No  heaven be praised  replied the minister  my part at court has long faded from my memory  and its trappings from my eyes  Indeed  why then  resumed I  since you have strength enough to banish false regrets  are you so weak as to indulge a melancholy which alarms us all  What is the matter with you  my dear master  continued I  falling at his knees  some secret sorrow preys upon you  can you hide it from Santillane  whose zeal  discretion  and fidelity you have so often experienced  Why am I so unhappy as to have lost your confidence   You still possess it  said his lordship  but I must own  it is reluctantly that I shall reveal the subject of my distress  yet the importunities of such a friend are irresistible  To no one else could I impart so singular a confidence  Yes  I am the prey of a morbid melancholy which eats inwardly into my vitals  a spectre haunts me every moment  arrayed in the most terrific form of preternatural horror  In vain have I argued with myself that it is a vision of the brain  an unreal mockery  its continual presentments blast my sight  and unseat my reason  Though my understanding teaches me  that in looking on this spectre I stare at vacancy  my spirits are too weak to derive comfort from the conviction  Thus much have you extorted from me  now judge whether the cause of my melancholy is fit to be divulged   With equal grief and astonishment did I listen to the strange confession  which implied a total derangement of the nervous system  This  my lord  said I  must proceed from injudicious abstinence  So I thought at first  answered he  and to try the experiment  I have been eating more than usual for some days past  but it is all to no purpose  the phantom takes his stand as usual  It will vanish  said I  if your excellency will only divert your mind by your accustomed relaxations with your household  Company and gentle occupation are the best remedies for these affections of the spirits   In a short time after this conversation  his lordship became seriously indisposed  and sent for two notaries from Madrid  to make his will  Three capital physicians followed in their track  who had the reputation of curing their patients now and then  As soon as it was noised about the castle that these last undertakers were arrived  the case was given up for lost  weeping and gnashing of teeth took place universally  and the family mourning was ordered  They brought with them their usual understrappers  an apothecary and a surgeon   The notaries were suffered to earn their fee first  after which death s notaries prepared to take a bond of the patient  They practised in the school of Sangrado  and from their very first consultation  ordered bleeding so frequently and freely  that in six days they brought his lordship to the point of death  and on the seventh delivered him from the terror of his sprite   After the minister s decease  a lively and sincere sorrow reigned in the castle of Loeches  The whole household wept bitterly  Far from deriving consolation from the certainty of being remembered in his will  there was not a dependent who would not willingly have saved his life by the sacrifice of the legacy  As for me  whom he most delighted in  attached to him as I was from disinterested friendship  my grief was more acute than that of the rest  I question whether Antonia cost me more tears    Translator s Note          Behind him sneaks Another mortal  not unlike himself  Of jargon full  with terms obscure o ercharged  Apothecary call d  whose foetid hands With power mechanic  and with charms arcane  Apollo  god of medicine  has endued     BRAMSTON       CH  XII     The proceedings at the Castle of Loeches after his lordship s death  and the course which Santillane adopted   THE minister  according to his last injunctions  was buried without pomp and without procession in the convent  with a dirge of our lamentations  After the funeral  Madame d  Olivarez called us together to hear the will read  with which the household had good reason to be satisfied  Every one had a legacy proportioned to his claim  and none less than two thousand crowns  mine was the largest  amounting to ten thousand pistoles  as a mark of his singular regard  The hospitals were not forgotten  and provision was made for an annual commemoration in several convents   Madame d Olivarez sent all the household to Madrid to receive their legacies from Don Raymond Caporis  who had orders to pay them  but I
