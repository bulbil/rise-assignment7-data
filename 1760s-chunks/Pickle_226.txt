naturally disposes the mind to  peace and benevolence  but when improved with conversation of the man  one loves  it fills the imagination with ideas of ineffable delight  For  my own part  I can safely say  my heart was so wholly engrossed by my  husband  that I never took pleasure in any diversion where he was not  personally concerned  nor was I ever guilty of one thought repugnant to  my duty and my love    In the autumn  we set out for the north  and were met on the road by  the duke and twenty gentlemen  who conducted us to H  n  where we lived  in all imaginable splendour  His grace  at that time  maintained above  a hundred servants  with a band of music  which always performed at  dinner  kept open table  and was visited by a great deal of company  The  economy of his house was superintended by his eldest sister  a beautiful  young lady of an amiable temper  with whom I soon contracted an intimate  friendship  She and the duke used to rally me upon my fondness for Lord  W    who was a sort of humourist  and apt to be in a pet  in which  case he would leave the company and go to bed by seven o clock in the  evening  On these occasions  I always disappeared  giving up every  consideration to that of pleasing my husband  notwithstanding the  ridicule of his relations  who taxed me with having spoiled him with  too much indulgence  But how could I express too much tenderness and  condescension for a man  who doted upon me to such excess  that     6 22 15  3 45 PM   when business obliged him to leave me  he always snatched the first  opportunity to return  and often rode through darkness  storms  and  tempests to my arms    Having stayed about seven months in this place  I found myself in a  fair way of being a mother  and that I might be near my own relations  in such an interesting situation  I and my dear companion departed  from H  n  not without great reluctance  for I was fond of the Scots in  general  who treated me with great hospitality and respect  and to this  day  they paid me the compliment of saying  I was one of the best wives  in that country which is so justly celebrated for good women    Lord W   having attended me to my father s house  was obliged to  return to Scotland  to support his interest in being elected member of  Parliament  so that he took his leave of me  with a full resolution of  seeing me again before the time of my lying in  and all the comfort  I enjoyed in his absence  was the perusal of his letters  which I  punctually received  together with those of his sister  who  from time  to time  favoured me with assurances of his constancy and devotion   Indeed  these testimonials were necessary to one of my disposition  for  I was none of those who could be contented with half a heart  I could  not even spare one complacent look to any other woman  but expected  the undivided homage of his love  Had I been disappointed in this  expectation  I should  though a wife  have rebelled or died    Meanwhile my parents treated me with great tenderness  intending that  Lord W   should be settled in a house of his own  and accommodated with  my fortune  and his expectations from the queen were very sanguine  when  I was taken ill  and delivered of a dead child  an event which affected  me extremely  When I understood the extent of my misfortune  my heart  throbbed with such violence  that my breast could scarce contain it   and my anxiety  being aggravated by the absence of my lord  produced a  dangerous fever  of which he was no sooner apprised by letter  than he  came post from Scotland  but  before his arrival  I was supposed to be  in a fair way    During this journey  he was tortured with all that terrible suspense  which prevails in the minds of those who are in danger of losing that  which is most dear to them  and  when he entered the house  was so much  overwhelmed with apprehension  that he durst not inquire about the state  of my health  As for my part  I never closed an eye from the time on  which I expected his return  and  when I heard his voice  I threw open  my curtains  and sat up in the bed to receive him  though at the hazard  of my life  He ran towards me with all the eagerness of passion  and  clasped me in his arms  he kneeled by the bedside  and kissed my hand  a thousand times  and wept with transports of tenderness and joy   In short  this meeting was so pathetic as to overcome my enfeebled  constitution  and we were parted by those
