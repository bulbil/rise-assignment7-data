if you please   Very true  I believe  Sir  said I  But  on the other hand  may not those who have either  or both  value themselves too much on that account  I knew once an excellent scholar  who thought  that too great a portion of life was bestowed in the learning of languages  and that the works of many of the antients were more to be admired for the stamp which antiquity has fixed upon them  and for the sake of their purity in languages that cannot alter  and whose works are therefore become the standard of those languages  than for the lights obtained from them by men of genius  in ages that we have reason to think more enlightened  as well by new discoveries as by revelation   And then I was going to ask  whether the reputation of learning was not oftener acquir d by skill in those branches of science which principally serve for amusement to inquisitive and curious minds  than by that in the more useful sort  But Mr  Walden broke in upon me with an air that had severity in it   I could almost wish  said he  and but almost  as you are a Lady  that you knew the works of the great antients in their original languages   Something  said Miss Clements  should be left for men to excel in  I cannot but approve of Mr  Walden s word almost   She then whisper d me  Pray  Miss Byron  proceed  for she saw me a little out of countenance at Mr  Walden s severe air —Strange  added she  still whispering  that people who know least how to argue  should be most disputatious  Thank Heaven  all scholars are not like this   A little encouraged  Pray  Sir  said I  let me ask one question—Whether you do not think  that our Milton  in his Paradise Lost  shews himself to be a   73 very learned man —And yet that work is written wholly in the language of his own country  as the works of Homer and Virgil were in the language of theirs —And they  I presume  will be allowed to be learned men   Milton  madam  let me tell you  is infinitely obliged to the great antients  and his very frequent allusions to them  and his knowlege of their mythology  shew that he is   His knowlege of their mythology  Sir —His own subject so greatly  so nobly  so divinely  above that mythology —I have been taught to think  by a very learned man  that it was a condescension in Milton to the taste of persons of more reading than genius  in the age in which he wrote  to introduce  so often as he does  his allusions to the pagan mythology  And that he neither raised his sublime subject  nor did credit to his vast genius  by it   Mr  Addision  said Mr  Walden  is a writer admired by the Ladies  Mr  Addison  madam  as you will find in your Spectators  Sneeringly he spoke this  gives but the second place to Milton  on comparing some passage of his with some of Homer   If Mr  Addison  Sir  has not the honour of being admired by the gentlemen  as well as the ladies  I dare say Mr  Walden will not allow  that his authority should decide the point in question  And yet  as I remember  he greatly extols Milton —But I am going out of my depth—Only permit me to say one thing more—If Homer is to be preferred to Milton  he must be the sublimest of writers  and Mr  Pope  admirable as his translation of the Iliad is said to be  cannot have done him justice   You seem  madam  to be a very deep English scholar  But say you this from your own observation  or from that of any other   I readily own  that my lights are borrowed  replied I  I owe the observation to my godfather Mr  Deane    74 He is a scholar  but a greater admirer of Milton than of any of the antients  A gentleman  his particular friend  who was as great an admirer of Homer  undertook from Mr  Pope s translation of the Iliad  to produce passages that in sublimity exceeded any in the Paradise Lost  The gentlemen met at Mr  Deane s house  where I then was  They allowed me to be present  and this was the issue  The gentleman went away convinced  that the English poet as much excelled the Grecian in the grandeur of his sentiments  as his subject  founded on the Christian system  surpasses the pagan   The debate  I have the vanity to think  said Mr  Walden  had I been a party in it  would have taken another turn   The baronet expressed himself highly delighted with me  and was running over with the praises he had heard given me at last Northampton races  when I endeavoured to stop him  by saying  Surely  Sir  it must be your too low opinion of the qualifications of our Sex  that can induce you to think such obvious remarks as I have been drawn in to make
