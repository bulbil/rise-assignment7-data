He is just as nature made him  with all the vivacity of youth  courteous in his manners  and forward to oblige  I could wish you to get acquainted with him  I answered that I would not fail to go and see this Joseph Navarro as soon as I should get to Madrid  whither I meant to return in due time  Then did I turn my back on the episcopal palace  never to grace it with my presence again  If I had kept my horse  I should perhaps have set out for Toledo immediately  but I had sold it during the period of my administration  supposing that I was in office for life  and should not henceforward be migratory  My final resolution was to hire a ready furnished lodging  as I had made up my mind to stay another month in Grenada  and then to pay the Count de Polan a visit   As dinner hour was drawing nigh  I asked my landlady if there was any eating house in the neighbourhood  She answered that there was a very good one within a few yards of her house  where the accommodations were excellent  and the company select and numerous  I made her shew me where it was  and went thither sharp set  I was shewn into a large room  resembling the hall of a monastery in everything but good cheer  There were ten or a dozen men sitting at a long table  with a cloth spread over it that fretted in its own grease  but they  with unoffended nostrils  were engaged in general conversation  though they dined individually  each having a miserable scrap for his portion  The people of the house brought me my allowance  which at another time would have turned my stomach  and have made me sigh after the luxuries of the table I had just lost  But at this moment I was so indignant against the archbishop  that the homely fare of a paltry eating house seemed more palatable than the dainties of his sumptuous board  It was a burning shame to see such a waste of provisions served up in soups and sauces to pamper the appetite  Arguing like a deep examiner in the economy of the human frame  and reasoning medically as well as philosophically  on the disproportion between the simple wants of nature and the complexity of luxurious indulgence  cursed be they  said I  who invented those pernicious dinners and suppers  where one must sit on the tenterhooks of self denial  for fear of overloading the storehouse and shop of the whole body  Man wants but little here below  and provided he can but keep body and soul together  the less he eats the better  Thus did I  in my surly vein  give utterance to wise saws  which  however just in theory  had hitherto been little recommended by my practice   While I was dispatching my commons  without any danger of a surfeit from repletion  the licentiate Lewis Garcias  who had got the living of Gabia in the manner above mentioned  came into the room  The moment he recognized me  he ran into my arms with all the cordiality of friendship  or rather with the extravagant joy of a lover after a long exile from his mistress  He folded me repeatedly within his sincere embrace  and I was compelled to stand the brunt of a long winded compliment on the unparalleled disinterestedness of my conduct towards him  Gratitude is a fine virtue  and yet it is wearisome when carried beyond due bounds  He took his seat next me  saying  Well  a parson must not swear  though by the mass  my dear patron  since my good fortune has thrown me in your way  we will not part without a jovial glass  But as there is no good wine in this shabby inn  I will take you  if you please  after our make shift dinner  to a place where I will treat you with a couple of bottles  rich  genuine  and old  in comparison of which the Falernian of Horace was all a farce  The church will give us absolution  in the cause of gratitude  If I could but get you for a few days down at my parsonage of Gabia  Maecenas was never more welcome to the poet s Sabine farm  than the author of all my ease and comfort to the choicest produce of a glebe which is mine only by your benevolence   While he was holding this high flown language  his little slice of dinner was set before him  He fell to without the fear of indigestion before his eyes  still heightening the luxury of the repast at intervals  by fine speeches addressed to me in the most fulsome style of flattery  I took the opportunity  when his mouth was filled with something more substantial  to edge in a word or two amidst the torrent  and as he had not forgotten to ask after his friend the steward  I made no bones about acknowledging that I was no longer a hanger on of the church  I even went so far as to particularize the most trivial circumstances attending my resignation  to all of which he listened with an attentive ear  After all his fine professions  who would not have expected to see him moved even to tears with the throes of resentful gratitude  to hear him thunder bulls and
