This is generally forgotten in the slumber of wickedness  So deeply is the love of pleasure rooted in mens hearts  and so strongly guarded by hope and fear against the approach of reason  that neither science nor experience can shake it  and they act as if life was without end  though they see and confess its uncertainty and shortness   If it has been your misfortune ever to be engaged in a life of wickedness  repent now  you yet have time  It is the same weakness now to defer repenting of your sins  in proportion to the importance of   177 the neglect  as to defer any care  which now claims your attention  to a future time  You cannot promise yourselves long life  and even though you could  it is easier to conceive sorrow for a few failings  than when the soul  by a long uninterrupted course of sin  is  as it were  covered all over with a callus  for although the motives of repentance are so much the stronger in proportion as the offences against the great Creator of mankind are heinous  or numerous  yet  when the heart is hardened  it is with the greatest dissiculty made to receive any impression of piety   Let the errors and follies  the dangers and infelicity of that state  sink deep into your hearts  Remember  that human life is the journey of a day  We rise in the morning of youth  full of vigour  and full of expectation  We set forward with spirit and hope  with gaiety and daily care  and travel a while in the straight road of piety towards the mansions of rest  in a short time we remit our fervour  and endeavour to find some mitigation of our duty  and some more easy means of obtaining   178 the same end  We then relax our vigour  and resolve no longer to be terrified with crimes at a distance  but rely on our own constancy  and venture to approach what we resolve never to touch   We are then willing to enquire whether another advance cannot be made  and whether we may not at least  turn our eyes upon the gardens of pleasure  We approach them with scruple and hesitation  we enter them  but enter timorous and trembling  and always hope to pass thro  them without losing the road of virtue  which we for a while keep in our sight  and to which we purpose to return   But temptation succeeds temptation  and one compliance prepares for another  We in time lose the happiness of innocence  and solace our disquiet with sensual gratifications  By degrees we let fall the remembrance of our original intention  and quit the only object of rational desire  We entangle ourselves in business  immerge ourselves in luxury  and rove through the labyrinth of inconstancy  till the darkness of old age begins to invade us  and diseases   179 and anxiety obstruct our way  We then look back on our lives with horror  with sorrow  with repentance  and wish  but too often vainly wish  that we had not forsaken the ways of virtue  Happy are they who learn from example not to be wicked   I hope my readers will excuse the prolixity I have used in penning the above  I have now done  and I must beg them to receive this as written only with a view of conveying delight with instruction  and to wean those unhappy females from vice who are enthralled in it  and guard those against it  who are as yet unacquainted with guilt  How I have succeeded is left to the impartial public  who I humbly hope will receive it with that candour with which they approve of any attempt to yield them pleasure or satisfaction   FINIS      unnumbered   This Day are publish d   Price 2s  6d  sew d   MEMOIRS of the Amours  Intrigues  and Adventures of Charles Augustus Fitz Roy  DUKE of GRAFTON  with Miss PARSONS  interspersed with a faithful Account of Miss PARSONS S Amours with other Persons of Distinction   Printed for S  Caldicot  in Bell Savage Yard  Ladgate Hill   Who has also Published   Price 1s  6d   THE Case   c  of the ORPHAN and CREDITORS of JOHN AYLIFFE  Esq  for the Opinion of the Public  with an ADDENDA of interesting QUERIES for the Answer of those whom it concerns  The whole fairly stated  and indisputably authenticated from Originals   Hast thou killed  and hast thou also taken possession  Thus saith the Lord  in the place where dogs licked the blood of Nabath shall dogs lick thy blood  even thine  because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord  behold I will bring evil upon thee  and will take away thy posterity   And Likewise   Genuine Memoirs of the Luttrell Family  of a very extraordinany Nature   Price 1s  6d
