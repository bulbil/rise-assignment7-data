set every engine at work to seduce Antonia  was in a hurry to get her safely out of my apartment  with a resolved purpose  probably  of withdrawing her for ever from my pursuit   Scipio finding himself alone with me  said with a smile  Here is another defence for you against the blue devils  I did not know that your farming man had so pretty a daughter  for I had never seen her before  though I have been twice at his house  He must have taken infinite pains to keep her out of the way  and it is impossible to be angry with him for it What the plague  here is a morsel for a liquorish palate  But there seems to be no necessity for blazoning her perfections to you  their very first glance dazzled you out of countenance  I do not deny it  answered I  Ah  my beloved friend  I have surely seen an inhabitant of the realms above  the electrical spark now thrills through all my frame  it scorches like lightning  yet tingles like the vivifying fluid at my heart   You slight me beyond measure  replied my secretary  by giving me to understand that you have at length fallen in love  Nothing but a mistress was wanting to complete your rural establishment at all points  Thanks to Heaven  you are now likely to be accommodated in every way  I am well aware that we shall have a hard matter to elude Basil s vigilance  but leave that to me  and I will undertake before the end of three days to manage a private meeting for you with Antonia  Master Scipio  said I  it is not so sure that you would be able to keep your word  but at all events  I have not the least desire to make the experiment I will have nothing to do with the ruin of that girl  for she is an angel  and does not deserve to be numbered among the fallen ones  Therefore  instead of laying the guilt upon your soul of assisting me in her dishonour  I have made up my mind to marry her with your kind help  supposing her heart not to be pre  occupied by a prior attachment I had no idea  said he  of your directly plunging headlong into the cold bath of matrimony  The generality of landlords  in your place  would stand upon the ancient tenure of manorial rights  they would not deal with Antonia upon the square of modern law and gospel  till after failure in the establishment of their feudal privileges  But though this may be the way of the world  do not suppose that I am by any means against your honourable passion  or at all wish to dissuade you from your purpose  Your bailiff s daughter deserves the distinction you design for her  if she can give you the first fruits of her heart  an offering of sensibility and gratitude  that is what I shall ascertain this very day by talking with her father  and possibly with her   My agent was a man to transact his business according to the letter  He went to see Basil privately  and in the evening came to me in my closet  where I waited for him with impatience  somewhat exasperated by apprehension  There was a slyness in his countenance  whence my prognostic inclined to the brighter side  Judging  said I  by that look of suppressed merriment  you are come to acquaint me that I shall soon be at the summit of human bliss  Yes  my dear master  answered he  the heavens smile upon your vows  I have talked the matter over with Basil and his daughter  declaring your intentions without reserve  The father is delighted at the idea of your asking his blessing as a son in  law  and you may set your heart at rest about Antonia s taste in a husband  Darts and flames  cried I in an ecstacy of amorous transport  what  am I so happy as to have made myself agreeable to that lovely creature  Never question it  replied he  she loves you already  It is true  she has not owned so much by word of mouth  but my assurance rests on the tale telling sparkle of her eye  when your proposals were made known to her  And yet you have a rival  A rival  exclaimed I  with a faltering voice  and a cheek blanched with fear  Do not let that give you the least uneasiness  said he  your competitor cannot bid very high  for he is no other than master Joachim your cook  Ah  the hangdog  said I  with an involuntary shout of laughter  this is the reason  then  why he had so great an objection to being turned out of my service  Exactly so  answered Scipio  within these few days he made proposals of marriage to Antonia  who politely declined them  With submission to your better judgment  replied I  it would be expedient  at least so it strikes me  to get rid of that strange fellow  before he is informed of my intended match with Basil s daughter  a cook  as you are aware  is a dangerous rival  You are perfectly in the right  rejoined my trusty counsellor  we must clear the premises of him
