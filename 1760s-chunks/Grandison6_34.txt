of your deliberations  Mean time may I meet with an interceding friend in every one I have had the pleasure to see this day  I must flatter myself with the honour of Miss Byron s whole heart  as well as with the approbation of all her friends  I cannot be thought at present  to deserve it  but it shall be the endeavour of my life so to do   He withdrew  with a grace which was all his own   The moment he was gone from us  my grandmamma threw her arms about her Harriet  then about my aunt  and they congratulated me  and each other   We were all pained at heart  when we read the Letter  It is from Signor Jeronymo  urging your brother to set the example to his sister  which they so much want her to follow  I send you the translation  Pray return it  Poor Lady Clementina  Without seeing the last Letters he wrote to them  she seems to be tired into compliance  I will not say one half that is upon my mind on this occasion  as you will have the Letter before you  His last written Letters   85 will not favour her wishes  Poor Lady  Can I forbear to pity her  And still the more is she to be pitied  as your brother s excellencies rise upon us   I besought my aunt to excuse me to the company   Sir Charles joined his friends  HIS friends indeed they are all   with a vivacity in his air and manner  which charmed every body  while the silly heart of your Harriet would not allow her to enter into company the whole night  Indeed it wanted the inducement of his presence  for  to every one s regret  he declined staying supper  yet my uncle put it to him—What  Sir  do you choose to sup at your inn  My uncle will have it  that Sir Charles looked an answer of displeasure for suffering him to go to it atall  My uncle is a good natured man  He will sometimes concede  when he is not convinced  and on every appearance which makes for his opinion  we are sure to hear of it   I shall have an opportunity to morrow morning early  This morning I might say  to send this long Letter by a neighbour  who is obliged to ride post to town on his own affairs   Had I not had this agreeable employment  rest  I am sure  would not have come near me  Your brother  I hope  has found it  Remember  I always mean to include my dear Lady L  in this correspondence  Any body else  but discretionally  My dear Ladies both  Adieu   HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XIX  Signor JERONYMO della PORRETTA  To Sir CHARLES GRANDISON    Bologna  Sunday  Sept  24  Oct  5   WE have at last  my Grandison  some hopes given us  that our dear Clementina will yield to our wishes     86 The General  with his Lady  made us a visit from Naples  on purpose to make a decisive effort  as he called it  and vowed that he would not return till he left her in a disposition to oblige us  The Bishop at one time brought the Patriarch to reason with her  who told her  that she ought not to think of the veil  unless her father and mother consented to her assuming it   Mrs  Beaumont was prevailed upon to favour us with her company  She declared for us  And on Thursday last Clementina was still harder set  Her Father  Mother  the General and his Lady  the Bishop  all came into my chamber  and sent for her  She came  Then did we all supplicate her to oblige us  The General was at first tenderly urgent  The Bishop besought her  The young Marchioness pressed her  Her Mother took her hand between both hers  and in silent tears could only sigh over it  And  lastly  my Father dropt down on one knee to her  My daughter  my child  said he  oblige me  Your Jeronymo could not refrain from tears   She fell on her knee—O my Father  said she  rise  or I shall die at your feet  Rise  my Father   Not  my dear  till you consent to oblige me   Grant me but a little time  my Father  my dear  my indulgent Father   The General thought he saw a flexibility which we had never before seen in her on this subject  and called upon her for her instant determination  Shall a Father kneel in vain  said he  Shall a Mother in weeping silence in vain entreat —Now  my sister  comply—or—He sternly stopt   Have patience with me  said she  but till the Chevalier s next Letters come  You expect them soon  Let me receive his next Letter  And putting her hand to her forehead—Rise  my Father  or I die at your feet   I thought the General pushed too hard  I begged that the next Letters might be waited for     87 Be it so  said my father  rising  and raising her
