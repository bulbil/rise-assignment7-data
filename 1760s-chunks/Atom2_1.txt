   unnumbered   THE HISTORY AND ADVENTURES OF AN ATOM   IN TWO VOLUMES   VOL  II   LONDON  Printed for ROBINSON and ROBERTS  No  25  in Pater noster Row  MDCCXLIX      unnumbered   THE History and Adventures OF AN ATOM   THE time was now come when Fortune  which had hitherto smiled upon the Chinese arms  resolved to turn tail to that vain glorious nation  and precisely at the same instant Taycho undertook to display his whole capacity in the management of the war  But before he assumed this province  it was necessary that he should establish a despotism in the council of Twenty eight  some members of which had still the presumption to offer their advice towards the    2 administration of affairs  This council being assembled by the Dairo s order  to deliberate upon the objects of the next campaign  the president began by asking the opinion of Taycho  who was the youngest member  upon which the orator made no articulate reply  but cried    Ba ba ba ba    The Dairo exclaimed   Boh    The Fatzman ejaculated the interjection   Pish    The Cuboy sat in silent astonishment  Gottomio swore the man was dumb  and hinted something of lunacy  Foksi rokhu shook his head  and Soosan sin o shrugged up his shoulders  At length  Fika kaka going round and kissing Taycho on the forehead    My dear boy  cried he  —Gad s curse  what s the matter  Do but open the sluices of your eloquence once more  my dear orator —let us have one simile—one dear simile  and then I shall die contented    3 —With respect to the operations of the campaign  don t you think   —Here he was interrupted with   Ka  ka  ka  ka     Heighday    cried the Cuboy  Ba ba ba  ka ka ka  that s the language of children     And children you shall be  exclaimed the orator   Here is a two penny trumpet for the amusement of the illustrious Got hama baba  a sword of gingerbread covered with gold leaf for the Fatzman  and a rattle for my lord Cuboy  I have  likewise  sugarplumbs for the rest of the council    So saying  he  without ceremony  advanced to the Dairo  and tied a scarf round the eyes of his imperial majesty  then he produced a number of padlocks  and sealed up the lips of every Quo in council  before they could recollect themselves from their first astonishment  The assembly broke up abruptly  and the   4 Dairo was conducted to his cabinet by the Fatzman and the Cuboy  which last endeavoured to divert the chagrin of his royal master  by blowing the trumpet and shaking the rattle in his ears  but Got hama ba ba could not be so easily appeased  He growled like an enraged bear  at the indignity which had been offered to him  and kicked the Cuboy before as well as behind  Mr  Orator Taycho was fain to come to an explanation  He assured the Dairo  it was necessary that his imperial majesty should remain in the dark  and that the whole council should be muzzled for a season  otherwise he could not accomplish the great things he had projected in favour of the farm of Yesso  He declared  that while his majesty remained blindfold  he would enjoy all his other senses in greater perfection  that his ears would be every   5 day regaled with the shouts of triumph  conveyed in notes of uncommon melody  and that the less quantity of animal spirits was expended in vision  the greater proportion would flow to his extremities  consequently  his pleasure would be more acute in his pedestrian exercitations upon the Cuboy and others whom he delighted to honour  He  therefore  exhorted him to undergo a total privation of eye sight  which was at best a troublesome faculty  that exposed mankind to a great variety of disagreeable spectacles  This was a proposal which the Dairo did not relish  on the contrary  he waxed exceedingly wroth  and told the orator he would rather enjoy one transient glance of the farm of Yesso  than the most exquisite delights that could be procured for all the other senses    To gratify your majesty with that ineffable pleasure   cried   6 Taycho  I have devoted myself  soul and body  and even reconciled contradictions  I have renounced all my former principles without forfeiting the influence which  by professing those principles  I had gained  I have obtained the most astonishing victories over common sense  and even refuted mathematical demonstration  The many headed Mob  which no former demagogue could ever tame  I have taught to fetch and to carry  to dance to my pipe  to bray to my tune  to swallow what I present without murmuring  to lick my feet when I am angry  and kiss the rod when I think proper to chastise it  I have done more  my liege  I have prepared a drench for it  which  like Lethe  washes away the remembrance of what is past  and takes away all sense of its own condition  I have swept away all the
