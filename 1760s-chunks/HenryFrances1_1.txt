              A SERIES of Genuine LETTERS BETWEEN HENRY AND FRANCES   Felices ter   ampliùs  Quos irrupta tenet copula  nec malis  Divulsus querimoniis   Supremâ citiùs solvet amor die     HOR  Lib  I  Od  13   VOL  I   LONDON  Printed for W  JOHNSTON  in St  Paul s Church Yard   MDCCLVII      unnumbered   HENRY TO THE EDITOR   SIR    I Send you by the Bearer a Collection of the Letters  which you complimented us so much upon  when you were last at my House  you should have had them before this  but my Clerk had not finished them  till Yesterday  I should have stiled him Secretary for the greater Air of the Thing   You will find several Chasms in the Series of our Correspondence  occasioned by our destroying  on both Sides  all the Letters which related to private History  or private Business  except a few which contained some Moral  or other Sentiment  and  in general  we neither of us preserved any of the other s Letters  which we did not think might   iv be an Entertainment to us to read over again  at some other Time  which was a Manner  I particularly  have very often employed myself in  for whenever I found my Resolution stagger  with Regard to our Marriage  or was offended at any of her Letters  which betrayed Impatience  Caprice  or Suspicion of my Love  I used to take out a Parcel from this Collection  sometimes more  or less  according to the Disorder in my Affection  and so read away  till I had swallowed the quantum Sufficit to restore the full Health of my Attachment to her   And indeed it would amuse you greatly to hear the many ingenious Arts I have made use of  for the first two or three Years of our Loves  to preserve my Constancy toward her  and I have actually  several Times  by the mere Force of Contemplation  worked myself into such an Enthusiasm about her Knowledge  Genius  and Understanding  that  as you will casually observe  in going through this Collection  I have wrote Latin  Philosophy  and Metaphisicks to her  during the Faroxisms of the Fit  by which uncommon Proceeding    v as I say in another Place    I reasoned myself into a real Passion for her   —I will tell you why —In Truth I could never have the least Enjoyment of Life  without the sweet Indulgence of fond Affections  and I always chose the most natural ones  All the Pleasures of Sense  the Beauties of Nature  and the Pomp of Grandeur  to me are tasteless  As to a sick Man  without a certain Tenderness of Sentiment  a Something  which as Horace expresses it  circum proecordia ludit  and gives a Relish to them all  I had quitted an Engagement of this Sort  about a Year before I entered into this  because there were several Reasons which made it highly improper to continue in it  and you cannot conceive what a wretched Vacuum of Life I passed during that Interval      I rather pass d than spent the Day   Before I could find out any Person whose Sense  or Taste was agreeable enough to fix my Attachments  I led an unsatisfactory Vague  dissipated kind of Life  during this Interregnum  my Passions and Affections all in perfect Anarchy  and  like the Frogs  petitioning   vi for a King  My Mind was listless  and my Time sauntered away without any Rule prescribed  or purposed End  At last  like the worn out Smile of the Patriarch s Dove  I found a resting Place  and grew timerous of hazarding again a Flight back into the troubled Ocean of Life   Many of the Letters are displaced  for want of Dates  and even those which have them  the Amanuensis has contrived to render Obscure  meerly by his Regularity  for as we corresponded for several Years  three Times a Week  without Intermission  by copying the Letters  according to their Dates  he has introduced this Confusion  that he has placed a Letter from Frances  suppose  because it was dated  for Instance  the Fourth of the Month  immediately succeeding the Date of one of mine  suppose of the Second or Third  whereas he should have gone on to one of her s dated the Sixth  for by not allowing the Interval of a Post  the latter could not be an Answer to the former  so that by taking them successively  rather than alternately  he has made several of them appear like   vii a Game of Cross Purposes  where the Answer never corresponds with the Question  except it be by Chance   However  I have endeavoured to set these Matters right  as well as I could  by numbering the Letters  which you are to attend to solely  and not to the s  but  doubtless several Mistakes have slipt my Attention  which I must leave to your own Observation to correct   In Return for all this Trouble  which I have taken on your Account  I
