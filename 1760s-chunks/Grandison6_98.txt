 the most indulgent guardian that ever poor Orphan had  to answer her by pen and ink  For whether you can forgive her or not  she will be equally incapable of bearing your goodness  or your displeasure▪ How weakly I express myself  I find I shall write worse to you  than to any body else  And why  Because I wish to write  best  But I have great awe  and no genius  I am a poor girl in every sense  as you shall hear by and by  I hope you won t be very angry with me  If you are  I shall be worse than poor—I shall be miserable   But to come before my guardian as a delinquent  when I have ambition enough to wish to shine in his eyes  if so it could have been —It is a very great mortification indeed —If you were to acquit me  I shall have had great punishment in that thought   But to open my troubled heart to you—Yet how shall I  I thought to tell it you yesterday  but for my   244 life I could not  Did you not observe me once  Sir  hanging upon the back of your chair  unable to stand in your sight  O how I felt my face glow —Then it was I thought to have spoken my mind  but you were so kind  so good to me  I could not  might I have had the world  You took my hand—I shall be very bold to repeat it  but am always so proud of your kind notice  that I can t help it  And you said  drawing me gently to you     Why keeps my Emily behind me  What can I do for my Emily  Tell me  child  Is there any thing I can do for my ward    Yet  tho  the occasion was so fair  I could not tell you  But I shall tire you  before I came to the point  to the fault  I should say  that has emboldened me to write     This then is the truth of the matter   My poor mother  Sir  is very good now  you know  You have taken from her all her cares about this world  She and her husband live together happily and elegantly  They want for nothing  and are grown quite religious  So that they have leisure to think of their Souls good  They make me cry for joy  whenever I go to them  They pray for you  and heap blessings upon you  and cry to think they ever offended you   But  Sir  I took it into my head  knowing it was a vast way for them to go from Soho to somewhere in Moorfields to hear the preacher they admire so much  and coach hire  and charities  and contributions  of one kind or other  for their minister has no establishment  and old debts paying off  that at present  tho  I believe they are frugal enough  they can t be much aforehand—So  thought I  shall I ride in my guardian s coach  at one time  in Lady G s at another  in Lady L s at another  tho  so much better able to walk than my poor mother  while she is growing into years  and when infirmities are coming on  and my guardian s example before me  so opening to one s heart —I ventured  therefore  unknown to my mother and   245 her husband  unknown to any body  by way of surprize  to bespeak a plain neat chariot  and agreed for a coachman  and a pair of horses  for I had about 130 guineas by me when I bespoke it  Out of this  thought I  which is my own money  without account  I shall be able to spare enough for the first half year s expences  after which  they will be in circumstances to keep it on  And as quarters come round  thought I  I will stint myself  and throw in something towards it  and then my poor mother and her husband can go to serve God  and take sometimes an airing  or so  where they please  and make an appearance in the world  as the mother of the girl who is intitled to so large a fortune  And I don t grudge Mr  O Hara  for he is vastly tender of my mother now  Which must be a great comfort to her  you know  Sir  now she is come to be sorry for past things  and apt to be very spiritless  when she looks back—Poor dear woman   But here  Sir  was the thing  Believing it became me  as Lady L  Lady G  and Mrs  Eleanor Grandison  intended to shew their respect to you  on a certain happy occasion  by new cloaths  to shew mine the same way  I went to the mercer s  and was so tempted by two patterns  that  not knowing which to choose  I bought of both  not thinking  at the time  of the bespoken chariot  To be sure I ought to have consulted Lady L  or Lady G   but  foolish creature as
