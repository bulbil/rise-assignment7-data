he himself who had called  if his housekeeper  that gentlewoman in whose care he left me  had not come to me from him  She is settled now in a lodging house  and Mr Faulkland  on his coming to London  went to her  to enquire where the child was  She told me he inquired civilly after me  and gave her a letter for me  which the good natured woman joyfully brought me  but it contained nothing but a bill of a hundred pounds  with two or    three lines  polite indeed  but not kind  to inform me it was for the child’s use  and I have heard nothing of him since   My mother told her  that as Mr Faulkland was returned again  probably to continue in England  she did not despair of his being brought to do her justice  especially as she must suppose the sight of the child had made an impression on him  She then  without ceremony  entered into a detail of my unhappy story  she was full of it  and being  as you know  of a very communicative temper  made no scruple to inform Miss Burchell of every particular  She seemed very much affected with the story  and grew red and pale by turns  especially at finding her aunt so deeply concerned in it  She exclaimed against her barbarity  reproached Mr Arnold for his injurious suspicions  and condoled obligingly with me on the wrongs I had received  and yet  my Cecilia  would you believe it  I thought I could discover  through all this  that Miss Burchell was not entirely free from doubt in regard to my innocence  This observation I gathered only from certain looks that she cast at me  as my mother related the passages  There are little minute touches on the countenance sometimes  which are so transient they can hardly be overtaken by the eye  and which  from the passions being strongly guarded that give rise to these emotions  are so slight  that a common observer cannot discover them at all  I am sure my mother did not  but my sensibility was particularly rouzed at her relating a story that I did not then wish to have divulged  and I was too much interested in the narrative  not to attend precisely to its effects on the hearer  I am neither angry with  nor surprized at  Miss Burchell  for her scepticism on this occasion  She loves Mr Faulkland  and had not herself the power to resist him  she knows he once loved me  and may fancy he does so still  nay  thinks perhaps I am not indifferent towards him  she is a stranger to my heart  but is convinced  that her aunt is base enough  first to ensnare to vice  and then to betray  Upon the whole  there is nothing unnatural in her suspicions  but I think they could not proceed from a virtuous mind   Upon Miss Burchell’s taking leave  my mother gave her a general invitation to come to her as often as she had leisure  telling her  she must not take it amiss if she did not return her visits  as her health would not permit her to go much abroad   Miss Burchell  it seems  has a house  not lodgings  in a retired street in Westminster  where she has been ever since she quitted her aunt  to whom she never discovered where she lived  Her fortune    enables her to appear very genteelly in the private manner she chuses to live  She goes but seldom into publick  and has but a narrow circle of acquaintance  Those are all of her own sex  and of the best character  and she has had the good fortune to preserve her reputation unsuspected  so that  I hope  she may yet retrieve her error by an advantageous match  should Mr Faulkland still continue averse to her   September 28  I have had a letter from Patty  she tells me  her master is returned home  and adds  ‘To be sure  that vile wicked wretch let him know you were gone ’ She says  he called for the two dear babes  and kissed them both  Patty carried the youngest to him in her arms  the other in her hand  and she says  he looked troubled  How came you not to follow your lady  Mrs Martha  said he  She replied  My Lady was willing  Sir  that I should stay to look after the children—And to be a spy upon my actions  I suppose  Is that not to be part of your employment too  Ah  Patty  Patty  Mrs Arnold had better have looked to her own conduct  Patty made no answer  but retired in tears  Every one in the house  she writes  is broken hearted  but that Mr Arnold is never at home  spending his whole time with Mrs Gerrarde  whom the girl  in the overflowings of her zeal for me  heartily execrates  She informed him  that I was gone to London  and purposed living with my mother  who was now there   October 7  I have just received a letter from Lady V——  She tells me she sent twice to Mr Arnold to dine with them  in order
