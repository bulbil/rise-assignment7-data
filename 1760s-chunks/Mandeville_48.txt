no possibility of keeping any of you without throwing the charms of dear variety into one s treatment of you  nothing cloys like continual sweets  a little acid is absolutely necessary        I am just come from giving Lady Julia some excellent advice on the subject of her passion for you  Really  my dear  said I  you are extremely absurd to blush and look foolish about loving so pretty a fellow as Harry Mandeville  handsome  well made  lively  elegant  and in the true classical stile           2 10       and approved by the connoisseurs  by Madame le Comtesse de       herself  whom I look upon to be the greatest judge of male merit on the face of the globe      It is not for loving him I am angry with you  but for entertaining so ridiculous a thought as that of marrying him  You have only one ratinoal step to take  marry Lord Melvin  who has title and fortune  requisites not to be dispensed with in a husband  and take Harry Mandeville for your Cecisbeo  The dear creature was immensely displeased  as you  who know the romantic turn of her imagination  will easily conceive        Oh  I had almost forgot  yes  indeed  you have great right to give yourself jealous airs  we have not heard of your coquetry with Miss Truman  My correspondent tells me  there is no doubt of its being a real passion on both sides  and          2 11       that the Truman family have been making private enquiries into your fortune  I shewed Lady Julia the letter  and you cannot conceive how prettily she blushed      But  to be grave  I am afraid you have nothing to fear from Lord Melvin  You must forgive my making use of this expression  for  as I see no possibility of surmounting the obstacles which oppose your union with Lady Julia  I am too much a friend to both  not to wish earnestly to break a connexion which has not a shadow of hope to support it        But a truce to this subject  which is not a pleasant one to either of us        I told you in my last I had something to say to you  As I am your confidente  you must consent to be mine  having a little present occasion for your services  You are to know  my dear Harry  that  with all          2 12       my coquetry  I am as much in love as yourself  and with almost as little prospect of success  this odious money is absolutely the bane of us true lovers  and always contrives to stand in our way      My dear spouse then  who in the whole course of our acquaintance did but one obliging thing  being kindly determined I should neither be happy with him nor without him  obligingly  though nobody knows this but myself and the Caro Bellville  made my jointure what it is  on condition I never married again  on observance of which condition  it was to be in my power to give the estate to whoever I pleased at my death  but  on a proof of my supposed future marriage  it was to go immediately to a niece of his  who at his death was in a convent in France  who is ignorant of this condition  and whose whole present fortune scarce amounts to fifteen hundred pounds  She is both in person and mind one of the          2 13       most lovely of women  and has an affection for me  which inclines me to think she would come into measures for my sake  which I shall make it her interest to acquiesce in for her own      Bellville s fortune is extremely moderate  and  if I marry him at present  I shall not add a shilling to it  his income will remain in statu quo  with the incumbrance of an indigent woman of quality  whose affairs are a little derang√©  and amongst whose virtues oeconomy was never one of the most observable  He would with transport marry me to morrow  even on these hard conditions  but how little should I deserve so generous a passion  if I suffered it to seduce him to his ruin  I have wrote to my niece to come to England  when I shall tell her my passion for Bellville  and propose to her a private agreement to divide the fortune  which will be forfeited to her on my marriage  and which it is in my          2 14       power by living single to deprive her of for ever  Incapable  however  of injustice  I have at all events made a will  dividing it equally between her and Bellville  if I die unmarried  I have a right to do this for the man I love  as
