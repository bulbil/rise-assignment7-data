for my rank could not fail of procuring me respect from the manufacturers of dedications  Though I was neither hungry nor thirsty  it was impossible not to sit down and drink a toast in such society   My presence appearing to be a restraint  Gentlemen  said I  it should seem that I have interrupted your conversation  resume it  or you drive me away  My learned friends  said Fabricio  were discussing the  Iphigenia  of Euripides  The bachelor  Melchior de Villégas  a clever man of the first rank in the republic of letters  resumed the topic by asking Don Jacinto de Romerate which was the point of interest in that tragedy  Don Jacinto ascribed it to the imminent danger of Iphigenia  The bachelor contended  offering to prove his proposition by all the evidence admissible at the bar of logic or criticism  that the danger of a trumpery girl had nothing to do with the real sympathy of that affecting piece  What has to do with it then  bawled the old licentiate Gabriel of Leon indignantly  It turns with the wind  replied the bachelor   The whole company burst into a shout of laughter at this assertion  which they were far from considering as serious  and I myself thought that Melchior had only launched it by way of adding the zest of wit to the severity of critical discussion  But I was out in my calculation respecting the character of that eminent scholar  he had not a grain of sprightliness or pleasantry in his whole composition  Laugh as you please  gentlemen  replied he  very coolly  I maintain that there is no circumstance but the wind  unless it be the weathercock  to interest  to strike  to rouse the passions of the spectator  Figure to yourselves a multitudinous army  assembled for the purpose of laying siege to Troy  take into account the eager haste of the officers and common men to carry their enterprise into execution  that they may return with their best legs foremost into Greece  where they have left everything most dear to them  their household gods  their wives and their children  all this while a mischievous wind from the wrong quarter keeps them port bound at Aulis  and  as it were  drives a nail into the very head of the expedition  so that till better weather  it was impossible to go and lay siege to Priam s town  Wind and weather therefore make up the interest of this tragedy  My good wishes are with the Greeks  my whole faculties are wrapped up in the success of their design  the sailing of their fleet is with me the only hinge of the fable  and I look at the danger of Iphigenia with somewhat of a self interested complacency  because by her death the winding up of the story into a brisk and favourable gale was likely to be accelerated   As soon as Villégas had finished his criticism  the laugh burst out more than ever  at his expense  Nunez was sly enough to side with him  that a fairer scope and broader mark might be presented to the shafts of malicious wit which were let fly from all the quarters in the shipman s card  at this poster of the sea and land  But the bachelor  eyeing them all with sublime indifference and supreme contempt  gave them to understand how low in the list of the ignorant and vulgar they ranked in his estimation  Every moment did I expect to see these vapouring spirits kindle into a blaze  and wage war against the hairy honours of each other s brainless skulls  but the joke was not carried to that length  they confined their hostilities to opprobrious epithets  and took their leave when they had eaten and drunk as much as they could get   After their departure  I asked Fabricio why he had separated himself from his treasurer  and whether they had quarrelled  Quarrelled  answered he  Heaven defend me from such a misfortune  I am on better terms than ever with Signor Don Bertrand  who gave his consent to my living apart from him  here therefore I receive my friends  and take my pleasure with them unmolested  You know very well that I am not of a temper to lay up treasures for those who are to come after me  and as it happens luckily  I am now in circumstances to give my little classical entertainments every day  I am delighted at it  my dear Nunez  replied I  and once more wish you joy on the success of your last tragedy  the great Lope  by his eight hundred dramatic pieces  never made a quarter of the money which you have got by the damnation of your  Count de Saldagna        BOOK THE TWELFTH     CH  I     Gil Blas sent to Toledo by the minister  The purpose of his journey and its success   For nearly a month his excellency had been saying to me every day  Santillane  the time is approaching  when I shall call your choicest powers of address into action  but the time that was coming never came  It is a long lane  however  where there is no turning  and his excellency at length spoke to me nearly as follows  They say that there is  in the company of comedians at Toledo
