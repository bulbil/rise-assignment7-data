 one fastened a claw in each cheek   of Mr  Snarle   and as his lady screamed out and clapped her hands   before her face  another fastened with four fangs on her best Brussels   head  and rent and tore away after a lamentable manner      The chambermaid and cook  hearing the uproar from the kitchen    were afraid to ascend  and still more afraid to stay below alone     they therefore crept softly and trembling up stairs  The torture   the cats were in did not permit them to be attached to any single   object  They had quitted Mr  and Mrs  Snarle  and now flew about   the parlour  smashing  dashing  and overturning piers  glasses  and   china  and whatever came in their way  as though it had been the   very palace of Pandemonium itself      George was again on his legs   his master and mistress had eloped   from the parlour  and met the two maids in the middle of the entry    They concluded  nem  con   to get as speedily as they might from   the ministers of darkness  and would willingly have escaped by   the street door   but  alas   this was not possible   one of the cats   guarded the pass  and  clinging to the great lock with all his   talons  growled and yelled in the dialect of twenty fiends  The   stairs  however  remained open  and up they would have rushed    but were so enfeebled by their fright that it could not be clone   in the way of a race      Having scaled as far as the dining room  they all entered and   bolted the door  and Mr  Snarle  opening a window  saw a large posse   of neighbours who had gathered below  What is the matter  sir     cried one of them   what is the meaning of this horrible uproar   and din  one would think that hell was empty  and that all its   inhabitants were come to keep carnival in your house      O  a ladder  a ladder   cries Mr  Snarle   deliver us  good people    good Christian people   a ladder  we beseech thee   a ladder  a   ladder   That  indeed  cries a wag  is the last good turn an honest   fellow has occasion for      The ladder was soon brought  and this panic stricken family were   helped down  and charitably conducted to the great inn of St  George   and the Dragon   where  with the help of sack whey  warm beds    and their remaining terrors  they got a hearty sweat  and were   somewhat composed by ten o clock next morning  They then got   up  and  having breakfasted on a pot of milled chocolate  they   hurried to London without adventuring to send to the haunted   mansion for any change of clothes or linen   for they would rather   have put on garments that had been dipped in the blood of Nessus    than have touched any thing in a house in which  with the furni    ture  plate  bedding  and other appurtenances  the devil  as they   conceived  had taken legal and full possession      In truth  there was scarce an inhabitant of the whole town of   Hampstead who differed in opinion on this head   insomuch that    as day after day began gradually to shut in  all people who had   occasion to pass by the dwelling of the late ejected Mr  Snarle    kept more and more aloof to the opposite side of the way  in   proportion as their apprehensions increased with the darkness  And   all things in the house remained as safe from depredation  as though   they had been guarded by a regiment of dragoons          142 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      The cats  in the mean time  lived plentifully and at free cost on   the cold meats which they found in the kitchen and larder   and    as the anguish of their tails was now no more remembered  they   kept undisturbed possession of their new acquisition  so that    during their residence  not even a mouse was stirring      As Mr  Fenton could not but be frequently apprised of these   prodigies and alarms that kept all Hampstead waking  and nightly   grouped every family into a single room   he compared  in his own   mind  the discomfiture and banishment of the unfortunate Snarle    with the circumstances of the provocation which Ned had received    He found that all answered  as well in point of time  as to Ned s   natural imluckiness and talents of invention
