had acquired in the turbulent parts of his reign  A spirit of liberty had now diffused itself from the incorporated towns thro  the whole mass of people  and ever after blazed forth at convenient seasons  afterwards whoever lost they were sure to be gainers  and  if in the contest they laid down their lives  and suffered all the hardships of war  yet they considered those calamities as trivial  if liberty were left improved and better secured to their posterity  I am   Dear Charles   c   LETTER XVI   AT the death of Henry III  Edward  his son and successor  was employed in the Holy wars  in which  though he gained nothing to the cause for which he fought  he acquired the character of an excellent general and an intrepid soldier  As he came to an undisputed throne  the opposite interests were proportionably feeble  The barons were exhausted by mutual dissensions  the clergy hated the Pope  and the people  as is evident from some insurrections at that time  were not much satisfied with the clergy  It was natural to suppose  that a politic and a conquering Prince would take this opportunity of giving the royal prerogative its former splendor and authority  Wise princes  however  are satisfied with moderate power  and Edward only laboured to be terrible to his enemies   The Welch had long enjoyed their own laws and customs  they were the only remains of the ancient Britons  and had still preserved their freedoms and their country uncontaminated from foreign   109 invasions  incapable  however  of resisting their enemies in the plain  their chief defence was in their inaccessible mountains  those natural bulwarks of their country  Whenever England was disturbed by factions at home  or its troops called off to wars abroad  the Welch would continually pour in their irregular troops  and lay the open country waste with ravage and desolation  No situation can be worse  than that of several petty principalities bordering upon each other  under different commanders  and pursuing different interests  Sensible of this  Edward led a powerful army against Lewellyn  their King  he had frequently before been chastised  obliged to beg peace  but was ever ready to seize an opportunity of making an advantageous war  Upon the approach of Edward  he took refuge upon the inaccessible mountains of Snowden  and there maintained his post without danger  The King of England  not discouraged by the difficulty of the situation  was resolved to invest his army  by securing all the avenues by which it might escape  Posted as Lewellyn was  he might certainly have harrassed his enemies without ever himself being destroyed  had not a trifling victory over a body of his besiegers induced him to come down and face the enemy upon more equal terms  A small advantage gained was interpreted as the beginning of the completion of Merlyn s prophecy  in which he was to possess the whole kingdom without a rival  Flattered with such expectations  he descends into the plain  without considering the inequality of his forces  the Welch and the English now  for the last time  drew up against each other  Lewellyn  after having performed all that courage and desperation could inspire  found himself  at last  fatally deceived    110 he was killed upon the field of battle  and his forces utterly routed  With him expired the distinction of his nation  it was soon after united to the kingdom of England  and made a principality  given to the eldest son of the crown  Foreign conquests might add to the glory  but the present added to the felicity of the kingdom  The Welch were now blended with their conquerors  and  in the revolution of a few ages  all national animosity was entirely forgotten   His native dominions being thus freed from every invader  the King soon had an opportunity to increase his power  by the dissension of his neighbours  The crown of Scotland  after the death of Alexander the Third  became destitute of any apparent heir  John Bruce and Robert Baliol divided all the suffrages of the kingdom  A civil war impended  and nothing but an umpire  appointed by mutual consent  could determine the contest without blood For this purpose  by a fatal mistake in the politics of the Scotch  Edward was chosen  accepted the mediation with pleasure  came to Norham  and  from being chosen umpire  claimed a superiority over the country  whose crown had been submitted to his decision  and asserted his right to the government  To wear the appearance of justice  however  after long deliberations  in which great care was taken to inculcate his right to the crown of Scotland  he fixed Baliol on the throne  less as King than as a vassal of England   The first step taken by Edward  after placing Baliol on the throne  was sufficient to convince the Scots of his intentions to stretch his superior prerogative to the utmost  A merchant of Gascoigne   111 presented a petition to him  implying  that Alexander  late King of Scotland  was indebted to him a certain sum  still unpaid  notwithstanding all his sollicitations to the new King for payment  Edward eagerly embraced this opportunity of exercising his new right  and summoned the King of Scotland to appear at Westminster  to
