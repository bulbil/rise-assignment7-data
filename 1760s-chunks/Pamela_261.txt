  dares not       You were a great many wenches  were you not  my dear  for that s a great   word with her   Yes  sir  said I  wenches and creatures out of number    and worse than all that  What  tell me  my dear  Sir  said I  I must not   have you angry with Lady Davers  while you are so good to me   tis all   nothing  only the trouble I have that I cannot be suffered to shew how   much I honoured her ladyship  as your sister       Well  said he  you need not be afraid to tell me  I must love her after   all  though I shall not be pleased with her on this occasion  I know   it is her love for me  though thus oddly expressed  that makes her so   uneasy  and  after all  she comes  I m sure  to be reconciled to me    though it must be through a good hearty quarrel first  for she can shew   a good deal of sunshine  but it must be always after a storm  and I ll   love her dearly  if she has not been  and will not be  too hard upon my   dearest       Mr  Peters said  Sir  you are very good  and very kind  I love to see   this complaisance to your sister  though she be in fault  so long as you   can shew it with so much justice to the sweetest innocence and merit   in the world  By all that s good  Mr  Peters  said he  I d present my   sister with a thousand pounds  if she would kindly take my dear Pamela   by the hand  and wish her joy  and call her sister   And yet I should be   unworthy of the dear creature that smiles upon me there  if it was not   principally for her sake  and the pleasure it would give her  that I say   this  for I will never be thoroughly reconciled to my sister till she   does  for I most sincerely think  as to myself  that my dear wife  there   she sits  does me more honour in her new relation  than she receives   from me       Sir  said I  I am overwhelmed with your goodness   And my eyes were   filled with tears of joy and gratitude  and all the company with one   voice blessed him  And Lady Jones was pleased to say  The behaviour of   you two happy ones  to each other  is the most edifying I ever knew  I   am always improved when I see you  How happy would every good lady be   with such a gentleman  and every good gentleman with such a lady   In   short  you seem made for one another       O madam  said I  you are so kind  so good to me  that I know not how to   thank you enough   Said she  You deserve more than I can express  for    to all that know your story  you are a matchless person  You are an   ornament to our sex and your virtue  though Mr  B     is so generous   as he is  has met with no more than its due reward  God long bless you   together       You are  said my dearest sir  very good to me  madam  I am sure  I have   taken liberties in my former life  that deserved not so much excellence    I have offended extremely  by trials glorious to my Pamela  but   disgraceful to me  against a virtue that I now consider as almost   sacred  and I shall not think I deserve her  till I can bring my   manners  my sentiments  and my actions  to a conformity with her own    In short  my Pamela  continued he  I want you to be nothing but what you   are  and have been  You cannot be better  and if you could  it would   be but filling me with despair to attain the awful heights of virtue at   which you have arrived  Perhaps  added the dear gentleman  the scene   I have beheld within these twelve hours  has made me more serious than   otherwise I should have been  but I ll assure you  before all this good   company  I speak the sentiments of my heart  and those not of this day   only       What a happy daughter is yours  O my dear father and mother  I owe it   all to God s grace  and to yours and my good lady s instructions  And to   these let me always look back with grateful acknowledgments
