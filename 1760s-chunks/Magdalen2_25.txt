not want for love  however I might be deficient in desert  That love  madam  instead of being extinguished by repulse  has  on the contrary  acquired additional force from opposition  and has driven me upon expedients in   147 which I have acquired nothing but disgrace—It has forced me to the meanness of keeping spies continually about your person  and your very woman  Sally  in whom you so confidently trusted—nay  madam  don t start—is nothing better than one of my instruments       As long however as you remained absolutely disengaged  I bore my own rejection  and even the shame which resulted from my unsuccessful attempt to carry you off before  with some tollerable share of temper  but the moment that cursed Harold was declared the happy man  I determined  let the consequence be what it would  to prevent the celebration of your union  and had not a rupture happened otherwise between you  I was resolved you never should be his  tho  I even got him pistoll d on his way   148 to the church—When you were sent up to town I followed you instantly  and established my interest so effectually with Mrs  Darnel  that she consented to my carrying you off from her house if there was no likelihood of my succeeding by any other means—There was no likelihood  on the contrary  lady Haversham set off to bring about a reconciliation between her family and your s  and the thing may be concluded done  for every body knows that woman is irresistable       Such  madam  is the history of your present captivity—Now to what must follow—After having gone these lengths to get you into my possession  it cannot be supposed that the power of man will ever prevail upon me to give you up—Nor  indeed  is it likely that any body will be able to discover   149 you  since Mrs  Darnel s own interest  as well as her reputation  must oblige her to account for your absence in a manner widely different from the truth—For these reasons  therefore  madam  I leave it to the determination of your own good sense  whether it will not be much better for you to think of uniting chearfully with me  than urge me to the disagreeable necessity of exerting a power  which  however unjustly it may be obtained  nevertheless places your destiny entirely in my hands—Believe me  Miss Mildmay  I love you with the most passionate extravagance  yet with the nicest sentiment of honour—If I did not intend honourably  what could prevent me  in a house where my will is as absolute as fate  from gratifying my inclination in any manner I might wish —But  I don t know how it is—culpable as I may have been with   150 regard to others  there is something about you which always excited my deepest veneration  and awes me at this instant  when I am in possession of your person  from entertaining any intention injurious to your character—I have talked a great deal  and shall now acquaint you with my final determination in a few words  From the purity of my views  madam  and the impossibility of your ever escaping from this house  I am in hopes that your generosity and your goodness will induce you to accept of the offer which I again repeat of my hand and fortune  Make a merit  therefore  madam  of necessity  and consent to my propositions with a good grace—for be assured your refusal shall excuse you nothing  as I have a clergyman already in the house  who is not to be terrified from his duty by screams  and will perform the necessary   151 ceremony were you even struggling in the pangs of death  and he himself to be destined the next moment to inevitable destruction     Inhuman  barbarous  remorseless villain —O  Harriot  don t you wonder at my patience in listening so tamely to so long and so audacious an address  But  indeed  my dear  the odious man terrified me to the last degree by the excess of his confidence  and  in proportion as it was proper for me to interrupt him  I found myself less and less able to break in upon his horrid harangue—But a motion which he made to seize my hand roused me instantly to an exertion of my spirits  and  spurning him from me with all the disdain I could possibly assume  yet still possessing my recollection  I spoke to him in the following manner    —Hear me  Hastings—Execrable monster hear me—Nor imagine  because   152 I have been infamously betrayed into your power  that any thing can fright away my reluctance to your person  or my hatred of your heart—Know then  that  should instant death be the consequence of my refusal  no force on earth shall ever make me yours—I always despised  I always detested you—and this last outrage or which you have been guilty  gives such an everlasting edge to my aversion  that  I if retain in the next world any sense of what has passed in this  I shall still consider you through all eternity with the same unremitting contempt  and the same unremitting detestation—What  Sir  do you suppose that the more reason I have for my abhorrence  the more I should relax in my resentments  or think that
