Sir Launcelot   presume to contend with me in argument    Your mouth is scarce shut   said the other   since you declared that a man was not to be punished for madness  because it was a distemper  Now I will maintain that cowardice is a distemper  as well as madness  for nobody would be afraid  if he could help it    There is more logic in that remark   resumed the knight   than I expected from your clod pate  Crabshaw  But I must explain the difference between cowardice and madness  Cowardice  though sometimes the effect of natural imbecility  is generally a prejudice of education  or bad habit contracted from misinformation  or misapprehension  and may certainly be cured by experience  and the exercise of reason  But this remedy cannot be applied in madness  which is a privation or disorder of reason itself     So is cowardice  as I m a living soul   exclaimed the squire   don t you say a man is frightened out of his senses  for my peart  measter  I can neither see nor hear  much less argufy  when I m in such a quandary  Wherefore  I do believe  odds bodikins  that cowardice and madness are both distempers  and differ no more than the hot and cold fits of an ague  When it teakes your honour  you re all heat  and fire  and fury  Lord bless us  but when it catches poor Tim  he s cold and dead hearted  he sheakes and shivers like an aspen leaf  that he does    In that case   answered the knight   I shall not punish you for the distemper which you cannot help  but for engaging in a service exposed to perils  when you knew your own infirmity  in the same manner as a man deserves punishment  who enlists himself for a soldier  while he labours under any secret disease    At that rate   said the squire   my bread is like to be rarely buttered o  both sides  i faith  But  I hope  as by the blessing of God I have run mad  so I shall in good time grow valiant  under your honour s precept and example    By this time a very disagreeable night was succeeded by a fair bright morning  and a market town appeared at the distance of three or four miles  when Crabshaw  having no longer the fear of hobgoblins before his eyes  and being moreover cheered by the sight of a place where he hoped to meet with comfortable entertainment  began to talk big  to expatiate on the folly of being afraid  and finally set all danger at defiance  when all of a sudden he was presented with an opportunity of putting in practice those new adopted maxims  In an opening between two lanes  they perceived a gentleman s coach stopped by two highwaymen on horseback  one of whom advanced to reconnoitre and keep the coast clear  while the other exacted contribution from the travellers in the coach  He who acted as sentinel  no sooner saw our adventurer appearing from the lane  than he rode up with a pistol in his hand  and ordered him to halt on pain of immediate death   To this peremptory mandate the knight made no other reply than charging him with such impetuosity  that he was unhorsed in a twinkling  and lay sprawling on the ground  seemingly sore bruised with his fall  Sir Launcelot  commanding Timothy to alight and secure the prisoner  couched his lance  and rode full speed at the other highwayman  who was not a little disturbed at sight of such an apparition  Nevertheless  he fired his pistol without effect  and  clapping spurs to his horse  fled away at full gallop  The knight pursued him with all the speed that Bronzomarte could exert  but the robber  being mounted on a swift hunter  kept him at a distance  and  after a chase of several miles  escaped through a wood so entangled with coppice  that Sir Launcelot thought proper to desist  He then  for the first time  recollected the situation in which he had left the other thief  and  remembering to have heard a female shriek  as he passed by the coach window  resolved to return with all expedition  that he might make a proffer of his service to the lady  according to the obligation of knight errantry  But he had lost his way  and after an hour s ride  during which he traversed many a field  and circled divers hedges  he found himself in the market town aforementioned  Here the first object that presented itself to his eyes was Crabshaw  on foot  surrounded by a mob  tearing his hair  stamping with his feet  and roaring out in manifest distraction   Show me the mayor  for the love of God  show me the mayor â€”O Gilbert  Gilbert  a murrain take thee  Gilbert  sure thou wast foaled for my destruction    From these exclamations  and the antique dress of the squire  the people  not without reason  concluded that the poor soul had lost his wits  and the beadle was just going to secure him  when the knight interposed
