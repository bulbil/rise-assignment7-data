 ashes doings  for a wedding  did I never hear of   She spoke a little   spitefully  I thought  and I returned no answer  I shall have enough to   do  I reckon  in a while  if I am to answer every one that will envy me       We went in to tea  and all that the ladies could prevail upon my master   for  was a dancing match before he left this county  But Miss Darnford   said  It should then be at their house  for  truly  if she might not be   at the wedding  she would be affronted  and come no more hither  till we   had been there       When they were gone  my master would have had my father stay till the   affair was over  but he begged he might set out as soon as it was light   in the morning  for  he said  my mother would be doubly uneasy at his   stay  and he burned with impatience to let her know all the happy things   that had befallen her daughter  When my master found him so desirous to   go  he called Mr  Thomas  and ordered him to get a particular bay horse   ready betimes in the morning  for my father  and a portmanteau  to put   his things in  and to attend him a day s journey  And if  said he  Mr    Andrews chooses it  see him safe to his own home  And  added he  since   that horse will serve you  Mr  Andrews  to ride backwards and forwards    to see us  when we go into Bedfordshire  I make you a present of it    with the accoutrements  And  seeing my father going to speak  he added    I won t be said nay  O how good was this       He also said a great many kind things at supper time  and gave him all   the papers he had of mine  but desired  when he and my mother had read   them  that he would return them to him again  And then he said  So   affectionate a father and daughter may  perhaps  be glad to be alone   together  therefore remember me to your good wife  and tell her  it   will not be long  I hope  before I see you together  on a visit to your   daughter  at my other house  and so I wish you good night  and a good   journey  if you go before I see you  And then he shook hands  and left   my dear father almost unable to speak  through the sense of his favours   and goodness       You may believe  my dear mother  how loath I was to part with my   good father  and he was also unwilling to part with me  but he was so   impatient to see you  and tell you the blessed tidings  with which his   heart overflowed  that I could hardly wish to detain him       Mrs  Jewkes brought two bottles of cherry brandy  and two of   cinnamon water  and some cake  and they were put up in the portmanteau    with my father s newly presented clothes  for he said  He would not    for any thing  be seen in them in his neighbourhood  till I was actually   known  by every body  to be married  nor would he lay out any part of   the twenty guineas till then neither  for fear of reflections  and   then he would consult me as to what he would buy  Well  said I  as you   please  my dear father  and I hope now we shall often have the pleasure   of hearing from one another  without needing any art or contrivances       He said  He would go to bed betimes  that he might be up as soon as it   was light  and so he took leave of me  and said  He would not love me    if I got up in the morning to see him go  which would but make us both   loath to part  and grieve us both all day       Mr  Thomas brought him a pair of boots  and told him  He would call him   up at peep of day  and put up every thing over night  and so I received   his blessing  and his prayers  and his kind promises of procuring the   same from you  my dear mother  and went up to my closet with a heavy   heart  and yet a half pleased one  if I may so say  for that  as he must   go  he was going to the best of wives  and with the best of tidings    But I begged he would not
