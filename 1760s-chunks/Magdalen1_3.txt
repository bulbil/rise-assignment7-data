 As you have heard so much about Miss Mildmay  Charles  I shall now proceed to do what I ought to have done somewhat sooner  that is  to give you a description of her person  and an account of her family —With regard to the first  she is to the full as tall as Mrs  Yates of Drury lane theatre  and has a sensibility of countenance  which we hardly ever meet where features are surprizingly regular—Her eyes are full  black  and languishing—her hair is as black as her eyes  and  from the present mode of dressing  appears to so much advantage  that  was she possessed of no other personal attraction  it would be almost sufficient to procure her a croud of admirers—Her forehead is finely open  and inconceivably white  and the two exquisite arches which are formed   12 by her brows  give such a dignity to her looks  that none but an impudent fellow like myself could possibly see her without an instant veneration—As to her mouth  I never saw any thing so ravishing—The resy ripeness of the lips  while it captivates the eye  receives additional beauties from the delicious poutingness of their formation  so that they rise with an equal charm both to the sight and touch  and seem no less calculated to excite emotion  than to reward it—Her teeth are remarkably even—but they have not that milky whiteness which I have observed in beauties of less eminence—They have to me  however  a colour which exceeds it—They have a certain pearliness so uncommonly clear  that you can in a manner see through them  and this I fancy is not only nearest to the genuine cast of nature  but the best designed also for duration  Miss Louisa is one of those delightfully formed   13 women  whom a Musselman in a phrensy of devotion would suppose to be a daughter of paradise—With the nicest harmony of proportion  there is a voluptuous fleshiness through her person  which keeps the imagination continually on fire  and would kindle the bosom of an anchorite into an instant flame of sensuality  Some people  when they talk of beauties  preposterously suppose that a fine woman must be scarcely fatter than the figure of Time over the monument of general Hargrave—for my own part I am fond of some flesh and blood about the bones Charles  and would even  of the two evils  rather pay my addresses to an Egyptian mummy than to an absolute skeleton  Miss Mildmay  however  so far from suffering the least disadvantage through this plenitude of person  acquires new charms from it  it gives a majesty to her air which bespeaks your veneration  and   14 blends all the elevation of dignity with all the tenderness of love —Add to this  that there is a something in the very tone of her voice which indicates the woman of condition  and gives you a supposition of rank before you receive the most distant account of her family   As to her family  it is not more antient than respectable—She reckons among her ancestors on the father s side  the great Sir Philip Sidney  and her mother is descended from a branch of the immortal Hampden  who so resolutely opposed the infamous oppressions of that rapacious tyrant Charles the First —Her father possesses  at present  a good four thousand pounds a year  her only brother has a company in the guards  and is universally esteemed a very fine gentleman     15Notwithstanding the advantages which Miss Mildmay derives from family and fortune  her education however has rather been ornamental than useful  and she is much better calculated for her present character of a toast  than for the necessary employment of mistress to a family—She speaks French and Italian—plays on the harpsicord and the guittar  and sings with an exquisite share of taste  though she has less body to her voice  than you would imagine from the melody and fulness of her tones in common conversation —These accomplishments  nevertheless  though they are generally as much as our young women of distinction possess now a days  are but very trifling matters when we come to enquire about a well informed mind  and a stability of principle —The men are not  in fact  such fools  my dear Melmoth  as the ladies may imagine  we love that they should understand   16 French and Italian  and we listen with pleasure when they either sing us a song  or favour us with a tune upon an instrument —Yet these are all but secondary considerations —After marriage  the ornamental parts of their education  like the beauties of their faces  very quickly lessen in our esteem—and nothing maintains its ground but sterling sense and real virtue —A woman  therefore  who studies to be the universal passion  is rather a dangerous character for a wife—Composed  in a great measure  of affectation and levity  her principal study is to please those who are labouring to destroy her  and the only person whom she declines to oblige is the unfortunate poor devil who is continually solicitous to promote her felicity —For these reasons  when I marry  I shall look out for a woman whose mind has been improved in some proportion with her person—If mere externals were able to   17 captivate me  I do not know a lady in the world whom I would sooner think of than Miss Mildmay—But this rage for admiration  which I fear absorbs all her faculties
