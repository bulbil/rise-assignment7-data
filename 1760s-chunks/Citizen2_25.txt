by experiment  others by minute enquiry  some arise from a knowledge of foreign climates  and others from an intimate study of our own  But there are few objects in comparison which present themselves to the inhabitant of a barbarous country  the game he hunts  or the transient cottage he builds  make up the chief objects of his concern  his curiosity therefore must be proportionably less  and if that is diminished  the reasoning faculty will be diminished in proportion   Besides  sensual enjoyment adds wings to curiosity  We consider few objects with ardent attention  but those which have some connection with our wishes  our pleasures  or our necessities  A desire of enjoyment first interests our passions in the pursuit  points out the object of investigation  and reason then comments where sense has led the way  An encrease in the number of our enjoyments therefore necessarily produces an encrease   74 of scientific research  but in countries where almost every enjoyment is wanting  reason there seems destitute of its great inspirer  and speculation is the business of fools when it becomes its own reward   The barbarous Siberian is too wise  therefore  to exhaust his time in quest of knowledge  which neither curiosity prompts  nor pleasure impells him to pursue  When told of the exact admeasurement of a degree upon the equator at Quito  he feels no pleasure in the account  when informed that such a discovery tends to promote navigation and commerce  he finds himself no way interested in either  A discovery which some have pursued at the hazard of their lives  affects him with neither astonishment nor pleasure  He is satisfied with thoroughly understanding the few objects which contribute to his own felicity  he knows the properest places where to lay the snare for the sable  and discerns the value of furrs with more than European sagacity  More extended knowledge would only serve to render him unhappy  it might lend a ray to shew him the misery of his situation  but could not guide him in his efforts to avoid it  Ignorance is the happiness of the poor   The misery of a being endowed with sentiments above its capacity of fruition  is most admirably described in one of the fables of Locman the Indian moralist   An elephant that had been peculiarly serviceable in fighting the battles of Wistnow  was ordered by the god to wish for whatever he thought proper  and the desire should be attended with immediate gratification  The elephant thanked his benefactor on bended knees    75 and desired to be endowed with the reason and the faculties of a man  Wistnow was sorry to hear the foolish request  and endeavoured to dissuade him from his misplaced ambition  but finding it to no purpose  gave him at last such a portion of wisdom as could correct even the Zendavesta of Zoroaster  The reasoning elephant went away rejoicing in his new acquisition  and though his body still retained its ancient form  he found his appetites and passions entirely altered  He first considered that it would not only be more comfortable  but also more becoming to wear cloaths  but unhappily he had no method of making them himself  nor had he the use of speech to demand them from others  and this was the first time he felt real anxiety  He soon perceived how much more elegantly men were fed than he  therefore he began to loath his usual food and longed for those delicacies which adorn the tables of princes  but here again he found it impossible to be satisfied  for though he could easily obtain flesh  yet he sound it impossible to dress it in any degree of perfection  In short  every pleasure that contributed to the felicity of mankind  served only to render him more miserable   as he found himself utterly deprived of the power of enjoyment  In this manner he led a repining  discontented life  detesting himself and displeased with his ill judged ambition  till at last his benefactor Wistnow  taking compassion on his forlorn situation  restored him to the ignorance and the happiness which he was originally formed to enjoy    No  my friend  to attempt to introduce the sciences into a nation of wandering barbarians  is only   76 to render them more miserable than even nature designed they should be  A life of simplicity is best fitted to a state of solitude   The great law giver of Russia attempted to improve the desolate inhabitants of Siberia  by sending among them some of the politest men of Europe  The consequence has shewn  that the country was as yet unfit to receive them  they languished for a time with a sort of exotic malady  every day degenerated from themselves  and at last  instead of rendering the country more polite  they conformed to the soil  and put on barbarity   No  my friend  in order to make the sciences useful in any country  it must first become populous  the inhabitant must go through the different stages of hunter  shepherd▪ and husbandman  then when property becomes valuable  and consequently gives cause for injustice  then when laws are appointed to repress injury  and secure possession  when men  by the sanction of those laws  become possessed of superfluity  when luxury is thus introduced and demands its continual supply then it is that the sciences become necessary and useful  the
