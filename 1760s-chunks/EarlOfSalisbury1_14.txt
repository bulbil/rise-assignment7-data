mayest  unopposed and unmolested  seek thy  native land  he wishes not to detain thee  nor regards the honour of  vanquishing Lord William as the least accession to his renown   My eyes  darted fiery indignation upon this messenger of abject fear   I defy  his power  said I  and scorn his friendship  I stay not here by his  permission  and without his permission will I depart  Thinks he that an  English Lord will fully his fair fame  and meanly steal away from  honourable danger  Bear back my defiance to the man who could entertain  so base a thought  Tell him I shall here wait  and wait with impatience  for the dawning of to morrow   The officer departed  my friend embraced  me with tears of joy  whilst I felt my heart chearful and dilated  and  from this overture derived an happy presage of victory     The morning of combat now appeared  nor did I wait the summons of my  friends  but impatient for the great decision  I prevented their  officious care and stood before them in arms  demanding to be conducted  to the lifts  These were prepared with every accustomed provision and  defence against fraud or treachery  And while I entered on one side  attended by Les Roches and his chosen companions  Count Savourè  appeared with an equal number of attendants on  the other  darting looks of deadly hate  rather than of manly valour  We  advanced towards each other  not with the courtesy of honourable rivals   but sullen and indignant  silent and disdainful  Our assistants having  first exacted the usual oaths  in which we disclaimed all unlawful  methods of defence  all fraudulent or magical resources  separated us  from each other  and pointed out our just stations  Here while our  horses pawed the ground  impatient to start forward  we waited the  signal of the trumpets  when suddenly our attendants burst into the  middle space  and called upon us to dismount  We obeyed  and as I  advanced towards the crowd of knights and squires  I soon discovered my  dear and reverend friend the Abbot  directing and commanding them with a  paternal authority  Two were ordered to take charge of our horses and  our weapons  whilst the father approached and invited us to a private  conference  Lord Mal leon   said he   hear me  and tremble at thy  presumption  tempt not the wrath of heaven  by exposing thyself to the  hazard of arms  in a cause which thou knowest is unjust  And do thou   Lord William  remember  that thou art for bidden to seek a brutal  revenge   The Count was just preparing to express his indignation at  such a bold and unexpected interruption  when the father surveying him  with a look of pity  mixed with some degree of scorn  proceeded thus    The wretch hired by thee to shed the blood of this unhappy Lord  tho   sorely wounded by Les Roches  was yet left with some remains of life   the peasants bore him to our house for relief  and ghostly comfort   There he expired  but not before his parting breath had publickly  declared the dreadful purpose—but I will not wound thy ears with the  horrid recital  Alas  thy shame is but too well known  If thou hast yet  the smallest remains of goodness  dare not by this combat to defy the  award of heaven  nor longer pursue this Lord with causeless hatred   My  rival now seemed to shrink before me  into all the meanness of disgrace   and abject baseness  whilst my triumph was more exalted  than  the most successful event of combat could have given  My eyes were  lighted up with indignation  but my heart disdained reproaches  Whilst I  embraced the reverend father  and freely submitted my arms to his  direction and controul  anguish  shame  remorse  and envy seemed to tear  the soul of Mal leon with their united tortures  tears  burst from him   not the gentle drops of penitence  but tears of vexation  of  disappointed and detected malice  Silent and trembling  he seemed  irresolute for some moments  then  in sullen and broken accents  he  just forced out   I will not—depart— I will not fight with thee—my  prisoner—yet I seek no ransom  retire from this island  and henceforth  avoid my fury  Here a loud shout prevented my reply  The soldiers of Les  Roches  by this time informed of the tidings which the Abbot brought   and which were no longer secret  hastened to receive me with their  gratulations  and whilst they accompanied me to their camp  the base  Count  followed by a silent and dejected party  marched away  and  covered his disgraced head in the recesses of his castle                       BOOK II              SECT  I     THE good old Knight could not suppress his exultation
