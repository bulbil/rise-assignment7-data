highest fermentation  together with  the want of that repose which calms and quiets the perturbation of the  spirits  had wrought him up to a pitch of real distraction  While he  uttered these delirious expressions  the tears ran down his cheeks  and  he underwent such agitation that the tender heart of the fair Fleming  was affected with his condition  and  while her own face was bedewed  with the streams of sympathy  she begged him  for Heaven s sake  to be  composed  and promised  for his satisfaction  to abate somewhat of the  rigour of her purpose  Consoled by this kind declaration  he recollected  himself  and  taking out his pencil  gave her his address  when she had  assured him  that he should hear from her in four and twenty hours  at  farthest  after their separation   Thus soothed  he regained the empire of himself  and  by degrees   recovered his serenity  But this was not the case with his Amanda  who   from this sample of his disposition  dreaded the impetuosity of his  youth  and was effectually deterred from entering into any engagements  that might subject her peace and reputation to the rash effects of  such a violent spirit  Though she was captivated by his person and  accomplishments  she had reflection enough to foresee  that the longer  she countenanced his passion  her own heart would be more and more  irretrievably engaged  and the quiet of her life the more exposed to  continual interruption  She therefore profited by these considerations   and a sense of religious honour  which helped her to withstand the  suggestions of inclination  and resolved to amuse her lover with  false hopes  until she should have it in her power to relinquish his  conversation  without running any risk of suffering by the inconsiderate  sallies of his love  It was with this view that she desired he would not  insist upon attending her to her mother s house  when they arrived at  Brussels  and he  cajoled by her artifice  took a formal leave of her   together with the other strangers  fixing his habitation at the inn to  which he and his fellow travellers had been directed  in the impatient  expectation of receiving a kind summons from her within the limited  time   Meanwhile  in order to divert his imagination  he went to see    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the stadthouse  park  and arsenal  took a superficial view of the  booksellers  cabinet of curiosities  and spent the evening at the  Italian opera  which was at that time exhibited for the entertainment  of Prince Charles of Lorraine  then governor of the Low Countries  In  short  the stated period was almost lapsed when Peregrine received a  letter to this purport           Sir   If you knew what violence I do my own heart  in       declaring  that I have withdrawn myself for ever from your       addresses  you would surely applaud the sacrifice I make to       virtue  and strive to imitate this example of self denial        Yes  sir  Heaven hath lent me grace to struggle with my guilty       passion  and henceforth to avoid the dangerous sight of him        who inspired it  I therefore conjure you  by the regard you       ought to have to the eternal welfare of us both  as well as by       the esteem and affection you profess  to war with your unruly       inclination  and desist from all attempts of frustrating the       laudable resolution I have made  Seek not to invade the peace       of one who loves you  to disturb the quiet of a family that       never did you wrong  and to alienate the thoughts of a weak       woman from a deserving man  who  by the most sacred claim        ought to have the full possession of her heart    This billet  without either date or subscription  banished all remains  of discretion from the mind of our hero  who ran instantly to the  landlord in all the ecstasy of madness  and demanded to see the  messenger who brought the letter on pain of putting his whole family to  the sword  The innkeeper  terrified by his looks and menaces  fell upon  his knees  protesting in the face of Heaven that he was utterly ignorant  and innocent of anything that could give him offence  and that the  billet was brought by a person whom he did not know  and who retired  immediately  saying it required no answer  He then gave utterance to his  fury in a thousand imprecations and invectives against the writer   whom he dishonoured with the appellations of a coquette  a jilt  an  adventurer  who  by means of a pimping
