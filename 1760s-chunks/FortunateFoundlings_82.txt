 it is perhaps  by being too much influenced by   your merits  that I find myself obliged to refuse what you require of   me   I cannot think  cried she  of rendering unhappy a person who so   much deserves to be blessed   and what but misery would attend a match   so unequal as yours would be with me   How would your kindred brook   it   How would the world confuse and ridicule the fondness of an   affection so ill placed   What would they say when they should hear the   nobly born  the rich  and the accomplished monsieur du Plessis  had   taken for his wife a maid obscurely defended  and with no other dowry   than her virtue   My very affection for you would  in the general   opinion  lose all its merit  and pass for sordid interest   I should be   looked upon as the bane of your glory   as one whose artifices had   ensnared you into a forgetfulness of what you owed to yourself and   family  and be despised and hated by all who have a regard for   you   This  monsieur  continued she  is what I cannot bear  neither for   your sake nor my own  and entreat you will no farther urge a suit  which   all manner of considerations forbid me to comply with       The firmness and resolution with which she uttered these words  threw   him into the most violent despair  and here might be seen the difference   between a sincere and counterfeited passion  the one is timid  fearful   of offending  and modest even to its own loss   the other presuming    bold  and regardless of the consequences  presses  in spight of   opposition  to its desired point       Louisa had too much penetration not to make this distinction  she saw   the truth of his affection in his grief  and that awe which deterred him   from expressing what he felt   she sympathized in all his pains  and for   every sigh his oppressed heart sent forth  her own wept tears of blood    yet not receding from the resolution she had formed  nothing could be   more truly moving than the scene between them       At length he ceased to mention marriage  but conjured her to consider   the snares which would be continually laid  by wicked and designing men    for one so young and beautiful   that she could go no where without   finding other Bellfleurs  and she might judge  by the danger she had   just now so narrowly escaped  of the probability of being involved again   in the same   he represented to her  in the most pathetic terms  that   her innocence could have no sure protection but in the arms of a   husband  or the walls of a convent  and on his knees beseeched her  for   the sake of that virtue which she so justly prized  since she would not   accept of him for the one  to permit him to place her in that other only   asylum for a person in her circumstances       Difficult was it for her to resist an argument  the reason of which she   was so well convinced of  and could offer nothing in contradiction to    but that she had a certain aversion in her nature to receive any   obligations from a man who had declared himself her lover  and who might   possibly hereafter presume upon the favours he had done her       It was in vain he complained of her unjust suspicion in this point    which  to remove  he protested to her that he would leave the choice of   the monastry wholly to herself  that in whatever part she thought would   be most agreeable  he would conduct her  and that  after she was   entered  he would not even attempt to see her thro  the grate  without   having first received her permission for his visit  Not all this was   sufficient to assure her scrupulous delicacy  she remained constant in   her determination  and all he could prevail on her  was leave to attend   her as far as Leghorn  to secure her from any second attempt the   injurious count might possibly make       After this they entered into some discourse of Melanthe  and whether it   would be proper for Louisa to write her an account of this affair  and   the count s perfidiousness  Monsieur du Plessis said  he thought that   the late usage she had received from that lady  deserved not she should   take any interest in her affairs  but it was not this that hindered   Louisa from doing it   the remembrance of the kindness she had once been   treated with by her  more than balanced  in her way of thinking  all the
