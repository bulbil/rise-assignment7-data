 with the other Letter  by the very next post  He says  he can deny me nothing  I wish I may not be too bold with him—As for Miss Grandison  she vows  that she will not let the good man rest till she gets him to communicate what he shall not absolutely declare to be a secret  to as three sisters  and my Lord L  If the first man  she says  could not resist one woman  how will the Doctor deal with three  not one of them behind hand with the first in curiosity  And all loving him  and whom he prosesses to esteem  You see  Lucy  that Miss Grandison has pretty well got up her spirits again   JUST now Miss Grandison has related to me a conversation that passed between my Lord and Lady L  herself  and Doctor Bartlett  In which the subject was their brother and me  The Ladies and my Lord are entirely in my interests  and regardful of my punctilio  They roundly told the Doctor  That  being extremely earnest to have their brother marry  they knew not the person living  whom they wished to call his wife preferably to Miss Byron  could they be sure  that I was absolutely disengaged  Now  Doctor  said Miss Grandison  tell us frankly  What is your opinion of our choice for a more than nominal sister   I will make no apologies  Lucy  for repeating all that was repeated to me of this conversation   Lord L  Ay  my good Doctor Bartlett  let us have your free opinion   Dr  B  Miss Byron  I pronounce upon knowledge  for she has more than once since I have been down  done me the honour of entering into very free and serious conversations with me  is one of the most excellent of women     323 And then he went on  praising me for ingenuousness  seriousness  chearfulness  and for other good qualities  which his partiality found out in me  And added  Would to heaven that she were neither more nor less than Lady Grandison   God bless him  thought I—Don t you join  my Lucy  to say  at this place  you who love me so dearly  God bless you  Doctor Bartlett   Lady L  Well  but  Doctor  you say that Miss Byron talks freely with you  cannot you gather from her  whether she is inclined to marriage  Whether she is absolutely disengaged  Lady D  made a proposal to her for Lord D   and insisted on an answer to this very question  That matter is gone off  As our guest  we would not have Miss Byron think us impertinent  She is very delicate  And as she is so amiably frank hearted  those things she chooses not to mention of her own accord  one would not  you know  officiously put to her   This was a little too much affected  Don t you think so  Lucy  The Doctor  it is evident by his answer  did   Dr  B  It is not likely that such a subject can arise between Miss Byron and me  And it is strange  methinks that Ladies calling each other sisters  should not be absolutely mistresses of this question   Lord L Very right  Doctor Bartlett  But Ladies will  in these points  take a compass before they explain themselves  A man of Doctor Bartlett s penetration and uprightness  Ladies  should not be treated with distance  We are of opinion  Doctor  that Miss Byron  supposing that she is absolutely disengaged  could make no difficulty to prefer my brother to all the men in the world  What think you   Dr  B  I have no doubt of it  She thinks herself under obligations to him  She is goodness itself  She must love goodness  Sir Charles s person  his vivacity  his address  his understanding—What woman would   324 not prefer him to all the men she ever saw  He has met with admirers among the Sex in every nation in which he has set his foot  Ah  Lucy    You  Ladies  must have seen  forgive me  bowing to each  that Miss Byron has a more than grateful respect for your brother   Miss Gr  We think so  Doctor  and wanted to know if you did  And so  as my Lord says  fetched a little compass about  which we should not have done to you  But you say  That my brother has had numbers of admirers—Pray  Doctor  is there any one Lady  We imagine there is  that he has preferred to another  in the different nations he has travelled through   Lord L  Ay  Doctor  we want to know this  and if you thought there were not  we should make no scruple to explain ourselves  as well to Miss Byron  as to my brother   Don t you long to know what answer the Doctor returned to this  Lucy  I was out of breath with impatience  when Miss Grandison repeated it to me   The Doctor hesitated—And at last said  I wish with all my heart  Miss Byron could be Lady Grandison
