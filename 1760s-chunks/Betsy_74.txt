 To compliment my   understanding   replied she  gaily   you should rather have told me I   was contemplating the mementos of great actions     You are at the wrong   end of the cathedral for that  Madam   resumed he   and I don t remember   to have heard anything extraordinary of the life of this great man    whose effigy makes so fine a figure here  except the favours he received   from the ladies         It were too much  then  to bestow them on him both alive and dead     cried she   therefore we will pass on to some other        Mr  Bloomacre had a great deal of wit and vivacity  nor were his two   companions deficient in either of these qualities  so that  between the   three  Miss Betsy was very agreeably entertained  They went round from   tomb to tomb  and the real characters  as well as epitaphs  some of   which are flattering enough  afforded a variety of observations  In   fine  the conversation was so pleasing to Miss Betsy  that she never   thought of going home till it grew too dark to examine either the   sculpture  or the inscriptions  so insensibly does time glide on  when   accompanied with satisfaction       But now ensued a mortification  which struck a damp on the sprightliness   of this young lady  she had sent away the chair which brought her  not   doubting but that there would be others about the church doors  She knew   not how difficult it was to procure such a vehicle in Westminster    especially on a Sunday  To add to her vexation  it rained very much  and   she was not in a habit fit to travel on foot in any weather  much less   in such as this       They went down into the cloisters  in order to find some person whom   they might send either for a coach or chair  for the gentlemen would   have been glad of such conveniences for themselves  as well as Miss   Betsy  they walked round and round several times  without hearing or   seeing any body  but  at last  a fellow  who used to be employed in   sweeping the church doors  offered his service to procure them what they   wanted  in case there was a possibility of doing it  they promised to   gratify him well for his pains  and he ran with all the speed he could    to do as he had said       The rain and wind increased to such a prodigious height  that scarce   was ever a more tempestuous evening  Almost a whole hour was elapsed    and the man not come back  so that they had reason to fear neither   coach nor chair was to be got  Miss Betsy began to grow extremely   impatient  the gentlemen endeavoured all they could to keep her in   a good humour   We have a good stone roof over our heads  Madam   said   one of them   and that at present shelters us from the inclemency of the   elements     Besides   cried another   the storm cannot last always  and   when it is a little abated  here are three of us  we will take you in   our arms by turns  and carry you home   All this would not make Miss   Betsy laugh  and she was in the utmost agitation of mind to think what   she should do  when  on a sudden  a door in that part of the cloister    which leads to Little Dean s Yard was opened  and a very young lady  not   exceeding eleven years of age  but very richly habited  came running   out  and taking Miss Betsy by the sleeve   Madam   said she   I beg to   speak with you   Miss Betsy was surprized  but  stepping some paces from   the gentleman  to hear what she had to say  the other drawing towards   the door  cried   Please  Madam  to come in here   On which she   followed  and the gentlemen stood about some four or five yards distant    Miss Betsy had no sooner reached the threshold  which had a step down   into the hall  and pulling her gently down  as if to communicate what   she had to say with the more privacy  than a footman  who stood behind   the door  immediately clapped it to  and put the chain across  as if he   apprehended some violence might be offered to it  Miss Betsy was in so   much consternation  that she was unable to speak one word  till the   young lady  who still had hold of her hand  said to her   You
