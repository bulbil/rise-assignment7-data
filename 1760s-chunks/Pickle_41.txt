the incautious conduct of  the conspirators  whom  by this time  success had rendered heedless and  indiscreet  was attended with the desired effect  He in a little time   detected Perry in a new plot  and by dint of a little chastisement   and a great many threats  extorted from him a confession of all  the contrivances in which he had been concerned  The commodore was  thunderstruck at the discovery  and so much incensed against Hatchway  for the part he had acted in the whole  that he deliberated with  himself  whether he should demand satisfaction with sword and pistol  or  dismiss him from the garrison  and renounce all friendship with him  at once  But he had been so long accustomed to Jack s company  that he  could not live without him  and upon more cool reflection  perceiving  that what he had done was rather the effect of wantonness than malice   which he himself would have laughed to see take place upon any  other person  he determined to devour his chagrin  and extended his  forgiveness even to Pipes  whom  in the first sally of his passion  he  had looked upon in a more criminal light than that of a simple mutineer   This determination was seconded by another  which he thought absolutely  necessary for his own repose  and in which his own interest  and that of  his nephew  concurred   Peregrine  who was now turned of twelve  had made such advances under  the instruction of Jennings  that he often disputed upon grammar  and  was sometimes thought to have the better in his contests  with the  parish priest  who  notwithstanding this acknowledged superiority of  his antagonist  did great justice to his genius which he assured Mr   Trunnion would be lost for want of cultivation  if the boy was not  immediately sent to prosecute his studies at some proper seminary of  learning   This maxim had been more than once inculcated upon the commodore by Mrs   Trunnion  who  over and above the deference she paid to the parson s  opinion  had a reason of her own for wishing to see the house clear  of Peregrine  at whose prying disposition she began to be very uneasy   Induced by these motives  which were joined by the solicitation of the  youth himself  who ardently longed to see a little more of the world   his uncle determined to send him forthwith to Winchester  under the  immediate care and inspection of a governor  to whom he allowed a very  handsome appointment for that purpose  This gentleman  whose name was  Mr  Jacob Jolter  had been school fellow with the parson of the parish   who recommended him to Mrs  Trunnion as a person of great worth and  learning  in every respect qualified for the office of a tutor  He  likewise added  by way of eulogium  that he was a man of exemplary  piety and particularly zealous for the honour of the church  of which  he was a member  having been many years in holy orders  though he did  not then exercise any function of the priesthood  Indeed  Mr  Jolter s  zeal was so exceedingly fervent  as  on some occasions  to get the  better of his discretion  for  being a high churchman and of consequence  a malcontent  his resentment was habituated into an insurmountable  prejudice against the present disposition of affairs  which  by  confounding the nation with the ministry  sometimes led him into  erroneous  not to say absurd calculations  otherwise  a man of good  morals  well versed in mathematics and school divinity  studies which    6 22 15  3 45 PM   had not at all contributed to sweeten and unbend the natural sourness  and severity of his complexion   This gentleman being destined to the charge of superintending Perry s  education  everything was prepared for their departure  and Tom Pipes   in consequence of his own petition  put into livery  and appointed  footman to the young squire  But  before they set out  the commodore  paid the compliment of communicating his design to Mr  Pickle  who  approved of the plan  though he durst not venture to see the boy  so  much was he intimidated by the remonstrances of his wife  whose aversion  to her first born became every day more inveterate and unaccountable   This unnatural caprice seemed to be supported by a consideration which   one would imagine  might have rather vanquished her disgust  Her second  son Gam  who was now in the fourth year of his age  had been rickety  from the cradle  and as remarkably unpromising in appearance as Perry  was agreeable in his person  As the deformity increased  the mother s  fondness was augmented  and the virulence of her hate against the other  son seemed to prevail in the same proportion   Far from allowing Perry to enjoy the common privileges of a child   she would not suffer him to approach his father s house  expressed  uneasiness whenever his name happened to be mentioned  sickened at his  praise  and in all respects
