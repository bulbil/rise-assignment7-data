my   sight  Sir  said I  I m going as fast as I can       But  indeed  my dear father and mother  my head was so giddy  and my   limbs trembled so  that I was forced to go holding by the wainscot all   the way with both my hands  and thought I should not have got to the   door  But when I did  as I hoped this would be my last interview with   this terrible hard hearted master  I turned about  and made a low   courtesy  and said  God bless you  sir  God bless you  Mr  Longman    and I went into the lobby leading to the great hall  and dropt into the   first chair  for I could get no farther a good while       I leave all these things to your reflection  my dear parents but I can   write no more  My poor heart s almost broken  Indeed it is  O when shall   I get away   Send me  good God  in safety  once more to my poor father s   peaceful cot   and there the worst that can happen will be joy in   perfection to what I now bear   O pity                                            Your distressed DAUGHTER                LETTER XXIX         MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I must write on  though I shall come so soon  for now I have hardly any   thing else to do  I have finished all that lay upon me  and only wait   the good time of setting out  Mrs  Jervis said  I must be low in pocket    for what I had laid out  and so would have presented me with two   guineas of her five  but I could not take them of her  because  poor   gentlewoman  she pays old debts for her children  that were extravagant    and wants them herself  This  though  was very good in her       I am sorry I shall have but little to bring with me  but I know you   won t  you are so good   and I will work the harder  when I come home    if I can get a little plain work  or any thing  to do  But all your   neighbourhood is so poor  that I fear I shall want work  except  may   be  dame Mumford can help me to something  from any good family she is   acquainted with       Here  what a sad thing it is  I have been brought up wrong  as matters   stand  For  you know  my good lady  now in heaven  loved singing and   dancing  and  as she would have it  I had a voice  she made me learn   both  and often and often has she made me sing her an innocent song  and   a good psalm too  and dance before her  And I must learn to flower and   draw too  and to work fine work with my needle  why  all this too I have   got pretty tolerably at my finger s end  as they say  and she used to   praise me  and was a good judge of such matters       Well now  what is all this to the purpose  as things have turned about       Why  no more nor less  than that I am like the grasshopper in the fable    which I have read of in my lady s book  as follows    See the Aesop s   Fables which have lately been selected and reformed from those of Sir R    L Estrange  and the most eminent mythologists         As the ants were airing their provisions one winter  a hungry   grasshopper  as suppose it was poor I  begged a charity of them  They   told him  That he should have wrought in summer  if he would not   have wanted in winter  Well  says the grasshopper  but I was not idle   neither  for I sung out the whole season  Nay  then  said they  you ll   e en do well to make a merry year of it  and dance in winter to the time   you sung in summer        So I shall make a fine figure with my singing and my dancing  when I   come home to you  Nay  I shall be unfit even for a May day holiday time    for these minuets  rigadoons  and French dances
