deprived of the pleasure of writing to you  as she intended  by Lady Anne Melville s dining with her  desires me to make her apologies       Allow me to say something for myself  and to share my joy with one who will  I am sure  so very sincerely sympathize with me in it       I could not have believed  my dear Bell  it had been so very easy a thing to be constant  I declare  but don t mention this  lest I should be laughed at  I have never felt the least inclination for any other woman  since I married your lovely friend       I now see a circle of beauties with the same indifference as a bed of snowdrops  no charms affect me but hers  the whole creation to me contains no other woman       I find her every day  every hour  more lovely  there is in my Lucy a mixture of modesty  delicacy  vivacity  innocence  and blushing sensibility  which add a thousand unspeakable graces to the most beautiful person the hand of nature ever formed       There is no describing her enchanting smile  the smile of unaffected  artless tenderness  How shall I paint to you the sweet involuntary glow of pleasure  the kindling fire of her eyes  when I approach  or those thousand little dear attentions of which love alone knows the value       I never  my dear girl  knew happiness till now  my tenderness is absolutely a species of idolatry  you cannot think what a slave this lovely girl has made me       As a proof of this  the little tyrant insists on my omitting a thousand civil things I had to say to you  and attending her and Lady Anne immediately to the opera  she bids me however tell you  she loves you passing the love of woman  at least of handsome women  who are not generally celebrated for their candor and good will to each other       Adieu  my dearest Bell   Yours   J  TEMPLE     LETTER CXXVII   127   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Silleri  April 18   INDEED      Is this that haughty  gallant  gay Lothario   That dear perfidious     Absolutely  my dear Temple  the sex ought never to forgive Lucy for daring to monopolize so very charming a fellow  I had some thoughts of a little badinage with you myself  if I should return soon to England  but I now give up the very idea         One thing I will  however  venture to say  that love Lucy as much as you please  you will never love her half so well as she deserves  which  let me tell you  is a great deal for one woman  especially  as you well observe  one handsome woman  to say of another       I am  however  not quite clear your idea is just  cattism  if I may be allowed the expression  seeming more likely to be the vice of those who are conscious of wanting themselves the dear power of pleasing       Handsome women ought to be  what I profess myself  who am however only pretty  too vain to be envious  and yet we see  I am afraid  too often  some little sparks of this mean passion between rival beauties       Impartially speaking  I believe the best natured women  and the most free from envy  are those who  without being very handsome  have that je ne sçai quoi  those nameless graces  which please even without beauty  and who therefore  finding more attention paid to them by men than their looking glass tells them they have a right to expect  are for that reason in constant good humor with themselves  and of course with every body else  whereas beauties  claiming universal empire  are at war with all who dispute their rights  that is  with half the sex       I am very good natured myself  but it is  perhaps  because  though a pretty woman  I am more agreable than handsome  and have an infinity of the je ne sçai quoi       A propos  my dear Temple  I am so pleased with what Montesquieu says on this subject  that I find it is not in my nature to resist translating and inserting it  you cannot then say I have sent you a letter in which there is nothing worth reading       I beg you will read this to the misses  for which you cannot fail of their thanks  and for this reason  there are perhaps a dozen women in the world who do not think themselves handsome  but I will venture to say  not one who does not think herself agreable  and that she has this nameless charm  this so much talked of I know not what  which is so much better than beauty  But to my Montesquieu        There is sometimes  both in persons and things  an invisible charm  a natural grace  which we cannot define  and which we are therefore obliged to call the je ne sçai quoi        It seems to me that
