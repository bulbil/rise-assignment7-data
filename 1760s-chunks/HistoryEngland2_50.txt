last  to discover his accomplices  He was the only person who suffered death upon this occasion  but several noblemen of high distinction were made prisoners upon suspicion  The Duke of Norfolk  the Bishop of Rochester  the Lord Orrery  and the Lord North and Grey were of this number  Of these all but the Bishop of Rochester cme off without punishment  the circumstances not being sufficient against them for conviction  A bill was brought into the house of commons against him  although a Peer  and though it met with some opposition  yet it was resolved by a great majority  that he should be deprived of his office and benefice  and banished the kingdom for ever  The Bishop made no defence in the lower house  reserving all his power to be exerted in the house of Lords  In that assembly he had many friends  his eloquence  politeness  and ingenuity had procured him many  and his cause being heard  a long and warm debate was   134 the consequence  As there was little against him but intercepted letters  which were written in cypher  the Earl Pawlet insisted on the danger and injustice of departing  in such cases  from the fixed rules of evidence  The Duke of Wharton having summed up the depositions  and shewn the insufficiency of them  concluded with saying  That let the consequences be what they would  he hoped the lustre of that house would be never tarnished  by condemning a man without evidence  The Lord Bathurst spoke also against the bill  observing  That if such extraordinary proceedings were countenanced  he saw nothing remaining for him and others to do  but to retire to their country houses  and there  if possible  quietly enjoy their estates within their own families  since the least correspondence  or intercepted letter  might be made criminal  Then turning to the Bishops  he said he could hardly account for the inveterate hatred and malice some persons bore the ingenious Bishop of Rochester  unless it was  that they were infatuated like the wild Americans  who sondly believe they inherit  not only the spoils  but even the abilities of any man they kill  The Earl of Strafford spoke on the same side  as also Lord Trevor  who observed  That if men were  in this unprecedented manner  proceeded against  without legal proof  in a short time the minister s favour would be the subject s only protection  but that for himself  no apprehension of what he might suffer  would deter him from doing his duty  He was answered by Lord Seafield  who endeavoured to shew  that the evidence which had been produced before them was sufficient to convince any reasonable man  and  in this  he was supported by the Duke of Argyle and Lord Lechmere  To these Lord Cowper replied  That the strongest argument urged in behalf of the bill  was necessity  but  for his part  he could see nothing that could justify such unprecedented  and   135 such dangerous proceedings  The other party  however  said little in answer  perhaps already sensible of a majority in their favour  The bill was passed against the Bishops  and several Lords entered their protest  Among the members of the house of commons  who had exerted themselves most strenuously in the Bishop s favour  was Doctor Friend  the celebrated physician  and he was now taken into custody on suspicion of treasonable practices  He was soon after  however  admitted to bail  his friend Doctor Mead becoming his security  In two days after the Bishop of Rochester embarked for banishment  accompanied with his daughter  and  on the same day that he landed at Calais  the famous Lord Bolingbroke arrived there  in his return to England  having obtained his Majesty s pardon  Upon which the Bishop  smiling  said    His Lordship and I are exchanged   In this manner the Bishop continued in exile and poverty till he died  though it may not be improper to observe  that Doctor Sacheverel left him  by will  five hundred pounds     Few transactions of importance happened during the remainder of this reign  the ministry were employed in making various and expensive negotiations  alliances  and treaties  covenants that are made without faith  and only observed from motives of interest or fear  The parliament made also some efforts to cheek the progress of vice and immorality  which now began to be diffused through every rank of life  luxury and profligacy had increased to a surprising degrce  nor were there any transactions to fill the  of history  except the mercenary schemes of vile projectors  or the tasteless profusion of new made opulence  The treaties lately concluded with Spain were again broken  perhaps by every party  admiral Hosier was sent to intercept the Spanish galleons from America  of which the Spaniards being apprized  remanded back their treasure  and the greatest   136 part of the English fleet  sent on this errand  was rendered  by the worms  entirely unfit for service  and the men were cut off by the unhealthy climate and long voyage  To retaliate this  the Spaniards undertook the siege of Gibraltar  and with similar success  New treaties were set on foot  France offered its mediation  and such a reconciliation as treaties could procure
