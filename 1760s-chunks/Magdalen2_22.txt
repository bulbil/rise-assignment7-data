I stay away from Sir William s  this is the day  and there is to be a prodigious croud of company there in the evening   My dear Mrs  Darnel  returned I  you quite distress me with your civility—You must on no condition stay from your friends  for I shall be quite miserable if I think I interfere in the   129 least with your engagements  I insist therefore absolutely on your going—and— Well  well   interrupted she   since you are so good I ll go —but depend upon it I shall be at home by eleven in the evening   The stating of an hour for her return occasioned a fresh dispute  but at last she set out  ordering a chariot  which she had kindly set up on my account the day or two before  notwithstanding the slenderness of her fortune  to come at twelve     As I was no way inclined to sleep I sat up in the back parlour  reading Clarissa Harlowe  and had just got into that passage where the vile Lovelace attempts the sanctity of her chamber at midnight  in the house of that detestable monster Sinclair  I don t know how it was  but I felt an instinctive kind of terror  when I came to this place—I could not go on with the story    130 and began to reflect  that  if any body was to break into our house I should be in a very dangerous situation—It was now almost one o clock  and not a single soul at home besides myself  and the cook  my Sally  and Mrs  Darnel s women had received leave to be at a dance with some servants in the neighbourhood  and the men were attending the chariot at Sir William Nicholson s to bring home their mistress—The time  the place  a remote street  bordering on the fields of Marybone  and  above all  the subject which I had been just reading  served to fill me with the strongest apprehensions  and I was going more than once to call the cook to sit with me  but that I was fearful the poor woman might be in a doze  from excessive fatigue  as she was house maid also  and therefore considered it cruel to disturb her—At last I heard somebody unlock the street door on the outside  and naturally   131 supposing it to be my Sally  and Mrs  Darnel s woman  who had now returned from their evening s entertainment  I rang the bell  when who should enter the room  to my inexpressible astonishment  but the villain Hastings  wrapped up in a large surtout  and carrying a dark lanthorn in his hand  which gleamed an inconceivable horror round the whole apartment—I screamed out  you may naturally imagine  at the sight of so unexpected and suspicious a visitor  and called the cook as loud as I could to come up stairs instantly  at the same time ringing the bell with the greatest violence  but whether she was too fast a sleep to hear me  or whether she was privy to the designs of her infamous mistress  I know not  this only I know  that she never once made her appearance  and that I was left entirely to the brutality of a wretch whom I   132 knew to be equally destitute of shame and of humanity   Finding myself thus barbarously betrayed  I assumed what spirits I could  and asked the midnight ruffian by what authority he had dared to break into my chamber at such an hour  in such a disguise  and threatened him with the utmost resentment  not only of the laws  but my family  He had now laid down his lanthorn  and unbuttoned his surtout  and was striving  by all the affectation of the deepest respect  to silence my exclamations  declaring that the happiness of his whole life depended upon me  and that nothing but the dictates of a desperate love could possibly urge him to break in thus violently on my repose—   Consider  ever beautiful Miss Mildmay   cried the monster on his knee   consider how long and how passionately   133 I have loved you—Recollect also  madam  that you are now thrown out by the inhumanity of a relentless father  and the perfidy of a profligate villain  upon an inhospitable world  which  so far from commiserating your situation  will even feast its malevolence with your distress—To guard you from the ruin which must inevitably burst upon your head in these melancholy circumstances  behold these faithful arms—My fortune and my soul are your s if you condescend to accept of them  and I shall think myself eternally obliged  if the solicitude which I manifest for your felicity may be able to influence the natural generosity of your temper to prevent the everlasting destruction of mine     As he pronounced this ridiculous speech with every seeming appearance   134 of sincerity  I suppressed the indignation which I should have otherwise discovered at his presumption in joining my father s name to so opprobrious an epithet  in hopes that I should be able to turn his own arts upon him  and draw some advantages from all this affectation of generosity and affection—I therefore told him  that he had taken an odd way to testify his regard for me  by breaking thus at midnight into my apartment  and that the mysterious
