have consumed with inward burnings had I not revealed   my flame   pardon  continued he  the boldness of a passion which knows   no bounds  and tho  I may not be so worthy of your love as the too happy   Horatio  I am certainly not less deserving of your pity       Surprize  and perhaps a mixture of secret satisfaction prevented her   from interrupting him during the first part of his discourse  but rage    at the mention of Horatio  forced from her this exclamation   has the   villain then betrayed me  cried she   No  madam  replied he  justice   obliges me to acquit him  tho  my rival   He had the misfortune  in   putting your billet into his pocket  to let it fall  I took it up unseen   by him   opened it  read it  and must confess  that all my generosity to   my friend was wholly swallowed up in my passion for you   I returned not   to him that kind declaration you were pleased to make him  and he is   ignorant of the blessing you intended for him   if the crime I have been   guilty of seem unpardonable in your eyes  command my death  I will   instantly obey you  for life would be a torment under your displeasure    and if  in my last moments  you vouchsafe some part of that softness to   the occasion of my fate  that you so lavishly bestowed on the fortunate   Horatio  I will bless the lovely mouth that dooms me to destruction       He pronounced all this with an emphasis  which made her not doubt the   power of her charms  and surveying him while he was speaking  found   enough in his person to compensate for the disappointment she had met   with from Horatio  besides  she reflected  that if what he had told her   concerning the dropping her letter  was a fiction  it was however an   ingenious one  and shewed his wit  as well as love  in bringing both   himself and friend off in so handsome a manner  She was infatuated with   the praises he gave her   the pathetic expressions he made use of    assured her of the ardency of his desires  and as she could not be   certain of being able to inspire Horatio with the same  she wisely chose   to accept the present offer  rather than wait for what might perhaps at   last deceive her expectations  She made  however  no immediate answer    but her eyes told him she was far from being displeased with what he had   said  and gave him courage to take up one of her hands and kiss it  with   an eagerness which confirmed his protestations       At last   Well  Mullern  said she  looking languishingly on him  since   chance has made you acquainted with my foible  I think I must bribe you   to secrecy  by forgiving the liberties you take with me   and if I were   convinced you really love me as well as you pretend  might indulge you   yet farther   An unaccountable caprice indeed swayed me in favour of   Horatio  but I am now half inclinable to believe you are more deserving   my regard   but rise  continued she  I will hear nothing from you while   in that posture       Mullern  who was no less bold in love than war  immediately obeyed her    and testified his gratitude for her condescention  by giving a sudden   spring and snatching her to his breast  pressed her in so arduous a   manner  that she would have been incapable of resisting  even tho  she   had an inclination to do so  but she  no less transported than himself    returned endearment for endearment  and not only permitted  but assisted   all his raptures   absolutely forgot Horatio  as well as all sense of   her own shame  and yielded him a full enjoyment without even an   affectation of repugnance       Both parties  in fine  were perfectly satisfied with each other  and   having mutually sworn a thousand oaths of fidelity which neither of   them  it is probable  had any intention to keep  Mullern took upon   himself the care of continuing to entertain her in private as often as   she came to the prison  and in return she made him a present of a purse   of gold  after which they passed into the outer room to prevent censures   on their staying too long together       On their return they found Horatio with the other gentlemen  Abandoned   as Mattakesa was  she could not keep herself from blushing a little at   sight of him  but soon recovering herself by the help of her natural   audacity
