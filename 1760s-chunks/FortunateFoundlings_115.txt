had not the least notion what it meant  but   Mullern  Horatio  and that friend to whom he had shewn the letter of   Mattakesa  had some conjecture of the truth  and presently imagined that   lady had been the incendiary to kindle the flame of jealousy in the   prince s breast  The affair  however  was of so nice a nature  that they   knew not how to vindicate Edella without making her seem more guilty  so   contented themselves with joining with the others  in protesting they   knew of no one among them who could boast of receiving any greater   favours from her than his fellows  but that what she did was instigated   merely by compassion  since she had never seen  or knew who any of them   were  till after she had moved the governor in their behalf   they   acknowledged she had been so good as to come sometimes to the prison  in   order to see if those she entrusted with her bounty had been faithful in   the delivery of it  but that she never made the least difference between   them  and never had conversation with any one of them that was not in   the presence of them all  Mullern could not forbear adding to this  that   he doubted not but the persons who had incensed his highness into   groundless surmises  were also the same who had hindered her  by some   false insinuations or other  from continuing the allowance her charity   allowed them  and for the want of which they had since been near   perishing       Prince Menzikoff listened attentively to what each said  and with no   less earnestness fixed his eyes on the face of every one as they   spoke   Finding they had done  he was about giving some orders on their   account  when the keeper of the prison came hastily into the room  and   having entreated pardon for the interruption  presented a letter to the   prince  directed for brigadier Mullern  and brought  he said  just after   the prisoners were carried out       Menzikoff commended his zeal in receiving and bringing it to him  as it   might possibly serve to give some light to the affair he was examining       Having perused it  he demanded which of them was named Mullern  I am    replied the brave Swede  and neither fear  nor am ashamed of any thing   under that name       Hear then what is wrote to you by a lady  resumed the prince  with a   countenance more serene than he had worn since their being brought   before him  and presently read with a very audible voice these words           That you have been so long without   seeing me  my dear Mullern  or hearing   from me  is not owing to any decrease in my   affection  but to the necessity of my affairs   if   you have any regard for me remaining  I   conjure you  if ever you are asked any questions   concerning the frequent visits I have made   you  to say I was sent by Edella  and that I was   no more than her emissary in the assistance you   received from me   add also  that you have   reason to believe her charity was excited by   her liking one of your company   mention   who you think fit  but I believe Horatio  as   the youngest and most handsome  will be the   most likely to gain credit to what you say      Depend upon it  that if you execute this commission   artfully  I will recompence it by procuring   your liberty   nor need you have any   scruples concerning it  for no person will be   prejudiced by it  and the reputation preserved   of       Yours        MATTAKESA           I suppose  said the prince  as soon as he had done reading  turning to   Horatio  you are the person mentioned in the letter  Tho  I neither   desire nor deserve the epithets given me there my lord  replied he  yet   I will not deny but I am called Horatio       Well  resumed the prince with a half smile  I am so well pleased with   the conviction this letter has given me  that I shall retain no   resentment against the malicious author of it       He then ordered Mullern to be taken from the rack  which had never been   strained  nor had he any intention  as he now assured him  to put him to   the torture  but only to intimidate him  being resolved to make use of   every method he could think of for the full discovery of
