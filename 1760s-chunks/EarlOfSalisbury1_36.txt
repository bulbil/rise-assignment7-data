Oswald  and scarcely had messengers been  dispatched to inform Lord Raymond of this event  and the arrival of the  two strangers  when they learned the situation of the Countess  and were  directed to conduct her back to her apartnient  A second message  was instantly dispatched to their Lord  with this alarming intelligence   and  ere long  he appeared in view  goating the sides of his courser   whilst a few attendants stretched after him at some distance  in vain  striving to keep pace with his impatience  He entered the castle with  looks wild and disordered  and flew towards the apartment of the  Countess  but was stopped by some of her maidens  who were directed to  inform him that her present weakness and malady required rest  and could  not permit him to approach  He called for Elinor  who appeared before  him trembling  He sternly reproached her with presumptuous treachery  and disobedience  and demanded to know where her brother lay concealed   whither and for what purpose he had fled  Elinor still trembled and was  silent  Raymond thundered out terrible denunciations of vengeance  when  the Countess who heard his rage from the adjacent chamber  suddenly  sent to desire his presence  He rushed in with glaring looks of fury and  distraction  when  rising her head gently from her pillow  Ela thus  accosted him         Proud Lord  thy power is at an end  I am above thy oppression  I am  hastening to the mansions of peace  My son is safe  Yes  that honest man  has conveyed him to the neighbouring monastery  whose hallowed  sanctuary shall protect him from thee and thy minions  Thither thou  canst not force thy way  Thence  shall our wrongs be boldly and loudly  echoed thro  the land  and soon shall the noble friends of Salisbury  appear  to end thy usurpation  to chastise thy ministers of cruelty  and  to revenge the injuries done even to the meanest of Ela s attendants         — Thus speaking  she turned away with marks of scorn  again reclined her  head  nor deigned the least regard to his extravagant expressions of  vexation and furptize  He burst away in mad disorder and confusion  he  ranged wildly through the galleries  started  and endeavoured to collect  his thoughts and allay his passions  curst his own rash folly which  had  tempted him abroad  afforded this opportunity of detecting and defeating  his designs and threatened to cover him with shame and scorn  Then again  he rushed forward in an agony of rage and vexation  when one of the  messengers from Hubert approached with respectful obeisance  and obliged  him to assume some appearance of ease and composure   From him Lord Raymond learned the several particulars  which his  companion had before imparted to Oswald  But as this man was admitted  more intimately into the confidence of Hubert  he was farther directed  to declare  that the friends to the house of Salisbury began to express  their fears  that the long protracted residence of Raymond in this  castle  without any intelligence being received of the dispositions of  the Countess  any assurances of her consent to accept his hand  had  raised jealousies and suspicions in their minds  and that Hubert  therefore urged him to renew his efforts  if he still continued  unsuccessful  to improve those rumours about Earl William  into full and  certain assurances of his death  and with all possible speed and  earnestness to hasten on his own nuptials with the Countess  He thanked  the stranger  and commended his fidelity  he requested him to retire  for a while  promising to confer more fully with him at better leisure   then resigned himself to the disorder of his mind  which this  information and advice served to inflame and irritate  He now saw the  misguided course which he had pursued  He formed the most dreadful  presages of that dishonour which must attend his violence and unlawful  oppressión  His passion for the Countess was still alive  and for a  while he seemed resolved once more to try the gentle arts of love and  tenderness  but the recollection of her rigour and disdain  her wrongs  and sufferings  in a moment dashed all his hopes  and he resolved to  fall at her feet  to implore her pardon  and to retire from her castle   For this purpose he again approached her apartment  and demanded  admittance  Elinor appeared before  him  kneeled  and with many tears implored his indulgence for the weak  state of her unhappy Lady   Heaven only knows   said the kind  attendant         whether she hath yet a few days of life remaining  Let not thy noble  nature afflict the already too severely afflicted  Let her die in peace   or if she may yet live  break not on that tranquillity which may be the  happy means of restoring her   Wretch         cried Raymond  wildly surveying her  as she humbled herself before him
