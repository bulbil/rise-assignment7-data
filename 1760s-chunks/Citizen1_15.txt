here  cried I—Yes  with every mother s son of them  replied he  except he happened to be born a mandarine  If he has much money  he may buy reputation from your book answerers  as well as a monument from the guardians of the temple   But are there not some men of distinguished taste  as in China  who are willing to patronize men of merit and soften the rancour of malevolent dulness   I own there are many  replied the man in black  but  alas  Sir  the book answerers croud about them  and call themselves the writers of books  and the patron is too indolent  to distinguish  thus poets are kept at a distance  while their enemies eat up all their rewards at the mandarine s table   Leaving this part of the temple  we made up to an iron gate  through which my companion told me we were to pass in order to see the monuments of the kings  Accordingly I marched up without further ceremony  and was going to enter  when a person who held the gate in his hand  told me I must pay first  I was surprised at such a demand    46 and asked the man whether the people of England kept a shew  Whether the paltry sum he demanded was not a national reproach  Whether it was not more to the honour of the country to let their magnificence or their antiquities be openly seen  than thus meanly to tax a curiosity which tended to their own honour  As for your questions  replied the gate keeper  to be sure they may be very right  because I don t understand them  but as for that there three pence  I farm it from one  who rents it from another  who hires it from a third  who leases it from the guardians of the temple  and we all must live  I expected upon paying here to see something extraordinary  since what I had seen for nothing filled me with so much surprize  but in this I was disappointed  there was little more within than black coffins  rusty armour  tatter d standards  and some few slovenly figures in wax  I was sorry I had paid  but I comforted myself by considering it would be my last payment  A person attended us  who  without once blushing  told an hundred lies  he talked of a lady who died by pricking her finger  of a king with a golden head  and twenty such pieces of absurdity  Look ye there  gentlemen  says he  pointing to an old oak chair  there s a curiosity for ye  in that chair the kings of England were crowned  you see also a stone underneath  and that stone is Jacob s pillow  I could see no curiosity either in the oak chair or the stone  could I  indeed  behold one of the old kings of England seated in this  or Jacob s head laid upon the other  there might be something curious in the sight  but in the present case  there was no more reason for my surprize than if I should pick a stone from their streets  and call   47 it a curiosity  merely because one of their kings happened to tread upon it as he passed in a procession   From hence our conductor led us through several dark walks and winding ways  uttering lies  talking to himself  and flourishing a wand which he held in his hand  He reminded me of the black magicians of Kobi  After we had been almost fatigued with a variety of objects  he  at last  desired me to consider attentively a certain suit of armour  which seemed to shew nothing remarkable  This armour  said he  belonged to general Monk  Very surprising  that a general should wear armour  And pray  added he  observe this cap  this is general Monk s cap  Very strange  indeed  very strange  that a general should have a cap also  Pray friend  what might this cap have cost originally  That  Sir  says he  I don t know  but this cap is all the wages I have for my trouble  A very small recompence  truly  said I  Not so very small  replied he  for every gentleman puts some money into it  and I spend the money  What  more money  still more money  Every gentleman gives something  sir  I ll give thee nothing  returned I  the guardians of the temple should pay you your wages  friend  and not permit you to squeeze thus from every spectator  When we pay our money at the door to see a shew  we never give more as we are going out  Sure the guardians of the temple can never think they get enough  Shew me the gate  if I stay longer  I may probably meet with more of those ecclesiastical beggars   Thus leaving the temple precipitately  I returned to my lodgings  in order to ruminate over what   48 was great  and to despise what was mean in thy occurrences of the day   LETTER XIV  From the same   I WAS some days ago agreeably surprised by a message from a lady of distinction  who sent me word  that she
