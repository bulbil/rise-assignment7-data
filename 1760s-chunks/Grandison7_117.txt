greatness of mind in such things as all men may  needs not doubt but he shall be respected by most  and may be sufficiently easy  tho  he is despised by some  He will still have the satisfaction of reflecting  that the Laws of all nations are on his side   a  and   303 only the usurped authority of a silly modern custom against him  that on many occasions  worthy men in all ages  have patiently suffered false disgrace for adhering to their duty  that the true bravery is to adhere to all duties under all disadvantages  and that refusing a duel is a duty to ourselves  our fellow creatures  and our MAKER  And whoever acts on these principles  the more reproach he undergoes for it  father than be driven  like a coward  by the scoffs of his fellow subjects  to rebel against the SOVEREIGN of the Universe  will have the more delightful consciousness of a strong inward principle of piety and virtue  and the more distinguished reward from the final Judge of all  who alone disposes of that Honour which shall never fade   It has been said in b half of many modern fictitious pieces  in which authors have given success  and happiness  as it is called  to their heroes of vicious  if not of profligate  characters  that they have exhibited Human Nature as it is  Its corruption may  indeed  be exhibited in the faulty character  but need pictures of this be held out in books  Is not vice crowned with success  triumphant  and rewarded  and perhaps set off with wit and spirit  a dangerous representation  And is it not made even more dangerous by the hasty reformation introduced  in contradiction to all probability  for the sake of patching up what is called a happy ending   The God of Nature intended not Human Nature for a vile and contemptible thing  And many are the instances  in every age  of those whom He enables  amidst all the frailties of mortality  to do it honour  Still the best performances of human creatures will be imperfect  but  such as they are  it is surely both delightful and instructive to dwell sometimes on this bright side of things  To show  by a series of facts in common life  what a degree of excellence may be   304 attained and preserved amidst all the infection of fashionable vice and folly   Sir CHARLES GRANDISON is therefore in the general tenor of his principles and conduct  tho  exerted in peculiarities of circumstances that cannot always be accommodated to particular imitation  proposed for an Example  and  in offering him as such were his character still more perfect than it is presumed to be  the Editor is supported by an eminent Divine of our own contry      There is no manner of inconvenience in having a pattern propounded to us of so great perfection  as is above our reach to attain to  and there may be great advantages in it  The way to excel in any kind  is  optima quaeque exempla ad imitandum proponere  to propose the brightest and most perfect Examples to our imitation  No man can write after too perfect and good a copy  and tho  he can never reach the perfection of it  yet he is like to learn more  than by one less perfect  He that aims at the heavens  which yet he is sure to come short of  is like to shoot higher than he that aims at a mark within his reach        Besides  that the excellency of the pattern  as it leaves room for continual improvement  so it kindles ambition  and makes men strain and contend to the utmost to do better  And  tho  he can never hope to equal the Example before him  yet he will endeavour to come as near it as he can  So that a perfect pattern is no hindrance  but an advantage rather  to our improvement in any kind    Tillotson  Vol  II  Serm  LVII  p  577       305  INDEX Historical and Characteristical TO THE Seven VOLUMES of this WORK   A few only of the SENTIMENTS with which this Work abounds  are inserted in this INDEX  There is only room to refer to the rest by Figures  under the proper Heads  as in Advice to Women  Anger   c    • A   • ABsence of Lovers  vol  iii  p  274  Promotive of a cure for Love  vii  226    • ADAM  his complaisance to Eve  according to Milton  animadverted upon  v  207    • ADDISON  Mr  the fair Sex under great obligations to him  iii  150    • Address to men of sense in the gay world  iii  200 to 207    • Adventures of Love  women have often more courage in them than men  vi  265    • Adversity is the trial of principle  v  67    • Advice or Cautions to women  i  13  17  19  26 to 29  37  82  151  300  302   ii  11  12
