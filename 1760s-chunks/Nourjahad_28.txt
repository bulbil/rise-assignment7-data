penalty became death   Page  192  They charged me with having distributed money for evil purposes  amongst persons disaffected to the state  and with having beat and abused those officers who first detected me  In vain did I offer all the pleas that truth could suggest  my enemies  exasperated at losing the sum which they hoped to have extorted from you  swore to the facts of which I was accused  and the rigid sultan condemned me to death  What thy fate is to be  I know not  but since it is thy misfortune to be doomed to perpetual life  better purchase thy freedom on any terms  than be condemned to languish for years in a prison  for such probably will be thy lot     Page  193  Oh that I could die with thee  said ← Nourjahad →   miserable that I am  thus to be deprived of thy counsel and friendship  at a time when I so much stood in need of them  but wherefore  my friend  why should we submit to the tyranny of the sultan  though thou art condemned  there may yet be found means to deliver thee  The keeper of the prison will gladly set a price on thy liberty  a hundred thousand pieces of gold shall be thy ransom  and I shall think myself rich by the purchase  And what is to become of thee  replied Cozro  I will buy my own freedom at the same rate  answered ← Nourjahad →   and we will both fly from Ormuz together  And leave  Page  194  your treasures behind you  cried Cozro  for it will be impossible to convey from hence such a vast mass of riches without discovery     I value them no longer  said Nourjahad  they can never yield me any permanent enjoyment  The saving thy life is the only good turn I now expect from them  That once accomplished  I shall desire to retain no more of them than what will support me above want  and I will leave the rest to be for ever hid in the bosom of the earth  where they now lie  that they may never more become a snare to others as they have been to me     Page  195  Praised be our holy prophet  said Cozro  that has at length endued the heart of ← Nourjahad → with wisdom  Pursue the purposes of thy soul  effect thy own freedom as soon as possible  since no comfort can visit thee in the gloom of this frightful prison  but tempt not Cozro back to a life which he despises  I tell thee again  there is nothing in this world to be put in competition with the glories I have in prospect in that state to which I am now hastening  Why then  ← Nourjahad →   wouldst thou retard my felicity  or wish me to hazard  for the sake of delusive pleasures  those transcendent joys which await the virtuous     Page  196  The energy with which Cozro delivered himself  pierced ← Nourjahad → to the inmost soul  A holy ardor was kindled in his breast  which he had never felt before  he found his faculties enlarged  his mind was transported above this world  he felt as it were unimbodied  and an involuntary adjuration burst from his lips     Oh  holy prophet  said he  take  take back the gift  that I in the ignorance and presumption of my heart so vainly sought  and which too late I find a punishment instead of a blessing  I contemn riches  and for ever cast them from me  suffer me then to yield up my life  for there can be no true happiness but in beholding thee  Oh Mahomet   Page  197  face to face  in the neverfading fields of paradise   Saying this  he prostrated himself on the ground  and continued for some time in mental prayer     Cozro observed an awful silence whilst he continued in this posture  When ← Nourjahad → arose from the earth  May our great prophet  said Cozro  hear your prayers  and were he even now to grant them  all the favours he has already bestowed on you would be poor and contemptible to this last best boon  Farewel  said he  I must now leave thee  I was only permitted to come and bid thee adieu  May the Supreme grant  Page  198  thy petition  then shall we again meet in the mansions of happy spirits  Nourjahad embraced him  and Cozro withdrew     Being now left at liberty to his own thoughts  he made bitter reflections on the strangeness of his fate  Fool  fool that I was  cried he aloud  beating his breast  to prefer so rash  so impious a petition to the prophet  as to desire the everlasting laws of nature to be overturned  to gratify my mad luxurious wishes  I thought the life of man too short for the enjoyment of those various and unbounded pleasures which wealth could procure  but it is long since I have found my error  Well did my guardian  Page  199  spirit say I should repent of the gift I had implored  when it should be too late
