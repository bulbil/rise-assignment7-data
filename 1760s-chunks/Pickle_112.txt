     hole  ware I shall be at the windore  if in kais you will be       so good as to pass that way at sicks a cloak in the heavening       when Mr  Hornbeck goes to the Calf hay de Contea  Prey for the       loaf of Geesus keep this from the nolegs of my hussban  ells he       will make me leed a hell upon urth   Being all from  deer Sur        your most umbell servan wile        Deborah Hornbeck    Our young gentleman was ravished at the receipt of this elegant epistle   which was directed  A Monsr  Monsr  Pickhell  a la Gaddamme de Paul  Freny  and did not fail to obey the summons at the hour of assignation   when the lady  true to her appointment  beckoned him up stairs  and he  had the good fortune to be admitted unseen   After the first transports of their mutual joy at meeting  she told him   that her husband had been very surly and cross ever since the adventure  at Chantilly  which he had not yet digested  that he had laid severe  injunctions upon her to avoid all commerce with Pickle  and even  threatened to shut her up in a convent for life  if ever she should  discover the least inclination to renew that acquaintance  that she had  been cooped up in her chamber since her arrival at Paris  without being  permitted to see the place  or indeed any company  except that of her  landlady  whose language she did not understand  so that her spirit  being broken  and her health impaired  he was prevailed upon some days  ago to indulge her in a few airings  during which she had seen the  gardens of the Luxembourg  the Tuileries  and Palais Royal  though at  those times when there was no company in the walks  and that it was  in one of those excursions she had the happiness of meeting with him   Finally  she gave him to understand  that rather than continue longer  in such confinement with the man whom she could not love  she would  instantly give him the slip  and put herself under the protection of her  lover   Rash and unthinking as this declaration might be  the young  gentleman was so much of a gallant  that he would not balk the  lady s inclinations  and too infatuated by his passion to foresee the  consequences of such a dangerous step  he therefore  without hesitation   embraced the proposal  and the coast being clear  they sallied out into  the street  where Peregrine  calling a fiacre  ordered the coachman  to drive them to a tavern  but knowing it would not be in his power to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   conceal her from the search of the lieutenant de police  if she should  remain within the walls of Paris  he hired a remise  and carried her  that same evening to Villejuif  about four leagues from town  where he  stayed with her all night  and having boarded her on a genteel pension   and settled the economy of his future visits  returned next day to his  own lodgings   While he thus enjoyed his success  her husband endured the tortures of  the damned  When he returned from the coffee house  and understood  that his wife had eloped  without being perceived by any person in the  family  he began to rave and foam with rage and jealousy  and  in the  fury of distraction  accused the landlady of being an accomplice in her  escape  threatening to complain of her to the commissaire  The woman  could not conceive how Mrs  Hornbeck  who she knew was an utter stranger  to the French language  and kept no sort of company  could elude the  caution of her husband  and find any refuge in a place where she had  no acquaintance  and began to suspect the lodger s emotion was no other  than an affected passion to conceal his own practices upon his wife  who  had perhaps fallen a sacrifice to his jealous disposition  She therefore  spared him the trouble of putting his menaces into execution by going to  the magistrate  without any further deliberation  and giving an account  of what she knew concerning this mysterious affair  with certain  insinuations against Hornbeck s character  which she represented as  peevish and capricious to the last degree   While she thus anticipated the purpose of the plaintiff  her information  was interrupted by the arrival of the party himself  who exhibited  his complaint with such evident marks of perturbation  anger  and  impatience  that the commissaire could easily perceive that he had  no share in the disappearance of his wife  and directed him to the  lieutenant de police  whose province it is to take cognizance of such  occurrences  This gentleman  who presides over the city of Paris  having  heard the particulars of Hornbeck s misfortune  asked if he suspected
