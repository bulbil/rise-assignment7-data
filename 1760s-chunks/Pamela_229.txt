for the future       Well  then  suppose I put Mrs  Jewkes in a good way of business  in some   inn  and give her John for a husband  And then your gipsy story will be   made out  that she will have a husband younger than herself       You are all goodness  sir  said I  I can freely forgive poor Mrs    Jewkes  and wish her happy  But permit me  sir  to ask  Would not this   look like a very heavy punishment to poor John  and as if you could not   forgive him  when you are so generous to every body else       He smiled and said  O my Pamela  this  for a forgiving spirit  is very   severe upon poor Jewkes  But I shall never  by the grace of God  have   any more such trying services  to put him or the rest upon  and if you   can forgive him  I think I may  and so John shall be at your disposal    And now let me know what my Pamela has further to wish       O  my dearest sir  said I  not a single wish more has your grateful   Pamela  My heart is overwhelmed with your goodness  Forgive these tears   of joy  added I  You have left me nothing to pray for  but that God   will bless you with life  and health  and honour  and continue to me the   blessing of your esteem  and I shall then be the happiest creature in   the world       He clasped me in his arms  and said  You cannot  my dear life  be so   happy in me  as I am in you  O how heartily I despise all my former   pursuits  and headstrong appetites  What joys  what true joys  flow from   virtuous love  joys which the narrow soul of the libertine cannot take   in  nor his thoughts conceive  And which I myself  whilst a libertine    had not the least notion of       But  said he  I expected my dear spouse  my Pamela  had something to ask   for herself  But since all her own good is absorbed in the delight her   generous heart takes in promoting that of others  it shall be my study   to prevent her wishes  and to make her care for herself unnecessary  by   my anticipating kindness       In this manner  my dear parents  is your happy daughter blessed in a   husband  O how my exulting heart leaps at the dear  dear word   And I   have nothing to do  but to be humble  and to look up with gratitude to   the all gracious dispenser of these blessings       So  with a thousand thanks  I afterwards retired to my closet  to write   you thus far  And having completed what I purpose for this packet  and   put up the kind obliging present  I have nothing more to say  but that   I hope soon to see you both  and receive your blessings on this happy    thrice happy occasion  And so  hoping for your prayers  that I may   preserve an humble and upright mind to my gracious God  a dutiful   gratitude to my dear master and husband  that I may long rejoice in the   continuance of these blessings and favours  and that I may preserve    at the same time  an obliging deportment to every one else  I conclude   myself  Your ever dutiful and most happy daughter                                                               PAMELA B          O think it not my pride  my dear parents  that sets me on glorying in my   change of name  Yours will be always dear to me  and what I shall never   be ashamed of  I m sure  But yet  for such a husband   What shall I say    since words are too faint to express my gratitude and my joy       I have taken copies of my master s letter to Mr  Longman  and mine to   Mrs  Jervis  which I will send with the further occurrences  when I go   to the other dear house  or give you when I see you  as I now hope soon   to do          Saturday morning  the third of my happy nuptials       I must still write on  till I come to be settled in the
