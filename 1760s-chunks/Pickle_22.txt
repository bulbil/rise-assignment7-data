shoulder was graced with a broad buff belt     6 22 15  3 45 PM   from whence depended a huge hanger with a hilt like that of a backsword   and on each side of his pommel appeared a rusty pistol rammed in a case  covered with a bearskin  The loss of his tie periwig and laced hat   which were curiosities of the kind  did not at all contribute to the  improvement of the picture  but  on the contrary  by exhibiting his  bald pate  and the natural extension of his lantern jaws  added to the  peculiarity and extravagance of the whole   Such a spectacle could not have failed of diverting the whole company  from the chase had his horse thought proper to pursue a different route   but the beast was too keen a sporter to choose any other way than that  which the stag followed and therefore  without stopping to gratify  the curiosity of the spectators  he in a few minutes outstripped every  hunter in the field  There being a deep hollow betwixt him and the  hounds  rather than ride round  about the length of a furlong  in a  path that crossed the lane  he transported himself at one jump  to the  unspeakable astonishment and terror of a waggoner who chanced to be  underneath  and saw this phenomenon fly over his carriage  This was not  the only adventure he achieved  The stag  having taken a deep river  that lay in his way  every man directed his course to a bridge in  the neighbourhood  but our bridegroom s courser  despising all such  conveniences  plunged into the stream without hesitation  and swam in a  twinkling to the opposite shore  This sudden immersion into an element  of which Trunnion was properly a native  in all probability helped to  recruit the exhausted spirits of his rider  at his landing on the other  side gave some tokens of sensation  by hallooing aloud for assistance   which he could not possibly receive  because his horse still maintained  the advantage he had gained  and would not allow himself to be  overtaken   In short  after a long chase that lasted several hours  and extended to  a dozen miles at least  he was the first in at the death of the deer   being seconded by the lieutenant s gelding  which  actuated by the same  spirit  had  without a rider  followed his companion s example   Our bridegroom  finding himself at last brought up  or  in other words   at the end of his career  took the opportunity of this first pause  to  desire the huntsmen would lend him a hand in dismounting  and by their  condescension  safely placed on the grass  where he sat staring at  the company as they came in  with such wildness of astonishment in his  looks  as if he had been a creature of another species  dropped among  them from the clouds   Before they had fleshed the hounds  however  he recollected himself   and  seeing one of the sportsmen take a small flask out of his pocket  and apply it to his mouth  judged the cordial to be no other than neat  Cognac  which it really was  and expressing a desire of participation   was immediately accommodated with a moderate dose  which perfectly  completed his recovery   By this time he and his two horses had engrossed the attention of the  whole crowd  while some admired the elegant proportion and uncommon  spirit of the two animals  the rest contemplated the surprising  appearance of their master  whom before they had only seen en passant   and at length  one of the gentlemen  accosting him very courteously   signified his wonder at seeing him in such an equipage  and asked if  he had not dropped his companion by the way   Why look ye  brother      6 22 15  3 45 PM   replied the commodore   mayhap you think me an odd sort of a fellow   seeing me in this trim  especially as I have lost part of my rigging   but this here is the case  d ye see  I weighed anchor from my own house  this morning  at ten A M  with fair weather  and a favourable breeze  at south south east  being bound to the next church on the voyage of  matrimony  but howsomever  we had not run down a quarter of a league   when the wind shifting  blowed directly in our teeth  so that we were  forced to tack all the way  d ye see  and had almost been up within  sight of the port  when these sons of b  s of horses  which I had  bought but two days before  for my own part  I believe they are devils  incarnate   luffed round in a trice  and then  refusing the helm  drove  away like lightning with me and my lieutenant  who soon came to anchor  in an exceeding good berth  As for my own part  I have been carried over  rocks  and quicksands  among which
