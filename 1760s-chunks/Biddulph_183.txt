enough  my Cecilia  to persist in embarrassing this mean woman any farther  though the insincerity of her whole behaviour  and the low falsities she had recourse to  very well deserved reproof  I was glad to find my brother was not so culpable as he had at first appeared  for I could easily discover from the whole tenor of her discourse  she was so far from giving him any intimation of my distress  that she had prevented him from enquiring after me  by telling him that I was gone out of town  probably too with some aggravating circumstances  either of a pretended neglect on my side towards them both  or  perhaps  some other falshood still more injurious  It was very apparent that she had sent her maid only as a spy  and  by way of passport  with a sham offer of kindness  of which she knew I stood not in need  and she depended on my pride and resentment so justly provoked  for my never coming to any explanation either with her or my brother  No wonder then she was so confounded at the sight of me  and the more so as she    apprehended I might reproach my brother  who could so well excuse himself by pleading ignorance of my situation  and her conduct must then appear so despicable to her husband  that hardy as she is  she would be at a loss to justify it   All this being very obvious to me  I determined to make her easy at once  I shall think no more of what is past  Lady Sarah  said I  I only wish to be on terms of friendship with my brother and you  and since he knows not of the message you sent to me  I will not mention it to him  nor any thing else that can recall past unkindness  I hope this visit will be taken as it is meant  out of pure affection  and that you  Madam  will be so kind as to make my peace with my brother  whom I am very sorry I was under a necessity of disobliging  but as I never did offend him  and I am sure never should but in that one instance  wherein I was so much more nearly interested than himself  I hope he will think no more of it  but restore me to a share of his love  which is all that is now wanting to my happiness   This declaration  as I intended it should  entirely restored Lady Sarah’s tranquillity  Her countenance brightened up  I’ll take upon me to answer for Sir George  said she  that he shall restore you to his affection  I shall insist upon a general act of oblivion being passed on his side  and I beg  sister  on your part  that you may not  by reproaching your brother  revive the memory of your past coldness   The weakest people are often very cunning  this caution of Lady Sarah’s  artfully enough introduced  conveyed an obvious meaning to me  very different from her pretended reason  she was afraid of an eclaircissement  I promised her I should meet my brother  whenever he would permit me  as if nothing had ever happened to disturb our friendship   See  my dear  how this woman  do durst not name me when I was poor  took upon her now to make her husband  whose anger had so much intimidated her  subscribe intirely to her opinion  but I was now become an object of attention  a finer house  and a finer equipage than her ladyship’s  gave me an indisputable title to that regard  to which  as a sister  and in distress  I had not the least claim   She now ventured to ask me some particulars relating to the very extraordinary change in my fortune  I satisfied her minutely  not without mentioning the cause of Mr Warner’s having made me the sole object of his bounty  Poor Lady Sarah could not conceal her vexation at the thoughts of what she had lost by her ill timed pride and parcimony  A strange whimsical old mortal  she called him  to    come upon them so abruptly  and in such a scandalous garb  that Sir George was quite ashamed of him  I am glad  however  Mrs Arnold  that he has made you the better for him  I hope he will continue his fondness  but such odd humourists are not to be depended on  Don’t tell him  however  what I say  I should be glad to shew him any civility in my power  for his kindness to you   I took my leave of her ladyship  with a cordial invitation to come and see me  which she said she would not fail to do   Mr Warner called on me for a few minutes in the evening to know the result of my visit  as I had told him I intended to make it  I related every thing that had passed between Lady Sarah and me  he enjoyed her confusion as I described it  with a triumphant satisfaction  which nothing but a very strong resentment could have excited in so good natured a man  as he really seems to be   He has added to my store of china to day  of which I have already
