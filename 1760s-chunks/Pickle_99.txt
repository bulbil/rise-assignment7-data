extravagance  of its dress and gesticulation  Peregrine mistook for a madman of the  growth of France  This phantom  which  by the bye  happened to be no  other than the cook  was a tall  long legged  meagre  swarthy fellow   that stooped very much  his cheek bones were remarkably raised  his nose  bent into the shape and size of a powder horn  and the sockets of his  eyes as raw round the edges as if the skin had been pared off  On his  head he wore a handkerchief  which had once been white  and now served  to cover the upper part of a black periwig  to which was attached a bag  at least a foot square  with a solitaire and rose that stuck upon each  side of his ear  so that he looked like a criminal on the pillory  His  back was accommodated with a linen waistcoat  his hands adorned with  long ruffles of the same piece  his middle was girded by an apron   tucked up  that it might not conceal his white silk stockings  rolled   and at his entrance he brandished a bloody weapon full three feet in    6 22 15  3 45 PM   length    Peregrine  when he first saw him approach in this menacing attitude  put  himself upon his guard  but being informed of his quality  perused  his bill of fare  and having bespoken three or four things for dinner   walked out with Mr  Jolter to view both towns  which they had not  leisure to consider minutely before  In their return from the harbour  they met with four or five gentlemen  all of whom seemed to look with an  air of dejection  and perceiving our hero and his governor to be English  by their dress  bowed with great respect as they passed  Pickle  who  was naturally compassionate  felt an emotion of sympathy  and seeing a  person  who by his habit he judged to be one of their servants  accosted  him in English  and asked who the gentlemen were  The lacquey gave  him to understand that they were his own countrymen  called from their  native homes in consequence of their adherence to an unfortunate and  ruined cause  and that they were gone to the sea side  according to  their daily practice  in order to indulge their longing eyes with a  prospect of the white cliffs of Albion  which they must never more  approach   Though our young gentleman differed widely from them in point of  political principles  he was not one of those enthusiasts who look upon  every schism from the established articles of faith as damnable   and exclude the sceptic from every benefit of humanity and Christian  forgiveness  he could easily comprehend how a man of the most  unblemished morals might  by the prejudice of education  or  indispensable attachments  be engaged in such a blameworthy and  pernicious undertaking  and thought that they had already suffered  severely for their imprudence  He was affected with the account of their  diurnal pilgrimage to the sea side  which he considered as a pathetic  proof of their affliction  and invested Mr  Jolter with the agreeable  office of going to them with a compliment in his name  and begging the  honour of drinking a glass with them in the evening  They accepted the  proposal with great satisfaction and respectful acknowledgment  and  in the afternoon waited upon the kind inviter  who treated them with  coffee  and would have detained them to supper  but they entreated the  favour of his company at the house which they frequented so earnestly   that he yielded to their solicitations  and  with his governor  was  conducted by them to the place  where they had provided an elegant  repast  and regaled them with some of the best claret in France   It was easy for them to perceive that their principal guest was no  favourer of their state maxims  and therefore they industriously avoided  every subject of conversation which could give the least offence  not  but they lamented their own situation  which cut them off from all their  dearest connections  and doomed them to perpetual banishment from their  families and friends  but they did not  even by the most distant hint   impeach the justice of that sentence by which they were condemned   although one among them  who seemed to be about the age of thirty  wept  bitterly over his misfortune  which had involved a beloved wife and  three children in misery and distress  and  in the impatience of his  grief  cursed his own fate with frantic imprecations  His companions   with a view of beguiling his sorrow  and manifesting their own  hospitality at the same time  changed the topic of discourse  and  circulated the bumpers with great assiduity  so that all their cares  were overwhelmed and forgotten  several French drinking catches were  sung  and mirth and good fellowship prevailed     6 22 15  3 45 PM   In the midst of this elevation  which commonly unlocks the most hidden  sentiment  and dispels every consideration of caution
