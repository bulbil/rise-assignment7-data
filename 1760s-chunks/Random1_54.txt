in practice  in spite of the scoffs  curses and reproaches with which he was answered  until a blacksmith s  prentice  seeing him stop a porter with a burden on his back  and hearing his question  for which he received a hearty curse  called to him  and asked if the person he enquired after was not a Scotchman —Strap replied with great eagerness     Yes  and had on a brown coat with long skirts  —   The same  said the blacksmith  I saw him pass about an hour ago  —   Did you so   cried Strap  rubbing his hands  Odd  I am very glad of that—which way went he  —   Towards Tyburn in a cart   said he  if you make good speed  you may get thither time enough to see him hanged  —  This piece of wit incensed my friend to such a degree  that he called the blacksmith scoundrel  and protested he would fight him for half a farthing—   No  no   said the other  stripping  I ll have none of your money—you Scotchmen seldom carry any about you—but I ll fight you for love  —  There was a ring immediately formed by the mob  and Strap finding he could not get off honourably without fighting    149 at the same time burning with resentment against his adversary  quitted his cloaths to the care of the multitude  and the battle began with great violence on the side of Strap  who in a few minutes exhausted his breach and spirits on his patient antagonist  who sustained the assault with great coolness  till finding the barber quite spent  he returned the blows he had lent him  with such interest  that Strap  after having received three falls on the hard stones  gave out  and allowed the blacksmith to be the better man —The victory being thus decided  it was proposed to adjourn to a cellar hard by and drink friends —But when my friend began to gather up his cloaths  he perceived that some honest person or other had made free with his shirt  neckcloath  hat and wig  which were carried off  and probably his coat and waistcoat would have met with the same fate  had they been worth the stealing —It was in vain for him to make a noise  which only yielded mirth to the spectators  he was fain to get off in this manner  which he accomplished with much difficulty  and appeared before me  all besmeared with blood and dirt —Notwithstanding this misfortune  such was his transport at finding me safe and sound  that he had almost stifled and stunk me to death with his embraces —After he had cleaned himself and put on one of my shirts  and a woolen night cape instead of hat and wig  I recounted to him the particulars of my night s campaign  which filled him with admiration  and made him repeat with great energy an observation which was often in his mouth  viz    London is the devil s drawing room  —  As neither of us had dined  he desired me to get up  and the milk woman coming round at that instant    150 he went down stairs and brought up a quart  with a penny brick  on which we made a comfortable meal  He then shared his money with me  which amounted to eighteen pence  and left me  with an intention to borrow an old wig and hat of his friend the school master     He was no sooner gone  than I began to consider my situation with great uneasiness  and revolved all the schemes my imagination could suggest  in order to chuse and pursue some one that would procure me bread  for it is impossible to express the pangs I felt  when I reflected on the miserable dependance in which I lived  at the expence of a poor barber s boy —My pride took the alarm  and having no hopes of succeeding at the navy office  I came to a resolution of enlisting in the foot guards next day  coute qui coute —This extravagant design  by flattering my disposition  gave great satisfaction  and I was charging the enemy at the head of my own regiment  when Strap s return interrupted my reverie —The school master had made him a present of the tye wig which he wore when I was introduced to him  together with an old hat  whose brims would have overshadowed a Colossus —Though Strap had ventured to wear them in the dusk  he did not chuse to entertain the mob by day  therefore went to work immediately and reduced them both to a moderate size  While he was employed in this manner  he addressed me thus —   To be sure  Mr  Random  you are born a gentleman  and have a great deal of learning—and indeed look like a gentleman  for as to person you may hold up your head with the best of them —On the other hand  I am a poor  but honest cobler s son—my mother was as industrious   151 a woman as ever broke bread   till such time as she took to drinking  which you very well know—but every body has failings—humanum est errare —Now for myself I am a poor journeyman barber  tolerably well made  and understand some
