 If Lady Clementina persists in her present resolution  I will endeavour to acquiesce with it  If she should change her mind  I will hold myself in readiness to Page  157 receive her hand  as the greatest blessing that can be conferred upon me  Only let me add  that in the first case  the difficulty upon me will be greatly increased  by the exalted contents of the paper she put into my hands on Saturday   The Marchioness taking her daughter s hand and mine—Why  why  said she  should minds thus pair d be sunder d —And will you  Chevalier  wait with patience the result of my sweet child s—Caprice—shall I call it   Detain not my hand  my dear mamma  withdrawing it a little wildly—Let me go up  and pray  that my fortitude of mind  after the pain it has cost me to obtain it  may not forsake me  Adieu  Adieu  Chevalier  I will pray for you as well as for myself  Never  never  in my devotions  will we be separated   Away flew the angel   She met Camilla in the passage—Dear Camilla  I have had an escape  as far as I know  My hand and the Chevalier s hand  each in one of my mamma s —My resolution was in danger  My mamma might have joined them  you know  and then I must have been his   Jeronymo in silence  but tears in his eyes  attended to the scene between his sister and she  He embraced me—Dearest of men  let me repeat my mother s question  Can you with patience wait the result of this dear girl s caprice   I can  I will   But I will talk to her myself  said he   So  said the Marquis  will we all   It will be right to do so  added the Count  least she should repent when it is too late   But I believe  said Father Marescotti  the Chevalier himself would not wish  that Lady Clementina should be too vehemently urged  She pleads her Soul  A strong plea  A plea that should not be over ruled  I myself doubt very much  whether she will be able Page  158 to adhere to her resolution  If she be she will merit Beatification  But let her not be over persuaded  Once more I should be glad to read the paper  the contents of which have so much surprised us all   I had it in my pocket  and he asked permission to read it aloud  Jeronymo opposed his motion  But the Bishop approving it  he read it  He laid great emphasis upon particular words  and repeated several of the passages in it  You will easily guess which  my dear friend  and all were as much affected  they owned  as when they heard it first read  Yet they joined in one doubt  notwithstanding what she had so lately said of the deliberation she had given her purpose  that she would not be able to adhere to her resolution  and made me many compliments on the occasion   But  my dear friend  if she can continue to interest her glory in the adherence  and they are not very urgent with her in my favour  I am inclined to believe  that she has greatness of mind sufficient to enable her to carry her resolution into effect  Where piety  my dear friend  engages the heart to give up its first fervors to its superior duties  is it not probable that all temporal impulses should receive abatement  and become but secondary ones  And now will not Father Marescotti once more try to revive his influences over her mind —Is it not his duty to do so  zealous Catholic as he is  Can the Bishop refuse  good man as he is  and as steady in his principles  to second the Father   But what trials are these  my dear Dr  Bartlett  to an expecting heart —Will they not serve to convince us of the vanity of all human reliance for happiness  I am in a very serious humour  But what can I say to you on such subjects  that you knew not much better before than I     Let us  I remember you once said  when we are called upon to act a great or manly part  preach by action  Words then will Page  159 be needless    God only knows  whether the ardent heart would be punished or rewarded  by the completion of its wishes  But this I know  that were Clementina to give me both her hand and her heart  and could not  by reason of religious doubts  be happy with me  I should myself be extremely miserable  especially if I had been earnest to prevail upon her to favour me against her judgment     LETTER XXVI  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  In Continuation   I Was obliged to lay down my pen  My mind was too much disturbed to write on   We had a great deal of discourse before we quitted Jeronymo s chamber  on this extraordinary subject  They all  as I told you  expressed their doubts  that the Lady would be able to persist in her new resolution  The Marquis and Marchioness
