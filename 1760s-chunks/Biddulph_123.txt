will come to your house at five o’clock  Well  said she  bring a few spirits with you  and do not let the interview soften you too much     Lady V—— then took her leave  as she said she should hardly have time to dress before dinner  My mother and I spent the interval between that time and evening  in talking of our future scheme of life  Remember  my dear  said she  that when I die  you lose the best part of your income  as my house  together with my jointure  revert to Sir George  and you have no great reason to expect that he will continue either to you  it therefore behoves you to use œconomy  as well for the sake of saving a little  as to accustom yourselves to live upon a little  I would myself accompany you down to the country  but as my son’s marriage is so near  he would have reason to take it amiss of me  and I know I shall have his imperious temper to battle with  on our making up matters between you and your husband  but I shall make myself easy  by reflecting that we have both acted agreeably to our duty   You never  my Cecilia  experienced such a situation as mine  and therefore can have no idea of what I felt  in expectation of seeing the person  whose presence I most ardently wished for  and yet was afraid of the interview  My fears were not on my account  conscious as I was of my innocence  I had no apprehensions on that head  but I could not bear the thoughts of beholding poor Mr Arnold  in the state of humiliation in which I supposed I should find him  I wished the first encounter of our eyes over  and as the appointed hour approached  my anxiety increased  I was faint  and seized with universal tremors  My mother did all she could to encourage me  and a little before five o’clock  I was put into a chair  and carried to Lord V——’s house   My lady met me on the stairs  I could scarce breathe  She carried me into her dressing room  and made me sit down till I recovered a little  she was affected herself  but endeavoured to raise my spirits  I wish  said she  smiling  you had been in my lord’s hands  he would have prepared you better than Lady Bidulph has for this meeting  he has been trying to make Mr Arnold drunk  in order to give him courage  he says  to face you  Poor man  he could scarcely credit me when I told him you were to come this evening  She proposed my taking a few drops  which I agreed to  and bidding me pluck up my spirits  said she would send Mr Arnold to me   I catched lady V—— by the hand  and begged she would desire him  from me  not to mention any thing that was past  but let our meeting be  as if the separation had only been occasioned by a long journey   She left me  and Mr Arnold in a few minutes entered the room     He approached me speechless  my arms were extended to receive him  he fell into them  we neither of us spoke  there was no language but tears  which we both shed plentifully  Mr Arnold sobbed as I pressed him to my bosom  My dearest Sidney  said he  can it be  Is it possible that you love me still   If lady V—— delivered my message to you  my dear Mr Arnold  sure you would not speak thus to me   I understand you  said he  Oh  my dear  I never wished for wealth or length of days  till now—but what I can I will   Forbear  my love  said I  remember my request  I wanted to give his thoughts another turn  My mother longs to see you  When will you visit her   I will throw myself at her feet  said he  I want a blessing from her  and she has sent me one  throwing his arms again round me   How much are we obliged to good lord and lady V——  said I   Oh  they have opened to me the path to Heaven  he answered—if it had not been for them—I think we had better go to them  said I  they will partake in our happiness   He took me by the hand without answering  and led me into the drawing room   I have  my sister  endeavoured to recollect our disjointed conversation  in order to give it to you as well as I could  All that I can remember I have set down  though I am sure a good deal more passed   Lord V——’s eyes sparkled when he saw us enter together  but my lady and he  I suppose  had agreed before hand to say nothing that could recall any past griefs  for they only smiled at our entrance  and my lord said  Arnold  you really hand your lady in with as gallant an air  as if you were married within these three hours  And so I have been  my lord  answered Mr Arnold
