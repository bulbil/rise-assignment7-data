nation with rigour and partiality    120 In Scotland the discontent broke forth  at length  into the flames of rebellion  The Earl of Mar  assembling three hundred of his own vassals  in the Highlands of Scotland  proclaimed the Pretender at Castletown  and set up his standard at Brae Mar  on the sixth day of September  then assuming the title of Lieutenant general of the Pretender s forces  he exhorted the people to take arms in defence of their lawful Sovereign  But these preparations were weak and ill conducted  all the designs of the rebels betrayed to the government  the beginning of every revolt repressed  the western counties prevented from rising  and the most prudent precautions taken to keep all suspected persons in custody  or in awe  The Earl of Derwentwater  and Mr  Foster  took the field near the borders of Scotland  and  being joined by some gentlemen  proclaimed the Pretender  Their first attempt was to seize upon Newcastle  in which they had many friends  but they found the gates shut upon them  and were obliged to retire to Hexam  while General Carpenter  having assembled a body of dragoons  resolved to attack them before their numbers were increased  The rebels had two methods of acting with success  either marching immediately into the western parts of Scotland  and there joining General Gordon  who commanded a strong body of Highlanders  or of crossing the Tweed  and attacking General Carpenter  whose forces did not exceed nine hundred men  From their usual infatuation neither of these schemes were put into execution  for  taking the route another way  they left General Carpenter on one side  and resolved to penetrate into England by the western border  They accordingly advanced without either foresight or design  as far as Preston  where they first heard the news that General Wills was marching at the head of six regiments of horse  and a battalion of foot  to attack them  They now therefore began to raise   121 barricadoes  and to put the place in a posture of defence  repulsing at first the attack of the King s army with some success  Next day  however  General Wills was reinforced by the troops under Carpenter  and the rebels were invested on all sides  Foster  their General  sent Colonel Oxburgh with a trumpet to the English commander  to propose a capitulation  This  however  General Wills refused  alledging that he would not treat with rebels  and that all they could expect was  to be spared from immediate slaughter  These were hard terms  but they were then obliged to submit  They accordingly laid down their arms  and were put under a strong guard  The leaders were secured  and led through London pinioned  and bound together  while the common men were confined at Chester and Liverpool   While these unhappy circumstances attended the rebels in England  the Earl of Mar s forces  in the mean time  increased to the number of ten thousand men  and he had made himself master of the whole county of Fife  Against him the Duke of Argyle set out for Scotland  as commander in chief of the forces in North Britain  and  assembling some troops in Lothian  returned to Stirling with all possible expedition  The Earl of Mar  being informed of this  at first retreated  but being joined soon after by some Clans under the Earl of Seaforth  and others by General Gordon  who had signalized himself in the Russian service  he resolved to march forward towards England  The Duke of Argyle  apprized of his intention  and being joined by some regiments of dragoons from Ireland  determined to give him battle in the neighbourhood of Dumblain  though his forces were by no means so numerous as those of the rebel army  In the morning therefore of the same day on which the Preston rebels had surrendered  he drew up his forces  which did not exceed three thousand five hundred men  but found himself greatly outflanked   122 by the enemy  The Duke therefore perceiving the enemy making attempts to surround him  was obliged to alter his disposition  which  on account of the scarcity of general officers  was not done so expeditiously as to be all formed before the rebels begun the attack  The left wing therefore of the Duke s army fell in with the center of the enemy s  and supported the first charge without shrinking  This wing even seemed  for a short time  victorious  as they killed the chief leader of part of the rebel army  But Glengary  who was second in command  undertook to inspire his intimidated forces  and  waving his bonnet  cried out several times  Revenge  This animated his men to such a degree  that they followed him close to the muzzles of the muskets  pushed aside the bayonets with their targets  and with their broad swords did great execution  A total route of that wing of the royal army ensued  and General Witham  their commander  flying full speed to Stirling  gave out  that all was lost  In the mean time the Duke of Argyle  who commanded in person on the right  attacked the left of the enemy  and drove them before him for two miles  though they often faced about  and attempted to rally
