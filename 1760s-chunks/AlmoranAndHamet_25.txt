which hypocrites conceal their wretchedness  and excite the   admiration of folly and the contempt of wisdom  yet thy walk  in this   place  shall be still unrestrained  Here the splendor of my felicity   shall fill thy heart with envy  and cover thy face with confusion  and   from thee shall the world be instructed  that the enemies of ALMORAN can   move no passion in his breast but contempt  and that most to punish them   is to permit them to live        OMAR  whose eye had till now been fixed upon the ground  regarded   ALMORAN with a calm but steady countenance   Here then   said he   will   I follow thee  constant as thy shadow  tho   as thy shadow  unnoticed or   neglected  here shall mine eye watch those evils  that were appointed   from everlasting to attend upon guilt  and here shall my voice warn thee   of their approach  From thy breast may they be averted by righteousness    for without this  though all the worlds that roll above thee should  to   aid thee  unite all their power  that power can aid thee only to be   wretched        ALMORAN  in all the pride of gratified ambition  invested with dominion   that had no limits  and allied with powers that were more than mortal    was overawed by this address  and his countenance grew pale  But the   next moment  disdaining to be thus controuled by the voice of a slave    his cheeks were suffused with the blushes of indignation  he turned from   OMAR  in scorn  anger  and confusion  without reply  and OMAR departed   with the calm dignity of a benevolent and superior being  to whom the   smiles and frowns of terrestrial tyranny were alike indifferent  and in   whom abhorrence of the turpitude of vice was mingled with companion for   its folly                CHAP  XII          In the mean time  ALMEIDA  who had been conveyed to an apartment in   ALMORAN S seraglio  and delivered to the care of those who attended upon   his women  suffered all that grief and terror could inflict upon a   generous  a tender  and a delicate mind  yet in this complicated   distress  her attention was principally fixed upon HAMET  The   disappointment of his hope  and the violation of his right  were the   chief objects of her regret and her fears  in all that had already   happened  and in all that was still to come  every insult that might be   offered to herself  she considered as an injury to him  Yet the   thoughts of all that he might suffer in her person  gave way to her   apprehensions of what might befall him in his own  in his situation    every calamity that her imagination could conceive  was possible  her   thoughts were  therefore  bewildered amidst an endless variety of   dreadful images  which started up before them which way soever they were   turned  and it was impossible that she could gain any certain   intelligence of his fate  as the splendid prison in which she was now   confined  was surrounded by mutes and eunuchs  of whom nothing could be   learned  or in whole report no confidence could be placed       While her mind was in this state of agitation and distress  she   perceived the door open  and the next moment ALMORAN entered the   apartment  When she saw him  she turned from him with a look of   unutterable anguish  and hiding her face in her veil  she burst into   tears  The tyrant was moved with her distress  for unfeeling obduracy is   the vice only of the old  whose sensibility has been worn away by the   habitual perpetration of reiterated wrongs       He approached her with looks of kindness  and his voice was   involuntarily modulated to pity  she was  however  too much absorbed in   her own sorrows  to reply  He gazed upon her with tenderness and   admiration  and taking her hand into his own  he pressed it ardently to   his bosom  his compassion soon kindled into desire  and from soothing   her distress  he began to solicit her love  This instantly roused her   attention  and resentment now suspended her grief  she turned from him   with a firm and haughty step  and instead of answering his professions    reproached him with her wrongs  ALMORAN  that he might at once address   her virtue and her passions  observed  that though he had loved her from   the first moment he had seen her  yet he had concealed his passion even   from her  till it had received the sanction of an invisible and superior
