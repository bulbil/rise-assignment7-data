it must be owned that Trunnion was  not naturally deficient in the social passions of the soul  which though  they were strangely warped  disguised  and overborne by the circumstance  of his boisterous life and education  did not fail to manifest  themselves occasionally through the whole course of his behaviour   As all the hopes of propagating his own name had perished  and his  relations lay under the interdiction of his hate  it is no wonder that  through the familiarity and friendly intercourse subsisting between him  and Mr  Gamaliel  he contracted a liking for the boy  who by this time  entered the third year of his age  and was indeed a very handsome   healthy  and promising child  and what seemed to ingratiate him still  more with his uncle  was a certain oddity of disposition  for which he  had been remarkable even from his cradle  It is reported of him  that  before the first year of his infancy was elapsed  he used very often   immediately after being dressed  in the midst of the caresses which  were bestowed upon him by his mother  while she indulged herself in the  contemplation of her own happiness  all of a sudden to alarm her with  a fit of shrieks and cries  which continued with great violence till  he was stripped to the skin with the utmost expedition by order of  his affrighted parent  who thought his tender body was tortured by the  misapplication of some unlucky pill  and when he had given them all this  disturbance and unnecessary trouble  he would he sprawling and laughing  in their faces  as if he ridiculed the impertinence of their concern   Nay  it is affirmed  that one day  when an old woman who attended in the  nursery had by stealth conveyed a bottle of cordial waters to her mouth   he pulled his nurse by the sleeve  by a slight glance detected the  theft  and tipped her the wink with a particular slyness of countenance   as if he had said  with a sneer   Ay  ay  that is what you must all come  to   But these instances of reflection in a babe nine months old are    6 22 15  3 45 PM   so incredible  that I look upon them as observations  founded upon  imaginary recollection  when he was in a more advanced age  and his  peculiarities of temper became much more remarkable  of a piece with  the ingenious discoveries of those sagacious observers  who can  discern something evidently characteristic in the features of any noted  personage whose character they have previously heard explained  Yet  without pretending to specify at what period of his childhood this  singularity first appeared  I can with great truth declare  that when  he first attracted the notice and affection of his uncle  it was plainly  perceivable   One would imagine he had marked out the commodore as a proper object of  ridicule  for almost all his little childish satire was leveled  against him  I will not deny that he might have been influenced in this  particular by the example and instruction of Mr  Hatchway  who delighted  in superintending the first essays of his genius  As the gout had taken  up its residence in Mr  Trunnion s great toe  from whence it never  removed  no not for a day  little Perry took great pleasure in treading  by accident on this infirm member  and when his uncle  incensed by the  pain  used to damn him for a hell begotten brat  he would appease him in  a twinkling  by returning the curse with equal emphasis  and asking  what was the matter with old Hannibal Tough  an appellation by which the  lieutenant had taught him to distinguish this grim commander   Neither was this the only experiment he tried upon the patience of the  commodore  with whose nose he used to take indecent freedoms  even   while he was fondled on his knee  In one month he put him to the  expense of two guineas in seal skin  by picking his pocket of divers  tobacco pouches  all of which he in secret committed to the flames  Nor  did the caprice of his disposition abstain from the favourite beverage  of Trunnion  who more than once swallowed a whole draught in which  his brother s snuff box had been emptied  before he perceived the  disagreeable infusion  and one day  when the commodore had chastised him  by a gentle tap with his cane  he fell flat on the floor as if he had  been deprived of all sense and motion  to the terror and amazement of  the striker  and after having filled the whole house with confusion and  dismay  opened his eyes  and laughed heartily at the success of his own  imposition   It would be an endless and perhaps no very agreeable task  to enumerate  all the unlucky pranks he played upon his uncle and others  before he  attained the fourth year of his age  about which time he was sent  with  an attendant  to a day school in the neighbourhood  that  to use his  good mother s own expression
