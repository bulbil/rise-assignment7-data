o clock  when we got up  and were treated at breakfast with chocolate and l eau de vie  by our paramours  of whom we took a tender leave  after my companion had confessed and given them absolution —While we proceeded on our journey  the conversation turned upon the night s adventure  being introduced by the capuchin  who asked me how I liked my lodging    55 I declared my satisfaction  and talked in raptures of the agreeable Nanette  at which he shook his head  and smiling said  she was a morçeau pour la bonne bouche    I never valued myself  continued he  upon any thing so much as the conquest of Nanette  and  vanity apart  I have been pretty fortunate in my amours  —  This information shocked me not a little  as I was well convinced of his intimacy with her sister  and though I did not care to tax him with downright incest  I professed my astonishment at his last night s choice  when  I supposed  the other was at his devotion —To this he answered  that besides his natural complaisance to the sex  he had another reason to distribute his favours equally between them  namely  to preserve peace in the family  which could not otherwise be maintained —that moreover Nanette had conceived an affection for me  and he loved her too well to baulk her inclination  more especially  when he had an opportunity of obliging his friend at the same time —I thanked him for this instance of his friendship  though I was extremely disgusted at his want of delicacy  and cursed the occasion that threw me in his way —Libertine as I was  I could not bear to see a man behave so wide of the character he assumed  I looked upon him as person of very little worth or honesty  and should have even kept a wary eye upon my pocket  if I had thought he could have any temptation to steal —But I could not conceive the use of money to a capuchin  who is obliged  by the rules of his order  to appear like a beggar  and enjoys all other necessaries of life gratis  besides  my fellow traveller seemed to be of a complexion too careless and sanguine  to give me any apprehension   56 on that score  so that I proceeded with great confidence  in expectation of being soon at my journey s end     CHAP  XLIII    We lodge at a house near Amiens  where I am robbed by the capuchin  who escapes while I am asleep—I go to Noyons in search of him  but without success—I make my condition known to several people  but find no relief—I grow desperate—join a company of soldiers—inlist in the regiment of Picardy—we are ordered into Germany—I find the fatigues of the march almost intolerable—quarrel with my comrade in a dispute upon politicks—he challenges me to the field  wounds and disarms me   THE third night of our pilgrimage  we passed at a house near Amiens  where Balthazar being unknown  we supped upon indifferent fare  and sower wine  and were fain to lie in a garret upon an old mattrass  which  I believe  had been in the possession of ten thousand myriads of fleas  time out of mind —We did not invade their territory with impunity  in less than a minute we were attacked with stings innumerable  in spite of which  however  I fell fast asleep  being excessively fatigued with our day s march  and did not wake till nine next   57 morning  when  seeing myself alone  I started up in a terrible fright  and examining my pockets  found my presaging fear too true  My companion had made free with my cash  and left me to seek my way to Paris by myself  I run down stairs immediately  and with a look full of grief and amazement  enquired for the mendicant  who  they gave me to understand  had set out four hours before  after having told them  I was a little indisposed  and desired I might not be disturbed  but be informed when I should wake he had taken the road to Noyons  where he would wait for my coming  at the Coq D Or —I spoke not a word  but with a heavy heart  directed my course to that place  at which I arrived in the afternoon  fainting with weariness and hunger  but learned  to my utter confusion  that no such person had been there —It was happy for me that I had a good deal of resentment in my constitution  which animated me on such occasions  against the villainy of mankind  and enabled me to bear misfortunes otherwise intolerable —Boiling with indignation  I discovered to the host my deplorable condition  and inveighed with great bitterness against the treachery of Balthazar  at which he shrugged up his shoulders  and with a peculiar grimace on his countenance  said  he was sorry for my misfortune  but there was no remedy like patience —At that instant some guests arrived  to whom he hastened to offer his service  leaving me mortified at his indifference  and fully persuaded that an inn keeper is the same sordid animal all over the world —While I stood in the porch  forlorn and undetermined  venting ejaculations of curses against the thief who had robbed
