Dear FANNY   I HAVE set up here at the old Inn  though you all say it is a bad one  This may be a Reason for new Guests not to come  but not for old ones to quit it  I always suppose  in such Cases  that Poverty is the Reason of bad Accommodations  and make it a Sort of Charity  to support the Indigent  and  when I eat or lye badly  it helps Digestion  and softens my Repose  to consider that others eat or sleep the better for it  I made a vile Breakfast at —  this Morning  from this Turn of Mind  though I had forsworn the old House  upon my going up to Town last  Such Reflections as these  my dear Fanny  are extremely pleasant  and their being uncommon is  perhaps  one of the Reasons  I amuse myself with them   I halted here  in order to write to —  instead of paying him a Visit  for I do Business better by Proxy  than in Person  The Reason that I write better than I speak  is not  as Dryden observes upon Persius  that I have a Difficulty in finding a Meaning  but rather  as the same Critic remarks upon Juvenal    car il est bon de se fair valoir   that it is hard to chuse one  I have too much Fancy  and am Page  227 too nice about my Expression  to explain myself off hand distinctly and intelligibly  Besides  the Persons and Objects  which strike on my Eyes  throw me into a Confusion  which hinders my Judgment from having fair Play to exert itself  My Ideas resemble a Painter s Pallet  where you have great Variety of Colours lying together  without Harmony or Order   till a skilful Pencil has blended them into proper Lights and Shades  to compose an agreeable Picture  This Difference between my Writing and Speaking must be very obvious to you  with whom I have corresponded  almost constantly  for above five Years past  And  upon a Review of my Letters lately  I do not recollect to have repeated the same Sentiment twice  yet I remember to have said the same Words  in Conversation  to you  an hundred times     Every Mile I rode  since I left Town  my Impatience to see Belvidere has increased  — Perhaps  the Affection  I have for it  being suspended  while I was with you   the greater Passion absorbing the less  was then set at liberty to operate  when we parted  or  perhaps  the Thoughts of quitting  as is natural in soft Minds  have the more attender d me toward it  If I thought there was a Naiad or Dryad in the Place  who would lament my Absence  I should sacrifice my Interest to my Superstition  but my Religion teaching me  that  where ever we go  Page  228 our Guardian Angel accompanies us  I think I but obey it s Call  whenever I change my Situation to my wholesome Advantage   I would have you  by all means  write to Lady —  You may also present my Duty to her  as she is to you a Mother   Adieu  my Life  my double Life now   LETTER CCLXVII   I BELIEVE  I need not take much Pains to assure my dear Harry  that nothing  but a very severe Illness  could have prevented my writing last Post  However  I hope his own Thoughts furnished him with some other Cause for my Silence  and that he had not the least Apprehension of the terrible Situation  his poor Fanny was in  I was seized with a Contraction in my Stomach on Wednesday Morning  attended with an unusual Pain  but  as I had Intervals of Ease  I hoped it would go off  I dressed myself  in order to go to —  but  finding myself grow worse every Hour  I was  at last  obliged to send an Apology  The Pain threw me into perfect Convulsions  and  in spite of all the Medicines which were given me  I continued on the Rack  till Friday Morning  when a violent Emetic gave me Ease  I am now free from Pain  but so extremely weak  that I cannot walk from my Page  229 Bed to the Dining Room  without Help  Even in those Moments  which I thought my last  I rejoiced you were not with me  as your Sufferings would have added to mine  and made them more than I could bear  Besides  I should not have had any Thing to struggle for  had you been present  but the earnest Desire  I have again to see thee  gave me Strength to encounter those Agonies  that would have torn me from thee  my more than Life  I would not let Tom write to acquaint you with my Illness  lest your Apprehension should suggest something even worse than the Reality   I now congratulate you on my Recovery  and shall proceed to thank my sweet Harry for both his Letters   There is  doubtless  something inexpressibly charming in reflecting on those Exercises of Humanity  which my dear practic Philosopher is so constantly employed in  But
