as a man of honour  as a friend of my Brother Giacomo  of all our family—But I cannot place him in any other light  What means the Chevalier Grandison  Keep not my mind in suspense   I will not  Your father  your mother  your brothers  came over in hopes  that you might be prevailed upon in the Count s favour  They have given up that hope—  They have  Sir   And will absolutely leave you to your own will  to your own wishes  on the condition to which you have agreed to sign—But shall I ask you—Were the Count to be in France  would you allow him to come over  and take leave of your family and you  before he sets out for the court of Madrid   What  Sir  as a man who had hopes from me of more than my good wishes     187 No  madam  only as a friend to the whole family—not requesting any other favour  now he sees you so determined  than your good wishes  your prayers  for him  as you will ever have his for you   I can consent in that view  But were any other favour to be hoped from me  were my generosity to be expected to be prevailed upon—O Chevalier  Lady Grandison  Mrs  Beaumont  Let me not be attempted in this way  The articles would be broken  This would be persuasion  and that compulsion   Nothing  madam  of this kind is intended  The articles will be inviolably observed on the part of your relations  But here Mrs  Beaumont  who never intended to set her foot on the English shore  to oblige and comfort your mother  is come to England  And in the general grief that was occasioned by your absenting yourself  if the man  who was always deservedly esteemed by your family  had accompanied  had attended  your father  your brothers—  Sir Charles stopt  and looked at the apprehensive Lady with such a sweet benignity  and  on her eye meeting his  with such tender and downcast modesty  all the graces of gentle persuasion are his  —  O Chevalier  your request  your request  Tell me in what I can oblige the most obliging of friends  of men   I will tell you  madam—bowing on the hand he held—Consent  if it be not with too much pain to yourself  to see the Count of Belvedere   See him  Sir  How  When  Where  As what   As a friend to your family—a well wisher to your glory  your happiness  and as a man ready and desirous to promote the latter at the expence of his own  He wishes but  while he stays here—   Stays here   Sir   To be allowed to visit your family  and to see you once  twice  thrice  as you please—but entirely under the conditions of the articles to be signed to morrow     188 And is then the Count in England   He is  madam  He attended his and your friends over  He has not once desired to appear in your presence  He keeps himself close in private lodgings  Hence judge of his resolution not to disturb or offend you  He will depart the kingdom without an interview  if you will have it so  But I could not bear  that so good a man should be obliged to depart disgracefully  as I may say  and as if he were undeserving of pity  tho  he could not obtain favour   O Chevalier   Secured  madam  by the articles  tho  his emotion may be apprehended to be great  yours cannot—There is not the same reason for the one as for the other  I make it my request  that the Count of Belvedere may be allowed  as one of the chosen friends of your house  but as no more  more the articles forbid  a place at my table to morrow   To morrow  Sir  and I at it —  He bowed affirmatively   O how the penetrating man looked into the heart of the Lady at her eyes —As sure us you are alive  madam  he thought of guessing by her then emotion  whether any hopes could distantly lie for the Count  by the consequence his presence or absence would give him with her   She paused—At last—And is this  Chevalier  the request you had to make me   It is  madam  and if my Harriet had not had the honour of this visit  I should have made the same request for his admission in the evening to morrow—as now I do to dinner   Well  Sir  I can suspect no double dealing from Sir Charles Grandison   I ask for no favour for the Count more than I have mentioned  madam  I am bound by the articles I have drawn  as if I were a party to them   Well  Sir  I consent to see the Count  He will   189 be prudent  I hope I shall be so  In Italy  more than once  after you had left it  I saw him  And I always wished him happy   Now  my dearest Sister  said
