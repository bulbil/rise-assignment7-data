her goods were seized on in a few days  and she was turned almost naked out of doors   The impious wretch died soon after in a goal  emaciated with the stings of conscience  and the prey of vermin  and I was left for a support on the wide world   Necessity soon prompted me to have recourse to prostitution  and with that view I came to town  where  being a novice in the abandoned way of life  I was often cheated of my reward  nor was it long before I contracted a virulent distemper  too frequently attendant on unfortunate women  At length  I purchased experience at the dearest rate    11 and my calamity taught me prudence and circumspection   From this time I always insisted on my fee beforehand  and if I had any suspicion of the state of my companion s health  I told him with a feigned countenance  that as he behaved like a gentleman  my ingenuity of temper obliged me to assure him  that I feared I had received an injury myself  If he still persisted  I was certain he was disordered  and peremptorily refused him  All who had a spark of generosity  greatly applauded me   By these  and such like arts  after six years public prostitution  during which  I was only once injured  and that not materially  I acquired  through cunning and prudence  as much money as produced me an easy competence  by purchasing an annuity  Being above the necessities of life  I am no longer common  I can despise most men  their money indeed has charms  the best way however  is to flatter them   12 with your love  and the expectation of enjoyment  Defer as long  therefore  as you can  the conferring of your favours  which once granted  cease to be such  In short  in all your proceedings  let your ultimate regard be to your own interest  and take care that your fond passions get not the ascendency over your reason  then will you ever have in view the motive of the men in solliciting intercourse with you  and your indespensible obligation of turning it to a solid advantage   Miss ELLIOT listened to this narrative with the utmost attention  thanked her friend for the excellent instructions contained in it  which she promised to render  by every means  conducive to the same purposes she now so happily experienced  She was so deeply affected with every particular of Mrs  JAMES S story  that she determined on adopting such a plan of future operation   Miss ELLIOT S friend soon recommended her to one Mr  THOMPSON  a gentleman who frequented the house  and who   13 was so struck with her beauty and transcendent charms  that he declared he had never seen so amiable a young woman before  Her new lover  after having kept her company some weeks  during which time he used to come every other day to visit her  was forced to be absent for some months  During this interval Mrs  JAMES brought her acquainted with an old gentleman called Mr  BROWN  who appeared charmed with her person and accomplishments  and she gladly accepted his proposals  though she expressed the inconvenience that would attend her being discovered by the unexpected arrival of another gentleman  to whom she was engaged  but who happened at that time to be out of town   This new lover was possessed of a great fortune in Jamaica  to which were added the strictest probity and the nicest sentiments of honour  in short he merited the much prostituted name of gentleman  He provided her elegant lodgings  and every thing else suitable to the wife of a nobleman  He visited her almost every day    14 and frequently used to sup with her at her own lodgings  He was so very polite  that if any thing prevented his going to see her  he would send to let her know  that she might not wait for him to no purpose  He grew so fond of her  that having laid aside all suspicion of her being able to be in love with any other man  he one day sent Monsieur PAPILLOTTE  his French hair dresser  with a letter to her  intimating that he would see her the following day  A short time  however  proved that he was greatly overseen in having such a person for a messenger between him and his mistress   PAPILLOTTE might be reckoned a handsome fellow  and there was a tolerable ease in his address  He delivered his message in so handsome a manner  that Miss ELLIOT began to think him very capable of supplying the place of his master   We may suppose from Miss ELLIOT S amorous disposition  and irresistible passion for variety  that the chief reason of her taking a liking to this fellow  was her having been confined to Mr  BROWN for   15 some time  the natural inconstancy of her temper getting the ascendant  and disposing her to change for another  though of inferior accomplishments   Observing that Monsieur PAPILLOTTE  after delivering his message  was preparing to take his leave with  a low bow  she told him she had something to ask him about Mr  BROWN  and desired him to sit down  which  after a modest excuse  he did
