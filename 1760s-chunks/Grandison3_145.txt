I even observed an increasing coldness in his behaviour  and his eye was too often cast upon me with a fierceness that shewed resentment  and not with the hospitable frankness that became him to a visiter and guest who had undertaken a journey of above two hundred miles  principally to attend him  and to shew him the confidence he had in his honour  This  as it was more to his dishonour   362 than mine  I pitied him for  But what most of all disturbed me  was  that I could not obtain from him any particular intelligence relating to the health of one person  whose distresses lay heavy upon my heart   There were several persons of distinction at dinner  the discourse could therefore be only general  He paid me great respect at his table  but it was a solemn one  I was the more uneasy at it  as I apprehended  that the situation of the Bologna family was more unhappy than when I left that city   He retired with me into his garden  You stay with me at least the week out  Chevalier   No  my Lord  I have affairs of a deceased friend at Florence and at Leghorn to settle  To morrow  as early as I can  I shall set out for Rome  in my way to Tuscany   I am surprised  Chevalier  You take something amiss in my behaviour   I cannot say that your Lordship s countenance  I am a very free speaker  has that benignity in it  that complacency  which I have had the pleasure to see in it   By G  Chevalier  I could have loved you better than any man in the world  next to the men of my own family  but I own I see you not here with so much love as admiration   The word admiration  my Lord  may require explanation  You may admire at my confidence  But I thank you for the manly freedom of your acknowlegement in general   By admiration I mean  all that may do you honour  Your bravery in coming hither  particularly  and your greatness of mind on your taking leave of us all  But did you not then mean to insult me   I meant to observe to you then  as I now do in your own palace  that you had not treated me as my heart told me I deserved to be treated  But when I thought your warmth was rising to the uneasiness of   363 your assembled friends  instead of answering your question about my stay at Bologna  as you seemed to mean it  I invited myself to an attendance upon you here  at Naples  in such a manner as surely could not be construed an insult   I own  Grandison  you disconcerted me  I had intended to save you that journey   Was that your Lordship s meaning  when  in my absence  you called at my lodgings  the day after the farewel visit   Not absolutely  I was uneasy with myself  I intended to talk to you  What that talk might have produced  I know not  But had I invited you out  if I had found you at home  would you have answered my demands   According as you had put them   Will you answer them now  if I attend you as far as Rome  on your return to Florence   If they are demands fit to be answered   Do you expect I will make any that are not fit to be answered   My Lord  I will explain myself  You had conceived causeless prejudices against me  You seemed inclined to impute to me a misfortune that was not  could not be  greater to you than it was to me  I knew my own innocence  I knew that I was rather an injured man  in having hopes given me  in which I was disappointed  not by my own fault  Whom shall an innocent and an injured man fear —Had I feared  my fear might have been my destruction  For was I not in the midst of your friends  A foreigner  If I would have avoided you  could I  had you been determined to seek me —I would choose to meet even an enemy as a man of honour  rather than to avoid him as a malefactor  In my country  the law supposes flight a confession of guilt  Had you made demands upon me that I had not chosen to answer  I would have expostulated with you  I could   364 Perhaps have done so as calmly as I now speak  If you would not have been expostulated with  I would have stood upon my defence  But for the world I would not have hurt a brother of Clementina and Jeronymo  a son of the Marquis and Marchioness of Porretta  could I have avoided it  Had your passion given me any advantage over you  and I had obtained your sword  a pistol  had the choice been left to me  I had refused for both our sakes   I would have presented both swords to you  and bared my breast  It was before penetrated by the distresses of the dear Clementina  and of all your family—Perhaps I should only have said     If your
