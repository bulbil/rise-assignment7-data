who was first upon the will  had been declared illegitimate by parliament  and that act was never repealed  the same could be alledged against Elizabeth  but she had another foundation by being restored to her rights in her father s reign  the Queen of Scotland  Henry s eldest sister  could plead the illegitimacy of his two daughters  and Jane Grey might alledge the will of the last King in her favour   You have seen  in the last reign  the Earl of Warwick suppressing an insurrection of the people  afterwards becoming a favourite of the King  then   264 made Duke of Northumberland  next overturning the Duke of Somerset his rival  and at length pursuing the measures of the man whom he had destroyed  This nobleman s ambition did not rest here  he had hopes of securing the crown in his own family  and  with this view  he matched the lord Guilford Dudley  his son  with lady Jane Grey  whom  by his interest  he hoped to settle on the throne  He was hated by the people for his cruelties as much as the young lady was loved for her virtues  and this was the greatest obstacle to his design  I have been more prolix than usual upon this topic of the succession  but you should attend to it with care  in order to have a clear idea of the present and the succeeding reigns   Immediately upon the death of the young King  but two competitors put up for the crown  Mary  relying upon the justice of her pretensions  and Jane Grey  supported by the Duke of Northumberland  her father in law  Mary was strongly bigotted to the Popish superstitions  having been bred up in restraint  she was reserved and gloomy  she had  even during the life of her father  the resolution to maintain her sentiments and ceremonies  and refused to comply with his new institutions  her zeal had rendered her cruel  and she was not only blindly attached to her religious opinions  but even to the Popish clergy who maintained them  On the other hand  Jane Grey was attached to the Reformers  though yet but sixteen  her judgment had attained such a degree of perfection as few enjoy in their more advanced age  All historians agree  that the solidity of her understanding  improved by continual application  rendered her the wonder of her age  Ascham  tutor to Elizabeth  informs us  that  coming once to   265 wait upon her at her father s house in Leicestershire  he found her reading Plato s works in Greek  when all the rest of the family were hunting in the park  He seemed surprized at her being the only person absent from the diversions abroad  but she assured him    that Plato was an higher amusement to her than the most studied refinements of sensual pleasure   It was philosophy  and not ambition  which she seemed born for  when her ambitious father in law came to inform her of her advancement to the throne  she heard the news with sorrow  and accepted the proffered honour with reluctance  However  the intreaties of her friends  and the authority of her husband  at length reconciled her to her fortune  she was removed to the Tower  and soon after proclaimed at London  while the people shewed few of those marks of satisfaction which usually accompany a ceremony of this kind     Jane was proclaimed by the council  but the people were for Mary  The men of Suffolk rose in her favour  Norfolk soon joined her  and Lord Hastings  with four thousand men which were raised to oppose her  revolted to her side  It was in vain that the Duke of Northumberland attempted to lead his army against them  his soldiers deserted on the march  he found himself abandoned  and soon after the council itself  which he once governed  now freed from restraint  declared against him  Jane  who had but just been crowned  now saw herself again stripped of her dignities  and  without any reluctance  laid down an honour which she was at first compelled to accept  and which she held but nine days  Her father  the Duke of Suffolk  delivered up the Tower  of which he had the command  and her father in law  the Duke of Northumberland  being prevented   266 from flying out of the kingdom  pretended to be pleased at Mary s success  and was the first to fling up his cap when she was proclaimed in Cambridge   Mary now entered London  and  without the least effusion of blood  saw herself joyfully proclaimed  and peaceably settled on the throne  This was a juncture that seemed favourable to British happiness and liberty  a Queen  whose rights were the most equitable  in some measure elected by the people  the aristocracy of the last reign almost wholly suppressed  the house of commons  by this means  re instated in their former authority  the pride of the clergy humbled  and their vices detected  together with peace abroad and almost unanimity at home  This was the flattering prospect upon Mary s accession  but soon this pleasing phantom was dissolved  Mary was cruel and a bigot  she gave back their former power to her clergy  and the kingdom was
