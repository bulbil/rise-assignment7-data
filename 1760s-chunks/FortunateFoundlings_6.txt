 considering so strong a   propensity as something supernatural  at last consented   Never was joy   more sincere and fervent than what this grant occasioned  and he told   his benefactor that he doubted not but that hereafter he should hear   such an account of his behaviour  as would make him not repent his   having complied with his request       The preparations for his going to Oxford were now converted into others   of a different nature   Several of our troops were already sent to   Flanders  and others about to embark  in order to open the campaign  so   that there was but a small space between the time of Horatio s asking   leave to go  and that of his departure  which Dorilaus resolved should   be in a manner befitting a youth whom he had bred up as his own  He   provided him a handsome field equipage  rich cloaths  horses  and a   servant to attend him  and while these things were getting ready  had   masters to perfect him in riding  and those other exercises proper for   the vocation he was now entering into  all which he performed with so   good a grace  that not only Dorilaus himself  who might be suspected to   look on him with partial eyes  but all who saw him were   perfectly charmed       He was more than ordinarily tall for his years  admirably well   proportioned  and had something of a grave fierceness in his air and   deportment  that tho  he was not yet sixteen  he might very well have   passed for twenty  he was also extremely fair  had regular features  and   eyes the most penetrating  mixed with a certain sweetness  so that it   was difficult to say whether he seemed most formed for love or war       Dorilaus thinking it highly proper he should take his leave of Louisa    sent for her from the boarding school  that she might pass the short   time he had to stay with her brother at his house  not without some   hopes that the great tenderness there was between them might put Horatio   out of his resolution of going to the army  who being grown now   extremely dear to him  he could not think of parting with  tho  he had   yielded to it  without a great deal of reluctance       It is certain  indeed  that when she first heard the motive which had   occasioned her being sent for  her gentle breast was filled with the   most terrible alarms for her dear brother s danger  but the little   regard he seemed to have of it  and the high ideas he had of future   greatness  soon brought her to think as he did  and instead of   dissuading him from prosecuting his design  she rather encouraged him in   it  and in this gave the first testimony of a greatness of soul  no less   to be admired than the courage and laudable ambition which actuated that   of her brother       Dorilaus beheld with an infinity of satisfaction the success of his   endeavours  in favour of these amiable twins  and said within himself    how great a pity would it have been  if capacities such as theirs had   been denied the means of improvement       After the departure of Horatio  he kept Louisa some time with him  under   pretence of showing her the town  which before she had never seen  but   in reality to alleviate that melancholy which parting from her brother   had caused in him  He could not have taken a more effectual way  for   there was such an engaging and sweet cheerfulness in her conversation    added to many personal perfections  that it was scarce possible to think   of any thing else while she was present  She had also an excellent   voice  and played well on the bass viol and harpsicord  so that it is   hard to say whether he found most satisfaction in hearing her or   discoursing with her       But how dangerous is it to depend on one s own strength  against the   force of such united charms  Dorilaus  who  in the midst of a thousand   temptations  had maintained the entire liberty of his heart  and tho    never insensible of beauty  had never been enslaved by it  was now by   charms he least suspected  and at an age when he believed himself proof   against all the attacks of love  subdued without knowing that he was   so   The tender passion stole into his soul by imperceptible degrees    and under the shape of friendship and paternal affection  met with no   opposition from his reason  till it became too violent to be restrained    then showed itself in the whole power of restless wishes  fears  hopes
