to a ball  to which they had been invited by one of the   Magnifico s  The honour of the prince s company had been requested  but   he excused himself on account  as it was imagined  of his being engaged   with a certain German lady  who also being absent  gave room for this   conjecture  most of the gentlemen who had followed his highness from   France were there  among whom was the count de Bellfleur  and a young   gentleman called monsieur du Plessis  who  by a fall from his horse  had   been prevented from appearing in public since his arrival  The   gracefulness of his person  the gallant manner in which he introduced   himself  and the brilliant things he said to the ladies  on having been   so long deprived of the happiness he now enjoyed  very much attracted   the admiration of the company  but Louisa in particular thought she had   never seen any thing so perfectly agreeable  a sympathy of sentiment    more than accident  made him chuse her for his partner in a grand dance   then leading up  and the distinction now paid her by him gave her a   secret satisfaction  which she had never known before on such an   occasion  tho  often singled out by persons in more eminent stations       The mind which  whenever agitated by any degree of pain or pleasure    never fails to discover itself in the eyes  now sparkled in those of   Louisa with an uncommon lustre  nor had less influence over all her   air   her motions always perfectly easy  gentle and graceful  especially   in dancing  were now more spirituous  more alert than usual  and she so   much excelled herself  that several  who had before praised her skill in   this exercise  seemed ravished  as if they had seen something new and   unexpected   her partner was lavish in the testimonies of his   admiration  and said  she as much excelled the ladies of his country  as   they had been allowed to excel all others       The encomiums bestowed on her  and more particularly those she received   from him  still added fresh radiance to her eyes  and at the same time   diffused a modest blush in her checks which heightened all her   charms   Never had she appeared so lovely as at this time  and the count   de Bellfleur  in spight of his attachment to Melanthe  felt in himself a   strong propensity to renew those addresses which her reserved behaviour   alone had made him withdraw and carry to another  but the lady to whom   for some days past he had made a shew of devoting himself was present    and he was ashamed to give so glaring an instance of his infidelity    which must in all probability render him the contempt of both       This night  however  lost Melanthe the heart she had thought herself so   secure of  but little suspecting her misfortune  she treated the   inconstant count with a tenderness he was far from deserving  and having   transplanted all the affection she once had for Henricus on this new   object  told him  at a time that such discovery was least welcome to   him  that she was not insensible of his merit  nor could be ungrateful   to his passion  provided she could be convinced of the sincerity of it    He had gone too far with her now to be able to draw back  therefore   could not avoid repeating the vows he before had made  tho  his heart   was far from giving any asient to what his tongue was obliged to utter    but blinded by her own desires  she perceived not the change in his  and   appointed him to come the next day to her lodgings  promising to be   denied to all other company  that she might devote herself entirely   to him       It is possible he was so lost in his passion for Louisa  as not to be   sensible of the condescension made him by Melanthe  but it is certain    by the sequel of his behaviour  that he was much less so than he   pretended       The ball being ended  these ladies carried with them very different   emotions  tho  neither communicated to the other what she felt  Melanthe   had a kind of awe for those virtuous principles she observed in Louisa    tho  so much her inferior and dependant  and was ashamed to confess her   liking of the count should have brought her to such lengths  not that   she intended to keep it always a secret from her  but chose she should   find it out by degrees  and these thoughts so much engrossed her  that   she said little to her that night  Louisa  for her part  having lost the
