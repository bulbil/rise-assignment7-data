to an unlawful thing  when my principles commanded my assent   I was  at first setting out  by favour of friends  taken as clerk to a merchant  In profess of time I transacted his business at the Custom house  He taught me to make light of oaths of office  and this by degrees made me think light of all moral obligations  and laid the foundation of my ruin   My master s name was Bagenhall  He died  and I was to seek  His brother succeeded to his fortune  which was very large  He was brought up to no business  He was a gentleman  His seat is near Reading  I was recommended by him to the service of a gentleman who was nominated to go abroad on a foreign embassy  I will name his name  lest your honour should imagine I have any design to evade the strictest truth  Sir Christopher Lucas  I was to be this gentleman s master of the horse abroad   The first service my new master employed me in  was to try to get for him the pretty daughter of an honest farmer   I had been out of place for a twelvemonth  Had I had twenty shillings aforehand in the world  I would  I think  have said No  Nevertheless I consulted  in   239 confidence  my late master s brother upon it  The advice he gave me was  not to boggle at it  But if  he said  I could manage the matter so  as to cheat Sir Christopher  and get the girl for him  and keep the secret  he would give me 50 l  I abhorred the double treachery of young Mr  Bagenhall  But undertook to serve Sir Christopher  and carried on a treaty with the farmer for his daughter  as if she were to be the wife of Sir Christopher  but not to be owned till he returned from abroad  no  not even if she should prove with child   I found  in the course of my visits at the farmer s  so much honesty both in father and mother  and so much innocence in the daughter  that my heart relented  and I took an opportunity to reveal Sir Christopher s base design to them  for the girl was designed to be ruined the very first moment that Sir Christopher could be alone with her  Your honour may belive  that I injoined all three strict secrecy   Nevertheless this contriving devil of a master found a way to get the young woman by other means  and  in amorous dalliance  she told him to whom he was obliged for not succeeding before   In rage he turned me out of his service  in the most disgraceful manner  but without giving any other reasons  than that he knew me to be a villain  and that I knew myself to be one  Nor would he give me a character  So I was quite reduced  and but for the kindness of a sister  who keeps an inn in Smithfield  I should have starved  or been obliged to do worse   I should have told your honour  that the poor farmer and his wife both died of grief in half a year  An honest young man  who dearly loved the young woman  was found drowned soon after  It is feared he was his own executioner  Sir Christopher went not on his embassy  His preparations for it  and his expensive way of life  before and after  reduced him  And he has been long a beggar  as I may say  The poor   240 young woman is now  if living  on the town  I saw her about half a year ago in St  Martin s Round house  taken up as a common prostitute  and charged with picking a pocket  She was a pretty creature  and had a very pious turn  when I knew her first  Her father had gone beyond himself in her education  And this was the fruit  What has such a man as Sir Christopher to answer for —But it is come home to him  I rejoice that this wickedness was not added to my score   But heavy scenes I had enough afterwards  Being utterly destitute  except what my sister did for me  and not enduring to be a burden to her  I threw myself on my master Bagenhall  He employed me in mean offices  till his pander died  he is a very profligate man  Sir    and then he promoted me to a still meaner   In this way  I grew a shameless contriver  He introduced me to Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  and to Mr  Merceda  a Portuguse Jew  In the service of these three masters  good heaven forgive me  what villainies was I not the means of perpetrating  Yet I never was so hardened  but I had temporary remorses  But these three gentlemen would never let me rest from wickedness  Yet they kept me poor and necessitous  as the only means to keep me what they called honest  for they had often reason to think  that had I had any other means of subsistence  I would have been really honest   I was now Mr  Bagenhall s constant servant  Sir Hargrave and Mr  Merceda used
