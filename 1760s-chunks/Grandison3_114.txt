two religions  that you cannot consent that I should keep my own  What must I be  who think as highly of my own as you can of yours  to give it up  tho  on the highest temporal consideration  Make the case your own  my Lord   I can  And were I in your situation  such a woman as my sister  such a family as ours  such a splendid fortune as she will have  I believe  I should not make the scruples you do  My brother the Bishop indeed might not have given the same answer  He might be more tenacious   The Bishop cannot be better satisfied with his religion than I am with mine  But I hope  my Lord  from what you have said  that I may claim the honour of your friendship in this great article  It is proposed to me  that I renounce my religion  I make no such proposal to your family  On the contrary  I consent that Lady Clementina should keep hers  and I am ready to allow a very handsome provision for a discreet man  her confessor  to attend her  in order to secure her in it  As to residence  I will consent to reside   284 one year in Italy  one in England  and even  if she choose not to go to England at all  I will acquiesce  and visit England myself but for three months in every year   As to the children  Mr  Grandison  said Signor Jeronymo  desirous of promoting the compromise   I will consent that daughters shall be the mother s care  the education of sons must be left to me   What will the poor daughters have done  Chevalier  sneeringly spoke the General  that they should be left to perdition   Your Lordship  without my entering into the opinion of the professors of both religions on this subject  will consider my proposal as a compromise  I would not have began an address upon these terms with a princess  I do assure you  that mere fortune has no bias with me  Prescribe not to me in the article of religion  and I will  with all my soul  give up every ducat of your sister s fortune   Then what will you have to support—  My Lord  leave that to your sister and me  I will deal honourably with her  If she renounce me on that article  you will have reason to congratulate yourselves   Your fortune  Sir  by marriage  will be much more considerable than it can be by patrimony  if Clementina be yours  Why then should you not look forward to your posterity as Italians  And in that case—  He stopt there—It was easy to guess at his inference   I would no more renounce my Country than my Religion  I would leave posterity free  but would not deprive them of an attachment that I value myself upon  Nor yet my country  of a family that never gave it cause to be ashamed of it   The General took snuff  and looked on me  and off me  with an air too supercilious  I could not but be sensible of it   I have no small difficulty  my Lord  said I  to bear   285 the hardships of my situation  added to the distress which that situation gives me  to be looked upon in this family as a delinquent  without having done anything to reproach myself with  either in thought  word  or deed—My Lord  it is extremely hard   It is  my Lord  said Signor Jeronymo  The great misfortune in the case before us  is  that the Chevalier Grandison has merit superior to that of most men  and that our sister  who was not to be attached by common merit  could not be insensible to his   Whatever were my sister s attachments  Signor Jeronymo  we know yours  and generous ones they are  But we all know how handsome men may attach young Ladies  without needing to say a single word  The poison once taken in at the eye  it will soon diffuse itself through the whole mass   My honour  yet  my Lord  was never called in question  either by man or woman   Your character is well known  Chevalier—Had it not been unexceptionable  we should not have entered into treaty with you on this subject  I do assure you  and it piques us not a little to have a daughter of our house refused  You don t know the consequence  I can tell you  of such an indignity offered in this country   Refused  my Lord —To endeavour to obviate this charge  would be to put an affront upon your Lordship s justice  as well as an indignity offered to your truly noble house   He arose in anger  and swore that he would not be treated with contempt   I stood up too  And if I am  my Lord  with indiguity  it is not what I have been used to bear   Signor Jeronymo was disturbed  He said  He was against our seeing each other  He knew his brother s warmth  and I  he said  from the scenes that had before passed  ought
