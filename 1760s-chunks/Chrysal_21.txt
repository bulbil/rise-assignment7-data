up whole nights in it  as before  nor bought any more char    â  Coal  nor even oil for his lamp  but went to bed orderly when   we did        But this change came too late   for about six months   after  we found him one morning dead in his bed  though he   had been as cheery in the evening before as he had for a   long time        This was a great surprise and concern to us   But what    avails grief   We must all die  and he was a very old man    As soon as we were certain that he was dead  the first thing   my mother and I did  was to go to the turret  impatient enough   to take possession of our heirship  where  Lord help our poor   heads   did we find only a few great old books  and those   papers you got   the very bellows and tools7 and pots that we         PREFACE xixvtt     saw there before  being all gone  and no more sign of a workshop   to be seen than if it was not the same place we had been in   six months before  What he could have done with his things    we could not imagine  for we never observed him to carry them   out  so that we concluded he must have burned them        This was a sore disappointment to me  not to mention   the loss to my mother  to whom he owed a quarter s rent    besides an account of near twenty shilhngs in the shop   and   seven shillings and twopence halfpenny was all the money in   his pocket  nor did we ever find one penny more after him    though we searched close enough         Well   patience is a remedy for all things but death r   we were forced to submit  though I cannot help grieving   when I think of it  to this day  especially when I see Peg   Sprout  the green woman s daughter from Wapping  that   Jack Twist married out of despair  when I refused him  ride    by in her chaise  like a lady   and it is now thirty years ago     No   let me see  it will be exactly twenty nine years come    next Michaelmas   I am sure I have reason to remember it   well  for my poor mother took it so to heart that she never held   up her head after  till it finished her  in about nine years     though I cannot say but something else might have helped     for she took cruelly to drinking drams  though as she began   it to comfort her for this misfortune  it was all owing to that      that poor sister Bet  too       I was obliged to interrupt her here  by asking her what kind   of a person he was  or she would have gone on to give me the   history of her whole family      My curiosity being thus satisfied as to the author  there was   but one thing more that I desired to know  and that was  how   those papers came to have so many blots made in them  which   by the difference of ink  I could see was done long since the   first writing   To which she answered  that  some time after   the old man s death  her mother let his apartment to one that   called himself a clergyman  and was a great scholar  and used   to make almanacks and other books   that he had looked over   those papers  and  she beUeved  taken out such as he liked    and done what he pleased with the rest  for they set no regard   on them   and particularly she remembered to have heard   him say  that he would make something of one of them   but   she believed he found it would not do  for he soon after left   their house  and  joining with those Methodists that were just   then come up  went away with them  preaching about th    country      I thought it but reasonable to reward the good woman s    expense of breath with half a crown  and so took my leave            ixxviii PREFACE     though with a secret resolution to give her half the profit  if   there arises any  from the sale of the books   not thinking that   such a purchase as I had made from an ignorant woman could   â  give me a just title to the whole heirship  as she
