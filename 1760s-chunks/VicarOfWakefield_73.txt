more of him    —   Well then    said the Baronet    my request is  that you will permit this man and two of your servants to go upon a message by my authority  and as I am in the commission of the peace  I undertake to secure you    —   Your promise is sufficient    replied the other    and you may at a minute s warning send them over England whenever your honour thinks fit    In pursuance of the gaoler s compliance  Jenkinson was dispatched in search of Timothy Baxter  while we were amused with the assiduity of our youngest boy Bill  who had just come in and climbed up to Sir William s neck in order to kiss him  His mother was immediately going to chastise  Page  180  his familiarity  but the worthy man prevented her  and taking the child  all ragged as he was  upon his knee      What  Bill  you chubby rogue    cried he    do you remember your old friend Burchell  and Dick too  my honest veteran  are you here  you shall find I have not forgot you    So saying  he gave each a large piece of gingerbread  which the poor fellows eat very heartily  as they had got that morning but a very scanty breakfast   We now sate down to dinner  which was almost cold  but previously  my arm still continuing painful  Sir William wrote a prescription  for he had made the study of physic his amusement  and was more than moderately skilled in the profession  this being sent to an apothecary who lived in the place  my arm was dressed  and I found almost instantaneous relief  We were waited upon at dinner by the gaoler himself  who was willing to do our guest all the honour  Page  181  in his power  But before we had well dined  another message was brought from his nephew  desiring permission to appear  in order to vindicate his innocence and honour  with which request the Baronet complied  and desired Mr  Thornhill to be introduced     Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XII     Former benevolence now repaid with unexpected interest     MR  Thornhill made his entrance with a smile  which he seldom wanted  and was going to embrace his uncle  which the other repulsed with an air of disdain      No fawning  Sir  at present    cried the Baronet  with a look of severity    the only way to my heart is by the road of honour  but here I only see complicated instances of falsehood  cowardice  and oppression  How is it  Sir  that this poor man  for whom I know you professed a friendship  is used thus hardly  His daughter vilely seduced  as a recompence  Page  184  for his hospitality  and he himself thrown into a prison perhaps but for resenting the insult  His son too  whom you feared to face as a man—    Is it possible  Sir    interrupted his nephew    that my uncle could object that as a crime which his repeated instructions alone have persuaded me to avoid     Your rebuke    cried Sir William   is just  you have acted in this instance prudently and well  though not quite as your father would have done  my brother indeed was the soul of honour  but thou—yes you have acted in this instance perfectly right  and it has my warmest approbation     And I hope    said his nephew    that the rest of my conduct will not be found to deserve censure  I appeared  Sir  with this gentleman s daughter at some places  Page  185  of public amusement  thus what was levity  scandal called by a harsher name  and it was reported that I had debauched her  I waited on her father in person  willing to clear the thing to his satisfaction  and he received me only with insult and abuse  As for the rest  with regard to his being here  my attorney and steward can best inform you  as I commit the management of business entirely to them  If he has contracted debts and is unwilling or even unable to pay them  it is their business to proceed in this manner  and I see no hardship or injustice in pursuing the most legal means of redress     If this    cried Sir William    be as you have stated it  there is nothing unpardonable in your offence  and though your conduct might have been more generous in not suffering this gentleman to be oppressed by subordinate tyranny  yet it has been at least equitable    Page  186     He cannot contradict a single particular    replied the  Squire    I defy him to do so  and several of my servants are ready to attest what I say  Thus  Sir    continued he  finding that I was silent  for in fact I could not contradict him    thus
