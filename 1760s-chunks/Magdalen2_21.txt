of surprize and affliction —When I came here  I expected a friend that would sympathize with my sorrows  not a flatterer that would study to lessen the blackness of my crime  Human nature as  you say  madam  may be human nature    123 but be assured  notwithstanding the error which I have so recently committed  I have no wishes to gratify by a new sacrifice either of my peace or my character  and that I shall never be so lost to sentiment or shame as to accept the hand of a worthless fellow who was formerly discarded on account of his own profligacy  and who is now mean enough to build his hopes of success upon an opinion of mine  Excuse me Mrs  Darnel—You have a right to receive what company you please in your own house  but consider that I am under no necessity of remaining here to be affronted by your visitors—I have other relations  madam  in town  who I doubt not will favour me with protection  and if you will only suffer some body to order a chair I shall ease you directly of all uneasiness on my account       124Alarmed at a reply  which I dare say from my silence at first  she no way expected  Mrs  Darnel seemed greatly surprized that I should put so unaccountable a construction upon her words  if she seemed to speak slightly  she said  of a deviation from the spotless path s of innocence  it was on purpose to restore me to some degree of temper with myself  and if she had recommended Sir Harry Hastings to my consideration  it was entirely from a solicitude for my welfare  that deserved a very different return from such a severity of animadversion as I had been pleased to distinguish it with  Sir Harry was a man of good family and large fortune  unexceptionable in his person  and for aught she had ever heard to the contrary unexceptionable also in his manners  On these accounts she did not think him unworthy of my notice  however  since I was so averse to an interview with him    125 she would take care he should never visit at her house so long as I continued to honour her with my company  and that for the future I might be satisfied she would not drop a single syllable which was capable of giving me the least offence—Adding  that from the unremitting rectitude of her past life there could be no room to suppose she would now become an advocate for dishonour  or betray the cause of that virtue in the decline of her days  which in the giddiest part of her youth she had always regarded as the principal beauty of the female character   We are all of us  my dear Harriot  ready enough to believe  what we wish may be true  and Mrs  Darnel defended herself with such an appearance of integrity that I was grieved for the tartness of my reply  and begged she would excuse it on account of the distraction   126 with which my mind must at that time be naturally torn  I then let her into a few passages of Sir Harry s character  particularly his ruining the two Miss Nettervilles  his insolent attempt to run away with myself  for which you know my poor brother would have called him to a severe account had not Mr  Townshend put them both under an arrest  and mentioned some instances of his tyranny to inferiors  that had rendered him either contemptible or detested through all the country  Mrs  Darnel affected great surprize at these accounts  declaring she had never heard of any thing but his attempt to run away with me which could be mentioned to his prejudice— Even of that   says she    I heard but vaguely  I however set it down as a proof of that passion for you  which he still continues to express with the greatest vehemence  and which before I heard your sentiments    127 I did not know but the family might be induced to overlook     Matters continued entirely to my mind at Mrs  Darnel s  till lady Haversham took her leave of me  and went down on the scheme of reconciliation to the Hall  Mrs  Darnel then began to hint something of a concern for Sir Harry  and insinuated  though distantly  a fear  lest the amiable countess should prevail in her brother s favour  and lest after all I should be doomed to the arms of a man who was entitled to nothing but my eternal detestation—I again appeared extremly dissatisfied  she however  apologized  and we were again reconciled  but the night after  Harriot—the night after—Does not your heart ach with the strongest apprehensions for your poor Louisa —I know it does—and I even anticipate at this passage   128 the distress which I am sensible you must feel upon my account   Next morning after breakfast Mrs  Darnel told me she was in a great dilemma with regard to an engagement  which she had annually at Sir William Nicholson s in the next street    You must know my dear   says she   Sir William and his lady always celebrate the anniversary of their marriage  and for twenty years I have never been absent on that occasion—Now I would not for the world leave you alone—and yet I don t know how to get excused if
