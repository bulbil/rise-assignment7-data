my brother could not bear being absent from her  he travels with them  I wish he had stay d at Naples  I hope  however  he will be as ready  as you will find us all  to acknowlege the favour of this visit  and the fatigue and trouble you have given yourself on our account   As to my sister s bodily health  proceeded he  it is greatly impaired  We are almost hopeless  with regard to the state of her mind  She speaks not  she answers not any questions  Camilla is with her  She seems regardless of any body else  She has been told  that the General is married  His Lady makes great court to her  but she heeds her not  We are in hopes  that my mother  on her return to Bologna  will engage her attention  She never yet was so bad as to forget her duty  either to God  or her Parents  Sometimes Camilla thinks she pays some little attention to your name  but then she instantly starts  as in terror  looks round her with fear  puts her finger to her lips  as if she dreaded her cruel cousin Laurana   279 should be told of her having heard it mentioned   The Bishop and Father both regretted that she had been denied the requested interview  They were now  they said  convinced  that if that had been granted  and she had been left to Mrs  Beaumont s friendly care  a happy issue might have been hoped for  But now  said the Bishop—Then sighed  and was silent   I dispatched Saunders  early the next morning  to Bologna  to procure convenient lodgings for me  and Mr  Lowther   In the afternoon we set out for that city  The Count of Belvedere found an opportunity to let me know his unabated passion for Clementina  and that he had lately made overtures to marry her  notwithstanding her malady  having been advised  he said  by proper persons  that as it was not an hereditary  but an accidental disorder  it might be  in time  cureable  He accompanied us about half way in our journey  and  at parting  Remember  Chevalier  whispered he  that Clementina is the Soul of my hope  I cannot forego that hope  No other woman will I ever call mine   I heard him in silence  I admired him for his attachment  I pitied him  He said  he would tell me more of his mind at Bologna   We reached Bologna on the 15th  N  S  Saunders had engaged for me the lodgings I had before   Our conversation on the road turned chiefly on the case of Signor Jeronymo  The Bishop and Father were highly pleased with the skill  founded on practice  which evidently appeared in all that Mr  Lowther said on the subject  And the Bishop once intimated  that  be the event what it would  his journey to Italy should be made the most beneficial affair to him he had ever engaged in  Mr  Lowther replied  that as he was neither a necessitous nor a mean spirited man  and   280 had reason to be entirely satisfied with the terms I had already secured to him  he should take it unkindly  if any other reward were offered him   Think  my dear Dr  Bartlett  what emotions I must have on entering  once more  the gates of the Porretta palace  tho  Clementina was not there   I hastened up to my Jeronymo  who had been apprized of my arrival  The moment he saw me  Do I once more  said he  behold my friend  my Grandison  Let me embrace the dearest of men  Now  now  have I lived long enough  He bowed his head upon his pillow  and meditated me  his countenance shining with pleasure  in defiance of pain   The Bishop entered  he could not be present at our first interview   My Lord  said Jeronymo  make it your care that my dear friend be treated  by every soul of our family  with the gratitude and respect which are due to his goodness  Methinks I am easier and happier  this moment  than I have been for the tedious space of time since I last saw him  He named that space of time to the day  and to the very hour of the day   The Marquis and Marchioness signifying their pleasure to see me  the Bishop led me to them  My reception from the Marquis was kind  from his Lady it was as that of a mother to a long absent son  I had ever been  she was pleased to say  a fourth son in her eye  and now  that she had been informed that I had brought over with me a surgeon of experience  and the advice in writing of eminent physicians of my country  the obligations I had laid on their whole family  whatever were the success  were unreturnable   I asked leave to introduce Mr  Lowther to them  They received him with great politeness  and recommended their Jeronymo to his best skill  Mr  Lowther s honest heart was engaged  by a reception so kind  He never
