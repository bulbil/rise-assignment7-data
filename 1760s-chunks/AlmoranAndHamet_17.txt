 clamorous insolence  they demand as their due  as well may the sun   linger in his course  and the world mourn in darkness for the day  that   the glow worm may still be seen to glimmer upon  the earth  and the   owls and bats that haunt the sepulchres of the dead enjoy a longer   night  Yet this have I done  because this has been done by HAMET  and my   heart sickens in vain with the desire of beauty  because my power   extends not to ALMEIDA  With dominion undivided and ALMEIDA  I should be   ALMORAN  but without them  I am less than nothing        OMAR  who  before he has passed the pavilion  heard a sound which he   knew to be the voice of ALMORAN  returned hastily to the chamber in   which he left him  believing he had withdrawn too soon  and that the   king  as he knew no other was present  was speaking to him  he soon drew   near enough to hear what was said  and while he was standing torpid in   suspense  dreading to be discovered  and not knowing how to retire    ALMORAN turned about       At first  both stood motionless with confusion and amazement  bus   ALMORAN S pride soon surmounted his other passions  and his disdain of   OMAR gave his guilt the firmness of virtue        It is true   said he   that thou hast stolen the secret of my heart    but do not think  that I fear it should be known  though my poignard   could take it back with thy life  I leave it with thee  To reproach  or   curse thee  would do thee honour  and lift thee into an importance which   otherwise thou canst never reach   ALMORAN then turned from him with a   contemptuous frown  but OMAR caught him by the robe  and prostrating   himself upon the ground  intreated to be heard  His importunity at   length prevailed  and he attempted to exculpate himself  from the charge   of having insiduously intruded upon the privacy of his prince  but   ALMORAN sternly interrupted him   And what art thou   said he   that I   should care  whether thou art innocent or guilty    If not for my   sake   said OMAR   listen for thy own  and though my duty is despised    let my affection be heard  That thou art not happy  I know  and I now   know the cause  Let my lord pardon the presumption of his slave  he that   seeks to satisfy all his wishes  must be wretched  he only can be happy    by whom some are suppressed   At these words ALMORAN snatched his robe   from the hand of OMAR  and spurned him in a transport of rage and   indignation   The suppression of desire   said he   is such happiness    as that of the deaf who do not remember to have heard  If it is virtue    know  that  as virtue  I despise it  for though it may secure the   obedience of the slave  it can only degrade the prerogative of a prince    I cast off all restraint  as I do thee  begone  therefore  to HAMET  and   see me no more        OMAR obeyed without reply  and ALMORAN being again alone  the conflict   in his mind was renewed with greater violence than before  He felt all   that he had disguised to OMAR  with the keenest sensibility  and   anticipated the effects of his detection  with unutterable anguish and   regret  He walked backward and forward with a hasty but interrupted   pace  sometimes stopping short  and pressing his hand hard upon his   brow  and sometimes by violent gestures showing the agitation of his   mind  he sometimes stood silent with his eyes  fixed upon  the ground    and his arms folded together  and sometimes a sudden agony of thought   forced him into loud and tumultuous exclamations  he cursed the   impotence of mind that had suffered his thoughts to escape from him   unawares  without reflecting that he was even then repeating the folly    and while he felt himself the victim of vice  he could not suppress his   contempt of virtue   If I must perish   said he   I will at least perish   unsubdued  I will quench no wish that nature kindles in my bosom  nor   shall my lips utter any prayer  but for new powers to feed the flame        As he uttered this expression  he felt the palace shake  he heard a   rushing  like a blast in the desart  and a being of more than human   appearance stood before him  ALMORAN  though he
