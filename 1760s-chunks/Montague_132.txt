friendships  my sweet Colonel  I thought you had better ideas of things in general       Fitzgerald and I have been disputing on French and English manners  in regard to gallantry       The great question is  Whether a man is more hurt by the imprudent conduct of his daughter or his wife       Much may be said on both sides       There is some hazard in suffering coquetry in either  both contribute to give charms to conversation  and introduce ease and politeness into society  but both are dangerous to manners       Our customs  however  are most likely to produce good effects  as they give opportunity for love marriages  the only ones which can make worthy minds happy       The coquetry of single women has a point of view consistent with honor  that of married women has generally no point of view at all  it is  however of use pour passer le tems        As to real gallantry  the French style depraves the minds of men least  ours is most favorable to the peace of families       I think I preserve the balance of argument admirably       My opinion  however  is  that if people married from affection  there would be no such thing as gallantry at all       Pride  and the parade of life  destroy all happiness  our whole felicity depends on our choice in marriage  yet we chuse from motives more trifling than would determine us in the common affairs of life       I knew a gentleman who fancied himself in love  yet delayed marrying his mistress till he could afford a set of plate       Modern manners are very unfavorable to the tender affections       Ancient lovers had only dragons to combat  ours have the worse monsters of avarice and ambition       All I shall say further on the subject is  that the two happiest people I ever knew were a country clergyman and his wife  whose whole income did not exceed one hundred pounds a year       A pretty philosophical  sentimental  dull kind of an epistle this       But you deserve it  for not answering my last  which was divine       I am pleased with Emily s ideas about her dress at the masquerade  it is a proof you are still lovers       I remember  the first symptoms I discovered of my tendresse for Fitzgerald was my excessive attention to this article  I have tried on twenty different caps when I expected him at Silleri       Before we drop the subject of gallantries  I must tell you I am charmed with you and my sposo  for never giving the least hint before Emily and me that you have had any  it is a piece of delicacy which convinces me of your tenderness more than all the vows that ever lovers broke would do       I have been hurt at the contrary behaviour in Temple  and have observed Lucy to be so too  though her excessive attention not to give him pain prevented her shewing it  I have on such an occasion seen a smile on her countenance  and a tear of tender regret starting into her eyes       A woman who has vanity without affection will be pleased to hear of your past conquests  and regard them as victims immolated to her superior charms  to her  therefore  it is right to talk of them  but to flatter the heart  and give delight to a woman who truly loves  you should appear too much taken up with the present passion to look back to the past  you should not even present to her imagination the thought that you have had other engagements  we know such things are  but had rather the idea should not be awakened  I may be wrong  but I speak from my own feelings       I am excessively pleased with a thought I met with in a little French novel        Un homme qui ne peut plus compter ses bonnes fortunes  est de tous  celui qui connoît le moins les faveurs  C est le cœur qui les accorde    ce n est pas le cœur qu un homme à la mode intresse  Plus on est prôné par les femmes  plus il est facile de les avoir  mais moins il est possible de les enflammer        To which truth I most heartily set my hand   Twelve o clock       I have just heard from your sister  who tells me  Emily is turned a little natural philosopher  reads Ray  Derham  and fifty other strange old fellows that one never heard of  and is eternally poring through a microscope to discover the wonders of creation       How amazingly learned matrimony makes young ladies  I suppose we shall have a volume of her discoveries bye and bye       She says too  you have little pets like sweethearts  quarrel and make it up again in the most engaging manner in the world       This is just what I want to bring Fitzgerald to  but the perverse monkey won t quarrel with me  do all I can  I am sure this is not my fault  for I give him reason every day of his life       Shenstone says admirably   That reconciliation is the
