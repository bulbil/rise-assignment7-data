repeat it  the English seem more polite than any of their neighbours  their great art in this respect lies in endeavouring  while they oblige  to lessen the force of the favour  Other countries are fond of obliging a stranger  but seem desirous that he should be sensible of the obligation  The English confer their kindness with an appearance of indifference  and give away benefits with an air as if they despised them   Walking a few days ago between an English and a Frenchman into the suburbs of the city  we were overtaken by a heavy shower of rain  I was unprepared  but they had each large coats  which defended them from what seemed to me a perfect inundation  The Englishman seeing me shrink from the weather  accosted me thus   Psha  man  what dost shrink at  here  take this coat  I don t want it  I find it no way useful to me  I had as lief be without it   The Frenchman began to shew his politeness in turn   My dear friend    14 cries he   why wont you oblige me by making use of my coat  you see how well it defends me from the rain  I should not chuse to part with it to others  but to such a friend as you  I could even part with my skin to do him service    From such minute instances as these  most reverend Fum Hoam  I am sensible your sagacity will collect instruction  The volume of nature is the book of knowledge  and he becomes most wise who makes the most judicious selection  Farewell   LETTER V  To the same   I Have already informed you of the singular passion of this nation for politics  An Englishman not satisfied with finding by his own prosperity the contending powers of Europe properly balanced  desires also to know the precise value of every weight in either scale  To gratify this curiosity  a leaf of political instruction is served up every morning with tea  When our politician has feasted upon this  he repairs to a coffee house  in order to ruminate upon what he has read  and encrease his collection  from thence he proceeds to the ordinary  enquires what news  and treasuring up every acquisition there  hunts about all the evening in quest of more  and carefully adds it to the rest  Thus at night he retires home  full of the important advices of the day  When lo  awaking next morning  he finds the instructions of yesterday a collection of absurdity or palpable falshood  This  one would think  a mortifying repulse in the   15 pursuit of wisdom  yet our politician no way discouraged  hunts on  in order to collect fresh materials  and in order to be again disappointed   I have often admired the commercial spirit which prevails over Europe  have been surprised to see them carry on a traffic with productions  that an Asiatic stranger would deem entirely useless  It is a proverb in China  that an European suffers not even his spittle to be lost  the maxim  however  is not sufficiently strong  since they sell even their Lies to great advantage  Every nation drives a considerable trade in this commodity with their neighbours   An English dealer in this way  for instance  has only to ascend to his work house  and manufacture a turbulent speech averred to be spoken in the senate  or a report supposed to be dropt at court  a piece of scandal that strikes at a popular Mandarine  or a secret treaty between two neighbouring powers  When finished  these goods are baled up  and consigned to a factor abroad  who sends in return two battles  three sieges  and a shrewd letter filled with dashes — blanks and stars      of great importance   Thus you perceive  that a single gazette is the joint manufacture of Europe  and he who would peruse it with a philosophical eye  might perceive in every paragraph something characteristick of the nation to which it belongs  A map does not exhibit a more distinct view of the boundaries and situation of every country  than its news does a picture of the genius  and the morals of its inhabitants  The superstition and erroneous delicacy of Italy  the formality of Spain    16 the cruelty of Portugal  the fears of Austria  the confidence of Prussia  the levity of France  the avarice of Holland  the pride of England  the absurdity of Ireland  and the national partiality of Scotland  are all conspicuous in every    But  perhaps  you may find more satisfaction in a real news paper  than in my description of one  I therefore send a specimen  which may serve to exhibit the manner of their being written  and distinguish the characters of the various nations which are united in its composition   NAPLES  We have lately dug up here a curious Etruscan monument  broke in two in the raising  The characters are scarce visible  but Nugosi  the learned antiquary  supposes it to have been erected in honour of Picus  a Latin King  as one of the lines may be plainly dinstinguished to begin with a P  It is hoped this discovery will produce something valuable  as the literati of our
