not that your soul should perish eternally  though your earthly honour is for ever lost   At these words he drew his dagger  Estephania  just speechless with terror  throwing herself at his feet  besought him with uplifted hands and inarticulate agony  to tell her why he raised his arm against her life  If he suspected her fidelity  she called heaven to attest her innocence   In vain  in vain  replied the infuriated murderer  your treason is but too well proved  My information is not to be contradicted  Don Huberto         Ah  my lord  interrupted she with eager haste  you must hold your trust aloof from Don Huberto  He is less your friend than you imagine  If he has said aught against my virtue  believe him not  Restrain that infamous tongue  replied Don Anastasio  By appealing against Hordales  you condemn yourself  You would ruin your relation in my esteem  because he is acquainted with your misconduct  You would invalidate his evidence against you  but the artifice is palpable  and only whets my appetite for vengeance  My dear husband  rejoined the innocent Estephania  while her tears flowed in torrents  beware of this blind rage  If you follow its instigation  you will perpetrate a deed for which you will hate yourself  when convinced of its injustice  In the name of heaven  compose your disordered spirits  At least give me time to clear up your suspicions  you will then deal candidly by a wife who has nothing to reproach herself with   Any other than Don Anastasio would have been touched by her pleadings  and still more by her agonizing affliction  but the barbarian  far from being softened  ordered the lady once again to recommend herself briefly to mercy  and lifted his arm to strike the blow  Hold  inhuman as you are  cried she  If your love for me is as if it had never been  if my lavish fondness in return is all blotted from your memory  if my tears have no eloquence to disarm your hellish purpose  have some pity on your own blood  Launch not your frantic hand against an innocent  who has not yet breathed this vital air  You cannot be its executioner without the curse of heaven and earth  As for myself  I can forgive my murderer  but the butcher of his own child  think deeply of it  must pay the dreadful forfeit of so detestable a deed   Determined as Don Anastasio was to pay no attention to anything Estephania could say  he could not help being affected by the frightful images these last words presented to his soul  Wherefore  as if apprehensive lest nature should play the traitress to revenge  he hastened to make sure of his staggering resolves  and plunged his dagger into her bosom  She fell motionless on the ground  He thought her dead  and on that supposition left his house immediately to be no more seen at Antequera   In the mean time  the unhappy victim of groundless suspicion was so stunned with the blow she had received  as to remain for a short interval on the ground without any signs of life  Afterwards  coming to herself  she brought an old female servant to her assistance by her plaints and lamentations  That good old woman  beholding her mistress in so deplorable a state  waked the whole household and even the neighbourhood by her cries  The room was soon filled with spectators  Surgical assistance was sent for  The wound was probed  and pronounced not to be mortal  Their opinion turned out to be correct  for Estephania soon recovered  and was in due time delivered of a son  not withstanding the cruel circumstances in which she had been placed  That son  Signor Gil Blas  you behold in me  I am the fruit of that dreadful pregnancy   Women  when chaste as ice  when pure as snow  seldom escape calumny  this plague  however  though virtue s dowry  did not alight upon my mother  The bloody scene passed in common fame for the transport of a jealous husband  My father  it is true  bore the character of a passionate man  prone to kindle into fury on the slightest occasion  Hordales could not but suppose that his kinswoman must suspect him of having sown wild fancies in the mind of Don Anastasio  so that he satisfied himself with this imperfect relish of revenge  and ceased to importune her  But  not to be tedious  I shall pass over the detail of my education  Suffice it to say  that my principal exercise was fencing  which I practised regularly in the most famous schools of Grenada and Seville  My mother waited with impatience till I was of age to measure swords with Don Huberto  that she might instruct me in the grounds of her complaint against him  In my eighteenth year she submitted her cause to my arbitrement  not without floods of tears  and every symptom of the deepest anguish  What must not a son feel  if he has the spirit and the heart of a son  at the sight of a mother in such distressing circumstances  I went immediately and called out Hordales  our place of meeting was private as it should be  we fought long and furiously
