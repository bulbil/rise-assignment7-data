such impertinence should a second time arise  I shall think        myself obliged to make a confidante of my husband  whose good sense        and penetration will  doubtless  enable him to discover the author         and his spirit and courage instruct him in what manner to resent        the affront offered to his ever faithful  and most affectionate        wife            B  MUNDEN        This had all the effect she wished it should have  the beau was ashamed   of the fruitless attack he had made  wrote to her no more  avoided her   sight as much as possible  and  whenever chance brought him into her   company  behaved towards her with all the distance and respect   imaginable       This lady  now fully convinced how dangerous it was to be too much   admired for her external charms  ceased even to wish they should be   taken notice of  and set herself seriously about improving those   perfections of the mind which she was sensible could alone entitle her   to the esteem of the virtuous and the wife       Mr  Munden  who had never been disquieted at the former part of his   wife s behaviour  was equally insensible of this alteration in her  his   cares  indeed  were too much taken up for re establishing himself with   his right honourable patron  to give any attention to what passed at   home       After much debating with himself  he thought it best to proceed so as   not to let the noble lord imagine he was acquainted with any part of the   attempt made upon his wife  but  though he attended his levee as usual    and seemed rather more obsequious than ever  he had the mortification   to find himself very coolly received  He stood undistinguished in the   circle which constantly waited the motions of that great man  was   scarcely spoken to by him  and then with a kind of indrawn reserve    which made him justly enough apprehensive that he had little now to hope   for from him       The truth is  he saw through the policy of this dependant  he could not   doubt but Mrs  Munden had told him of the violence he had offered to   her  he was conscious of the baseness of it  but he was not angry with   himself for it  though with the person he would have injured  and could   not forgive him for the knowledge of his crime  though the other was   willing to forgive the crime itself       The treatment he received at Lord      s made him extremely churlish to   his wife  he looked upon her as the primary cause of his misfortune    cursed his marriage with her  and even hated her for the beauties and   good qualities which should have endeared her to him  Nothing she could   say or do had the power of pleasing him  so that she stood in need of   all her courage and fortitude to enable her to support  with any   tolerable degree of patience  the usage she received       To heighten her misfortune  the late levity of her temper had hindered   her from cultivating an acquaintance with any one person  on whose   secrecy  sincerity  and sedateness  she could enough depend for the   disburdening her mind of those vexations with which it was sometimes   overwhelmed       But this was a matter of disquiet to her which she had not long to   complain of  Heaven sent her a consolation of which she had not the   least distant expectation  and restored her to a friend  by whom she had   thought herself utterly forsaken  and whom she had not herself scarce   thought of for a long time       Lady Loveit was now but just returned from the country  where she had   continued ever since her marriage to Sir Bazil  A famous French milliner   being lately arrived from Paris with abundance of curiosities  her   ladyship went to see if there was any thing she should think worth the   purchasing  Mrs  Munden was led by the same curiosity  and it was at   this woman s house that these ladies happened to meet after so long an   absence from each other       Mrs  Munden was a little confused at first sight of her  as bringing to   her mind some passages which it was never in her power to think on with   the indifference she wished to do  They embraced  however  with a great   deal of affection  made each other the usual compliments on the mutual   change of their condition  for Lady Loveit
