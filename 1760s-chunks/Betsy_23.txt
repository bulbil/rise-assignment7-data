 and  as one would think  insignificant in   itself  lay broiling in the minds of both mother and daughter  and they   waited only for an opportunity of venting their spite  in such a manner   as should not make them appear to have the least tincture of so foul and   mean a passion  but as neither of them were capable of a sincere   friendship  and had no real regard for any one besides themselves  their   displeasure was of little consequence       Preparations for the journey of the young ladies seemed  for the   present  to employ all their thoughts  and diligence enough was used to   get every thing ready against the time prefixed  which wanted but three   days of being expired  when an unforeseen accident put an entire stop to   it       Miss Betsy received a letter from her brother  Mr  Francis Thoughtless    accompanied with another to Mr  Goodman  acquainting them  that he had   obtained leave from the head of the college to pass a month in London    that he should set out from Oxford in two days  and hoped to enjoy the   satisfaction of being with them in twelve hours after this letter  What   could she now do  it would have been a sin  not only against natural   affection  but against the rules of common good manners  to have left   the town  either on the news of his arrival  or immediately after it    nor could Lady Trusty expect  or desire she should entertain a thought   of doing so  she was too wise and too good not to consider the interest   of families very much depended on the strict union among the branches of   it  and that the natural affection between brothers and sisters could   not be too much cultivated  Far  therefore  from insisting on the   promise Miss Betsy had made of going with her into the country  she   congratulated her on the happy disappointment  and told her  that she   should receive her with a double satisfaction  if  after Mr  Francis   returned to Oxford  she would come and pass what then remained of the   summer season with her  This Miss Betsy assured her ladyship she would   do  so that  according to all appearance  the benefits she might have   received  by being under the eye of so excellent an instructress were   but delayed  not lost                CHAPTER VIII       Relates how  by a concurrence of odd circumstances  Miss Betsy was   brought pretty near the crisis of her fate  and the means by which she   escaped          Mr  Francis Thoughtless arrived in town the very evening before the day   in which Sir Ralph Trusty and his lady were to set out for L    e  They   had not seen this young gentleman since the melancholy occasion of his   father s funeral  and would have been glad to have spent some time with   him  but could no way put off their journey  as word was sent of the day   in which they expected to be at home  Sir Ralph knew very well that a   great number of his tenants and friends would meet them on the road  and   a letter would not reach them soon enough to prevent them from being   disappointed  they supped with him  however  at Mr  Goodman s  who would   not permit him to have any other home than his house during his stay in   town  Lady Trusty  on taking leave of Miss Betsy  said to her  she hoped   she would remember her promise when her brother was returned to Oxford    on which  she replied  that she could not be so much an enemy to her own   happiness as to fail       Miss Betsy and this brother had always been extremely fond of each   other  and the length of time they had been asunder  and the improvement   which that time had made in both  heightened their mutual satisfaction   in meeting       All that troubled Miss Betsy now was  that her brother happened to come   to London at a season of the year in which he could not receive the   least satisfaction  the king was gone to Hanover  all the foreign   ministers  and great part of the nobility attended him  and the rest   were retired to their country seats  so that an entire stop was put to   all publick diversions worth seeing  There were no plays  no operas  no   masquerades  no balls  no publick shews  except at the Little Theatre in   the Hay Market  then known by the name of F    g s scandal shop  because   he frequently exhibited there certain drolls
