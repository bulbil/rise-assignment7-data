he said  and averred  that his arguments were invincible  They extolled him above all the divines of the age  and at once confirmed his pride and his prejudices  the result of the argument was  that Lambert had his choice  either to abj… his opinions or to be burnt as an obstinate he… Lambert chose to die rather than for……hat he 〈◊〉 considered as the truth  and 〈◊〉…tence was soon after executed in Smithfi…〈…〉 his legs and thighs were burnt off  there not …ing fire enough to consume the rest  two of the officers  raising his body up with   255 their halberds  pushed it into the flames  where it was soon consumed to ashes   It was not without reason  therefore  that the present Queen concealed her sentiments  and behaved with caution  upon this account she durst not intercede for three Protestants  who were burnt at Windsor just after her marriage  she once  indeed  attempted to argue with the King  but it had like to have cost her her life  wherefore afterwards she suffered the divines on each side to dispute  and the executioner to destroy  During these transactions the King would frequently assemble the houses of parliament  and harangue them with florid orations  in which he would aver  that never Prince had a greater affection for his people  or was more beloved by them  In every pause of his discourse  some of his creatures  near his person  would begin to applaud  and this was followed by loud acclamations from the rest of the audience   It is  indeed  astonishing  to what a pitch of cruelty he attained  and to what a state of servility his people  I can account for either in no other manner  than that religious disputes had now so divided the people  and set one against the other  that the King  availing himself of the universal weakness which was produced by universal dissension  became the tyrant of all   But nature  at last  seemed kindly willing to rid the world of a monster that man was unable to destroy  Henry had been troubled  for some time  with a disorder in his leg  which was now grown very painful  this  added to his monstrous corpulency  which rendered him unable to stir  made him more furious than a chained lion  he became froward and untractable  none dared to approach   256 him without trembling  He had been ever stern and severe  he was now outrageous  flattery had corrupted all his senses  he deemed it an unpardonable crime to controvert those opinions which he himself was changing every hour  His courtiers  contending among themselves  and conspiring the death of each other  had no inclination to make an enemy of him  Thus he continued  for four years  the terror of all and the tormentor of himself  at length his end approached  he perceived he had not long to live  his fat increasing and his leg growing worse  He had already slaughtered several favourites  raised from obscure stations to share his dignities and his cruelty  More  Fisher  Cromwell  and others  died upon the scaffold  and Wolsey prevented it by his own death  he was resolved to make one victim more before he left the world  and that was the Duke of Norfolk  who had formerly suppressed a rebellion excited against him  and who had  all along  been the vigilant minister of his commands  This nobleman had  outwardly  complied with the reformation  but  in his heart  favoured the Pope  the King knew this  and only wanted a pretext to put him and his son  the Earl of Surry  to death  it was no difficult matter to find one  the son had used the arms of Edward the Confessor in his escutcheon  and the father had left a blank space in his own where they might be inserted  This was all the crime alledged against them  but it was sufficient when the King gave his opinion that it was his will they should die  The Earl of Surry was beheaded upon Tower hill  and a warrant sent to the Lieutenant of the Tower to cut off the Duke of Norfolk s head in two days following  this sentence was just upon the point of being executed    257 when the King s own death gave him an unexpected reprieve  Henry had been suffered to languish without any of his domestics having the courage to warn him of his approaching end  they who had ever come near him with trembling  now dreaded to give him this friendly admonition  At length Sir Anthony Denny had the charity to inform him of his situation  he thanked this courtier for his friendly admonition  and soon after expired  full of sorrow for his former guilt  and with all the horrors of approaching dissolution   Some Sovereigns have been tyrants from contradiction and revolt  some from being misled by favourites  and some from a spirit of party  but Henry was cruel from disposition alone  cruel in the government  cruel in religion  and cruel in his family  yet  tyrant as he was  he died peaceably a natural death  while Henry VI  the most harmless of all Monarchs  was dethroned  imprisoned  and assassinated  It is a folly and a wickedness to
