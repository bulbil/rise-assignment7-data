by storms  and the crews more than half destroyed by cold and distemper   When the news of these disasters arrived  great commotion arose in the council  The Dairo Got hama baba fluttered  and clucked and cackled and hissed like a goose disturbed in the act of incubation  Quamba cun dono shed bitter tears  the Cuboy snivelled and sobbed  Sti phi rum poo groaned  Gottomio swore  but the sea Sey seo gun Nin kom poo po underwent no alteration  He sat as the emblem of insensibility  fixed as the north star  and as cold as that luminary  sending forth emanations of frigidity  Fika ka  mistaking this congelation for fortitude  went round and embraced him where he sat  exclaiming     My    79 dear Day  Sey seo gun  what would you advise in this dilemma    But the contact had almost cost him his life  for the touch of Nin kom poo po  thus congealed  had the same effect as that of the fish called Torpor  The Cuboy s whole body was instantly benumbed  and if his friends had not instantly poured down his throat a considerable quantity of strong spirit  the circulation would have ceased  This is what philosophers call a generation of cold  which became so intense  that the mercury in a Japonese thermometer constructed on the same principles which were afterwards adopted by Fahrnheit  and fixed in the apartment  immediately sunk thirty degrees below the freezing point     The first astonishment of the council was succeeded by critical remarks and argumentation  The Dairo consoled himself by observing  that his troops made a very soldierly    80 appearance as they lay on the field in their new cloathing  smart caps  and clean buskins  and that the enemy allowed they had never seen beards and whiskers in better order  He then declared  that should a war ensue with China  he would go abroad and expose himself for the glory of Japan  Foksi roku expressed his surprize  that a general should march his army through a wood in an unknown country  without having it first reconnoitred  but the Fatzman assured him  that was a practice never admitted into the discipline of Japan  Gotto mio swore the man was mad to stand with his men  like oxen in a stall  to be knocked on the head without using any means of defence     Why the devil  said he  did not he either retreat  or advance to close engagement with the handful of Chinese who formed the ambuscade     I hope  my dear Quanbuku   replied the    81 Fatzman  that the troops of Japan will always stand without flinching  I should have been mortified beyond measure  had they retreated without seeing the face of the enemy —that would have been a disgrace which never befel any troops formed under my direction  and as for advancing  the ground would not permit any manoeuvre of that nature  They were engaged in a cul de sac  where they could not form either in hollow square  front line  potence  column or platoon —It was the fortune of war  and they bore it like men —we shall be more fortunate on another occasion    The president Soo san sin o  took notice  that if there had been one spaniel in the whole Japonese army  this disaster could not have happened  as the animal would have beat the bushes and discovered the ambuscade  He therefore proposed  that if the war was to be prosecuted in Fatsissio     82 which is a country overgrown with wood  a number of blood hounds might be provided and sent over  to run upon the foot in the front and on the flanks of the army  when it should be on its march through such impediments  Quamba cun dono declared  that soldiers had much better die in the bed of honour  than be saved and victorious  by such an unmilitary expedient  that such a proposal was so contrary to the rules of war and the scheme of enlisting dogs so derogatory from the dignity of the service  that if ever it should be embraced  he would resign his command  and spend the remainder of his life in retirement  This canine project was equally disliked by the Dairo  who approved of the Fatzman s objection  and sealed his approbation with a pedestrian salute of such momentum  that the Fatzman could hardly stand under the weight of the compliment  It was    83 agreed that new levies should be made  and a new squadron of Fune equipped with all expedition  and thus the assembly broke up     Fortune had not yet sufficiently humbled the pride of Japan  That body of Chinese which defeated Koan  made several conquests in Fastsissio  and seemed to be in a fair way of reducing the whole island  Yet  the court of China  not satisfied with this success  resolved to strike a blow  that should be equally humiliating to the Japonese  in another part of the world  Having by specious remonstrances already prepossessed all the neighbouring nations against the government of Japan  as the patrons of perfidy and piracy  they fitted out an armament  which was intended to subdue the island of Motao on the coast of Corea  which the Japonese had taken in a
