  you will find all as fair as a new cable    But I must give you one point to direct your reckoning by  and that   is this   You bade me buy a sliip and freight her  and so forth    and she and the cargo should be my own after I had done your job   this trip  Now  owner  it is very true that a less vessel than this   might have made the run  but then you seemed so desirous to be   safe that I thought it best to make a bargain in this stout ship    which I knew to be as good a sea boat as ever turned to windward    and able to go  hank for hank  with anything that swims the sea    as we showed when we run the Frenchman out of sight yesterday    though it went against my heart to do it  But no matter for that   now   the ship is yours  and you have a right to be obeyed  How    ever  there is the account  and here is the rest of your money  of   which I did not lay out a shilling that I could avoid  but one guinea    which I gave Will Crosstree to repair his rigging  and one I gave   Black Moll of Wapping to heave down   and I could not well avoid   those neither  for Will was an old messmate  and I owed Moll for   many a good turn in her way  But all this signifies nothing to you     they can be stopped in the account  And now  owner  as you may   think this ship cost too much  and that the cargo is too good  I   will not keep you to your bargain   she is your own  and all that is   in her  only pay the men  As for me  I am satisfied with having   got out of that damned Inquisition  and leave the rest to yourself    If you think that I have deserved anything  well and good  if not    I do not f   ar bread while the sea fiows round Old England   all that   grieves me is that you would not let us set iire to the Inquisition    amd cut the Inquisitor s throat        If my master s bluntness in the affair of the French ship gave   offence to his owner  the honesty of his speech restored him to   his wr i mest esteem  and made Pheron  who was present  cry out   in a rapture â€”   Thank Heaven there is still some honesty among   mankind          Honesty   Ay    replied my master    a little among the tars   of Old England   a little         The Inquisitor having recovered from the astonishment into   which such nobleness of soul threw him  returned the account un    opened  with these words     I am convinced your account must be   just  and I freely make you a gift  not of this ship and cargo  for   they are justly your own already  but of the rest of the money which   is in your hands          What   All  ovmeT  all           All  mj  friend   if it were many times so much  you justly   merit it            ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 293       But then  owner  had you not better sign the account  if you   please  for fear of after reckonings with your executors   for I hate   the law damnably  ever since I lost a year s pay for hindering our   boatswain s mate s brother from beating his wife   the brimstone   swore I beat her husband  and so I paid for meddling   but it was   the la  vyer s fault that set her on  Damn all lawyers  say I         Well  then  my honest worthy friend  there is a receipt  and I   wish you success equal to your merit   and you cannot have more          Enough said  owner  enough said   I thank you  I thank you        The remainder of our voyage was one continued scene of happi    ness  My master landed his passengers at Alexandria  from whence   they soon set out for Pheron s country  and  at his talcing leave of   them  advised them to be careful how they ventured in any of the   ships of those countries  which  he assured them  were not better   than bum boats  nor did their mariners
