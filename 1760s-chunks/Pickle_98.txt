with a  bottle of wine  The people in question were a gentleman and his lady  lately arrived from England  in their way to Paris  The husband was  a man of good fortune  who had been a libertine in his youth  and a  professed declaimer against matrimony  He wanted neither sense nor  experience  and piqued himself in particular upon his art of avoiding  the snares of the female sex  in which he pretended to be deeply versed   but  notwithstanding all his caution and skill  he had lately fallen a  sacrifice to the attractions of an oyster wench  who had found means  to decoy him into the bands of wedlock  and  in order to evade the  compliments and congratulations of his friends and acquaintance  he had  come so far on a tour to Paris  where he intended to initiate his spouse  in the beau monde  In the mean time  he chose to live upon the reserve   because her natural talents had as yet received but little cultivation   and he had not the most implicit confidence in her virtue and  discretion  which  it seems  had like to have yielded to the addresses  of an officer at Canterbury  who had made shift to insinuate himself  into her acquaintance and favour   Peregrine s curiosity being inflamed by this information  he lounged  about the yard  in hopes of seeing the dulcinea who had captivated the  old bachelor  and at length observing her at a window  took the liberty  of bowing to her with great respect  She returned the compliment with a  curtsy  and appeared so decent in her dress and manner  that unless he  had been previously informed of her former life and conversation  he  never would have dreamt that her education was different from that  of other ladies of fashion  so easy is it to acquire that external  deportment on which people of condition value themselves so much  Not  but that Mr  Pickle pretended to distinguish a certain vulgar audacity  in her countenance  which in a lady of birth and fortune would have    6 22 15  3 45 PM   passed for an agreeable vivacity that enlivens the aspect  and gives  poignancy to every feature  but as she possessed a pair of fine eyes   and a clear complexion overspread with a glow of health  which never  fails of recommending the owner  he could not help gazing at her with  desire  and forming the design of making a conquest of her heart   With this view  he sent his compliments to her husband whose name was  Hornbeck  with an intimation that he proposed to set out the next day  for Paris  and as he understood that he was resolved upon the same  journey  he should be extremely glad of his company on the road  if he  was not better engaged  Hornbeck  who in all probability did not choose  to accommodate his wife with a squire of our hero s appearance  sent a  civil answer to his message  professing infinite mortification at his  being unable to embrace the favour of this kind offer  by reason of  the indisposition of his wife  who  he was afraid  would not be in a  condition for some days to bear the fatigue of travelling   This rebuff  which Peregrine ascribed to the husband s jealousy  stifled  his project in embryo  he ordered his French servant to take a place  for himself in the diligence  where all his luggage was stowed  except a  small trunk  with some linen and other necessaries  that was fixed upon  the post chaise which they hired of the landlord  and early next morning  he and Mr  Jolter departed from Calais  attended by his valet de chambre  and Pipes on horseback  They proceeded without any accident as far  as Boulogne  where they breakfasted  and visited old Father Graham  a  Scottish gentleman of the governor s acquaintance  who had lived as a  Capuchin in that place for the space of threescore years  and during  that period conformed to all the austerities of the order with the most  rigorous exactness  being equally remarkable for the frankness of his  conversation  the humanity of his disposition  and the simplicity of his  manners  From Boulogne they took their departure about noon  and as they  proposed to sleep that night at Abbeville  commanded the postilion to  drive with extra ordinary speed  Perhaps it was well for his cattle that  the axletree gave way and the chaise of course overturned  before they  had travelled one third part of the stage   This accident compelled them to return to the place from whence they had  set out  and as they could not procure another conveyance  they found  themselves under the necessity of staying till their chaise could be  refitted  Understanding that this operation would detain them a whole  day  our young gentleman had recourse to his patience  and demanded  to know what they could have for dinner  the garcon or waiter  thus  questioned  vanished in a moment  and immediately they were surprised  with the appearance of a strange figure  which  from the
