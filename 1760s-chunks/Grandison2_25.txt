Divine Laws  and have not  when we meet  as private subjects  the Mareschal s  nor even the Goths excuse  I think the example worthy consideration   And if  gentlemen  I have argued before now  or should I hereafter argue  as follows  to a challenger  shall I deserve either to branded or insulted    Of what use are the Laws of society  if magistracy may be thus defied  Were I to accept of your challenge  and were you to prevail against me  who is to challenge you  and if you fall  who him  by whose sword you perish  Where  in short  is the evil to stop  But I will not meet you  My system is self defence and self defence only  Put me upon that  and I question not but you will have cause to repent it  A premeditated revenge is that which I will not meet you to gratify  I will not dare to risque the rushing into my Maker s presence from the consequences of an act  which cannot  in the man that falls  admit of repentance  and leaves for the survivor s portion nothing but bitter remorse  I fear not any more the reproaches of men  than your insults on this occasion  Be the latter offered to me at your peril  It is perhaps as happy for you as for myself  that I have a fear of an higher nature  Be the event what it will  the test you would provoke me to  can decide nothing as to the justice of the cause on either side  Already you will find me disposed to do you the justice you pretend to seek  For your own sake  therefore  consider better of the matter  since it is not impossible  but  were we to meet  and both survive  you may exchange  what you will think  a real disgrace for an imaginary one    And thus  gentlemen  have I almost syllogistically argued with myself on this subject     62 Courage is a virtue   Passion is a vice   Passion  therefore  cannot be Courage   Does it not then behove every man of true honour to shew  that reason has a greater share than resentment in the boldness of his resolves   And what  by any degree  is so reasonable as a regard to our duty   You called upon me  gentlemen  to communicate my notions on this important subject  I have the more willingly obeyed you  as I hope Sir Hargrave  on the occasion that brought us to this not unhappy breakfasting  will be the better satisfied that it has so ended  and as  if you are so good as to adopt them  they may be of service to others of your friends  in case of debates among them  Indeed  for my own sake  I have always been ready to communicate my notions on this head  in hopes sometimes to be spared provocation  for  as I have owned  I am passionate  I have pride  And am often afraid of myself  and the more  because I am not naturally  I will presume to say  a timid man   Mr  Bag   Fore God  Sir Hargrave  somebody has escaped a scouring  as the saying is   Mr  Mer  Aye  by my life  Sir Hargrave  you had like to have caught a Tartar   Sir Ch  The race is not always to the swift  gentlemen  Sir Hargrave s passion would  doubtless  have laid him under disadvantage  Defence is guarded  Offence exposes itself   Mr  Bag  But  Sir Charles  you despise no man  I am sure  for differing from you in opinion  I am a Catholic—  Sir Ch  A Roman Catholic—No religion teaches a man evil  I honour every man who lives up to what he professes   Mr  Bag  But that is not the case with me  I doubt     63Mr  Mer  That is out of doubt  Bagenhall   Mr  Jord  The truth is  Mr  Bagenhall has found his conveniencies in changing  He was brought up a Protestant  These dispensations  Mr  Bagenhall —  Mr  Mer  Ay  and they were often an argument in Bagenhall s mouth  for making me his proselyte   Sir Ch  Mr  Bagenhall  I perceive  is rather of the religion of the ourt  than of that of the Church of Rome   Mr  Bag  But what I mean by telling you I am a Catholic  is this  I have read the opinion of some of our famous Casuists  that  in some cases  a private man may become his own avenger  and challenge an enemy into the field   Sir Ch  Bannes and Cajetan  you mean  one a Spaniard  the other an Italian  But the highest authority of your Church is full against them in this point  The Council of Trent treats the combatants who fall  as self murderers  and denies them Christian burial  It brands them  and all those who by their presence countenance and abet this shocking and unchristian practice  with perpetual infamy  and condemns them
