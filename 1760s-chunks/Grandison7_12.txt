have looked upon what Lucy has written  I see there will be but little room for me to say any thing  She is delighted with the task  It employs all her faculties  displays her fine taste in architecture  paintings  needle works  shell works  She will give you a description of several charming performances in the two latter arts  of the late Lady Grandison —How does the character of that admirable Lady rise upon us  With what emulation does it fire me  On twenty accounts  it was a very bold thing  my grandmamma  for your Harriet to aspire to be Lady Grandison —Yet how does Sir Charles s goodness  his   30 kind acceptance of all my humble endeavours  encourage me —O  madam  he said truth  when in courtship he told me  that I parted with power to have it returned me with augmentation  I don t know how it is  but his freedom of behaviour to me is increased  yet his respectfulness is not diminished —And  tender as he was before to me  his tenderness is still greater than it was  Yet so much unaffected dignity in it  that my reverence for him is augmented  but without any abatement of my Love  Then his chearfulness  his more than chearfulness  his vivacity  shews  that he is at heart pleased with his Harriet  Happy Harriet —Yet I cannot forbear now and then  when my joy and my gratitude are at the highest  a sigh to the merits of Lady Clementina —What I am now  should she have been  think I often —The general admination paid me as the wife of Sir Charles Grandison  should have been paid to her —Lady L  Lady G  should have been  her sisters  She should have been the mistress of this house  the co guardian of Emily  the successor of the late excellent Lady Grandison —Hapless Clementina —What a strange thing  that a love of religion in two persons so pious  so good  each in their way  should sunder  for ever sunder  persons whose minds were so closely united   Sir Charles  by Lucy  invites me  till dinner is ready  to walk with them  at her request  in the gallery  Lucy wants  in describing that gallery  to give you  my dearest grandmamma  in whom every other of my friends is included  a brief history of the ancestors of Sir Charles  whose pictures adorn it  I come  Lord of my heart  I attend you —  How  madam  would you have been delighted  could you have sat in this truly noble gallery  and seen the dear man  one arm round my waist  holding my opposite hand in the hand of the same surrounding arm  pointing sometimes with the other  sometimes   31 putting that other arm round my Lucy s  and giving short histories of the persons whose pictures we saw   Some of the pictures are really fine  One of Sir Charles s  which is drawn when he was about sixteen  is on horseback  The horse a managed  curvetting  proud beast —His seat  spirit  courage  admirably expressed  He must have been  as his sisters say he was  the loveliest  and the most undaunted  yet most modest looking  of youths  He passed his own picture so slightly  that I had not time to take in half the beauties of it  You will not doubt  madam  but I shall be often in this gallery  were only this one picture there   What pleasure had I in hearing the history of this antient family  from this unbroken series of the pictures of it  for so many generations past  And will mine  one day  thought I  be allowed a place among them  near to that of the most amiable of them all  both as to mind and figure  How my heart exulted  What were my meditations as I traced the imagined footsteps of dear Lady Grandison  her picture and Sir Thomas s in my eye  as finely executed  as those in the best bedchamber  May I  thought I  with a happier lot  be but half as deserving  But  madam  did not Lady Grandison shine the more for the hardships she passed through —And is it necessary for virtue to be called forth by trials  in order to be justified by its fortitude under them  What trials can I be called to with Sir Charles Grandison  But may I not take my place on the footstep of her throne  yet make no contemptible figure in the family of her beloved son  I will humbly endeavour to deserve my good fortune  and leave the rest to Providence   There are in different apartments of this seat  besides two in the house in the town  no less than six pictures of Sir Thomas  But then two of them were brought from his seat in Essex  Sir Thomas was fond of his person  They are drawn in different attitudes    32 He appears to be  as I have always heard he was  a fine figure of a man  But neither Lucy nor I  tho  we made not the compliment to Sir Charles  you may suppose  who always speaks with reverence and unaffected Love of his
