return  Patty  said I  you should not leave me  but I cannot afford to pay a servant of your abilities as you deserve  and I must be my own maid for the future  Never  never  Madam  cried the honest creature  bursting into tears  while I have hands to serve you  Let me but attend on you  and the two dear children  I desire nothing —I want nothing  Your goodness has all along supplied me so  that I am sure I have clothes enough to serve me during my life  and if I could not put up with the same humble way of living that my mistress does  sure I should be a presumptuous wretch  My tears thanked the grateful girl  and taking her by the hand  I told her  that I would not talk of parting for the present  but when any thing worth her acceptance offered  I should then insist on her embracing it   I am determined to retire to some village at a distance from London  and either to take a little cottage to myself  or board with my children at some farm house  as I shall find most convenient  Fifty pounds a year will be but a slender support for three persons brought up in affluence  My little ones indeed will not now be sensible of the change  and by the time they are grown up  they will be so inured to their homely board  that they will not  I hope  aspire after what cannot consistently  perhaps   with virtue  lie within their reach   October 27  After paying the expences of my mother’s funeral  discharging our lodgings  and some other demands  I find my purse will be so extremely reduced  that I shall have but barely enough to keep out want  till my small income becomes due to me  I must therefore  for the present  defer putting my scheme into execution  as I am not qualified to undertake a journey with my little family  especially as I am as yet uncertain what place to fix on for my residence  neither will I afford my brother  though I have no reason to expect any thing from him   a farther pretence for reproaching me  by giving him room    to say  I left London without consulting him  or waiting for his return to it  I shall therefore look out a lodging of a small price  where I will conceal myself from every body that knows me  and wait for Sir George’s arrival   October 28  How happy you make me  my ever dear friend  by your approbation of my conduct  since my receiving your last packet  which came into my hand late last night  I am better reconciled to my present lot than I was before I heard from you  I could not do otherwise  you say  after my solemn promise given to Miss Burchell  than use my utmost endeavours to promote her marriage with Mr Faulkland  True  I could not  but I wish you had entered more into my sentiments  in regard to those punctilios  which  you tell me  you think might have been got over  if that young woman had been out of the question  I could not help smiling at your wish  unchristian as it was  but my dear  if that were to happen  do you think Mr Faulkland so void of reason  nay of feeling  as after all that has past to persevere  Or if he did  that I could be so mean as to owe the very bread that I and my children should eat  to his generosity  Would you  my Cecilia  wish to see your friend so humbled  ’Tis not in the power even of the cold  hard hand of poverty itself  to dash me so low as that would do  But where is the need of forming resolutions  or even making declarations about what never can happen  I see notwithstanding  that you think my heart has again done itself some violence  You know that heart too well for me to attempt to hide from you its secret workings  I own to you honestly I now feel my own unhappiness in its full extent  I look back  and take a survey of the past  and cannot help thinking that I have had the most wayward fate allotted me that ever woman had   Disappointment in a first love  has  I think been ever accounted a grief scarce surmountable even by time  but this can only be the case  where the heart  extremely vulnerable by nature  like Miss Burchell’s  suffers itself to be so entirely immersed in that passion  that all other duties of life are swallowed up in it  and where an indolent turn of mind  a want of rational avocations  and perhaps of a new object  all contribute to indulge and confirm the disease  This you know was not my case  I loved  ’tis true  but it was with temperance  and though my disappointment afflicted me  it did not subdue me  I got the better of it  I think I got the better of it even before I married  but sure I am  I totally conquered all remembrance of it after I became a wife  I then
