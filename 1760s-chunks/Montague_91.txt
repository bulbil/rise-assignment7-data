to us next year  at least  this is the plan my heart has formed       I wish Mrs  Rivers had born his absence better  her impatience to see him has broken in on all our schemes  Emily and I had in fancy formed a little Eden on Lake Champlain  Fitzgerald had promised me to apply for lands near them  we should have been so happy in our little new world of friendship       There is nothing certain in this vile state of existence  I could philosophize extremely well this morning       All our little plans of amusement too for this summer are now at an end  your brother was the soul of all our parties  This is a trifle  but my mind to day seeks for every subject of chagrin       Let but my Emily be happy  and I will not complain  even if I lose her  I have a thousand fears  a thousand uneasy reflections  if you knew her merit  you would not wish to break the attachment       My sweet Emily is going this morning to Quebec  I have promised to accompany her  and she now waits for me       I cannot write  I have a heaviness about my heart  which has never left me since I read your letter   Tis the only disagreable one I ever received from my dear Lucy  I am not sure I love you so well as before I saw this letter  There is something unfeeling in the style of it  which I did not expect from you       Adieu  your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER CXLVII   147   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  May 25   I AM unhappy beyond all words  my sweet Emily is gone to England  the ship sailed this morning  I am just returned from the beach  after conducting her on board       I used every art  every persuasion  in the power of friendship  to prevent her going till your brother came down  but all I said was in vain  She told me   she knew too well her own weakness to hazard seeing him  that she also knew his tenderness  and was resolved to spare him the struggle between his affection and his duty  that she was determined never to marry him but with the consent of his mother  that their meeting at Quebec  situated as they were  could only be the source of unhappiness to both  that her heart doated on him  but that she would never be the cause of his acting in a manner unworthy his character  that she would see his family the moment she got to London  and then retire to the house of a relation in Berkshire  where she would wait for his arrival        That she had given you her promise  which nothing should make her break  to embark in the first ship for England        She expressed no fears for herself as to the voyage  but trembled at the idea of her Rivers s danger       She sat down several times yesterday to write to him  but her tears prevented her  she at last assumed courage enough to tell him her design  but it was in such terms as convinced me she could not have pursued it  had he been here       She went to the ship with an appearance of calmness that astonished me  but the moment she entered  all her resolution forsook her  she retired with me to her room  where she gave way to all the agony of her soul       The word was given to sail  I was summoned away  she rose hastily  she pressed me to her bosom   Tell him  said she  his Emily  she could say no more       Never in my life did I feel any sorrow equal to this separation  Love her  my Lucy  you can never have half the tenderness for her she merits       She stood on the deck till the ship turned Point Levi  her eyes fixed passionately on our boat   Twelve o clock       I have this moment a letter from your brother to Emily  which she directed me to open  and send to her  I inclose it to you  as the safest way of conveyance  there is one in it from Temple to him  on the same subject with yours to me       Adieu  I will write again when my mind is more composed   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER CXLVIII   148   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Silleri   Montreal  May 28   IT was my wish  my hope  my noblest ambition  my dear Emily  to see you in a situation worthy of you  my sanguine temper flattered me with the idea of seeing this wish accomplished in Canada  though fortune denied it me in England       The letter which I inclose has put an end to those fond delusive hopes  I must return immediately to England  did not my own heart dictate this step  I know too well the goodness of yours  to expect the continuance of your esteem  were I capable of purchasing happiness  even
