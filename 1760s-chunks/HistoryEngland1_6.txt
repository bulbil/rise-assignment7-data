to be found in the accounts of any other ancient or modern nation  The custom I mean  was a community of wives  among certain numbers  and by common consent  Every man married indeed but one woman  who was always after  and alone  esteemed his wife  but  it was usual for five or six  ten  twelve  or more  either brothers or friends  as they could agree  to have all their wives in common  But this  though calculated for their mutual happiness  in fact proved their greatest disturbance  and we have some instances  in which this community of wives produced dissensions  jealousies  and death  Every woman s children  however  were the property of him who had married her  but all claimed a share in the care and defence of the whole society  since no man knew which were his own   To estimate the wisdom of the people  we must examine the manners of their teachers  If the laity were so very barbarous  the Druids  their   16 instructors  must have but few pretences to superior refinement  Yet  I know not how  we have different and almost contradictory accounts of this extraordinary fraternity  They have been represented  by some  as persons of learning  which had been derived to them by long tradition  Their skill consisted in the observation of the heavens  and  upon the influence of its appearance  they gave their countrymen omens of failure or success  They taught a morality  which principally consisted in justice and fortitude  Their lives were simple and innocent  in woods  caverns  and hollow trees  their food acorns or berries  and their drink water  They were respected and admired  not only for knowing more than other men  but for despising what all others valued and pursued  by their virtue and temperance  they reproved and corrected those vices in others  from which they were themselves happily free  and made use of no other arms  than the reverence due to integrity  to enforce obedience to their own commands  From such a conduct as this  they derived so much authority  that they were not only priests  but judges also  throughout the nation  No laws were instituted without their approbation  no person punished with bonds  or death  but by their condemnation   But  on the other hand  we learn  that all their knowledge was imposture  and their simplicity only a savage passion for solitude  Their language was barbarous  and their manners still more rude  These were such as called aloud for some more enlightened instructors  to conquer and to direct them  The Druids  seemingly formed for the people among whom they governed  sacrificed human victims  which they burned in large wicker   17 idols  which were made so capacious  as to contain a multitude of persons  who were  in this manner  at once consumed in the flames  The female Druids plunged their knives in the breasts of the prisoners taken in war  and prophesied from the manner in which the blood happened to stream from the wound  Several of their altars  consisted of four broad stones  three of which were set edgewise  and the fourth horizontally on the top  and are still to be seen   In accounts  so seemingly contradictory  we are entirely to give assent to neither  That they pretended to astrology is certain  this  and not their piety  probably gave them such influence among their countrymen  To judge of what the Britons then were  as I have already hinted  we must look at what savage nations are at present  We perceive  what authority a pretence to astrology  in barbarous countries  confers  the astrologer being generally considered  in almost all the Eastern kingdoms  as the second  if not the first man of the state  That the Druids deceived the people with a false religion cannot be denied  but  yet  I can never think that they were impostors  they first deceived themselves into a belief and veneration of what they taught  and then made use of every motive to persuade the people  The ignorant and erroneous  in the commerce of this life  are many  the villains and impostors are found more rarely  As for human sacrifices  few probably were destroyed upon this horrid occasion  but prisoners taken in war  and such have ever been sacrificed  by savage nations  rather from a principle of revenge  than religion  It is not peculiar to the religion of the Druids alone  but was primarily the   18 barbarous practice of those very nations who then exclaimed against it most loudly   In short  my dear Charles  the religion of the Druids was no more than that of every barbarous nation  with whose ceremonies we have any acquaintance  This was the religion  not only practised in Britain  but which prevailed  originally  over the greatest part of the world  The original inhabitants of Europe  as a learned antiquary  has finely proved  were the same  all speaking one language  obeying the same deities  and governed by similar laws  Successive invasions  from different parts of Asra  brought new changes  and  as the colonies went westward  the Greek  the Roman  and Teutonic
