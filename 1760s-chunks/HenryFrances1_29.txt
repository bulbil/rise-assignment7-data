left you every Thing in Life  which I thought valuable  I chiefly mean  your own Letters  for  alas  I have little else  that is worthy of your Acceptance   Farewel  my dearest Harry  living or dying   I am eternally Your s  F     89  LETTER LIII  HENRY to FRANCES   I RECEIVED two Letters from you  last Post  of different Dates  and find you are returning again to the Melpomene Strain  and are as great a Riddle as ever  You trifle with yourself very idly  for sure  if Life is not worth your Care  Health is  I felt your Disorder  before I heard of it  for I have been in the same Way  myself  for some Time past  I am sorry to find the Sympathy of our Bodies so great—at this Distance—but  I find  the Sphere of your Activity is very extensive  nay  more powerful than any of the fixed Stars  because you can influence  as far as you are capable of being contemplated  But  no more of your malign Aspects  and I beg that all your future Letters may be wrote in a chearful Strain  tho  it should be even a Strain to you —forgive the Quibble  —for  be assured  that nothing keeps off either natural or moral Evils  so well  as Chearfulness  somebody calls it    the Health of Virtue   And I will not venture to carry it so far as to pronounce  that a Man  who is not chearful  is either a Knave  or a Fool  Take Notice that all Distempers sooner seize on us  when we are low spirited  and all ill Luck    90 and Misfortunes  afflict the coward Mind  more than the Brave  Chearfulness I take to be the best Hymn we can offer up to our Creator  as it shews Gratitude and Acquiescence  while Melancholy betrays Repining  and Despair at the Ways and Dispensations of Providence  It is a Degree of the greatest Crime Man can be guilty of  Suicide  and the greatest Degree of it too  for Deliberation is the highest Aggravation of a Crime     One of the strongest Articles of Guilt too  instanced in the Crime I mention  is  the depriving the Society of a Member  by how much more then the Victim s Merit is  by so much greater must the Destroyer s Sin be —Think of this and tremble   Henry   LETTER LIV   Dear HARRY   I HOPE you have  before this  received my congratulatory Epistle  on the Day that gave you Birth  and  I think  I ought to condole with you now  for having entered into the old fashioned Scheme of House keeping  I thank you for your obliging Wish  but am angry with you for suspecting that I should be   91 tired of the Place  for I could say  with Cowley    With thee  for ever  I in Woods could rest   Where never human Foot the Ground has prest   Thou  from all Shades  the Darkness can st exclude   And from a Desert banish Solitude     So much by Way of Answer to the civil Part of your Letter  but  I confess  I am quite at a Loss to know what Return to make to the Remainder of it  I have so often spoke my Sentiments  upon such Occasions  that I have scarce any Thing left to say  but Repetitions  which I am not fond of  upon so ungrateful a Subject   If I knew any Method to convince you I am serious  and resolved in what I say  I would  upon my Honour  attempt it with the greatest Pleasure  tho  it were parting with a Limb  as it would thenceforward save you a great deal of needless Trouble  and me from a World of Anxiety and Mortification  This might  perhaps  give such a Turn to your Regards for me  as I could wish  or prevent your ever thinking of me at all  even which I should prefer to your thinking of me as you do  I should then be at Liberty to love you  without hating myself  because I should then have an Esteem for you  which might justify my Passion    92 I shall only add  that  if you have a Mind to convince me you desire either to see  or hear from me again  you will never mention so unkind  so ungenerous  and so unmannerly a Subject more  for I shall never answer another Letter of your s  wrote in such a Stile  which  if you sometimes use  to shew your Wit  you have no Excuse for  as your Fund does not require the Aid of Libertinism   That I do love you  I own  and confess it more freely  since I find I have  thank God  sufficient Strength to acknowledge it with Safety  for  I am glad to find  I do not love you better than myself  and  tho  I would chearfully sacrifice all that is perishable of me  for your Happiness  I shall take Care to preserve that Part of me  which may
