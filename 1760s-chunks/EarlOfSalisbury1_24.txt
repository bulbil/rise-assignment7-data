address and eloquence   to prevail upon the gentle Countess  No easy conquest  she  no common  prize  My grace waits on her consent —Consent  impossible  cried  Salisbury  when Randolph again endeavouring to allay the heat of his  impatience  earnestly united his intreaties with those of the Earl s  companions  and at length obtained a patient audience     Raymond  thus the old Knight proceeded  was not slow to accept this  gracious condescension to his wishes  Supported by the power of Hubert   enriched by his bounty  and attended by the flattering followers of his  prosperity  this Lord soon prepared all necessaries for a magnificent  and stately progress  He left the English court  which now graced the  city of Marlborough with it s residence  for thither the indisposition  of our liege had caused it to be transferred  and at the head of a  gallant troop of Knights  armed  and caparisoned in all their courtly  pride and splendor  and implicitly obedient to their leader  he  proceeded toward the castle of Salisbury  The humble villagers gazed on  this gay troop  with surprize and pleasure  were soon informed of their  purpose  and soon spread the story through all the neighbouring land   The Countess had already learned the melancholy tidings of her Lord  and  indulged her griefs in secret  when  roused by the appearance of this  retinue  and nothing suspecting the purpose of Raymond  she  opened her gates wide to his approach  and received him and his  attendants with all hospitable rites  befitting her own nobility  and  the greatness of her guests  To Raymond she appeared in all the dignity  of grief  holding her young son  a fair copy of her beauty and her  sorrow  And  if fame speaks true  the charms of the majestic mourner   had  in that moment  too powerful an influence upon the heart of  Raymond  Love came in aid of his ambition  and inflamed the ardor of his  pursuit  With all those soothing arts  which courts and their polish d  converse had bestowed  he laboured to dispel her gloom  and cautiously  to introduce the great purpose of his arrival  Long time he suspended  his declaration   such is the controuling power of beauty  surrounded by  the awful beams of chaste and graceful dignity  yet in every interview  was his passion confirmed and encreased  At length  so have we been  informed  he spoke his suit with humble and anxious hesitation  and was  received with surprize and scornful denial     Whilst the Knight thus spake  a succession of violent passions had  distracted the mind of Lord William  His eyes first expressed an earnest  and tumultuous impatience  He trembled  and the blood retired from his  cheeks  then rushed back to resume it s seat  with double force  and  glowed with fiery indignation  Again  his tender looks declared  with  what love and gratitude and sympathizing pity  he felt the sorrows of  his beloved Countess  Impatience and anxiety again succeeded  and when  the Knight paused  his looks had grown great  and elevated  and a sudden  exclamation of triumph broke involuntarily from his lips   What  remains   said he   but that we now go and resume our authority  What is  wanting but our presence to relieve our Countess from this importunate  wooer  Come  my friends  let us haste away  Let us break through that  cloud of obscurity which hath too long concealed us  and confound the  men who grasp at our rights and  honours  with such a precipitate and rash presumption  Shall Ela weep   and I delay to comfort her  Shall proud intrusion break upon her  privacy  and irritate her grief  and do I not fly to relieve her     Beware   replied the Knight with looks of sage and rigid caution    beware of violence  consult not with thy passions  Thy Countess hath  I  hope  maintained her firmness and constant purpose to the last  Should  she—but I cannot fear it —Yet still Raymond is in possession of thy  castle  he acts as Lord of thy land and inheritor of thy power  Canst  thou behold this usurpation calm and unmoved  Trust me  I dread thy  impetuous resentment  Raymond is proud and insolent  Hubert crafty   dark  and revengeful  The injurious never can forgive  Shame and  disappointment may drive him to desperate resolutions —Alas  I cannot  speak half my fears      This mysterious language of the Knight  who  however he suppressed his  fear  really dreaded a fatal compliance in the Countess  and formed the  most terrible presages of broils and blood  kindled up a sudden flame in  the breast of Salisbury   Heavens   cried he   if Raymond should have  already— I see the danger of my situation —But let us quickly seek this  invader   Randolph now seemed to condemn his own apprehensions  which he  observed might arise from doubtful or mistaken information  His  retirement had rendered him the
