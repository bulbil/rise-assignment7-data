elevated  as in some extraordinary emotion      Mrs  Graves  said I  how do you do  I hope you are well  I   now begin to conjecture whereabouts I am  But neither did she   answer   but falling on her knees by my bed  and taking hold of my   hand I thank thee  O my God   she cried   and  bursting into tears    she wept and sobbed like an infant  Ah  Mrs  Graves  said I    I fear that you have had a very troublesome guest of me  But   then  says she  we remember that trouble no more  now that you   are  once again  born into the world      During the few succeeding days in which I kept my bed  Mrs    Graves and her fair niece  Arabella  whom I had taken for a vision    constantly breakfasted and spent their evening in my apartment      I gave them a short narrative of my foregoing history   and         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  77     understood  on their part  that they were the sister and daughter of   the late Keverend Mr  Graves  of Putney  who had little more to   bequeath than his books and furniture  amounting to about five   hundred pounds  which they held in joint stock  and had  hitherto    rather increased than diminished      As I scarce remembered my mother  and had now  as it were    no farther relation nor friend upon earth  I felt a vacuity in my   soul  somewhat like that of an empty stomach  desirous of seizing   on the first food that should present itself to my cravings  Delight    ful sensibilities   sweet hungerings of nature after its kind   This   good woman and her niece became all the world to me  The one   had conceived for me all the passion of a parent   the other  that of   the fondest and tenderest of sisters  On the other hand  I had for   Mrs  Graves all the feelings of a child who conceives himself a part   of the existence of her who bore him   and my eyes and actions   could not forbear to discover to Arabella  that my heart was that   of the most affectionate of brothers  though too delicate to indulge   itself in those familiar endearments which the nearness of kindred   might venture to claim      When I was up and about the house  I requested Mrs  Graves to   make out her bill for my board  and for my physician  surgeon    drugs   c   during my long illness  Hereupon she looked eagerly   and tenderly at me  Mr  Clement  says she  I think you are too   generous designedly to reproach us with what we owe you  But   for what is it  my child  that you desire us to charge you   Is it   for rescuing me from death  or a shame worse than death probably   from both   Or is it for delivering this  my darling  from the bitter   grief and distress that my loss must have brought upon her   Or   do you rather desire to pay us for the fearful pains and sickness   which you suffered on our account  and for having nearly forfeited   your life in our defence   No  Mr  Clement  you must not think of   paying us the very debts that we owe you  more  indeed  Mr    Clement  than all our little fortune  than the product of the in    dustry of our lives  can ever repay      Here I was silenced for the present  but in no degree convinced     and I felt  in a sort  the disgust of an injured person  uneasy and   studious  till some revenge might be had      In two days after  while Mrs  Graves was at market  and Ara    bella gone with a Brussels head and ruffles to a young lady of dis    tinction  I stepped into the shop where Jenny waited the commands   of those that should call  I had scarce entered when a sheriff s   officer appeared at the door  and  bolting in  laid an execution on the   shop for eighty five pounds odd shillings  at the suit of Mr  Hard    grave  the cambric and lace merchant      I was at first surprised and grieved  but pleasure quickly suc    ceeded to my concern on the occasion  I took out my pocket book    immediately discharged the debt with costs  and gave a crown to   Jenny on her solemn assurance that she would not betray a syllable   of what had happened to her
