observation  said in a low voice  that if I was close and trustworthy  I had only to be in the garden at midnight  when a scene would be laid open in which I should not be sorry to be an actor  I answered the duenna  pressing her hand significantly  that I would not fail  and we parted in a hurry for fear of a surprise  How the hours lagged from this moment till supper time  though we supped very early  Then again  from supper to my master s bed time  It should seem as if the march of the whole family was timed to a largo movement  By way of helping forward the fidgets  when Don Vincent withdrew to his chamber  the army was put on the war establishment  and we were obliged to fight the campaigns in Portugal over again  though my ears had not recovered from the din of the last cannonade  But a favour  from which I had hitherto made my escape  was reserved for this eventful evening  He repeated the army list from beginning to end  with copious digressions on the exploits of those officers who had distinguished themselves in his time  Oh my poor tympanum  It was almost cracked before we got to the end  Time  however  will wear out even an old man s story  and he went to bed  I immediately went to my own little chamber  whence there was a way into the garden by a private staircase  I depended on my purchase of perfumery for overcoming the effluvia of the day s drudgery  and put on a clean shirt highly scented  When every invention had been pressed into the service to render my person worthy of its destiny  and cherish the fondness of my mistress  I went to the appointment   Ortiz was not there  I concluded that  tired of waiting for me  she had gone back to her chamber  and that the happy moment of philandering was over  I laid all the blame on Don Vincent  but just as I was singing Te Deum backwards for his campaigns  I heard the clock strike ten  To be sure it must be wrong  It could not be less than one o clock  Yet I was so egregiously out in my reckoning  that full a quarter of an hour afterwards  I counted ten upon my fingers by the clock at next door  Vastly well  thought I to myself  I have only two complete hours to ventilate my passion here alfresco  At least they shall not complain of me for want of punctuality  What shall I do with myself till twelve  Suppose we take a turn about this garden and settle our cues in the delicious drama just going to be brought on the stage  it is my first appearance in so principal a character  I am not yet sufficiently well read in the crotchets of your quality dames  I know how to tickle a girl in a stuff gown  or an actress  You swagger up to them with an easy  impudent assurance  and pop the question without making any bones of it  But one must take a female of condition on a very different tack  It seems to me  that in this case the happy swain must be well bred  attentive  tender  respectful  without degenerating into bashfulness  Instead of taking his happiness by storm  he must plant his amorous desires in ambuscade  and wait till the garrison is asleep  and the outworks defenceless   Thus it was that I argued  and such were the preconcerted plans of my campaign with Aurora  After a few tedious minutes  according to my calculation  I was to experience the ecstasy of finding myself at the feet of that lovely creature  and pouring forth a torrent of impassioned nonsense  I scraped together in my memory all the clap traps in our stock plays  which were most successful with the audience  and might best set off my pretensions to spirit and gallantry  I trusted to my own adroitness for the application  and hoped  after the example of some players in the list of my acquaintance  bringing only a stock of memory into the trade  to deal upon credit for my wit  While my imagination was engrossed by these thoughts  which kept my impatience at bay much more successfully than the commentaries of my modern Caesar  I heard the clock strike  eleven  This was some encouragement  and I fell back to my meditations  sometimes sauntering carelessly about  and sometimes throwing myself at my length on the turf  in a bower at the bottom of the garden  At length it struck twelve  the long expected hour  big with my high destiny  Some seconds after  Ortiz  as punctual as myself though less impatient  made her appearance  Signor Gil Blas  said she  accosting me  how long have you been here  Two hours  answered I  Indeed  Truly  replied she  laughing  you are very exact  there is a pleasure in making nocturnal assignations with you  Yet you may assure yourself  continued she more gravely  that you cannot pay too dear for such good fortune as that of which I am the messenger  My mistress wants to have some private talk with you  I shall not anticipate what may be the subject  that is a
