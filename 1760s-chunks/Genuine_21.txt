that it was plain his fickle temper could not be long satisfied with the enjoyment of the same person  Having nothing else to depend on but his pay he could not answer all her extravagant demands  which proved  after a short intercourse  the cause of their final separation   But to proceed in order  Being now left to herself  she was soon surrounded by the same circle of admirers as before  though none made so sensible an impression on her heart as Capt  S—D—RS  a gentleman  whose vivacity and good breeding rendered him much respected by all his acquaintance  as well as a general favourite with the ladies  The captain  being enamoured of our heroine  took every opportunity of being in her company alone  nor was she backward in complying with   100 his inclination in this respect  since the short intercourses thus obtained  yielded much greater satisfaction than a mixed company could give   He had  however  the discretion to address her only as a former acquaintance  whenever he found she was engaged with other company  and the lady had knowledge enough of the world to answer him in the same manner  and their intimacy was kept up with so much art  that one Mr  THOMPSON who kept her company at the same time  and who was of so jealous a temper  that he boiled with rage if she spoked to or looked at any other man  appeared free from all suspicion of the captain  though the change in her was so apparent  as might have been observable by one less jealous  Her eyes became animated  her complexion glowed  she spoke with ease  and her whole air was changed when in the captain s company   On the other hand the captain was extremely cautious in his conduct towards her  which  as it laid him under great restraint  he thought deserved to be rewarded   101 by some private interviews  wherein they might have the pleasure of securely gratifying their mutually ardent passions   To this her fears of a discovery made some objection  nor was she without apprehensions from the imprudence of his passion  which she thought her own was too violent to repress  At length  however  he prevailed  and as it was not very difficult to bring about  a time and place were accordingly appointed   The first private interview brought on a second  a second a third  and so on  until they became  almost daily  the thoughts of danger vanished from her  and she gave a loose to her most animated desires  revelling in all the ecstasies of a boundless affection  and receiving the most sensible tokens of love from her admired captain  that youth and vigour could possibly afford   These private meetings enabled the lovers the better to restrain themselves in public company  and they had the satisfaction of continuing their course unsuspected    102 faction of continuing their course unsuspected  till one night a maid servant of Mr  Thompson passed by  just as she came out of the captain s lodging  and visibly observed her  Her fright at this accident was so excessive  that she could not support herself  and she was obliged to return with the captain to his lodgings  till she was well enough recovered to walk   On her return to her own apartment  she found Mr  Thompson had been acquainted with the affair  though she was poorly provided with an apology  it was no part of her misfortune  that he would not give her an opportunity to defend herself  His abuse descended to every infamous appellation  and he ordered her  in a very imperious tone  to depart from his house  which she immediately did  and sent notice of it directly to captain S—d—rs  and begged to hear from him as soon as possible   The following evening she heard a footman coming up stairs  who  to her inexpressible joy  put a note into her hands from the captain  who promised to wait   103 on her the next morning  The pleasure she received on this occasion was so great  that she could hardly conceal it from the servant who brought it  and who waited for an answer  much less could she compose herself so as to read it directly  At length  after a little recollection  she found that theCapt  told her in it  that his apprehensions for her had given him the greatest uneasiness  that he would soon see her and order matters so as to put her in a place where she would be safe from any future insult she might apprehend from the jealousy of Mr  Thompson   This gave her new courage  and the following evening he came to her lodgings in a post chaise  in which they set out for Bath  and relays of freshhorses being provided at the different stages  they arrived the next day at Bath   Here the captain provided genteel lodgings for her  and the people with whom she lodged regarded her as a person of quality  rather than  what she in fact was  a woman of pleasure     104In this state she continued near two months  when her lover received orders for a cruize in the Mediteranean  He endeavoured in vain to be excused from going  and this unwillingness to obey the orders sent to ••m by
