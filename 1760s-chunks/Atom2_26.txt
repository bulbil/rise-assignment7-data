now so convinced of his own personal energy  that he persuaded his master Gio gio to come forth and see it operate on the blatant beast  Accordingly the Dairo ascended his car of state  while the Cuboy  arrayed in all his trappings  stood before him with the reins in his own hand  and drove directly to the enemy  who waited for him without flinching  Being arrived within dung shot of Jan ki dtzin  he made a halt  and putting himself in the attitude of the idol Fo  with a simper in his countenance  seemed to invite the warrior to make a full discharge of his artillery  He did not long wait in suspence  The balls soon   152 began to whizz about his ears  and a great number took effect upon his person  At length  he received a shot upon his right temple which brought him to the ground  All his gewgaws fluttered  and his buckram doublet rattled as he fell  Llur chir no sooner beheld him prostrate  than advancing with the monster  he began to repeat his rhymes  at which every mouth and every tail of Legion was opened and listed up  and such a torrent of filth squirted from these channels  that the unfortunate Cuboy was quite overwhelmed  Nay  he must have been actually suffocated where he lay  had not some of the Dairo s attendants interposed and rescued him from the vengeance of the monster  He was carried home in such an unsavoury pickle  that his family smelled his disaster long before he came in sight  and when he appeared   153 in this woeful condition  covered with ordure  blinded with dirt  and even deprived of sense and motion  his wife was seized with hysterica passio  He was immediately stripped and washed  and other means being used for his recovery  he in a little time retrieved his recollection   He was now pretty well undeceived  with respect to the divinity of his person  but his enthusiasm took a new turn  He aspired to the glory of martyrdom  and resolved to devote himself as a victim to patriotic virtue  While his attendants were employed in washing off the filth that stuck to his beard  he recited in a theatrical tone  the stanza of a famous Japonese bard  whose soul afterwards transmigrated into the body of the Roman poet Horatius Flaccus  and inspired him   154 with the same sentiment in the Latin tongue   Virtus repulsae nescia sordidae  Intaminatis fulget honoribus   Nec sumit  aut ponit secures  Arbitrio popularis aurae     His friends hearing him declare his resolution of dying for his country  began to fear that his understanding was disturbed  They advised him to yield to the torrent  which was become too impetuous to stem  to resign the Cuboyship quietly  and reserve his virtues for a more favourable occasion  In vain his friends remonstrated  in vain his wife and children employed their tears and intreaties to the same purpose  He lent a deaf ear to all their sollicitations  until they began to drop some hints that seemed to imply   155 a suspicion of his insanity  which alarmed him exceedingly  and the Dairo himself signifying to him in private  that it was become absolutely necessary to temporize  he resigned the reins of government with a heavy heart  though not before he was assured that he should still continue to exert his influence behind the curtain   Gio gio s own person had not escaped untouched in the last skirmish  Jan ki dtzin was transported to such a pitch of insolence  that he aimed some balls at the Dairo  and one of them taking place exactly betwixt the eyes  defiled his whole visage  Had the laws of Japan been executed in all their severity against this audacious plebeian  he would have suffered crucifixion on the spot  but Gio gio  being good natured even to a fault  contented himself with ordering some   156 of his attendants to apprehend and put him in the public stocks  after having seized the whole cargo of filth which he had collected at his habitation for the manufacture of his balls  Legion was no sooner informed of his disgrace  than it released him by force  being therein comforted and abetted by the declaration of a puny magistrate  called Praff patt phogg  who seized this  as the only opportunity he should ever find of giving himself any consequence in the commonwealth  Accordingly  the monster hoisting him and Jan ki dtzin on their shoulders  went in procession through the streets of Meaco  hollowing  huzzaing  and extolling this venerable pair of patriots as the Palladia of the liberty of Japan   The monster s officious zeal on this occasion  was far from being agreeable to Mr  Orator Taycho    157 who took umbrage at this exaltation of his two understrappers  and from that moment devoted Jan ki dtzin to destruction  The Dairo finding it absolutely necessary for the support of his government  that this dirt monger should be punished  gave directions for trying him according to the laws of the land  He was ignominiously expelled from the assembly of the people  where his old patron Taycho not only disclaimed him  but even represented him as a worthless atheist and sower of sedition  but he escaped the weight of a more severe sentence in another tribunal  by retreating without beat of
