 don t you speak to her    or show that you take the least notice of her   but come and tell   me  or honest James in my absence  that we may take care of her    and force her to confess whether she is in reality your mother   or not      While Mr  Fenton was speaking  Andrew entered with tidings   that a chariot was overturned not twenty yards from the door  and   that he feared the people in it were much hurt  Mr  Fenton s   humanity was much alarmed at the news   he ordered the servants   to follow him  and instantly hurried out to give all the assistance   he could to the strangers      The chariot happened to be overturned by the slipping out of   one of the linen pins that kept the wheel on the axle tree  The   company had already got out  They were an agreeable young   couple  Mr  Fielding and his wife  who had come from London on   purpose to take an airing on the hill  Mrs  Fielding had suffered   nothing except from her fears   but Mr  Fielding s right arm was   something bruised  by his endeavouring to preserve his lady in   the fall      Mr  Fenton appeared the greatest sufferer of the three  and   addressed the strangers with a countenance that convinced them   how feelingly he was interested in their safety  He left Andrew to   have the chariot set to rights  and  having conducted his new   guests to his own house  he ordered up a bottle of sack and some   Naples cakes to the parlour      When they were all seated  and the glass had gone round I find    sir  said Mr  Fielding  that people are apt to be disgusted with   what they call accidents  and which may afterward turn out to   their greatest advantage  Perhaps I should never have known   what true humanity was  if our carriage had not been overturned   this day  If you knew all  said Mr  Fenton  with a tender blunt    ness  you would be far from laying any humanity at my door   since   I rejoice at an accident where the damage is all yours  and the ad    vantage that arises from it is all my own      I would hold fifty to one  cried Mrs  Fielding  that this is the   very Mr  Fenton we have heard so much about  Indeed  madam    said Mr  Fenton  you surprise me much   if I had the pleasure of   ever knowing you  there is something in that face I should not   have readily forgot      L2         148 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      No  sir  said Mrs  Fielding  I speak from information  I never   had the happiness of being known to you till now  We have a   fosterer in this village  Rose Jenkins  a poor widow  one of those   many persons you have down in your list  She was nurse to our   only child  while he lived and was with us  she was a constant     visitant  but as soon as soon as  Here Mrs  Fielding hesitated      her lip trembled  and her eye glistened with a filling tear   I say    sir  as soon as a very sad affair happened  the poor woman came   near us no more  One day  as we were taking the air through   this town  I thought I saw a face that was familiar to me  I called   to the coachman to stop  It was my old nurse  She had a family   of small children  and had fallen sadly to decay before you came    Mr  Fenton  to settle in the town  I chid her for becoming a   stranger to us  Ah  madam  said the kind creature the tears   bursting from her eyes how could I go near a place where every   thing would put me in mind of my dear lost child   She still con    tinued to weep and I wept for company 1 put a guinea in     her hand  and insisted on her coming to see us  She did so  It   was then  Mr  Fenton  that we learned your name and character     and you must expect the mortification  now and then  of hearing   a little of those many things that are spoken to your advantage    I am sorry  madam  said Mr  Fenton  that my nothings should   be talked of  lest it should intimate that other people are less   ostentatious      Mrs  Fielding was still affected by what she had been
