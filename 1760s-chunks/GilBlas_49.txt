to do its duty  He sent it backwards and forwards fast enough  though it brought but half its cargo to the landing place at a lading  the table cloth and napkin took toll  I carried off the soup when he had done  and brought in a partridge flanked by two roast quails  which Dame Jacintha cut up for him  She took care to make him take a good draught of wine  a little lowered at proper intervals  out of a large  deep  silver cup  which she held to his mouth  as if he had been an infant  He winged the partridge  and came down slap  dash upon all the rest of the dishes  When he had done cramming  that saint of the saucepan unpinned his napkin  reinstated his pillow and cushions  then  leaving him composed in his arm chair to the enjoyment of his usual nap after dinner  we took away  and demolished the remainder with appetites worthy of our master   The dinner of to day was the ordinary bill of fare  Our canon played the best knife and fork in the chapter  But the supper was a mere bauble  seldom more than a chicken and a little confectionery  I larded my inside in this house  and led a good easy life  There was but one awkward circumstance  and that was sitting up with my master  to save the expense of a nurse  Besides a strangury  which kept him on the fidget ten times in an hour  he was very much given to perspire  and in that event  I shifted him  Gil Blas  said he  on the second night  you are an active  clever fellow  I foresee that we shall jog on very well together  I only just give you a hint to keep in with Dame Jacintha  the girl has been about me for these fifteen years  and manages all my little matters  she comforts my outward man  and I cannot do too much for her  For that reason  you are to know  that she is more to me than all my family  There is my nephew  my own sister s son  why  I have turned him out of doors  only to please her  He had no regard for the poor lass  and so far from giving her credit for all her little assiduities  the saucy rascal swore she did not care a farthing for me  But now a days  young people think virtue and gratitude all a farce  Heaven be praised  I am rid of the varlet  What claim has blood  in comparison with unquestionable attachment  I am influenced by a give and take principle in my connections  You are right  sir  replied I  gratitude ought to be the first thing  and natural affection the last  Ay  resumed he  and my will shall be a comment on that text  My housekeeper shall be residuary legatee  and you shall have a corner in a codicil  if you go on as well as you have begun  The footman I turned off yesterday has lost a good legacy  by not knowing where to hit the right nail on the head  If the blockhead had not obliged me  by his ill behaviour  to send him packing  I would have made a man of him  but the beggar on horseback gave himself airs to Dame Jacintha  Then master lazy bones did not like sitting up  I might pass the night as I could  provided he had no trouble with me  Oh  the unfeeling scoundrel  exclaimed I  in the true spirit of Fabricio  he was not a man to be about so good a master  The lad for your money should be a humble  but confidential friend  he should not make a toil of what ought to be a pleasure  but think nothing of going through fire and water for your ease   These professions were not lost upon the licentiate  Neither were my assurances of due submission to Dame Jacintha s authority less acceptable  Puffing myself off for a servant  who was not afraid of work  I got through my business as cheerfully as I could  I never complained of my nursery  Though to be sure it was irksome enough  and if the legacy had not settled my stomach  I should have sickened at the nature of my employment  It is true I got some hours  rest during the day  The housekeeper  to do her justice  was kind enough to me  owing to the insinuating manner in which I wormed myself into her good graces  Suppose me at table  with her and her niece Inésilla  I changed their plates  filled their glasses  never thought of my own dinner before they had everything they wanted  This was the way to thrive in their esteem  One day when Dame Jacintha was gone to market  finding myself alone with Inésilla  I began to make myself agreeable  Were her father and mother alive  Oh  no  answered she  they have been dead this long  long time  for my good aunt says they have  and I have never seen them  I religiously believed the little innocent  though her answer was not of the clearest  and she got into such an humour of talking  as to tell
