him  He besought their pardon▪ but he would haunt me like a ghost  In spite of man and devil I should be his  he had the presumption to repeat  And went away with a flaming face   Don t you think  my dear  that my cousin Reeves was a little too mild in his own house  as I am under his guardianship  But perhaps he was the more patient for that very reason  and he is one of the bestnatured men in England  And then 8000l  a year —Yet why should a man of my cousin s independent fortune—But grandeur will have its charms   Thus did Sir Hargrave confirm all that Sir John Allestree had said of his bad qualities  And I think I am more afraid of him than ever I was of any man before  I remember  that mischievous is one of the bad qualities Sir John attributed to him  And revengeful another  Should I ever see him again  on the same errand  I will be more explicit  as to my being absolutely disengaged in my affections  if I can be so without giving him hope  lest he should do private mischief to some one on my account  Upon my word  I would not  of all the men I have ever seen  be the wife of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen   And so much for this first visit of his  I wish his pride may be enough piqued to make it the last   But could you have thought he would have shewn   120 himself so soon —Yet he had paraded so much  before I went down  to my cousins  and so little expected a direct and determined repulse  that a man of his self consequence might  perhaps  be allowed to be the more easily piqued by it   Lady Betty has sent us notice  that on Thursday next  there will be a ball at the Opera house in the Hay market  My cousins are to choose what they will be  but she insists  that my dress shall be left to her  I am not to know what it is to be  till the day before  or the very day  If I like it not  she will not put me to any expence about it   You will easily imagine  upon such an alternative  I shall approve of it  be it what it will  I have only requested  that I may not be so remarkably dressed  as to attract the eyes of the company  If I am  I shall not behave with any tolerable presence of mind   LETTER XVIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Friday  Feb  10   ONE of Mr  Greville s servants has just been here  with his master s compliments  So the wretch is come to town  I believe I shall soon be able to oblige him  He wishes  you know  to provoke me to say I hate him   Surely I draw inconveniencies upon myself by being so willing to pay civility for esteem  Yet it is in my nature to do so  and I can t help it without committing a kind of violence on my temper  There is no merit  therefore  in my behaviour  on such occasions  Very pretty self deception —I study my own ease  and  before I consider  am ready to call myself patient  and good humoured  and civil  and to attribute to myself I know not how many kind and complaisant things  when I ought  in modesty  to distinguish between the virtue and the necessity     121 I never was uncivil  as I call it  but to one young gentleman  a man of quality  you know who I mean   and that was  because he wanted me to keep secret his addresses to me  for family considerations  The young woman who engages to keep her lover s secrets in this particular  is often brought into a plot against herself  and oftener still against those to whom she owes unreserved honour and duty  And is not such a conduct also an indirect confession  that you know you are engaging in something wrong and unworthy   Mr  Greville s arrival vexes me  I suppose it will not be long before Mr  Fenwick comes too  I have a good mind to try to like the modest Mr  Orme the better  in spite   Sat  Morn  Feb  11   I SHALL have nothing to trouble you with  I think  but scenes of courtship  Sir Rowland  Sir Hargrave  and Mr  Greville  all met just now at our breakfasttime   Sir Rowland came first  a little before breakfast was ready  After enquiries of Mr  Reeves  whether I held in the same mind  or not  he desired to have the favour of one quarter of an hour s conversation with me alone   Methinks I have a value for this honest knight  Honesty  my Lucy  is good sense  politeness  amiableness  all in one  An honest man must appear in every light with such advantages  as will make even singularity agreeable  I went down directly   He met me  and taking my not withdrawn hand  and peering in my face  Mercy  said he
