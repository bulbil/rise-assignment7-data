I  be properly conducted  as it can no ways injure those who are flattered  so it may be a glorious incentive to those who are now capable of enjoying it  It is the duty of every good government to turn this monumental pride to its own advantage to become strong in the aggregate from the weakness of the individual  If none but the truly great have a place in this awful repository  a temple like this will give the finest lessons of morality  and be a strong incentive to true ambition  I am told  that none have a place here but characters of the most distinguished merit    The man in black seemed impatient at my observations  so I discontinued my remarks  and we walked on together to take a view of every particular monument in order as it lay       43As the eye is naturally caught by the finest objects  I could not avoid being particularly curious about one monument which appeared more beautiful than the rest  that  said I to my guide  I take to be the tomb of some very great man  By the peculiar excellence of the workmanship  and the magnificence of the design  this must be a trophy raised to the memory of some king who has saved his country from ruin  or law giver  who has reduced his fellow citizens from anarchy into just subjection——It is not requisite  replied my companion smiling  to have such qualifications in order to have a very fine monument here  More humble abilities will suffice  What  I suppose then  the gaining two or three battles  or the taking half a score towns  is thought a sufficient qualification  Gaining battles  or taking towns  replied the man in black  may be of service  but a gentleman may have a very fine monument here without ever seeing a battle or a siege  This then is the monument of some poet  I presume  of one whose wit has gained him immortality  No  sir  replied my guide  the gentleman who lies here never made verses  and as for wit  he despised it in others  because he had none himself  Pray tell me then in a word  said I peevishly  what is the great man who lies here particularly remarkable for  Remarkable  sir  said my companion  why  sir  the gentleman that lies here is remarkable  very remarkable—for a tomb in Westminster abbey  But  head of my Ancestors  how has he got here  I fancy he could never bribe the guardians of the temple to give him a place  Should he not be ashamed to be seen among company  where even moderate merit would look like infamy  I suppose  replied the man in black  the gentleman was rich  and his friends  as is usual   44 in such a case  told him he was great  He readily believed them  the guardians of the temple  as they got by the self delusion  were ready to believe him too  so he paid his money for a fine monument  and the workman  as you see  has made him one the most beautiful Think not  however  that this gentleman is singular in his desire of being buried among the great  there are several others in the temple  who  hated and shunned by the great while alive  have come here  fully resolved to keep them company now they are dead   As we walked along to a particular part of the temple  there  says the gentleman  pointing with his finger  that is the poets corner  there you see the monuments of Shakespear  and Milton  and Prior  and Drayton  Drayton  I replied  I never heard of him before  but I have been told of one Pope  is he there  It is time enough  replied my guide  these hundred years  he is not long dead  people have not done hating him yet  Strange  cried I  can any be found to hate a man  whose life was wholly spent in entertaining and instructing his fellow creatures  Yes  says my guide  they hate him for that very reason  There are a set of men called answerers of books  who take upon them to watch the republic of letters  and distribute reputation by the sheet  they somewhat resemble the eunuchs in a seraglio  who are incapable of giving pleasure themselves  and hinder those that would  These answerers have no other employment but to cry out Dunce  and Scribbler  to praise the dead  and revile the living  to grant a man of confessed abilities some small share of merit  to applaud twenty blockheads in order to gain the reputation of candour  and to revile the moral   45 character of the man whose writings they cannot injure Such wretches are kept in pay by some mercenary bookseller  or more frequently  the bookseller himself takes this dirty work off their hands  as all that is required is to be very abusive and very dull  every Poet of any genius is sure to find such enemies  he feels  though he seems to despise their malice  they make him miserable here  and in the pursuit of empty fame  at last he gains solid anxiety   Has this been the case with every poet I see
