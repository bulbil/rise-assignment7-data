of love in the beginning of their course  which should serve them through their whole journey  Neither side should expect those instances of kindness which are inconsistent with true freedom or happiness to bestow  Love  when founded in the heart  will shew itself in a thousand unpremeditated sallies of fondness  but every cool deliberate exhibition of   64 the passion  only argues little understanding  or great insincerity   Choang was the fondest husband  and Hansi the most endearing wife in all the kingdom of Korea  they were a pattern of conjugal bliss  the inhabitants of the country around saw  and envied their felicity  wherever Choang came  Hansi was sure to follow  and in all the pleasures of Hansi  Choang was admitted a partner  They walked hand in hand wherever they appeared  shewing every mark of mutual satisfaction  embracing  kissing  their mouths were for ever joined  and to speak in the language of anatomy  it was with them one perpetual anastomosis   Their love was so great  that it was thought nothing could interrupt their mutual peace  when an accident happened  which  in some measure  diminished the husband s assurance of his wife s fidelity  for love so refined as his  was subject to a thousand little disquietudes   Happening to go one day alone among the tombs that lay at some distance from his house  he there perceived a lady dressed in the deepest mourning   being cloathed all over in white  fanning the wet clay that was raised over one of the graves with a large fan  which she held in her hand  Choang  who had early been taught wisdom in the school of Lao  was unable to assign a cause for her present employment  and coming up  civilly demanded the reason  Alas  replied the lady  her eyes bathed in tears  how is it possible to survive the loss of my husband  who lies buried in this grave  he was the best of men  the tenderest of husbands    65 with his dying breath he bid me never marry again till the earth over his grave should be dry  and here you see me steadily resolving to obey his will  and endeavouring to dry it with my fan  I have employed two whole days in fulfilling his commands  and am determined not to marry till they are punctually obeyed  even though his grave should take up four days in drying   Choang  who was struck with the widow s beauty  could not  however  avoid smiling at her haste to be married  but  concealing the cause of his mirth  civilly invited her home  adding  that he had a wife who might be capable of giving her some consolation  As soon as he and his guest were returned  he imparted to Hansi in private what he had seen  and could not avoid expressing his uneasiness  that such might be his own case if his dearest wife should one day happen to survive him   It is impossible to describe Hansi s resentment at so unkind a suspicion  As her passion for him was not only great  but extremely delicate  she employed tears  anger  frowns  and exclamations  to chide his suspicions  the widow herself was inveighed against  and Hansi declared she was resolved never to sleep under the same roof with a wretch  who  like her  could be guilty of such barefac d inconstancy  The night was cold and stormy  however  the stranger was obliged to seek another lodging  for Choang was not disposed to resist  and Hansi would have her way   The widow had scarce been gone an hour  when an old disciple of Choang s  whom he had   66 not seen for many years  came to pay him a visit  He was received with the utmost ceremony  placed in the most honourable seat at supper  and the wine began to circulate with great freedom  Choang and Hansi exhibited open marks of mutual tenderness  and unfeigned reconciliation  nothing could equal their apparent happiness  so fond an husband  so obedient a wife  few could behold without regretting their own infelicity  When  lo  their happiness was at once disturbed by a most fatal accident  Choang fell lifeless in an apoplectic fit upon the floor  Every method was used  but in vain  for his recovery  Hansi was at first inconsolable for his death  after some hours  however  she found spirits to read his last will  The ensuing day she began to moralize and talk wisdom  the next day she was able to comfort the young disciple  and  on the third  to shorten a long story  they both agreed to be married   There was now no longer mourning in the apartments  the body of Choang was now thrust into an old coffin  and placed in one of the meanest rooms  there to lie unattended until the time prescribed by law for his interment  In the mean time Hansi  and the young disciple  were arrayed in the most magnificent habits  the bride wore in her nose a jewel of immense price  and her lover was dressed in all the finery of his former master  together with a pair of artificial whiskers that reached down to his toes  The hour of their nuptials was arrived
