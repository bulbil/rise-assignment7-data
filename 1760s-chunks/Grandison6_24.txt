my pen  It is not possible for me to write at this time  but to you  and on this subject  It is good for a busy mind to have something to be employed in  and I think  now I am amusing myself on paper  my heart is a little more governable than it was   I am glad we heard of his coming before we saw him  But surely Sir Charles Grandison should not have attempted to surprise us  Should he  my dear  Does it not look like the pride of a man assured of a joyful welcome  I have read of princes  who  acquianted with their Ladies by picture only  and having been married by proxy  have set out to their frontiers in•ognito  and in disguise have affected to surprise the poor apprehensive bride —But here  not only circumstances differ  since there has been no betrothment  but were he of princely rank  I should have expected a more delicate treatment from him —  How will the consciousness of inferiority and obligation set a proud and punctilious mind upon hunting for occasions to justify its caprices —A servant of   60 Sir Charles is just arrived with a billet directed for my uncle Selby  My aunt opened it  It is dated from Stratford  The contents are  after compliments of enquiry of our healths  to acquaint my uncle  that he shall put up at the George at Northampton  this night  and hopes to be allowed to pay his compliments to us to morrow morning  at breakfast  So he did not intend to give himself the consequence  of which my capricious heart was so apprehensive  Yet then  as if resolved to find fault  Is not this a little too parading for his natural freedom  thought I  Or does he think we should not be able to outlive our joyful surprize  if he gave us not notice of his arrival in these parts before he saw us —O Clementina —Goodness  Angel  What a meremortal  what a woman  dost thou make the poor Harriet Byron appear in her own eyes  How apprehensive of coming after thee  The sense I have of my own littleness  will make me little  indeed   Well  but I presume  that if my uncle and Mr  Deane meet him  they will prevail on him to come hither this night  Yet I suppose he must be allowed to go to the proposed inn afterwards —But here  he is come —Come  indeed —My uncle in the chariot with him  My cousin and Mr  Deane  Sally tells me  just alighted  Sally adores Sir Charles Grandison—Begone  Sally  Thy emotions  foolish wench  add to those of thy mistress —  THAT I might avoid the appearance of affectation  I was going down to welcome him when I met my uncle on the stairs  Niece Byron  said he  you have not done justice to Sir Charles Grandison  I thought your Love sick heart  What words were these  my dear  and at that moment too   must have been partial to him  He prevailed on me to go into his chariot  You may think yourself very happy  For fifteen miles together did he talk of nobody but you  Let me go down with you  Let me present you to him     61 I had before besought my spirits to befriend me  but for one half hour  Surely there is nothing so unwelcome as an unseasonable jest  Present me to him  Love sick heart  O my uncle  thought I  I was unable to proceed  I hastened back to my closet  as much disconcerted as a child could be  who  having taken pains to get its lesson by heart  dashed by a chiding countenance  forgot every syllable of it when it came to say it  You know  my dear  that I had not of some time been well  My spirits were weak  and joy was almost as painful to me as grief could have been   My aunt came up—My love  why don t you come down —What now  Why in tears —You will appear  to the finest man I ever saw in my life  very particular —Mr  Deane is in love with him  Your cousin James—  Dear madam  I am already  when I make comparisons between him and myself  humbled enough with his excellencies  I did intend to avoid particularity  but my uncle has quite disconcerted me—Yet he always means well  I ought not to complain  I attend you  madam   Can you  Lady G  forgive my pride  my petulance   My aunt went down before me  Sir Charles hastened to me  the moment I appeared  with an air of respectful love   He took my hand  and bowing upon it  I rejoice to see my dear Miss Byron  and to see her so well  How many sufferers must there be  when you suffer   I bid him welcome to England  I hope he heard me  I could not help speaking low  He must observe my discomposure  He led me to a seat  and sat down by me  still holding my hand  I withdrew it not presently  left he should think me precise  But  as there were so
