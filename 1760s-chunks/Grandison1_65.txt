unceremonious a manner  slap dash  as I may say  and not one objection to make  or which you will condescend to make   You say  Sir  that you love me above all women  Would you  can you be so little nice  as to wish to marry a woman who does not prefer you to all men —If you are  let me tell you  Sir  that you have assigned a reason against yourself  which I think I ought to look upon as conclusive   I make no doubt  madam  that my behaviour to you after marriage  will induce you in gratitude as well as justice  to prefer me to all men     157 Your behaviour after marriage  Sir —Never will I trust to that  where—  Where what  madam   No need of entering into particulars  Sir  You see that we cannot be of the same mind  You  Sir Hargrave  have no doubt of your merit—  I know  madam  that I should make it the business as well as pleasure of my life  to deserve you   You value yourself upon your fortune  Sir—  Only  as it gives me power to make you happy   Riches never yet  of themselves  made any body happy  I have already as great a fortune as I wish for  You think yourself polite—  Polite  madam —And I hope—  The whole of what I mean  Sir Hargrave  is this  You have a very high opinion of yourself  You may have reason for it  since you must know yourself  and your own heart  better than I can pretend to do  But would you  let me ask you  make choice of a woman for a wise  who frankly owns  that she cannot think so highly  as you imagine she ought to think of you —In justice to yourself  Sir—  By my Soul  madam  haughtily  you are the only woman who could thus—  Well  Sir  perhaps I am  But will not this singularity convince you  that I can never make you happy  nor you me  You tell me  that you think highly of me  but if I cannot think so highly of you  pray  Sir  let me be intitled to the same freedom in my refusal that governs you in your choice   He walked about the room  and gave himself airs that shewed greater inward than even outward emotion   I had a mind to leave him  yet was not willing to withdraw abruptly  intending  and hoping  to put an end to all his expectations for the future  I therefore in a manner asked for leave to withdraw   I presume  Sir  that nothing remains to be said but   158 what may be said before my cousins  And  courtesying  was going   He told me  with a passionate air  that he was halfdistracted  and complained of the use I made of the power I had over him  And as I had near opened the door  he threw himself on his knees to me against it  and undesignedly hurt my finger with the lock   He was grieved  I made light of it  tho  in pain  that he might not have an opportunity to flourish upon it  and to shew a tenderness which I doubt is not very natural to him   How little was I affected with his kneeling  to what I was with the same posture in Sir Rowland  Sir Hargrave supplicated me as before  I was forced  in answer  to repeat some of the same things that I had said before   I would fain have parted civilly  He would not permit me to do so  Though he was on his knees  he mingled passion  and even indirect menaces  with his supplications  I was forced to declare  that I never more would receive his visits   This declaration he vowed would make him desperate  and he cared not what became of him   I often begged him to rise  but to no purpose  till I declared that I would stay no longer with him  And then he arose  rapt out an oath or two  again called me proud and ungrateful  and followed me into the other room to my cousins  He could hardly be civil to them  he walked two or three turns about the room  At last  Forgive me  Mr  Reeves  Forgive me  Mrs  Reeves  said he  bowing to them  more stiffly to me—And you forbid my future visits  madam  said he  with a face of malice   I do  Sir  and that for both our sakes  You have greatly discomposed me   Next time  madam  I have the honour of attending you  it will be  I hope— He stopt a moment  but still looking fiercely  to an happier purpose  And away he went     159 Mr  Reeves was offended with him  and discouraged me not in my resolution to avoid receiving his future visits  You will now  therefore  hear very little farther in my Letters of this Sir Hargrave Pollexfen   And yet I wish I do not see him very soon
