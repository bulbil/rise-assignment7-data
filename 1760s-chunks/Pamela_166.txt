will treat you as my mother s   waiting maid   What says my girl to this       You may well guess  my dear father and mother  how transporting these   kind  these generous and condescending sentiments were to me   I thought   I had the harmony of the spheres all around me  and every word that   dropped from his lips was as sweet as the honey of Hybla to me   Oh    sir  said I  how inexpressibly kind and good is all this  Your poor   servant has a much greater struggle than this to go through  a more   knotty difficulty to overcome       What is that  said he  a little impatiently  I will not forgive your   doubts now   No  sir  said I  I cannot doubt  but it is  how I shall   support  how I shall deserve your goodness to me   Dear girl  said he    and hugged me to his breast  I was afraid you would have made me angry   again  but that I would not be  because I see you have a grateful heart    and this your kind and cheerful return  after such cruel usage as you   had experienced in my house  enough to make you detest the place  has   made me resolve to bear any thing in you  but doubts of my honour  at a   time when I am pouring out my soul  with a true and affectionate ardour    before you       But  good sir  said I  my greatest concern will be for the rude jests   you will have yourself to encounter with  for thus stooping beneath   yourself  For  as to me  considering my lowly estate  and little merit    even the slights and reflections of the ladies will be an honour to me    and I shall have the pride to place more than half their ill will to   their envy at my happiness  And if I can  by the most cheerful duty  and   resigned obedience  have the pleasure to be agreeable to you  I shall   think myself but too happy  let the world say what it will       He said  You are very good  my dearest girl  But how will you bestow   your time  when you will have no visits to receive or pay  No parties of   pleasure to join in  No card tables to employ your winter evenings  and   even  as the taste is  half the day  summer and winter  And you have   often played with my mother  too  and so know how to perform a part   there  as well as in the other diversions  and I ll assure you  my girl    I shall not desire you to live without such amusements  as my wife might   expect  were I to marry a lady of the first quality       O  sir  said I  you are all goodness  How shall I bear it   But do you   think  sir  in such a family as yours  a person whom you shall honour   with the name of mistress of it  will not find useful employments for   her time  without looking abroad for any others       In the first place  sir  if you will give me leave  I will myself look   into such parts of the family economy  as may not be beneath the rank   to which I shall have the honour of being exalted  if any such there   can be  and this  I hope  without incurring the ill will of any honest   servant       Then  sir  I will ease you of as much of your family accounts  as I   possibly can  when I have convinced you that I am to be trusted with   them  and you know  sir  my late good lady made me her treasurer  her   almoner  and every thing       Then  sir  if I must needs be visiting or visited  and the ladies won t   honour me so much  or even if they would now and then  I will visit  if   your goodness will allow me so to do  the sick poor in the neighbourhood   around you  and administer to their wants and necessities  in such   matters as may not be hurtful to your estate  but comfortable to them    and entail upon you their blessings  and their prayers for your dear   health and welfare       Then I will assist your housekeeper  as I used to do  in the making   jellies  comfits  sweetmeats  marmalades  cordials  and to pot  and   candy  and preserve for the uses of the family  and to make  myself  all   the fine
