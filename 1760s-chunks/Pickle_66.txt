approbation with  which they were received on the other  suffice it to say that the  endearing intimacy of their former connection was instantly renewed  and  Sophy  who congratulated them on the happy termination of their quarrel   favoured with their mutual confidence  In consequence of this happy  pacification  they deliberated upon the means of seeing each other  often  and as he could not  without some previous introduction  visit  her openly at the house of her relation  they agreed to meet every  afternoon in the park till the next assembly  at which he would solicit  her as a partner  and she be unengaged  in expectation of his request   By this connection he would be entitled to visit her next day  and  thus an avowed correspondence would of course commence  This plan was  actually put in execution  and attended with a circumstance which had  well nigh produced some mischievous consequence  had not Peregrine s  good fortune been superior to his discretion   CHAPTER XXIV   He achieves an Adventure at the Assembly  and quarrels with his  Governor   At the assembly  were no fewer than three gentlemen of fortune  who  rivalled our lover in his passion for Emilia  and who had severally  begged the honour of dancing with her upon this occasion  She had  excused herself to each  on pretence of a slight indisposition that she  foresaw would detain her from the ball  and desired they would provide  themselves with other partners  Obliged to admit her excuse  they  accordingly followed her advice  and after they had engaged themselves  beyond the power of retracting  had the mortification of seeing her  there unclaimed  They in their turn made up to her  and expressed their  surprise and concern at finding her in the assembly unprovided  after  she had declined their invitation  but she told them that her cold had  forsaken her since she had the pleasure of seeing them  and that she  would rely upon accident for a partner  Just as she pronounced these  words to the last of the three  Peregrine advanced as an utter stranger   bowed with great respect  told her he understood she was unengaged  and  would think himself highly honoured in being accepted as her partner for  the night  and he had the good fortune to succeed in his application   As they were by far the handsomest and best accomplished couple in the  room  they could not fail of attracting the notice and admiration of the  spectators  which inflamed the jealousy of his three competitors  who  immediately entered into a conspiracy against this gaudy stranger  whom   as their rival  they resolved to affront in public  Pursuant to the plan  which they projected for this purpose  the first country dance was no  sooner concluded  than one of them  with his partner  took place of  Peregrine and his mistress  contrary to the regulation of the ball  Our  lover  imputing his behaviour to inadvertency  informed the gentleman of  his mistake  and civilly desired he would rectify his error  The other  told him  in an imperious tone  that he wanted none of his advice  and  bade him mind his own affairs  Peregrine answered  with some warmth  and  insisted upon his right  a dispute commenced  high words  ensued  in the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   course of which  our impetuous youth hearing himself reviled with the  appellation of scoundrel  pulled off his antagonist s periwig  and  flung it in his face  The ladies immediately shrieked  the gentlemen  interposed  Emilia was seized with a fit of trembling  and conducted  to her seat by her youthful admirer  who begged pardon for having  discomposed her  and vindicated what he had done  by representing the  necessity he was under to resent the provocation he had received   Though she could not help owning the justice of his plea  she not the  less concerned at the dangerous situation in which he had involved  himself  and  in the utmost consternation and anxiety  insisted upon  going directly home  he could not resist her importunities  and her  cousin being determined to accompany her  he escorted to their lodgings   where he wished them good night  after having  in order to quiet their  apprehensions  protested  that if his opponent was satisfied  he should  never take any step towards the prosecution of the quarrel  Meanwhile  the assembly room became a of scene of tumult and uproar  the person who  conceived himself injured  seeing Peregrine retire  struggled with his  companions  in order to pursue and take satisfaction of our hero  whom  he loaded with terms of abuse  and challenged to single combat  The  director of the ball held a consultation with all the subscribers who  were present  and it was determined  by a majority of votes  that the  two gentlemen who had occasioned the disturbance should be desired to  withdraw  This resolution being signified to one of the parties then  present  he made some difficulty of complying  but was persuaded to  submit by his two confederates
