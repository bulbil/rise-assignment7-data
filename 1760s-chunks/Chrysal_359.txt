GUINEA 431     you to that and many other things equally grosa and shocking in   speculation  Marriage is a mutual trust of honour  A man s   marrying a woman  therefore  who has lost her honour  is trusting   his whole fortune to a bankrupt who has no security to give for that   trust   a foolhardiness that must proceed either from a conscious    ness of having himself no honour to lose  a total disregard to the   loss  or an affectation of acting on different principles from the rest   of mankind  as a proof of being above their prejudices  Where her   honour indeed has been lost to himself  justice makes it a duty   upon him to repair her loss by marriage   but then that very marriage   is a punishment for his crime  as it must want the essential happi    ness of confidence   for he will be always ready to suspect that   the disposition which betrayed her into error with him may have   the same effect with others  Nor is this suspicion unnatural  I   see you would argue from the habitual  avowed incontinence of   man  that this trust of honour is not equal  and therefore cannot be   obliging  But this is judging without duly considering the subject    Chastity is  in its nature  a virtue equally the duty of both sexes   to observe  and  with regard to society iu general  the violation of   it is equally criminal in both   but in those nearer connections of   life  the interest of which is the more immediate object of human   attention  the consequences of that violation in woman are attended   with so much greater iuconveniences than in man  that  in respect   to them  the crime is obviously less pardonable in her than him     and  for this reason  this virtue of chastity is made  in a peculiar   manner  the honour of woman   while the honour of man is placed   in other virtues  from which she receives as much advantage as   he does from her chastity   and  therefore  the trust of honour is   mutual and equal  In distinguishing thus between honour and   virtue  I speak according to the notions of maiikind   in their own   nature there is no distinction between them      There was something in the whole appearance of the person to   whom my mistress paid me away  that made me expect to see a   character of the oast which I had not yet met with among man    kind  His looks were sly  methodical  and plodding  Practice   had fixed upon his passive face the hollow varnish of a servile   smile   and an over acted affectation of polite behaviour made   his natural awkwardness truly ridiculous  But under all this   I could see a depth of design  and latitude of principle equal to any   great attempt  the success of which should in the opiaion of the   world determine the quality of that greatness  whether villainy or   virtue  That knowledge of his life which is necessary to explain   his character  and account for the principles upon which he acted   consistently his manifold part  will be comprised in a few words    Sprung from the dregs of the people  and turned loose upon the   world to shift for himself  as soon as he was able to crawl  he took   his stand about the house of a person in business  where he hardly   earned a morsel of broken victuals  by running of errands  cleaning   shoes  and such offices as are performed by those servants of servants      I see you wonder at my saying he was sprung from the dregs of   the people  as if difierence of rank could make any alteration in the   essential equality of human nature   but without entering into a         432 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     discussion of undetermined points  on both sides of whicli much has   been said with equal strength of reason  the best observation of   the power of early example  to impress those principles which are   to govern the future life  will sufficiently justify my using the ex    pression here  The patience with which he was obliged to bear   the cuffs and kicks of those worst of tyrants  who always wantonly   revenge tenfold upon their wretched underlings whatever they   suffer themselves  taught him that hypocrisy and abject submission   to everything that might anyway serve his convenience  which   afterwards proved the groundwork of his fortune   as the example   of his parents  who got their living by retailing to the poor the   meanest necessaries of Ufe  initiated him so early into every species   of low fraud and chicane  that they became absolutely natural to   him  and invariably ruled
