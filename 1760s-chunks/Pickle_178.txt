of the party  sat in silent  mortification  In all probability  he deliberated with himself  whether  or not he should expostulate with the young gentleman on the freedom he  had taken with his character in a company of strangers  but as he knew  he had not a Pallet to deal with  he very prudently suppressed that  suggestion  and  in secret  chewed the cud of resentment   After they had visited the physic garden  the university  the anatomical  hall  and every other thing that was recommended to their view  they    6 22 15  3 45 PM   returned to Rotterdam  and held a consultation upon the method of  transporting themselves to England  The doctor  whose grudge against  Peregrine was rather inflamed than allayed by our hero s indifference  and neglect  had tampered with the simplicity of the painter  who was  proud of his advances towards a perfect reconciliation  and now took the  opportunity of parting with our adventurer  by declaring that he and  his friend Mr  Pallet were resolved to take their passage in a trading  sloop  after he had heard Peregrine object against that tedious   disagreeable  and uncertain method of conveyance  Pickle immediately saw  his intention  and  without using the least argument to dissuade them  from their design  or expressing the smallest degree of concern at their  separation  very coolly wished them a prosperous voyage  and ordered his  baggage to be sent to Helvoetsluys  There he himself  and his retinue   went on board of the packet next day  and  by the favour of a fair wind   in eighteen hours arrived at Harwich   CHAPTER LXVI   Peregrine delivers his Letters of Recommendation at London  and returns  to the Garrison  to the unspeakable joy of the Commodore and his whole  Family   Now that our hero found himself on English ground  his heart dilated  with the proud recollection of his own improvement since he left his  native soil  He began to recognise the interesting ideas of his tender  years  he enjoyed  by anticipation  the pleasure of seeing his friends  in the garrison  after an absence of eighteen months  and the image  of his charming Emily  which other less worthy considerations had  depressed  resumed the full possession of his breast  He remembered   with shame  that he had neglected the correspondence with her brother   which he himself had solicited  and in consequence of which he had  received a letter from that young gentleman  while he lived at Paris  In  spite of these conscientious reflections he was too self sufficient to  think he should find any difficulty in obtaining forgiveness for  such sins of omission  and began to imagine that his passion would  be prejudicial to the dignity of his situation  if it should not be  gratified upon terms which formerly his imagination durst not conceive   Sorry I am  that the task I have undertaken  lays me under the necessity  of divulging this degeneracy in the sentiment of our imperious youth   who was now in the heyday of his blood  flushed with the consciousness  of his own qualifications  vain of his fortune  and elated on the  wings of imaginary expectation  Though he was deeply enamoured of Miss  Gauntlet  he was far from proposing her heart as the ultimate aim of  his gallantry  which  he did not doubt  would triumph over the most  illustrious females of the land  and at once regale his appetite and  ambition   Meanwhile  being willing to make his appearance at the garrison equally  surprising and agreeable  he cautioned Mr  Jolter against writing to the  commodore  who had not heard of them since their departure from Paris   and hired a post chaise and horses  for London  The governor  going out    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to give orders about the carriage  inadvertently left a paper book open  upon the table  and his pupil  casting his eyes upon the page  chanced  to read these words   Sept  15  Arrived in safety  by the blessing of  God  in this unhappy kingdom of England  And thus concludes the journal  of my last peregrination   Peregrine s curiosity being inflamed by this  extraordinary conclusion he turned to the beginning  and perused several  sheets of a diary such as is commonly kept by that class of people known  by the denomination of travelling governors  for the satisfaction of  themselves and the parents or guardians of their pupils  and for the  edification and entertainment of their friends   That the reader may have a clear idea of Mr  Jolter s performance  we  shall transcribe the transactions of one day  as he had recorded them   and that abstract will be a sufficient specimen of the whole plan and  execution of the work    May 3  At eight o clock  set out from Boulogne in a post chaise  the  morning hazy and cold  Fortified my stomach with a cordial  Recommended  ditto to Mr  P  as an antidote against the fog  Mem  He refused it
