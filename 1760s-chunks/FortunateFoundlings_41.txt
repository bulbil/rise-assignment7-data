  the truth by keeping a watchful eye over her behaviour without   seeming to do so       During the time of their little journey from the palace of St  Germains   to Paris  where monsieur the baron de Palfoy ordinarily resided  nothing   farther was discoursed on  but when they arrived  and mademoiselle   Charlotta had opportunity of reflecting on this sudden turn  she gave a   loose to all the anxieties it occasioned   she was not only snatch d   from the presence of what was most dear to her on earth  but as she had   no confidante  nor durst make any  was also without any means either of   conveying a letter to him  or receiving the least intelligence from him       She had been in Paris but a very little time before she perceived the   baron artfully kept her in the most severe restraint under a shew of   liberty  pretending to her  as he had done to the princess  that he was   not well enough to go abroad  he would stay at home whole days together    and oblige her to read  or play to him on the spinnet  which frequently   she did with an aking heart  and when she went out  it was always in   company with a relation whom he kept at his house on purpose  as he   said  as a companion to divert her  but in reality to be a spy over all   her actions  and had orders to dive  by all the insinuations she was   mistress of  into her very thoughts  All this mademoiselle Charlotta had   penetration enough to discover  and  spite of the discontent she   laboured under  so well concealed what they endeavoured to find out    that all the traps laid for her were wholly ineffectual       But in what manner did the enamoured Horatio support so cruel an   affliction  he was no sooner informed at his return from hunting of what   had happened  than he was seized with agonies  which  in the force he   did himself to conceal  threw him into a fever that confined him to his   bed for several days  as his passion for mademoiselle Charlotta was not   in the least suspected  every body imputed his disorder to be occasioned   by having over heated himself in the chace  and during his indisposition   was visited by all the court   the Chevalier St  George sent two or   three times a day to enquire of the health of his countryman  as he was   pleased to call him  and gave him many other tokens how greatly he was   in his favour  but all the civilities he received were not capable of   lessening the anguish of his mind  which kept his body so weak  that   tho  youth and an excellent constitution threw off the fever in a short   time  yet he was unable to quit his chamber in near three weeks  and   when he did  appeared so wan and so dejected  that he seemed no more   than the shadow of the once gay and sprightly Horatio       But while he was thus sinking under the burden of his griefs  and   despairing ever to see his adorable Charlotta any more  fate was   providing for him a relief as unexpected as the cause of his present   unhappy situation had been  and to the very same persons also was he   indebted both for the one and the other       Young monsieur de Coigney was not less alarmed than Horatio at the   removal of Charlotta  tho  it had not the same effect on him  he was   continually teizing his sister to make her a visit and repeat her   intercessions in his behalf  but she had received such tart answers on   that score  that she was very unwilling to undertake the embassy    however  she complied at last  and was received by mademoiselle   Charlotta in the most obliging manner  but had not the least opportunity   of executing her commission  that lady having a good deal of company   with her  whom she purposely detained to avoid entering into any   particular conversation with her  till the hour in which she knew her   attendance on the queen would oblige her to take leave       The baron de Palfoy was at that time abroad  but when he was informed   who had been there  was a little disturbed that the sister of de Coigney   endeavoured still to keep up her intimacy with his daughter  not   doubting but she had either brought some letter or message from him  as   he was fully persuaded in his mind that there was a mutual affection   between them  but he took no notice of it as yet  thinking that probably   she might make a second visit  and that then he should be better able to   judge of the motive
