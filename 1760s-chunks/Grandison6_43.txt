said my uncle  throwing yourself in his arms at once  when he demands the result of our deliberations  If I follow Mr  Deane s advice  I am to give him my hand at the first word  If Lucy s and Nancy s  he is not to ask me twice  If my grandmamma s and aunt s  They are always good  I am to act as occasion requires  and   107 as my own confided in prudence will suggest at the time  but to be sure not to be guilty of affectation  But still  my dear Ladies  something sticks with me  and ought it not   in relation to the noble Clementina   LETTER XXII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Saturday Night  Oct  14   NOW  my dear Ladies L  and G  let me lay before you  just as it happened  for your approbation  or censure  all that has passed between the best of men and your Harriet  Happy shall I be  If I can be acquitted by his sisters   My grandmamma went home last night  but was here before Sir Charles  yet he came a little after Eleven  We were all in the great parlour when he came  He addressed us severally with his usual politeness  and my grandmother  particularly  with such an air of reverence  as did himself credit  because of her years and wisdom   We all congratulated him on what we had heard from Mr  Fenwick   Mr  Greville and I  said he  are on every good terms  When I have the presumption to think myself a welcome guest  I am to introduce him as my friend  Mr  Greville  tho  so long your neighbour  modestly doubts his own welcome   Well he may  said my aunt Selby  after—No afters  dear madam  if you mean any thing that has passed between him and me   He again addressed himself to me  I rejoice  Sir  said I  that you have quieted so happily a spirit always thought uncontroulable   You must tell me  madam  replyed he  when I can be allowed to introduce Mr  Greville to you     108 Shall I answer for my cousin  said Lucy —I did not  Sir Charles  think you such a designer —You were not  you know  to introduce Mr  Greville  till you were assured of being yourself a very welcome guest to my cousin   I own my plot  replied he  I had an intent to surprise Miss Byron into an implied favour to myself   You need not  Sir Charles  thought I  take such a method   On his taking very kind notice of my cousin James  Do you know  Sir Charles  said my uncle  whose joy  when it overflows  seldom suffers the dear man to consult seasonableness  that that boy is already in Love with your Emily —The youth blushed—  I am obliged to every body who loves my Emily  She is a favourite of Miss Byron—Must she not then be a good girl   She is indeed a favourite  said I  and so great a one  that I know not who can deserve her   I said this  lest Sir Charles should think  on a supposition that my uncle meant something  that my cousin had my countenance   Sir Charles then addressed himself to my grandmamma and aunt  speaking low—I hope  Ladies  I may be allowed in your presence to resume the conversation of yesterday with Miss Byron   No  Sir Charles  answered my grandmamma  affecting to look serious  that must not be   Must not be  madam  and he seemed surprised  and affected too  My aunt was a little startled  but not so much as she would have been  had she not known the lively turns which that excellent parent sometimes gives to subjects of conversation   Must not be  I repent  Sir Charles  But I will not suffer you to be long in suspense  We have always  when proposals of this kind have been made  referred ourselves to our Harriet  She has prudence  She has gratitude  We will leave her and you together  when   109 she is inclined to hear you on the interesting subject  I know I am right  Harriet is above disguises  She will be obliged to speak for herself  when she has not either her aunt or me to refer to  She and you are not acquaintance of yesterday  You  Sir  I dare say  will not he displeased with the opportunity—  Neither Miss Byron nor I  madam  could wish for the absence of two such parental relations  But this reference I will presume to construe as a hopeful prognostic  May I now  through your mediation  madam  to my aunt  hope for the opportunity of addressing myself to Miss Byron   My aunt  taking me to the window  told me what had passed  I was a little surprised at my grandmamma s reference to myself only  I expostulated with my aunt  It is plain▪ madam  that Sir Charles expected not this compliment   Your grandmamma s motion surprised me a little my dear  It proceeded
