since you are—  Pray  madam—    150 Well  well  give me your hand—You must leave Harrier and me together   She humorously courtesied to him as he bowed to me  taking the compliment as to herself  She nodded her head to him  as he turned back his when he was at the door  and when he was gone  If I can but make this man orderly  said she  I shall not quarrel with my brother for hurrving me  as he has done   You are wrong  excessively wrong  Charlotte  You call my Lord a silly man  but can have no proof that he is so  but by his bearing this treatment from you   None of your grave airs  my dear  The man is a good sort of man  and will be so▪ if you and Lady L  don t spoil him  I have a vast deal of roguery  but no ill nature  in my heart  There is luxury in jesting with a solemn man  who wants to assume airs of privilege  and thinks he has a right to be impertinent  I ll tell you how I will manage—I believe I shall often try his patience  and when I am conscious that I have gone too far  I will be patient if he is angry with me  so we shall be quits  Then I ll begin again  He will resent  And if I find his aspect very solemn—Come  come  no glouting  friend  I will say  and perhaps smile in his face  I ll play you a tune  or sing you a song—Which  which  Speak in a moment  or the humour will be off   If he was ready to cry before  he will laugh then  tho  against his will  And as he admires my finger  and my voice  shall we not be instantly friends   It signified nothing to rave at her  She will have her way  Poor Lord G  —At my first knowlege of her  I thought her very lively  but imagined not that she was indiscreetly so   Lord G  s fondness for his saucy bride was  as I have reason to believe  his fault  I dare not to ask for particulars of their quarrel  And if I had  and found it so  could not  with such a raillying creature  have entered into his defence or censured her     151 I went down a few moments before her  Lord G  whispered me  that he should be the happiest man in the world  if I  who had such an influence over her  would stand his friend   I hope  my Lord  said I  that you will not want any influence but your own  She has a thousand good qualities  She has charming spirits  You will have nothing to bear with but from them  They will not last always  Think only  that she can mean nothing by the exertion of them  but innocent gaiety  and she will every day love your Lordship the better for bearing with her  You know she is generous and noble   I see  madam  said she  she has let you into—  She has not acquainted me with the particulars of the little misunderstanding  only has said  that there had been a slight one  which was quite made up   I am ashamed  replied he  to have it thought by Miss Byron  that there could have been a misunderstanding between us  especially so early  She knows her power over me  I am afraid  she despises me   Impossible  my Lord  Have you not observed  that she spares nobody when she is in a lively humour   True—But here she comes —Not a word  madam —I bowed assenting silence  Lord G  said she  approaching him  in a low voice  I shall be jealous of your conversations with Miss Byron   Would to heaven  my dearest life  snatching at her withdrawn hand  that—  I were half as good as Miss Byron  I understand you —But time and patience  Sir  nodding to him  and passing him   Admirable creature  said he  how I adore her   I hinted to her afterwards  his fear of her despising him  Harriet  answered she  with a serious air  I will do my duty by him  I will abhor my own heart  if I ever find in it the shadow of a regard for any man in the World  inconsistent with that which he has a right to expect from me     152 I was pleased with her  And found an opportunity to communicate what she said  in confidence  to my Lord  and had his blessings for it   But now for some account of Lady Olivia  With which I will begin a new Letter   LETTER XXI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   SIR Charles returned with the Ladies  He presented to Lady Olivia and her Aunt  Lady G  Lord L  and Lord W  I was in another apartment talking with Dr  Bartlett  Lady Olivia asked for the doctor  He left me to pay his respects to her  Sir Charles being informed
