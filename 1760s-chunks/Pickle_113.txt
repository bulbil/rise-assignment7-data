 any individual person as the seducer of his yoke fellow  and when he  mentioned Peregrine as the object of his suspicion  granted a warrant  and a detachment of soldiers  to search for and retrieve the fugitive   The husband conducted them immediately to the academy where our hero  lodged  and having rummaged the whole place  to the astonishment of  Mr  Jolter  without finding either his wife or the supposed ravisher   accompanied them to all the public houses in the Faubourg  which having  examined also without success  he returned to the magistrate in a state  of despair  and obtained a promise of his making such an effectual  inquiry  that in three days he should have an account of her  provided  she was alive  and within the walls of Paris   Our adventurer  who had foreseen all this disturbance  was not at all  surprised when his governor told him what had happened  and conjured  him to restore the woman to the right owner  with many pathetic  remonstrances touching the heinous sin of adultery  the distraction of  the unfortunate husband  and the danger of incurring the resentment of  an arbitrary government  which  upon application being made would  not fail of espousing the cause of the injured  He denied  with great  effrontery  that he had the least concern in the matter  pretended to  resent the deportment of Hornbeck  whom he threatened to chastise for  his scandalous suspicion  and expressed his displeasure at the credulity  of Jolter  who seemed to doubt the veracity of his asseveration     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Notwithstanding this confident behaviour  Jolter could not help  entertaining doubts of his sincerity  and  visiting the disconsolate  swain  begged he would  for the honour of his country  as well as  for the sake of his own reputation  discontinue his addresses to the  lieutenant de police  and apply to the British ambassador  who  by dint  of friendly admonitions  would certainly prevail upon Mr  Pickle to do  him all the justice in his power  if he was really the author of  the injury he had sustained  The governor urged this advice with the  appearance of so much sympathy and concern  promising to co operate  within his influence in his behalf  that Hornbeck embraced the proposal   communicated his purpose to the magistrate  who commended the resolution  as the most decent and desirable expedient he could use  and then waited  upon his excellency  who readily espoused his cause  and sending for the  young gentleman that same evening  read him such a lecture in private   as extorted a confession of the whole affair  Not that he assailed him  with sour and supercilious maxims  or severe rebuke  because he  had penetration enough to discern that Peregrine s disposition was  impregnable to all such attacks  but he first of all rallied him on his  intriguing genius  then  in a humorous manner  described the distraction  of the poor cuckold  who he owned was justly punished for the absurdity  of his conduct  and lastly  upon the supposition that it would be no  great effort in Pickle to part with such a conquest  especially after  it had been for some time possessed  represented the necessity and  expediency of restoring her  not only out of regard to his own character  and that of his nation  but also with a view to his ease  which would in  a little time be very much invaded by such an incumbrance  that in all  probability would involve him in a thousand difficulties and disgusts   Besides  he assured him that he was already  by order of the lieutenant  de police  surrounded with spies  who would watch all his motions  and  immediately discover the retreat in which he had disposed his prize   These arguments  and the frank familiar manner in which they were  delivered  but  above all  the last consideration  induced the young  gentleman to disclose the whole of his proceedings to the ambassador   and he promised to be governed by his direction  provided the lady  should not suffer for the step she had taken  but  be received by her  husband with due reverence and respect  These stipulations being agreed  to  he undertook to produce her in eight and forty hours  and  taking  coach  immediately drove to the place of her residence  where he spent  a whole day and night in convincing her of the impossibility of their  enjoying each other in that manner  then  returning to Paris  he  delivered her into the hands of the ambassador  who  having assured her  that she might depend upon his friendship and protection  in case she  should find herself aggrieved by the jealous temper of Mr  Hornbeck   restored her to her legitimate lord  whom he counselled to exempt her  from that restraint which in all probability had been the cause of  her elopement  and endeavour to conciliate her affection by tender and  respectful usage   The husband behaved with great humility and compliance  protesting  that his chief study should be to contrive parties for her
