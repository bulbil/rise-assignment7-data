was relieved by the assistance of Doctor Mead  In this state of stupefaction she continued all night  she gave some signs of life between twelve and one next day  but expired the next morning  a little after seven o clock  having lived forty nine years five months and six days  and having reigned more than twelve years with honour  equity  and applause  This Princess was rather amiable than great  rather pleasing than beautiful  neither her capacity nor learning were remarkable  Like all those of her family  she seemed rather fitted for the private duties of life than a public station  a pattern of conjugal affection  a good mother  a warm friend  and an indulgent mistress  During her reign none suffered on the scaffold for treason  so that after a long succession of faulty or cruel Kings  she shines with particular lustre  In her ended the line of the Stewarts  a family  the misfortunes and misconducts of which are not to be paralleled in history  a family who  less than men themselves  seemed to expect from their followers more than manhood in their defence  a family demanding rather our pity than assistance  who never rewarded their friends  nor avenged them of their enemies   I am   c   LETTER XIV   THE nearer we approach to our own times  in this survey of English history  the more important every occurrence becomes  our own interests are blended with those of the state  and the accounts of public welfare are but the transcript of private happiness  The two parties which had long divided the kingdom  under the names of Whig and Tory  now seemed to alter their titles  the Whigs being   113 styled Hanoverians  and the Tories branded with the appellation of Jacobites  The former  desired to be governed by a King  who was a Protestant  though a foreigner  the latter  by a Monarch of their own country  though a Papist  Of two inconveniencies  however  that seemed the least  where religion seemed to be in no danger  and the Hanoverians prevailed   The Jacobites had been long flattered with the hopes of seeing the succession altered by the Earl of Oxford  but by the premature death of the Queen  all their expectations at once were blasted  the diligence and activity of the privy council  in which the Hanoverian interest prevailed  completed their confusion  and they now found themselves without any leader to give consistency to their designs  and force to their councils  Upon recollection they saw nothing so eligible as silence and submission  they hoped much from the assistance of France  and still more from the vigour of the pretender   Pursuant to the act of succession  George I  son of Ernest Augustus  first Elector of Brunswick  and Sophia  grand daughter to James I  ascended the British throne  His mature age  being now fifty four years old  his sagacity and experience  his numerous alliances  the general peace of Europe  all contributed to his support  and promised a peaceable and happy reign  His virtues  though not shining  were solid  he was of a very different disposition from the Stewart family  whom he succeeded  they were known to a proverb for leaving their friends in distress  George  on the contrary  soon after his arrival in England  used to say    My maxim is never to abandon my friends  to do justice to all the world  and to fear no man   To these qualifications he joined great application to business  but generally studied more the interests of those subjects he had left behind  than of these he came to govern       114 The King first landed at Greenwich  where he was received by the Duke of Northumberland  and the Lords of the regency  From the landing place he walked to his house in the Park  accompanied by a great number of the nobility  and other persons of distinction  who had the honour to kiss his hand  as they approached  When he retired to his bed chamber  he sent for those of the nobility who had distinguished themselves by their zeal for his succession  but the Duke of Ormond  the Lord Chancellor  and Lord Trevor  were not of the number  Lord Oxford too  the next morning  was received with marks of disapprobation  and none but the Whig party were admitted into any share of confidence  The King of a faction is but the sovereign of half his subjects  of this  however  the Monarch I speak of did not seem sensible  it was his misfortune  as well as that of the nation  that he was hemmed round by men who soured him with all their interests and prejudices  none now but the violent in faction were admitted into employment  and the Whigs  while they pretended to secure for him the crown  were  with all possible diligence  abridging the prerogative  An instantaneous and total change was effected in all offices of honour and advantage  The Whigs governed the senate  and the court disposed of all places at pleasure  whom they would they oppressed  bound the lower orders of people with new and severe laws  and this they called liberty   These partialities  and this oppression  soon raised
