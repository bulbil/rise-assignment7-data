coaches near a stone s throw from the Church porch  then was my lovely cousin put to it  especially as her grandmother walked so slow  We were all out of our Coaches before the Father and the Bride entered the   326 Porch  I should tell your Ladyship  that the passage from the entrance of the Church yard to the Church is railed in  Every Sunday the croud  gathered to see the gentry go in and come out  are accustomed to be bounded by these rails and were the more contentedly so now  The whole Church yard seemed one mass  but for that separating passage  of living matter  distinguished only by separate heads  not a hat on the mens  pulled off  perhaps  by general consent  for the convenience of seeing  more than from designed regard in that particular  But  in the main  never was there such silent respect shewn  on the like occasion  by mortal mob  We all of us  Lady L  have the happiness of being beloved by high and low   But one pretty spectacle it is impossible to pass by  Four girls  tenants daughters  the eldest not above Thirteen  appeared with neat wicker baskets in their hands  filled with flowers of the season  Chearful way was made for them  As soon as the Bride  and Father  and Sir Charles  and Mrs  Shirley  alighted  these pretty little Flora s  all dressed in white  chaplets of flowers for head dresses  large nosegays in their bosoms  white ribbands adorning their stays and their baskets  some streaming down  others tied round the handles in true lover s knots  attended the company  two going before  two other here and there  and every where  all strewing flowers  A pretty thought of the tenants among themselves  Sir Charles seemed much pleased with them  Pretty dears he called them  to one of them   God bless you  and God bless you  was echoed from many mouths  Your brother s attention was chiefly employed on Mrs  Shirley  because of her age and lameness  Here my good Lady G  perhaps would stop to remark upon the worthy nature of the English populace  when good characters attract their admiration  for even the populace took notice  how right a thing it was for the finest young Gentleman their eyes   327 ever beheld  to take such care of so good an old Lady  He deserved to live to be old himself  one said  They would warrant  others said  that he was a sweettemper d man  and others  that he had a good heart  In the Procession one of us picked up one praise  another another  Tho  Lady G  Lady W  and the four Bride maids  as well as the Lords  might have claimed high notice  yet not any of them received more than commendation  We were all considered but as Satellites to the Planetr that passed before us  What  indeed  were more  But let me say  that Mrs  Shirley had her share in Reverence  as the lovely Couple had theirs in Admiration  But O how my dear cousin was affected  when she alighted from her uncle s coach   The Churchwardens themselves were so complaisant as to stand at the Church door  and opened it  on the approach of the Bride  and her Nuptial Father  But all the pews near the Altar were  however  filled  one or two excepted  which seemed to be left for the company  with Ladies and well dressed women of the neighbourhood  And tho  they seemed to intend to shut the doors after we had all got in  the Church was full of people  Mr  Selby was displeased  for his Niece s sake  who trembling  could hardly walk up to the Altar  Sir Charles seated his venerable charge on a covered bench on the left side of the Altar  and by her  and on another covered bench on the rightside  without the rails  we all  but the Bride maids and their partners  took our seats  They stood  the Men on the Bridegroom s side  the Maids on Harriet s—Never—  Lady G      Are you within the Church  Lucy —You are  I protest  Let me read what you have done  Come  pretty well  pretty well —You were going to praise my brother  Leave that to me  I have an excellent knack at it        328 Never was man so much  and so deservedly  admired  He saw his Harriet wanted support and encouragement  The Minister stood suspended  a few moments  as doubting whether she would not faint  My dearest Love  whispered Sir Charles  remember you are doing honour to the happy  thrice happy  man of your Choice  Shew he is your Choice  in the face of this Congregation  Pardon me  Sir  I will endeavour to be all you wish me   Sir Charles bowed to the Minister to begin the Sacred Office  Mr  Selby  with all his bravery  trembled  and  overcome by the Solemnity of the Preparation  looked now pale  now red  The whole Congregation were hushed and silent  as if
