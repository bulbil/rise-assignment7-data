  undertake the siege of Ingoldstadt  our young cornet attended his grace   to the relief of prince Eugene  who expected to be attacked by the   united army of Bavarians and French  then encamped near Hockstadt       It would be needless to give any description of this famous battle  few   of my readers but must be acquainted with it  so I shall only say  that   among the number of those few prisoners the French had to boast of in   attonement for so great a defeat  was the young brave Horatio  who fell   to the lot of the baron de la Valiere  nephew to the marquis of Sille    This nobleman being extremely taken with his person and behaviour    treated him in the politest manner  and tho  he carried him with him   into France  assured him  that it was more for the pleasure of   entertaining him there than any other consideration  Horatio was not   much afflicted at this misfortune  because it gave him an opportunity of   seeing a country he had heard so much commended  and also to make   himself master of a language  which  tho  he understood  he spoke but   imperfectly       The baron was not only one of the most gallant  but also one of the best   humoured men in the world  he spared nothing during the whole time they   tarried in his quarters  nor in their journey to Paris  which might   contribute to make his prisoner easy under his present circumstances    and among other things  often said to him  if you and some others have   fallen under the common chance of war  you have yet the happiness of   knowing your army in general has been victorious  and that  there are   infinitely a greater number of ours who  against their will  must see   England  than  there are of yours conducted into France       On their arrival  Horatio wrote an account to Dorilaus of all had   happened to him  not doubting but he would use his interest to have him   either mentioned when there should come an exchange of prisoners  or   that he would randsom him himself  but receiving no answer  he concluded   his letter  by some accident  had miscarried  and sent another  but that   meeting the same fate as the former  he wrote a third  accompanied with   one to his sister directed to the boarding school  where he imagined she   still was  to this last  after some time  he had the following return   from the governess       SIR        A letter directed for miss Louisa coming to   my house  I was in debate with myself   what to do with it  that young lady having been   gone from me last September  since which time   I have never heard any thing of her   at last I   sent it to Dorilaus s country seat by a messenger    who brought it to me again  with intelligence   that he was gone with some friends into the north   of Ireland  and that it was probable they had   taken miss with them   I then thought proper   to open it  believing she had no secrets I might   not be entrusted with  and finding it came from   you  could do no less than give you this information   to prevent your being under any surprize   for not receiving answers to your letters  I am   sorry to find by yours that you have had such ill   success in your first campaign  but would not   have you be cast down  since you need not doubt   but on the return of Dorilaus you will have remittances   for your ransom  or whatever else you   may have occasion for         I am   SIR     Your most humble and obedient Servant        A  TRAINWELL       This letter made him perfectly contented  he had no reason to question   the continuance of Dorilaus s goodness to him  nor that he should attend   this new proof of it any longer than the return of that gentleman to   England should make him know the occasion he now had for it  He   therefore had no anxious thoughts to interrupt the pleasures the place   he was in afforded in such variety  he was every evening with the baron    either at court  the opera  the comedy  or some other gay scene of   entertainment  was introduced to the best company  and his young heart    charm d with the politeness and gallantry of that nation  and the little   vanity to which a person of such early years is incident  being   flattered with the complaisance he was treated with  gave him in a short
