were rallied and reinforced by another old  experienced commander  who being well acquainted with the genius of his adversary  pitched upon an advantageous situation  where he waited for another attack  Brut an tiffi  flushed with his former victory  and firmly persuaded that no mortal power could withstand his prowess  gave him battle at a very great disadvantage  The consequence was natural —he lost great part of his army  was obliged to abandon the siege  and retreat with disgrace  A separate body  commanded by one of his ablest captains  met with the same fate in a neighbouring country  and a third detachment at the farthest extremity of his dominions  having attacked an army of the    148 Mantchoux  was repulsed with great loss   These were not all the mortifications to which he was exposed about this period  The Fatzman of Japan  who had formed an army for the defence of the farm of Yesso against the Chinese  met with a terrible disaster  Notwithstanding his being outnumbered by the enemy  he exhibited many proofs of uncommon activity and valour  At length they came to blows with him  and handled him so roughly  that he was fain to retreat from post to pillar  and leave the farm at their mercy  Had he pursued his route to the right  he might have found shelter in the dominions of Brut an tiffi  and this was his intention  but  instead of marching in a straight line  he revolved to the right  like a planet round the sun  impelled as it were by a compound impulse  until he had described a regular    149 semicircle  and then he found himself with all his followers engaged in a sheep pen  from whence there was no egress  for the enemy  who followed his steps  immediately blocked up the entrance  The unfortunate Fatzman being thus pounded  must have fallen a sacrifice to his centripetal force  had not he been delivered by the interposition of a neighbouring chief  who prevailed upon the Chinese general to let Quamba cun dono escape  provided his followers would lay down their arms  and return peaceably to their own habitations  This was a bitter pill  which the Fatzman was obliged to swallow  and is said to have cost him five stone of suet  He returned to Japan in obscurity  the Chinese general took possession of the farm in the name of his emperor  and all the damage which the tenants sustained  was nothing more than a    150 change of masters  which they had no great cause to regret   To the thinking part of the Japanese  nothing could be more agreeable than this event  by which they were at once delivered from a pernicious excrescence  which  like an ulcerated tumour  exhausted the juices of the body by which it was fed  Brut an tiffi considered the transaction in a different point of view  He foresaw that the Chinese forces would now be at liberty to join his enemies  the tribe of Ostrog  with whom the Chinese emperor was intimately connected  and that it would be next to impossible to withstand the joint efforts of the confederacy  which he had brought upon his own head  He therefore raised a hideous clamour  He accused the Fatzman of misconduct  and insisted  not without a mixture of menaces  upon the Dairo s reassembling    151 his forces in the country of Yesso   The Dairo himself was inconsolable  He neglected his food  and refused to confer with his ministers  He dismissed the Fatzman from his service  He locked himself in his cabinet  and spent the hours in lamentation     O my dear farm of Yesso   cried he  shall I never more enjoy thy charms —Shall I never more regale my eye with thy beauteous prospects  thy hills of heath  thy meads of broom  and thy wastes of sand  Shall I never more eat thy black bread  drink thy brown beer  and feast upon thy delicate porkers  Shall I never more receive the homage of the sallow Yessites with their meagre faces  ragged skirts  and wooden shoes  Shall I never more improve their huts  and regulate their pigstyes  O cruel Fate  in vain did I face thy mud walled mansion with    152 a new freestone front  In vain did I cultivate thy turnep garden  In vain did I enclose a piece of ground at a great expence  and raise a crop of barley  the first that ever was seen in Yesso  In vain did I send over a breed of mules and black cattle for the purposes of husbandry  In vain did I supply you with all the implements of agriculture  In vain did I sow grass and grain for food  and plant trees  and furze and fern for shelter to the game  which could not otherwise subsist upon your naked downs  In vain did I furnish your houseless sides  and fill your hungry bellies with the good things of Japan  In vain did I expend the treasures of my empire for thy melioration and defence  In vain did I incur the execrations of my people  if I must now lose thee for ever  if thou must now fall into the hands of an insolent alien  who has no affection    153 for thy soil  and no
