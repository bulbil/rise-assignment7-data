   Yet let me for the Honour of these Times observe —no  let us rather observe Sir Tasty and Junior —there they are  close together  the Baronet leaning his Elbow on a Dial  playing his Brilliant in the Sun beams  and Junior with folded Arms  resting himself against the Summer house   Sir Tasty    Look ye  Junior  among Friends  I m fond of her  she s quite the Thing — I ve seen something between you and her  but mum  You know my dear Friend I know the World  you have had her  I like her  and he who won t part from   117his Woman to his Friend  has not a Drop of social Virtue about him   Junior   What makes you  Sir Tasty  imagine such a Thing is practicable   Sir Tasty    Come  come  don t be queer  don t hum  neither did you ever know a Woman that wou dn t —that s all  Pon Honnor I ll disburse  here s a Bill for Fifty  bring her up to London —I know you re an honest Fellow  Hush  here s our Elders   Enter Lady Dowager    Mr  Junior  my Lady  has given me his Honour  he ll now and then kill an Hour this Winter with us in London   Lady   If Mr  Junior can find any thing there equal to his Merit —  Sir  Tasty    You ll excuse me my Lady —I believe we shall have more Time to say fine Things when we meet next —Will I see is ready — so Dr  Jack Adieu  as the Ghost says in Hamlet  Farewell  remember me   Junior began now to believe there was such a Thing as being in Luck  and that he was the identical Existence  that Fortune   118had fix d on for her Favourite  with the Landlady  Under Pretence of taking an Airing  he gallop d off  and after a few Days crossing the Country  to avoid Pursuit  they arriv d safe in London  of which in about a Week more he inform d Sir Tasty  not forgetting to enumerate the mighty Difficulties  and vast Expences  which attended the Undertaking   Sir Tasty  all in Rapture  flew to him  caress d him in the highest Manner  bid him command his Fortune  vow d an eternal Friendship to him  and introduced him as his most intimate  at Lady Dowager s     119  CHAP  XIV   IN the Beginning of these Memoirs  or Collection of Paragraphs  the Editor promised a History of the human Mind  but never declared whether it was to be a Male or Female one  If he intended to describe a Lady s Inclinations  he flattered himself—  For where is the scientific   that can lead us to unravel the whimsical Workings of a fine Woman s Fancy   Yet they themselves can account for the greatest seeming Inconsistencies of their own Sex s Behaviour  as easily as we form a cometary System  Nay  I heard several of their Opinions upon Mrs  Belcy  the Landlady s Case  who  tho  she went away with Mr  Junior  as we may suppose  for Love  yet  if she did grant Sir Tasty a Favour  or so  she was not so much to blame  as People might imagine her to be  This may  indeed  as the Lady said  seem odd to some strange Mortals  but they must be excessively ignorant  and shockingly absurd in their Ideas  to fansy a fine Woman could be constant  Besides  as Miss Juliet  the great Actress  observed    120Sir Tasty was a Man of Consequence  and perhaps rich as Peruvian Mines  and generous as Woman s warmest Wishes   Mr  Deputy s Lady presumed  that Junior might grow cold  neglect her  and not give Madam Belcy so much of his Time as he ought  and she did it to be even with him  For as Revenge is sweet  this must be a very sweet Revenge—or perhaps  Miss in her Teens  sighing  remarked  that Sir Tasty might take at first some unbecoming Advantage  and hinted something about a Masquerade  that terrible Auto de se to English Chastities   Harry Hatzell  an Intimate of the Editor s  hit off the true Reason at once — saying  the Landlady thought  that two Friends  like two Heads  would be better than one  that Emulation is Vigour s Whetstone  and a Lady who has only one Lover  is as ill served as a Town with but one Tavern in it   To this Opinion the Transcriber signs  for she wanted as many Friends as she could get  to secure her from her Husband s Resentment  who  presently after her Elopement  broke up Housekeeping  advertised her  and was on his Journey to London to search for her     121The Baronet  tho  very vain  had not yet talked of his Mistress either at the Star  King s Arms  or Shakespear  whether out of Regard to Mrs  Belcy  or Fear of her Husband  is undetermined  He had Subtlety enough to have
