Good and Bad  with Regard to the unbounded Mercy of God  In order to which  I shall make Use of an Allusion  by considering Man in this Life  like a Silk Worm in it s Nymph State  involved and incompassed round with Toils of their own weaving  the one waiting  till God s Blessing  as the other for a warm Sun  shall rescue him to a joyful Resurrection  Now some Insects carry the Seeds of Death with them into the Grave  and  consequently  perish immediately  without being able to revive to a new Life  Page  55 in which forlorn Situation I consider a wicked Man — and think I have some Authority from Scripture for this Hypothesis    The Wages of Sin are Death   And again   The Lord wisheth not the Death of a Sinner  but rather  that he may turn from his Wickedness  and live     Now  though the Inflicting of Punishments  as I have somewhere said  would  in some Sort  deprive Heaven of the full Enjoyment of it s own Perfection  yet such a literal Death  as I understand from these Texts  that is  the intire Deprivation of Sense or Being from a Sinner  is not only agreeable to Justice  but to Mercy too  for   they say  bad Men would be unbless d in Heaven   And as this Life is given us  in order to prepare our Souls for the Relish of that contemplative Bliss  which is hereafter to be permitted to the Spirits of good Men made perfect  it would be rather an Instance of Cruelty  than Mercy  to grant Immortality to those unhappy Wretches  in a State of Existence  which would not admit the Gratification of mortal Senses  or the Indulgence of human Passions     As I am drawing toward the Conclusion of Pliny s Works  I shall finish my Remarks upon him  and his Translator  in the Remander of this Letter   Page  56In a Note upon the forty sixth Epistle  optimo Viro is called an Idiom  but I cannot see for what Reason  And my Lord might very well have rendered it literally  the best of Men  without appearing the least stiff in the Stile of that Expression   Trajan s Speech  in the last Part of the Comment upon the fifty first Epistle  puts me in mind of a Humour of the Widow —  in this Country  who was some Time ago married  and the Morning after she appeared caparisoned with an Horse whip pinned to her Girdle  and told her Husband  she meant always to wear it about her  that it might be ready  whenever she deserved his Chastisement   In the sixty seventh Epistle  read since  for scarce   I have gone through the rest of this Book  which finishes the Volume  and find nothing more  fit to be remarked upon  that is not already taken Notice of by the Commentator  much better than I can pretend to do  and this  in general  is the Reason  why I have made so few Observations upon the whole Work  As to the Freedom I have taken  in some Criticisms  both with the Author  and his Commentator  I shall excuse myself with a Quotation out of the thirteenth Epistle of the third Book    If I find you so frank  as to make Objections to particular Passages  I shall take Page  57 it for granted  that you are pleased with all the rest   And so indeed I am     I think  the twentieth Epistle of the fourth Book would be proper to conclude these Remarks with  changing the Word Grief for Sense  and applying that Letter to Pliny and Orrery   And now let me assure you  my dear Fanny  that I feel a real Concern  upon the Close of this Work  at parting with three such Men  as Trajan  Pliny  and Orrery  But one I hope to know in this Life  and shall die in Trust of meeting the others in the next  and you  my best loved Girl  shall know them too    Together to the Realms of Bliss well go    Till then  let us live  and love  for  while we do one  I am sure we shall do the other     Adieu   my Heart s Delight   Henry   LETTER CXCVIII   My Dearest HARRY   I AM vastly provoked at your not receiving my Letters regularly  I am uneasy about my Saturday s Letter  though the Disappointment only could make it of any Consequence  As I have nothing extraordinary to say  at present  Page  58 with Regard to myself  and have not Time to answer your s  I should not write To night  but on Account of the inclosed  which  I am sure  will give you Pleasure  as my dear Lady — s Sentiments correspond with your s  I have wrote a very long Letter to her  and my Fingers ache to such a Degree  I can hardly hold the Pen  I hope  I have now returned the Compliment you paid me  by bringing her Letter to —   We will prescribe the
