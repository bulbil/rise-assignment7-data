a disorder peculiar to the country  which every season makes strange ravages among them  it spreads with pestilential rapidity  and infects almost every rank of people  what is still more strange the natives have no name for this peculiar malady  tho  well known to foreign physicians by the appellation of Epidemic terror   A season is never known to pass in which the people are not visited by this cruel calamity in one shape or another  seemingly different  tho  ever the same  one year it issues from a baker s shop in the shape of a sixpenny loaf  the next it takes the appearance of a comet with a fiery tail  a third it threatens like a flat bottomed boat  and a fourth it carries consternation at the bite of a mad dog  The people  when once infected  lose their relish for happiness  saunter about with looks of despondence  ask after the calamities of the day  and receive no comfort but in heightening each others distress  It is insignificant how remote or near  how weak or powerful the object of terror may be  when once they resolve to fright   17•nd be frighted  the meerest trifles sow consternation and dismay  each proportions his fears not •o the object  but to the dread he discovers in •he countenance of others  for when once the •ermentation is begun  it goes on of itself  tho  •he original cause be discontinued which first •et it in motion   A dread of mad dogs is the epidemic terror which now prevails  and the whole nation is at present actually groaning under the malignity of •ts influence  The people sally from their houses with that circumspection which is prudent in •uch as expect a mad dog at every turning  The •hysician publishes his prescription  the beadle •repares his halter  and a few of unusual bravery ••rm themselves with boots and buff gloves  in ••rder to face the enemy if he should offer to at•ack them  In short  the whole people stand •ravely upon their defence  and seem by their •resent spirit to shew a resolution of not being •amely bit by mad dogs any longer   Their manner of knowing whether a dog be •ad or no  somewhat resembles the ancient Eu•opean custom of trying witches  The old wo•an suspected was tied hand and foot and thrown ••to the water  If she swam  then she was instantly •arried off to be burnt for a witch  if she sunk  ••en indeed she was acquitted of the charge  but •rown d in the experiment  In the same manner • crowd gather round a dog suspected of mad•ess  and they begin by teizing the devoted animal •n every side  if he attempts to stand upon the •efensive and bite  then is he unanimously found •uilty  for a mad dog always snaps at every thing    18 if  on the contrary  he strives to escape by running away  then he can expect no compassion  for mad dogs always run straight forward before them   It is pleasant enough for a neutral being like me  who have no share in those ideal calamities  to mark the stages of this national disease  The terror at first feebly enters with a disregarded story of a little dog  that had gone through a neighbouring village  that was thought to be mad by several that had seen him  The next account comes  that a mastiff ran through a certain town  and had bit five geese  which immediately run mad  foamed at the bill  and died in great agonies soon after  Then comes an affecting history of a little boy bit in the leg  and gone down to be dipt in the salt water  when the people have sufficiently shuddered at that  they are next congealed with a frightful account of a man who was said lately to have died from a bite he had received some years before  This relation only prepares the way for another  still more hideous  as how the master of a family  with seven small children  were all bit by a mad lap dog  and how the poor father first perceived the infection by calling for a draught of water  where he saw the lap dog swimming in the cup   When epidemic terror is thus once excited  every morning comes loaded with some new disaster  as in stories of ghosts each loves to hear the account  though it only serves to make him uneasy  so here each listens with eagerness  and adds to the tidings with new circumstances of peculiar horror  A lady for instance  in the country  of very weak nerves has been frighted by the barking of a dog  and this  alas  too fre••ently   19 happens  The story soon is improved ••d spreads  that a mad dog had frighted a lady • distinction  These circumstances begin to grow ••rrible before they have reached the neighbour••g village  and there the report is  that a lady • quality was bit by a mad mastiff  This ac••unt every moment gathers new strength and ••ows more dismal as it approaches the capital  ••d by the time it has arrived in town the lady is ••scribed  with wild eyes  foaming mouth  run••ng mad upon all four  barking like a dog  bi•••g her servants  and at last smothered between ••o beds by the advice of her doctors
