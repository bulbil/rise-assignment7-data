never so think  over the   35 surface of the earth  it enriches the whole country  Thus the wealth a nation possesses must expatiate  or it is of no benefit to the public  it becomes rather a grievance  where matrimonial laws thus confine it to a few   But this restraint upon matrimonial community  even considered in a physical light  is injurious  As those who rear up animals take all possible pains to cross the strain in order to improve the breed  so in those countries  where marriage is most free  the inhabitants are found every age to improve in stature and in beauty  on the contrary  where it is confined to a cast  a tribe  or an b•rd  as among the Gaurs  the Jews  or the Tartars  each division soon assumes a family likeness  and every tribe degenerates into peculiar deformity  From hence it may be easily inferred  that if the mandarines here are resolved only to marry among each other  they will soon produce a posterity with mandarine faces  and we shall see the heir of some honourable family scarce equal to the abortion of a country farmer   These are a few of the obstacles to marriage here  and it is certain  they have in some measure answered the end  for celibacy is both frequent and fashionable  Old batchelors appear abroad without a mask  and old maids  my dear Fum Hoam  have been absolutely known to ogle  To confess in friendship  if I were an Englishman  I fancy I should be an old batchelor myself  I should never find courage to run through all the adventures prescribed by the law  I could submit to court my mistress herself upon reasonable terms  but to court her father  her mother  and   36 a long tribe of cousins  aunts and relations  and then stand the butt of a whole country church  I would as soon turn tail and make love to her grandmother   I can conceive no other reason for thus loading matrimony with so many prohibitions  unless it be that the country was thought already too populous  and this was found to be the most effectual means of thinning it  If this was the motive  I cannot but congratulate the wise projectors on the success of their scheme  Hail  O ye dim sighted politicians  ye weeders of men   Tis yours to clip the wing of industry  and convert Hymen to a broker   Tis yours to behold small objects with a microscopic eye  but to be blind to those which require an extent of vision   Tis yours  O ye discerners of mankind  to lay the line between society  and weaken that force by dividing  which should bind with united vigour   Tis yours  to introduce national real distress  in order to avoid the imaginary distresses of a few  Your actions can be justified by an hundred reasons like truth  they can be opposed by but a few reasons  and those reasons are true  Farewel   LETTER LXX  From Lien Chi Altangi to Hinpgo  by the way of Moscow   AGE that lessens the enjoyment of life encreases our desire of living  Those dangers  which  in the vigour of youth we had learned to despise  assume now terrors as we grew old  Our caution   37 encreasing as our years encrease  fear becomes at last the prevailing passion of the mind  and the small remainder of life is taken up in useless efforts to keep off our end  or provide for a continued existence   Strange contradiction in our nature  and to which even the wise are liable  If I should judge of that part of life which lies before me by that which I have already seen  the prospect is hideous  Experience tells me  that my past enjoyments have brought no real felicity  and sensation assures me  that those I have felt are stronger than those which are yet to come  Yet experience and sensation in vain persuade  hope  more powerful than either  dresses out the distant prospect in fancied beauty  some happiness in long perspective still beckons me to pursue  and  like a losing gamester  every new disappointment encreases my ardour to continue the game   Whence  my friend  this encreased love of life  which grows upon us with our years  whence comes it  that we thus make greater efforts to preserve our existence  at a period when it becomes scarce worth the keeping  Is it that nature  attentive to the preservation of mankind  encreases our wishes to live  while she lessens our enjoyments  and  as she robs the senses of every pleasure  equips imagination in the spoil  Life would be insupportable to an old man  who loaded with infirmities  feared death no more than when in the vigour of manhood  the numberless calamities of decaying nature  and the consciousness of surviving every pleasure  would at once induce him with his own hand to terminate the scene of misery  but happily the contempt of death forsakes   38 him at a time when it could only be prejudicial  and life acquires an imaginary value  in proportion as its real value is no more   Our attachment to every object around us encreases  in general  from the length of our acquaintance with
