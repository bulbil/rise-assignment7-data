 And be so good as to let me know—  Pray  Sir  ask me not a reason for a peculiarity  Do you not yourself shew a peculiarity in making me the twentieth   Your merit  madam—  It would be vanity in me  Sir  interrupted I  to allow a force to that plea  You  Sir  may have more merit  than perhaps the man I may happen to approve of better  but—shall I say   Pardon me  Sir  You do not—You do not  hesitated I—hit my fancy—Pardon me  Sir   If pardon depends upon my breath  let me die if I do —Not hit your fancy  madam   And then he look d upon himself all round  Not hit your fancy  madam   I told you  Sir  that you must not expect any thing from me but the simplest truth  You do me an honour in your good opinion  and if my own heart were not  in this case  a very determined one  I would answer you with more politeness  But  Sir  on such an occasion as this  I think it would not be honourable  it would not be just  to keep a man in an hour s suspense  when I am in none myself   And are you then  angrily  so determined  Miss Byron     115 I am  Sir   Confound me —And yet I am enough confounded —But I will not take an answer so contrary to my hopes  Tell me  madam  by the sincerity which you boast  are you not engaged in your affections  Is there not some one happy man  whom you prefer to all men   I am a free person  Sir Hargrave  It is no impeachment of sincerity  if a free person answers not every question that may be put to her  by those to whom she is not accountable   Very true  madam  But as it is no impeachment of your freedom to answer this question either negatively or affirmatively  and as you glory in your frankness  let me be beseech you to answer it  Are you  madam  or are you not  disengaged in your affections   Excuse me  Sir Hargrave  I don t think you are intitled to an answer to this question  Nor  perhaps  would you be determined by the answer I should make to it  whether negative or affirmative   Give me leave to say  madam  that I have some little knowledge of Mr  Fenwick and Mr  Greville  and of their addresses  They have both owned  that no hopes have you given them  yet declare that they will hope  Have you  madam  been as explicit to them  as you are to me   I have  Sir   Then they are not the men I have to fear—Mr  Orme  madam—  Is a good man  Sir   Ah  madam —But why then will you not say that you are engaged   If I own I am  perhaps it will not avail me  It will much less  if I say I am not   Avail you  dear Miss Byron  I have pride  madam  If I had not  I should not aspire to your favour  But give me leave to say  and he reddened with anger  that my fortune  my descent  and my ardent affection   116 for you  considered  it may not dis avail you  Your relations will at least think so  if I may have the honour of your consent for applying to them   May your fortune  Sir Hargrave  be a blessing to you  It will  as you do good with it  But were it twice as much  that alone would have no charms for me  My duties would be increased with my power  My fortune is an humble one  but were it less  it would satisfy my ambition while I am single  and if I marry  I shall not desire to live beyond the estate of the man I choose   Upon my soul  madam  you must be mine  Every word you speak  adds a rivet to my chains   Then  Sir  let us say no more upon this subject   He then laid a title to my gratitude from the passion he avowed for me   That is a very poor plea  Sir  said I  as you yourself would think  I believe  were one of our sex  whom you could not like  to claim a return of love from you upon it   You are too refined  surely  madam   Refined  what meant the man by the word in this place   I believe  Sir  we differ very widely in many of our sentiments   We will not differ in one  madam  when I know yours  such is the opinion I have of your prudence  that I will adopt them  and make them my own   This may be said  Sir  but there is hardly a man in the world that  saying it  would keep his word  Nor a woman  who ought to expect he should   But you will allow of
