 But then this Reason can never conclude for eternal Punishments  and his Faith must be blind  who could credit that Religion  which adhibited such a Revelation   So that the Doctrine of Punishments rests merely upon what Revelation is made about them  which  as I hinted before  does not denounce them eternal  at least the Misery   Nay I think farther  that  tho  Rewards may be agreeable to divine Justice  Punishments are not  If I remember right  I said something upon this Subject to you in a former Letter  by alluding to human Laws  so shall insist on it no farther here  But  to take away all Cavil from this Paradox  and to treat this Subject more equally  I shall deny that either Rewards or Punishments  tho  allowed in the moral Sense  are agreeable to divine Goodness or Justice  in the legislative Sense  and perhaps I may argue in concert with the Scripture too   The Pleasing or Displeasing of God are but figurative Expressions  which  taken in a literal Sense  have occasioned the Terms of Rewards and Punishments  for thus are divine Matters confounded and impured  by drawing Analogies between them and human Things  Now our good or bad Actions relate entirely to our own Page  330 Happiness or Misery  and would it not be partial to bestow a Reward  where there can possibly be no Merit  for  as the Scripture says    after all we shall be but unprofitable Servants   As it would be cruel to inflict a Punishment  where Ignorance  Passion  or Temptation may lead a Man into Vice  for  as the same Scripture says   where little is given  little shall be expected      I would not hazard this Subject  so unfinished  to any Hands but your s  as I am obliged to break off in a very dangerous Crisis  but the Night is far spent  and next Post shall be employed to extract the Poison   Adieu  thou sole Partner of my Heart  and only Confidante of all it s Sentiments   Henry   LETTER CCCXVII   I THINK then  with some sensible Divines  that Rewards and Punishments are not bestowed or inflicted upon our Actions  good or bad  but that Happiness or Misery is the preordained Consequence of Virtue or Vice  and that  as natural Virtue or Vice  as Temperance and Exercise  or Intemperance and Inactivity  produce Health or Disease in this World  so moral Virtue or Vice as essentially are attended with Happiness or Misery in the next   Page  331Now  if our Portions hereafter be general moral Consequences  and not particular justiciary Adaptions  I can perceive no Reason how the Soul of Man can be  at any Time  precluded from redeeming itself by a thorough Contrition  and sincere Repentance  or that a Halter or a Quinsey shall be sufficient to deprive it of Bliss  to all Eternity  For a Spirit  at any Period of it s Existence  reclaimed to a full and perfect Sense  Love  and Adoration of the Essence  Truth  Goodness  and Power of God  must necessarily attract to itself that Happiness  which is essentially allied to such a State of Mind   But some severe Divines may here object  that a departed Spirit can possibly have no Merit in Contrition or Repentance  when Temptation to Sin is no more  and when the consequential Misery is demonstratively ascertained  and severely experienced  To which  Part of my last Letter may be an Answer  where the Merit of Virtue is denied  and the Beginning of this Letter may be referred to  where Happiness is said to be the Consequence  not the Reward of Virtue  And  as we are taught to believe that higher Spirits than our s have been plunged into the Abyss for Sin  in the next World  why may we not hope that a poor human Soul may be capable of emerging from thence  by Righteousness hereafter  for surely Religion is not limited  either in Place or Time  to the narrow Bounds and Page  332 short Duration of this paltry Globe  but extends itself thro  the whole Universe of Intelligence  and shall continue to all Eternity   I look upon this Life to be a State of Trial  and the next to be a State of Purgation  from which  perhaps  the most perfect Man may not be exempt  For Vengeance is not of the Essence of God  but his Nature is so pure  that no Spirit may approach the Throne of his Grace  obscured by Stain or Blemish  and a State of thorough Purgation  that is  of sincere Repentance  without Temptation to Sin  is necessary to prepare us for the Bliss of Angels  So that I look upon the Devil s Empire to be of this World only  and not extended to the next  for here he may tempt  but there he cannot   I think  then  that a Soul purged from Sin  by any Method  is a proper Object of the Divine Favour    Whom the Lord loveth  he chasteneth   Can Chastisement then be deemed the Effect of Hatred  in the Lord   who hateth nothing  which he has made   And does
