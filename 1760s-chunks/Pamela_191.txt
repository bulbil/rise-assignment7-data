and   you have not spared me  Sir  said I  He interrupting me  said  Well  I   forgive you  You had too much reason for it  But I find  plainly enough    that if you had got away  you would soon have been Williams s wife  and   I can t see how it could well have been otherwise  Indeed  sir  said I    I had no notion of it  or of being any body s  I believe so  said he    but it must have come as a thing of course  and I see your father was   for it  Sir  said he  I little thought of the honour your goodness would   confer upon her  and I thought that would be a match above what we   could do for her  a great deal  But when I found she was not for it  I   resolved not to urge her  but leave all to her own prudence       I see  said he  all was sincere  honest  and open  and I speak of it  if   it had been done  as a thing that could hardly well be avoided  and I   am quite satisfied  But  said he  I must observe  as I have a hundred   times  with admiration  what a prodigious memory  and easy and happy   manner of narration  this excellent girl has  And though she is full   of her pretty tricks and artifices  to escape the snares I had laid   for her  yet all is innocent  lovely  and uniformly beautiful  You are   exceedingly happy in a daughter  and I hope I shall be so in a wife  Or    said my father  may she not have that honour  I fear it not  said he    and I hope I shall deserve it of her       But  Pamela  said my master  I am sorry to find in some parts of your   journal  that Mrs  Jewkes carried her orders a little too far  and I   the more take notice of it  because you have not complained to me of   her behaviour  as she might have expected for some parts of it  though a   good deal was occasioned by my strict orders   But she had the insolence   to strike my girl  I find  Sir  said I  I was a little provoking  I   believe  but as we forgave one another  I was the less entitled to   complain of her       Well  said he  you are very good  but if you have any particular   resentment  I will indulge it so far  as that she shall hereafter have   nothing to do where you are  Sir  said I  you are so kind  that I ought   to forgive every body  and when I see that my happiness is brought about   by the very means that I thought then my greatest grievance  I ought to   bless those means  and forgive all that was disagreeable to me at the   same time  for the great good that hath issued from it   That  said he    and kissed me  is sweetly considered  and it shall be my part to make   you amends for what you have suffered  that you may still think lighter   of the one  and have cause to rejoice in the other       My dear father s heart was full  and he said  with his hands folded  and   lifted up  Pray  sir  let me go  let me go  to my dear wife  and tell   her all these blessed things  while my heart holds  for it is ready to   burst with joy  Good man  said my master  I hope to hear this honest   heart of yours speaking at your lips  I enjoin you  Pamela  to continue   your relation  as you have opportunity  and though your father be here    write to your mother  that this wondrous story be perfect  and we  your   friends  may read and admire you more and more  Ay  pray  pray do  my   child  said my father  and this is the reason that I write on  my dear   mother  when I thought not to do it  because my father could tell you   all that passed while he was here       My master took notice of my psalm  and was pleased to commend it  and   said  That I had very charitably turned the last verses  which  in the   original  were full of heavy curses  to a wish that shewed I was not of   an implacable disposition though my then usage might have excused it  if   I had  But  said he  I think you shall sing it to me
