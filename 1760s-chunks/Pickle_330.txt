declaring  themselves for one or other of the combatants  whom they encouraged by  their looks  gestures  and applause  according to the circumstances of  the dispute   This honourable consistory was held in the best room of an ale house   which afforded wine  punch  or beer  suitable to the purse or  inclination of every individual  who separately paid for his own choice   and here was our hero introduced in the midst of twenty strangers  who   by their looks and equipage  formed a very picturesque variety  He was  received with a most gracious solemnity  and placed upon the right  hand of the president  who  having commanded silence  recited aloud  his introductory ode  which met with universal approbation  Then was  tendered to him the customary oath  obliging him to consult the honour  and advantage of the society as far as it should he in his power  in  every station of life  and this being taken  his temples were bound with  a wreath of laurel  which was kept sacred for such inauguration   When these rites were performed with all due ceremony  the new member  cast his eyes around the place  and took a more accurate survey of his  brethren  among whom he observed a strange collection of periwigs  with  regard to the colour  fashions  and dimensions  which were such as  he had never seen before  Those who sat on each side  nearest the  president  were generally distinguished by venerable ties  the foretops  of which exhibited a surprising diversity  some of them rose slanting  backwards  like the glacis of a fortification  some were elevated in  two distinct eminences  like the hills Helicon and Parnassus  and others  were curled and reflected  as the horns of Jupiter Ammon  Next to these   the majors took place  many of which were mere succedanea  made by the  application of an occasional rose to the tail of a lank bob  and in the  lower form appeared masses of hair  which would admit of no description   Their clothes were tolerably well suited to the furniture of their  heads  the apparel of the upper bench being decent and clean  while that  of the second class was threadbare and soiled  and at the lower end  of the room  he perceived divers efforts made to conceal their  rent breeches and dirty linen  nay  he could distinguish by their  countenances the different kinds of poetry in which they exercised the  muse  He saw Tragedy conspicuous in a grave solemnity of regard  Satire  louring in a frown of envy and discontent  Elegy whining in a funeral  aspect  Pastoral dozing in a most insipid languor of face  Ode writing  delineated in a distracted stare  and Epigram squinting with a pert  sneer  Perhaps our hero refined too much in his penetration  when he  affirmed  that  over and above these discoveries  he could plainly  perceive the state of every one s finances  and would have undertaken  to have guessed each particular sum without varying three farthings from  the truth  The conversation  instead of becoming general  began to fall    6 22 15  3 45 PM   into parties  and the epic poet had actually attracted the attention of  a private committee  when the chairman interposed  calling aloud   No  cabals  no conspiracies  gentlemen   His rival  thinking it incumbent  upon him to make some reply to this rebuke  answered   We have no  secrets  he that hath ears  let him hear   This was spoke as an  intimation to the company  whose looks were instantly whetted with the  expectation of their ordinary meal  but the president seemed to decline  the contest  for  without putting on his fighting face  he calmly  replied  that he had seen Mr  Metaphor tip the wink  and whisper to  one of his confederates  and thence judged  that there was something  mysterious on the carpet   The epic poet  believing his antagonist crest fallen  resolved to take  the advantage of his dejection  that he might enhance his own character  in the opinion of the stranger  and  with that view  asked  with an air  of exultation  if a man might not be allowed to have a convulsion in his  eye  without being suspected of a conspiracy  The president  perceiving  his drift  and piqued at his presumption   To be sure   said he   a  man of a weak head may be very well supposed to have convulsions in his  eyes   This repartee produced a laugh of triumph among the chairman s  adherents  one of whom observed  that his rival had got a smart rap on  the pate   Yes   replied the bard   in that respect Mr  Chairman has the  advantage of me  Had my head been fortified with a horn work  I should  not have been so sensible of the stroke   This retort  which carried a  severe allusion to the president s wife  lighted up the countenances of  the aggressor s
