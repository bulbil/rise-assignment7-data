s debts  I consider the affair just in the same light as you do  said Don Caesar  and Santillane s visit to court will doubtless prove the occasion of his arriving at the very first employments   In good truth  my noble friends  exclaimed I  you do not consider what you are talking about  It should seem  were one to give ear to the soothing words of you both  as if I had nothing to do but to shew my face at Madrid  and receive the key of office  or some foreign government for my pains  but you are egregiously mistaken  I am  on the contrary  well persuaded that the king would pass me over as a stranger  were I to throw myself in his way  I will make the experiment if you wish it  merely for the sake of undeceiving you  The lords of Leyva took me at my word  so that I could not help promising them to set out without loss of time for Madrid  No sooner did my secretary perceive my mind fully made up to the prosecution of this journey  than his ecstasies were wound up to the highest pitch  he was satisfied within himself that if I did but present my excellent person before the new monarch  he would immediately single me out from the crowd of political candidates  and weigh me down under a load of dignities and emoluments  On the strength of these conjectures  puffing himself out and amusing his fancy with the most splendid extravagances of device  he raised me up to the first offices of the state  and pushed forward his own preferment in the path of my exaltation   I therefore made my arrangements for returning to court  without the most distant intention of again sacrificing at the shrine of fortune  but merely to convince Don Caesar and his son of their error  in imagining that I was at all likely to ingratiate myself with the sovereign  It is true that there was some little lurking vanity at the bottom of all my philosophy  sprouting up in the shape of a desire to ascertain whether my royal master would throw away a thought on me  now in the spring time of his new and blushing honours  Led out of that course solely by that tempter  curiosity  without a dream of hope  or any practical contrivance for tuning the new reign to my own individual advantage  I set out for Madrid with Scipio  consigning the management of my household to Beatrice  who was well skilled in all the arts of domestic economy       CH  II     Gil Blas arrives in Madrid  and makes his appearance at court  the king is blessed with a better memory than most of his courtiers  and recommends him to the notice of his prime minister  Consequences of that recommendation   WE got to Madrid in less than eight days  Don Alphonso having given us two of his best horses  that we might lose no time on the road  We alighted at a ready furnished lodging  where I had lived formerly  kept by Vincent Ferrero  my old landlord  who was uncommonly glad to see me again   As this man prided himself on being in the secret of whatever was going forward either in court or city  I asked him after the best news  There is plenty of it  whether best or worst  answered he  Since the death of Philip the Third  the friends and partisans of the Cardinal Duke of Lerma have been moving heaven and earth to support his Eminence on the pinnacle of ministerial authority  but their efforts have been ineffectual  the Count of Olivarez has carried the day  in spite of all their industry  It is alleged that Spain will be no loser by the exchange  and that the present premier is possessed of a genius so extensive  a mind so capacious  that he would be competent to wield the machine of universal government  New brooms  they say  sweep clean  But  at all events  you may take this for certain  that the public is fully impressed with a very favourable opinion of his capacity  we shall see by and by whether the Duke of Lerma s situation is well or ill filled up  Ferrero  having got his tongue into the right train for wagging  gave me all the particulars of all the changes which had taken place at court since the Count of Olivarez had taken his seat at the helm of the state vessel   Two days after my arrival at Madrid  I repaired to the royal palace after my dinner  and threw myself in the king s way as he was crossing the lobby to his closet  but his notice was not at all attracted by my appearance  Next day  I returned to the same place  but with no better success  On the third day he looked me full in the face as he passed by  but the stare was perfectly vacant  as far as my interest or my vanity was concerned  This being the case  I resolved in my own mind what was proper to be done  You see  said I to Scipio  who accompanied me  that the king is grown out of my recollection  or if his memory is not become more frail with the elevation of his circumstances  he
