left to her by a godmother   Halden being very desirous to see his future Lady  I shall  at his request  send the Letter I have written to Lady Mansfield by him early in the morning  with a line recommending him to the notice of that Lady as Lord W s principal steward  Adieu  my dear Dr  Bartlett  I have joy in the joy of all these good people  If Providence graciously makes me instrumental to it  I look upon myself but as its instrument  I hope ostentation has no share in what draws on me more thanks and praises than I love to hear   Lord W  has a right to be made happy by his next relation  if his next relation can make him so  Is he not my mother s brother  Would not her enlarged soul have rejoiced on the occasion  and blessed her son for an instance of duty to her  paid by his disinterested   40 regard for her brother  Who  my dear Dr  Bartlett  is so happy  yet who  in some cases  so unhappy  as  Your CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER V  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY   Monday  April 3   THE Countess of D  and the Earl her son have but just left us  The Countess sent last night  to let my cousin Reeves know of their intended morning visit  and they came together  As the visit was made to my cousin  I did not think myself obliged to be in waiting for them below  I was therefore in my closet  comforting myself with my own agreeable reflexions  They were there a quarter of an hour before I was sent to   Their talk was of me  I am used to recite my own praises  you know  and what signifies making a parade of apologies for continuing the use  I don t value myself so much as I once did on people s favourable opinions  If I had a heart in my own keeping  I should be glad it was thought a good one  that s all  Yet tho  it has littlenesses in it  that I knew nothing of formerly  I hope it is not a bad one   My Lord D  by the whole turn of the partial conversation  was led to expect a very extraordinary young woman  The Lady declared  that she would have her talk out  and hear all my two cousins were inclined to say of me  before I was sent up to  as I was not below when they came   I was therefore to be seen only as a subject of curiosity  My Lord had declared  it seems  that he would not be denied an introduction to me by his mother  But there were no thoughts of making any application to a girl whose heart was acknowleged   41 not to be her own  My Lord s honour would not allow of such an intention  Nor ought it   His impatience  however  hastened the message to me  The Countess met me half way  and embraced me  My lovely girl  how do you —My Lord  said she  turning to the Earl  I need not say  This is Miss Byron   He bowed low  and made me a very high compliment  but it had sense in it  tho  high  and above my merits  Girls  writing of themselves on these occasions  must be disclaimers  you know  But  my dear uncle  what care I now for compliments  The man  from whose mouth only they could be acceptable  is not at liberty to make me any   The Countess engaged me in an easy general conversat on  part of which turned upon Lord and Lady L  Miss Grandison  and Miss Jervois  and how I had passed my time at Colnebrooke  in this wintry season  when there were so many diversions in town  But  said she  you had a man with you  who is the admiration of every man and woman  where ever he goes   Is there no making an acquaintance  said my Lord  with Sir Charles Grandison  What I hear said of him  every time he is mentioned in company  is enough to fire a young man with emulation  I should be happy did I deserve to be thought of as a second or third man to Sir Charles Grandison   I dare say  returned I  your Lordship s acquaintance would be highly acceptable to him  He is easy of access  Men of rank  if men of merit  must be of kindred  and recognize one another the moment they meet  But Sir Charles will soon leave England   The fool sighed  It was  you may believe  involuntarily  I felt myself blush  and was the more silly for that   The Countess took my hand—One word with you  my dear—and led me out into the next room  and sitting down  made me sit on the same settee with her     42 O that I could call you daughter  began she at once  and turning half round to me  put one arm about me  with her other hand taking one of mine  and earnestly looking in my downcast face
