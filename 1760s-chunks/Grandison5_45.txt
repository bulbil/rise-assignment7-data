take advice in a malady that nothing but time and patience can cure   A charming correspondence is carried on between Harriet and the Countess of D  Harriet is all frankness Page  112 in it  so is Lady D  One day I hope to procure you a sight of their Letters  I am allowed to inclose a copy of the Countess s last  You will see the force of the reasoning  on Harriet s declaration  that she will never think of a second Lover  Her grandmother is entirely with the Countess  So am I—Tho  the first was Sir Charles Grandison   What will become of Lady Olivia  if the alliance between my brother and the Bologna family take effect —She has her emissaries  who I suppose will soon apprise her of it  How will she flame out  I suppose you  who correspond with her  will soon be troubled with her invectives on this subject   All here wish for you and Lord L  For my part  I long to see you both  and to be seen by you  You never could see me more to my advantage than now  We have nothing between us  But—   What your Lordship pleases     My dearest life  you have no choice     You prevent me  my Lord  in all my wishes      I have told him  in Love  of some of his foibles  And he thanks me for my instruction  and is resolved to be all I wish him to be   I have made discoveries in his favour—More wit  more humour  more good sense  more learning  than I had ever till now  that I was willing to enquire after those qualities in him  imagined he had  He allows me to have a vast share of good understanding  and so he ought  when I have made such discoveries to his advantage   In short we so monstrously improve upon each other  that if we go on thus  we shall hardly know ourselves to be the same man and woman  that made such aukward figures in the eyes of all beholders a few months ago at St  George s church  and must be married over again  to be sure of each other  for you must believe  that we would not be the same odd souls we then were  on any account   Page  113 What raises him with me  is the good opinion every body here has of him  They also have found him out to be a man of sense  a good natur d man  nay  would you believe it  a handsome man  and all these people having deservedly the reputation of good sense  penetration  and so forth  I cannot contradict them with credit to myself  When we married folks have made a silly choice  we should in policy  you know  for the credit of our judgment  try to make the best of it  I could name you half a score people who are continually praising  the man his wife  the woman her husband  who  were they at liberty to choose again  would be hanged before they would renew their bargain   Let me tell you  that Emily will make an excellent wife  and mistress of a family  Miss Byron is one of the best oeconomists  and yet one of the finest Ladies  in the county  As soon as she came down  she resumed the family direction  in ease of her aunt  which was her province before she came to London  I thought myself a tolerable manager  But she has for ever stopt my mouth on this subject  Such a succession of orderliness  if I may so call it  One right thing is an introduction to another  and all is in such a method  that it seems impossible for the meanest servants to mistake their duty  Such harmony  such observance  yet such pleasure in every countenance —But she is mistress of so much ease  so much dignity  and so much condescension  that she is worshiped by all the servants  and it is observable  hardly ever was heard to direct twice the same thing to be done  or remembred   The servants have generally time for themselves  an hour or two in a day  Her orders are given over night  and as the family live in a genteel manner  they are never surprised  or put out of course  by company  The poor only have the less of the remnants  if visiters or guests come in unexpectedly  and in Page  114 such case  she says  they shall fare better another day  Emily is taking minutes of all her management  She is resolved to imitate her in every thing  Hence it is  that I say  the girl will make one of the best wives in England  Yet  how the dear Harriet manages it  I cannot tell  for we hardly ever miss her  But early hours  and method  and ease  without hurry  will do every thing   POSTSCRIPT   LORD bless me  my dear Lady L   I have been frightened out of my wits  This Lord G —What do we do by marriage  but double our cares —He was taken very ill two
