drum  into the territories of China  where he found an asylum  from whence he made divers ineffectual appeals to the multitudinous beast at Niphon   As for Yak strot  he was every thing but a down right martyr to   158 the odium of the public  which produced a ferment all over the nation  His name was become a term of reproach  He was burnt or crucified in effigy in every city  town  village  and district of Niphon  Even his own countrymen  the Ximians  held him in abhorrence and execration  Notwithstanding his partiality to the natale solum  he had not been able to provide for all those adventurers who came from thence in consequence of his promotion  The whole number of the disappointed became his enemies of course  and the rest finding themselves exposed to the animosity and ill offices of their fellow subjects of Niphon  who hated the whole community for his sake  inveighed against Yak strot as the curse of their nation   In the midst of all this detestation and disgrace  it must be owned for   159 the sake of truth  that Yak strot was one of the honestest men in Japan  and certainly the greatest benefactor to the empire  Just  upright  sincere  and charitable  his heart was susceptible of friendship and tenderness  He was a virtuous husband  a fond father  a kind master  and a zealous friend  In his public capacity he had nothing in view but the advantage of Japan  in the prosecution of which he flattered himself he should be able to display all the abilities of a profound statesman  and all the virtues of the most sublime patriotism  It was here he over rated his own importance  His virtue became the dupe of his vanity  Nature had denied him shining talents  as well as that easiness of deportment  that affability  liberal turn  and versatile genius  without which no man can ever figure at the head of an administration    160 Nothing could be more absurd than his being charged with want of parts and understanding to guide the helm of government  considering how happily it had been conducted for many years by Fika kaka  whose natural genius would have been found unequal even to the art and mystery of wool combing  Besides  the war had prospered in his hands as much as it ever did under the auspices of his predecessor  though  as I have before observed  neither the one nor the other could justly claim any merit from its success   But Yak strot s services to the public  were much more important in another respect  He had the resolution to dissolve the shameful and pernicious engagements which the empire had contracted on the continent of Tartary  He lightened the intolerable burthens of the empire    161 he saved its credit when it was stretched even to bursting  He made a peace  which  if not the most glorious that might have been obtained  was  at least  the most solid and advantageous that ever Japan had concluded with any power whatsoever  and  in particular  much more honourable  useful  and ascertained  than that which Taycho had agreed to subscribe the preceding year  and  by this peace  he put an end to all the horrors of a cruel war  which had ravaged the best parts of Asia  and destroyed the lives of six hundred thousand men every year  On the whole  Yak strot s good qualities were respectable  There was very little vicious in his composition  and as to his follies  they were rather the subjects of ridicule than of resentment     162 Yak strot s subalterns in the ministry  rejoiced in secret at his running so far into the north of Legion s displeasure  Nay  it was shrewdly suspected that some of their emissaries had been very active against him in the day of his discomfiture  They flattered themselves  that if he could be effectually driven from the presence of the Dairo  they would succeed to his influence  and in the mean time would acquire popularity by turning tail to  and kicking at  the Ximian favourite  who had associated them in the administration in consequence of their vowing eternal attachment to his interest  and constant submission to his will  Having held a secret conclave to concert their operations  they began to execute their plan  by seducing Yak strot into certain odious measures of raising new impositions on the people  which did not fail  indeed  to   163 increase the clamour of the blatant Beast  and promote its filthy discharge upwards and downwards  but then the torrents were divided  and many a tail was lifted up against the real projectors of the scheme which the favourite had adopted  They now resolved to make a merit with the Mobile  by picking a german quarrel with Strot  and insulting him in public  Gotto mio caused a scrubbing post to be set up in the night  at the Cuboy s door —The scribe Zan ti fic presented him with a scheme for the importation of brimstone into the island of Ximo  the other scribe pretended he could not spell the barbarous names of the Cuboy s relations and countrymen  who were daily thrust into the most lucrative employments  As for Twitz er the Financier  he never approached Yak strot without clawing his knuckles in derision  At
