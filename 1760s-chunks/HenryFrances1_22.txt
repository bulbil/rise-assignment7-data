sufficiently prove  or declare  the original Excellence of our Natures  for Reason  or Philosophy  may perfect Virtue  but cannot create it  tho  a narrow and illiberal Education may so depress and obscure great Qualities  as to give that paltry Tenour to our Characters  which you so unfairly reproach us with —which brings me to the second Part of my Proposition  and which  according to your Example  I shall make the Subject of a second Letter —so a Truce   till next Post  but no Peace   till you are fairly conquered   Farewel   F     62  LETTER XL   IN antient Times  when Mankind began to frame themselves into Societies and States  the male Part  perceiving they were born with greater bodily Strength  than the Female  vainly concluded  they were originally indued with greater Sense and nobler Souls  so  partially arrogated to themselves the Superiority  at the same Time  that they refused  very unfairly  the same Law of Reason  to an Horse  though they acknowledge him to be an Animal of greater Strength  than they   Now  in order to preserve this unjust Dominion to themselves  and their Heirs Male for ever  they concluded no Salique Law so effectual  as to fetter and inslave our Minds  by such a narrow  domestick  and partial Education  as should bury the Seeds of Sense and Philosophy  and byass our Opinions towards a Notion of their superior   manly Sense and Reason    Thus un educated  and un improved  or  what is worse  condemned to a wrong Education  it is as unfair to censure us for the Weakness of our Understandings  as it would be to blame the Chinese Women for little Feet  for neither is owing to the Imperfection of Nature  but to the Cruelty of Custom   When Women then associate themselves with Men of moderate Understandings  for I   63 think you too humble  when you brand those with the Title of Fools  who fall short of your own Sense  it is only because it is natural and reasonable to prefer that Degree of Sense  which they comprehend  to that which is beyond their Apprehension  and this is nothing more than you would do yourself  for I do not know  what Pleasure you could have  in Company with a Rabbi  merely for his understanding Hebrew  of which you hardly know the Type   I believe that Women  caeteris paribus  as Tom says  always prefer Men of the best Sense  as far as the Limits of their own Understanding extend  beyond which  it would be Enthusiasm  not rational Affection  to carry their Regards  I confess indeed that there must be an intire Equality between the Rivals  with regard to Fortune  Titles  Dress  Person   c —before the Superiority of Understanding can have the Chance of being considered  But then this is owing to the false Byass of female Education  which directs us to wrong Means of Happiness  and  instead of being censured for our Error  we ought to be pitied for not being rendered capable of judging right   Henceforward therefore  I interdict you  wise Fools  from the Unjustness of any Satyr against our Sex   till you have  by a proper and more liberal Education  given our noble and ingenuous Natures fair Play to exert themselves    64 Do this  if ye dare  ye imperious Tyrants  and ye shall see  how small we will make you  Oh  let us once be free  for know that Arts and Sciences cannot raise their Heads under despotick Sway   I shall mention but one Thing more  which appears to me a very natural Thought  that Providence certainly intended Women  rather than Men  for the Study and Contemplation of Philosophy and scientifick Knowledge  as the Delicacy of our Frame seems fitter for Speculation  than Action  and our Home province affords us greater Leisure  than Men  who  from their robust and active Natures  seem calculated more for Business  Labour  and mechanick Arts  Out then  ye vile Usurpers of our natural Rights and Liberties  and oh  for an Army of Amazons to vindicate our Wrongs   F   LETTER XLI  HENRY to FRANCES   Penthesilea furens  mediis que  in millibus ardet—  Bellatrix  audet que  viris concurrere Virgo   There is more Latin for Tom   I AM charmed at the Sense and Spirit of your Letters  and find it easy to recant from an Error  which was never seriously my Opinion    65 and you may forgive the Spleen of a provoked Lover  who  as is generally the Way  abuses the whole Sex  to shew his Resentment to one  But I cannot help observing  how generously  and like a Knight Errant  you have behaved  to fly to the Succour of a weak Combatant  by whose Fall you could no Way be affected   Since Satyrizing those  is  Praising you   To this you could not be induced  by any State Policy  to enter into an Alliance for your own Defence  but  like the English  bravely ingage in the War  to preserve the Ballance of Power  and
