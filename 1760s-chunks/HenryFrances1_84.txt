one Blemish to cover  but because you can afford to hide many Beauties   I left — this Morning  not that I had finished my Business there  but because I had read out the only Book I had with me  and was then exposed to the Mercy of the Winds and Rains  which have been very severe there this Week     292The only Fault  I find in Montaigne  is the Profusion of Quotations  he intersperses thro  all his Works  It is necessary sometimes to illustrate our Reasonings by Examples  but these should be drawn from our own Observations  rather than the Sentiments of others  When we treat of Death  Immortality   c  why need we produce the Opinions of Plato  or Seneca  upon these Subjects  We dare not depend on our own Strength  but lean upon others  and often support weak Judgments by the Force of Authority  This is one of the Reasons we make such slow Progress  of late  in Science  or Philosophy  for we follow one another in such beaten Tracks  that our View cannot be extended farther than to the Person  who goes before us  and are afraid of turning to the Right  or Left  lest we should lose our Way  I am so disatisfied with Quotations  that I run into the contrary Extreme  and endeavour to avoid them  as much as others do to bring them in  insomuch  that I often shun the very Thoughts  which naturally occur to me in writing  or speaking  if I recollect they have been made use of  upon the same Occasion before  This is  perhaps  an Affection greater than the other  and may fall under the Censure objected to Writings of this Kind  that those  who will not condescend to say any Thing  which has been said before them  will  probably  never say any Thing  which will be quoted after them  But this last   293 Nicety  perhaps  I owe to my Correspondence with you  lest I should be suspected of Plagiarism  as you have read every Thing  which I am capable of Understanding  yet I have a more humble Reason for avoiding Quotations  that I don t care to give People an Opportunity of making Comparisons to my Disadvantage   There is a Passage in Montaigne  which I am particularly flattered with  because it puts me in Mind of a bold Expression and Sentiment of mine  in a former Letter to you    that I had so compleat a Possession of you  that I enjoyed your very Absence   or Words to that Purpose  Speaking of a Friend  he loved  he says   A Correspondence destroys Absence  as it gives us a Liberty of conversing together  We better filled  and extended the Possession of Life  in being parted  He lived  rejoiced  and saw for me  and I for him  as plainly as if he had himself been there  One Part remained idle  and we confounded one another  when we were together  Distance of Place rendered the Conjunction of our Wills more rich  The insatiable Desire of personal Presence somewhat implies Weakness in the Fruition of Souls   Nothing can he more finely imagined  or better expressed  than this whole Passage  after which  I will not venture to add any Thing of my own  but conclude in his Words   While natural Conveniencies fail    294 let us supply the Defect with those that are artificial     Farewel   my Love  my Friend   Henry   LETTER CXLIX   My dear FANNY   I AM jealous of you  from your last Letter  You say H  G  and J  S  make such a Noise in the Room  that you cannot attend to what you are writing  I don t care that you should divide yourself between your common Acquaintance  and me  and am such a Churl  that I have no Enjoyment either of your Conversation  or Correspondence  but when I have them entirely to myself   Adam relating  she sole Auditress   When I write to you  my whole Soul is yours  I am not however so selfish  or rather  I am so selfish  as to be willing to communicate your charming Converse to those few  who have a just Relish for your Wit and Sense  for this is but enlarging my own Capacity  and increasing my Comprehension  which is too narrow  to enjoy the Fullness of the Feast   If I appear to have a better Philosophy  or more refined Sense than formerly  it is but to accommodate myself to your Sentiments and Taste  which  by the Continuance of your Favour  may perhaps strengthen Habit into Nature  However  in general  I endeavour to   295 appear to you  what I really in myself am  because I cannot be otherwise assured either of your Love  or Esteem  I am certain that  by shewing myself in this Light  I may lessen both  But then I secure those Portions of each  which I may honestly  or prudently claim  All farther Regard is but paid to something foreign from me  and I should be jealous of your Attachments even to an imaginary
