 as the whole course of this history has shewn    had been always fond of them to an excess  and whose humour  in this   point  was very little altered by the change of her condition  readily   embraced the first proposal he made of returning to town  believing she   should now have courage enough to appear in publick  without testifying   any of that shamefacedness on account of her marriage  which she knew   would subject her to the ridicule of those of her acquaintance who had a   greater share of assurance       For a time  this new married pair seemed to have no other thing in view   than pleasure  Mr  Munden had a numerous acquaintance  his wife not a   few  Giving and receiving entertainments  as yet  engrossed their whole   attention  each smiling hour brought with it some fresh matter for   satisfaction  and all was chearful  gay  and jocund       But this was a golden dream  which could not be expected to be of any   long continuance  The gaudy scene vanished at once  and soon a darkening   gloom overspread the late enchanting prospects  Mr  Munden s fortune   could not support these constant expences  He was obliged to retrench   somewhere  and  not being of a humour to deny himself any of those   amusements he was accustomed to abroad  he became excessively   parsimonious at home  insomuch that the scanty allowance she received   from him for housekeeping  would scarcely furnish out a table fit for a   gentleman of an estate far inferior to that he was in possession of  to   sit down to himself  much less to ask any friend who should casually   come in to visit him  to partake of       Nothing can be more galling to a woman of any spirit  than to see   herself at the head of a family without sufficient means to support her   character as such in a handsome manner  The fair subject of this history   had too much generosity  and  indeed  too much pride  in her   composition  to endure that there should be any want in so necessary an   article of life  and  as often as she found occasion  would have   recourse for a supply to her own little purse       But this was a way of going on which could not last long  She complained   of it to Mr  Munden  but  though the remonstrances she made him were   couched in the most gentle terms that could be  he could not forbear   testifying a good deal of displeasure on hearing them  He told her that   he feared she was a bad oeconomist  and that  as she was a wife  she   ought to understand that it was one of the main duties of her place to   be frugal of her husband s money  and be content with such things as   were suitable to his circumstances       The surly look with which these words were accompanied  as well as the   words themselves  made her easily perceive  that all the mighty passion   he had pretended to have had for her  while in the days of courtship    was too weak to enable him to bear the least contradiction from her now   he became a husband       She restrained  however  that resentment which so unexpected a discovery   of his temper had inspired her with  from breaking into any violent   expressions  and only mildly answered  that she should always be far   from desiring any which would be of real prejudice to his circumstances    but added  that she was too well acquainted with his fortune  not to be   well assured it would admit of keeping a table much more agreeable to   the rank he held in life  and the figure he made in other things        I am the best judge of that   replied he  a little disdainfully   and   also  that it is owing to your own want of management that my table is   so ill supplied  I would wish you  therefore  to contrive better for the   future  as you may depend upon it that  unless my affairs take a better   turn  I shall not be persuaded to make any addition to my domestick   expences         I could wish then  Sir   cried she  with a little more warmth   that   henceforth you would be your own purveyor  for I confess myself utterly   unable to maintain a family like ours on the niggard stipend you have   allotted for that purpose         No  really  Madam   answered he  very churlishly   I did not marry in   order to make myself acquainted with how the markets go  and become   learned
