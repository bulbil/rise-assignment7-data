yet I live  I survive it all  you can t conceive what comfort I find under afflictions from philosophy  There is Seneca  and Bolingbroke  and some others  who guide me through life  and teach me to support its calamities —I could not but smile at a woman who makes her own misfortunes  and then deplores the miseries of her situation  Wherefore  tired of acting with dissimulation  and willing to indulge my meditations in solitude  I took leave just as the servant was bringing in a plate of beef  pursuant to the directions of his mistress  Adieu   LETTER XV  From the same   THE better sort here pretend to the utmost compassion for animals of every kind  to hear them speak  a stranger would be apt to imagine they could hardly hurt the gnat that stung  em  they seem so tender  and so full of pity  that one would take them for the harmless friends of the whole creation  the protectors of the meanest insect or reptile that was privileged with existence  And yet would you believe it  I have seen the very men who have thus boasted of their tenderness  at the same time devouring the flesh of six different animals tossed up in a fricassee  Strange contrariety of conduct  they pity and they eat the objects of their compassion  The lion roars with terror over its captive  the tyger sends forth its hideous shriek to intimidate its prey  no creature shews any fondness for its short lived prisoner  except a man and a cat     52Man was born to live with innocence and simplicity  but he has deviated from nature  he was born to share the bounties of heaven  but he has monopolized them  he was born to govern the brute creation  but he is become their tyrant  If an epicure now should happen to surfeit on his last night s feast  twenty animals the next day are to undergo the most exquisite tortures in order to provoke his appetite to another guilty meal  Hail  O ye simple  honest bramins of the east  ye inoffensive friends of all that were born to happiness as well as you  you never sought a short lived pleasure from the miseries of other creatures  You never studied the tormenting arts of ingenious refinement  you never surfeited upon a guilty meal  How much more purified and refined are all your sensations than ours  you distinguish every element with the utmost precision  a stream untasted before is new luxury  a change of air is a new banquet  too refined for western imaginations to conceive   Though the Europeans do not hold the transmigration of souls  yet one of their doctors has  with great force of argument  and great plausibility of reasoning  endeavoured to prove that the bodies of animals are the habitations of daemons and wicked spirits  which are obliged to reside in these prisons till the resurrection pronounces their everlasting punishment  but are previously condemned to suffer all the pains and hardships inflicted upon them by man  or by each other here  If this be the case  it may frequently happen  that while we whip pigs to death  or boil live lobsters  we are putting some old acquaintance  some near relation  to excruciating tortures  and are   53 serving him up to the very same table where he was once the most welcome companion    Kabul  says the Zendavesta  was born on the rushy banks or the river Mawra  his possessions were great  and his luxuries kept pace with the affluence of his fortune  he hated the harmless bramins  and despised their holy religion  every day his table was deck d out with the flesh of an hundred different animals  and his cooks had an hundred different ways of dressing it  to solicit even satiety    Notwithstanding all his eating  he did not arrive at old age  he died of a surfeit  caused by intemperance  upon this  his soul was carried off  in order to take its trial before a select assembly of the souls of those animals which his gluttony had caused to be slain  and who were now appointed his judges    He trembled before a tribunal  to every member of which  he had formerly acted as an unmerciful tyrant  he sought for pity  but found none disposed to grant it  Does he not remember  cries the angry boar  to what agonies I was put  not to satisfy his hunger  but his vanity  I was first hunted to death  and my flesh scarce thought worthy of coming once to his table  Were my advice followed  he should do penance in the shape of an hog  which in life he most resembled    I am rather  cries a sheep upon the bench  for having him suffer under the appearance of a lamb  we may then send him through four or five transmigrations in the space of a month  Were my   54 voice of any weight in the assembly  cries a calf  he should rather assume such a form as mine  I was bled every day  in order to make my flesh white  and at last killed without mercy  Would it not be wiser  cries a hen  to cram him in the shape of a fowl  and then smother him in
