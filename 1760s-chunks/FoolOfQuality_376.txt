that I dared to seize her hand   I   crushed it to my lips  and thrust it to ray soul  What would you   enjoin  I cried  I would do any thing  dare any thing   to be united   to my Eloisa   in life and in death  body to body  and dust to dust    never never to be sundered till her spirit should make the heaven   of my spirit hereafter       Ah   she suddenly exclaimed  that is the very thing I so eagerly   desire  Let the God of my heart be the God of your heart let   the God of my spirit be the God of your spirit   so shall we be   united in him  and jointly partake of his blessedness through   eternity      Ah   I cried   can I forego the divine precepts of our prophet     Your prophet  says she  preaches only to the eye and the ear  and   that is all that he does or can pretend to   but CHKIST  my pro    phet  preaches in the heart to the affections  From him is every   good motion  divine or human  He is the unknown God of your   spirit  my master  my Abcnamin   and you feel his precious power   while you disavow his name      I was puzzled I was silenced  I bent a knee in reverence    kissed her hand  and withdrew      I sent for the chief of the Christian missionaries throughout the   city and country  I consulted each of them in private  but re    ceived no satisfaction from them  They all appeared equally   zealous for my reformation  but attempted it by different  and   even by opposite  arguments      Some would have persuaded me to be Christian  by showing the   absurdity of every religion that was not Christian  Others affirmed   that my eternal salvation depended on my conformity to certain   external rules and penances  While the greatest number inveighed   against the Christians of every other denomination   and would   have thrust me wholly from Christ  if I did not consent to receive   him within their stinted pale      I knew not what to do   I was put to a stand  and quite con    founded by this multiplicity of conflicting opinions  At length a   countryman of my own came to me from the desert  He had been   a great sinner  but was converted by the sense of his sins   and he   was revered and resorted to by all the friendless and afflicted      I opened my soul to him  with all its doubts and difficulties    My friend in Christ  said he  with a gentle nnd still voice  they   have been leading you all astray  quite away from the haven that   stretches forth its arms for the reception of long toiled mariners    whom storms have at length compelled to seek a final port      The God of your creation can alone be your redemption  the   E e 2         420 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      God of your nature can alone be the salvation of the nature that   he imparted  But who shall convince you of this  Not all the   angels in heaven  nor all the doctors upon earth  till the Christ   of your heart shall be pleased to convince you that you are  as   indeed you are  however mighty a monarch   a poor  frail  erring    vile  and despicable creature  subjected to innumerable lapses   and infirmities  sickness  passions  and crosses  griefs  agonies  and   death  When this is effectually clone  the whole of the business is   done  You will call for and catch at a Saviour  in the sensibility   of your want of him  When you come thus laden with your sins   to him  he will in nowise cast you out  But he will take you  as   Noah took the wearied dove into the ark he will take you within   the veil of his own temple of rest   and all sects  forms  and cere    monies will be as the outward courts  with which you shall have   no manner of commerce or concern      My heart felt the weight and the fulness of conviction  I took   him to my arms  and requested instant baptism  My Eloisa was   called   we locked ourselves in   and I was washed by water and   faith into Christ  while my kneeling angel wept a stream of delight   beside me      It is said that possession cloys  But I experienced  my dear   D Aubigny  that love
