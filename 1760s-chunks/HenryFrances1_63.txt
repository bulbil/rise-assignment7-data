confines me much at Home  where I have no Companion  makes all my Thoughts turn upon you  and I have frequently  in reading aloud  applied to you  for your Opinion of a Sentiment▪— Why are you not here to answer me   I begin to grow jealous of your contemplative Pleasures  when I think my dearest Harry  218 may indulge them  when I am far removed from a Possibility of any other  yet he now prefers them to a personal Converse with me —   Perhaps I am too fond   but let the short Time limited for my earthly Happiness plead my Excuse     I am vastly indebted to you for your elegant Compliment  tho  I am thoroughly conscious  I by no Means  deserve it  I am pleased with that  or any Thing else  which gives my dear Harry an Opportunity of shewing his Wit and Politeness  Not that I want fresh Proofs  to convince me  that  had he a proper Object to inspire him  his Writings might well vie with any  the greatest Masters in the Art of Pleasing  For my own Part  I solemnly declare that the Addresses of the greatest Monarch on Earth could not  to my Vanity  afford so high a Triumph  as those elegant Praises  which your dear charming Letters abound with  There is in my Temper something  that arises  either from Benevolence to the World  or selfish Vanity   I can t tell which   that  in Contradiction to Alexander s Opinion  and your s  makes me wish to communicate the Pleasure I receive from your Writings to the World  for I look upon it as a high Degree of Avarice  to monopolize such an invaluable Treasure   Tho  I am transported at the Thought of your considering me as a Male Friend  yet I in something vastly tremendous in it  The   219 great Disparity in our Understandings may now be accounted for  with some Shew of Reason  It is the Charter of our Sex  to be Fools  and the numberless Weaknesses  which intitle us to your Regard and Protection  create a peculiar Kind of Affection  which it is natural to feel for Creatures in our Power  But should we once disclaim that powerful Weakness  which renders us alike Objects of Love and Pity  we are no longer intitled to that Indulgence and Partiality  which the Wisest of us want  and the Simplest have a Claim to  Let me therefore intreat my dearest Harry  to look on my Friendship for him as truely Masculine  But let my Understanding still claim all the Privileges of the Feminine Gender   I think we have both great Reason to triumph in our late Reconciliation  as you  in attempting to regain my Esteem  paid the highest Compliment to my Affection for you  while I proved to Demonstration  that you had Merits sufficient to surmount my Pride  and your own Failings —May we long continue to receive Pleasure from the Recollection of our past Uneasinesses  and to look on that  as the happiest Aera of our Lives  that restored us to each other   I heartily wish your Friend Success  as you are interested for him  but I shall be very apt to hate him bravely  if he should be again the   220 Occasion of your missing a Post —I am  my dear Harry  constantly and sincerely  Your s   LETTER CXVIII   Dear FANNY   I WAS as bad last Night  as ever  the Reason  I did not appear so the Night before  was  that I did not sleep long enough to give my Rheum Strength sufficient to oppress me  It is now near Two  before I could set out  and shall have but just Time to reach Barnet  perhaps not before Night  so can t call on you To day  as I promised   I thank you for your Letter this Morning  and am almost sorry I did not want your Favour  for I have a Pleasure in being obliged to you  But perhaps I shall soon  and will then call on you  I beg you will write me Word  by Tuesday s Post  whether you will speed the Frolick of coming down to the Country  who the Party is to be  and what the Stage —I mean the Place of Meeting  Don t  my dear Fanny  have any Doubts or Qualms about my Desire to see you  because I did not receive the Proposal with Transport  at a Time when all my Faculties were over powered by Disorder  and Want of Rest  besides you surely ought to distinguish between the Effects of Pleasure  and those of Joy  the Transports of the one your   221 Coyness has refused me  but the Tranquility of the other your Conversation  upon any Terms  will always afford me   Consider too  if I did not press you to a Fatigue  and an Expence  for this  and the other Reasons  above hinted  I should not have been treated with such unkind Suspicion   Whenever your Words  or Actions  can bear two Meanings  I always arrest the best  and where they can admit but of one  and that not favourable  I set them by  as not to
