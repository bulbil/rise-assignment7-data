laughter  and said with a kind embrace  You must not be frightened at my dress  if it is not becoming  it is useful  it gives me my title to a charming retreat  and to the good will of the neighbouring villages  whose inhabitants love or rather idolize me  Come this way  and I will clothe you in a jacket of the same stuff as mine  If you think well of it  you shall share with me the pleasures of the life I lead  and  if it does not hit your fancy  you shall not only be at liberty to leave me  but you may depend on it that in the event of our parting  I shall not fail to do something handsome by you   I suffered myself to be persuaded  and followed the old hermit  who put several questions to me  which I answered with a truth  telling simplicity  not always to be found in a more advanced stage of morality  On our arrival at the hermitage he set some fruit before me  which I devoured  having eaten nothing all day but a slice of dry bread  on which I had breakfasted at the hospital in the morning  The recluse  seeing me play so good a part with my jaws  said  Courage  my good boy  do not spare my fruit  there is plenty of it  Heaven be praised  I have not brought you hither to starve you  And indeed that was true enough  for an hour after our coming in  he kindled a fire  put a leg of mutton down to roast  and while I turned the spit  laid a small table for himself and me  with a very dirty napkin upon it   When the meat was done enough he took it up  and cut some slices for our supper  which was no dry bargain  since we quaffed a delicious wine  of which he had laid in ample store  Well  my chicken  said he  as he rose from table  are you satisfied with my style of living  You see how we shall fare every day  if you fix your quarters here  Then with respect to liberty  you shall do just as you please in this hermitage  All I require of you is to accompany me whenever I go begging to the neighbouring villages  you will be of use in driving an ass laden with two panniers  which the charitable peasants usually fill with eggs  bread  meat  and fish  I ask no more than that  I will do  said I  whatever you desire  provided you will not oblige me to learn Latin  Friar Chrysostom  for that was the old hermit s name  could not help smiling at my school boy frowardness  and assured me once more that he should not pretend to interfere either with my studies or my inclinations   On the very next day we went on a foraging party with the donkey  which I led by the halter  We made a profitable gleaning  for all the farmers took a pleasure in throwing somewhat into our panniers  One chucked in an uncut loaf  another a large piece of bacon  here a goose  there a pair of giblets  and a partridge to crown the whole  But without entering further into particulars  we carried home provender enough for a week  and hence you may infer the esteem and friendship in which the country people held the holy man  It is true that he was a great blessing to the neighbourhood  his advice was always at their service when they came to consult him  he restored peace where discord had reigned in families  and made up matches for the daughters  he had a nostrum for almost any disease you could mention  with an assortment of pious rituals  to avert the curse of barrenness   Hence you perceive that I was in no danger of starving in my hermitage  My lodging  too  was none of the worst  stretched on good fresh straw  with a cushion of ratteen under my head  and a coverlet over me of the same stuff I made but one nap of it all night  Brother Chrysostom  who had promised me a hermit s dress  made up an old gown of his own for me  and called me little brother Scipio  No sooner did I appear in my religious uniform  than the ass s back suffered for my genteel appearance in the eyes of the villagers  It was who should give most to the little brother  so much were they delighted with his spruce figure   The easy  slothful life I led with the old hermit could not be very revolting to a boy of my age  On the contrary  it suited my taste so exactly  that I should have continued it to this time  but that the fates and destinies were weaving a more complicated tissue for my future years  It was cast in the figure of my nativity  early to rouse myself from the effeminacy of a religious life  and to take leave of brother Chrysostom after the following manner   I often observed the old man at work upon his pillow  unsewing and sewing it up again  and one day  I saw him put in some money  This circumstance excited a tingling curiosity  which I
