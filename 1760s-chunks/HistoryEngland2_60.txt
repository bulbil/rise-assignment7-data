began  but as those who oppose have always the advantage of those who defend  and as the English are more expert in naval affairs than any other nation  the Spanish ship soon became the Centurion s prize  There were but a few men killed on the side of the English  while the Spaniards lost near seventy  The conqueror now returned to Canton oncemore with his prize  He there maintained the honour of his country  in refusing   161 to pay the imposts which were laid upon ordinary merchants  and insisted that an English ship of war was exempted from such a duty  From Canton he proceeded to the Cape of Good Hope  and prosecuted his voyage to England  where he arrived in safety  with immense riches  His last prize was valued at three hundred and thirteen thousand pounds sterling  and the different captures that had been made before this last piece of good fortune  might amount to as much more  Upon his return  Commodore Anson received all that honour which prudence and perseverance deserve  He soon became the oracle consulted in all naval deliberations  the King after wards raised him to the dignity of the peerage  and he was made first Lord of the Admiralty   I am   c   LETTER XX   THE expedition of Anson took up near three years  The English  in the mean time  carried on their operations against Spain with vigour  and various success  When Anson had set out  it was only to act a subordinate part to a formidable armament  designed for the coasts of New Spain  consisting of twenty nine ships of the line  and almost an equal number of frigates  furnished with all kinds of warlike stores  and near fifteen thousand seamen  and twelve thousand land forces  Never was a fleet more completely equipped  nor never had the nation more sanguine hopes of victory  Lord Cathcart commanded the land forces  but  dying on the passage  the command devolved upon General Wentworth  whose chief merit was his favour with hose in power  This  with several other unfortunate ircumstances  concurred to frustrate the hopes of the   162 Public  The ministry  without any visible reason  had detained the fleet in England until the season for action was almost over  In the country where they were to carry on their operations  periodical rains begin about the end of April  and this change in the atmosphere is always attended with epidemical distempers  They  at length  however  set sail for the continent of New Spain  and  after some tempests  and some delays  arrived before Carthagena  This city  which lies within sixty miles of Panama  serves as the magazine for the Spanish merchandize  which is brought from Europe hither  and from thence transported  by land  to Panama  lying on the opposite coast  The taking of Carthagena therefore would interrupt the whole trade between Old Spain and the New  The troops were landed on the island Terra Bomba  near the mouth of the harbour  known by the name of the Bocca Chica  which was fortified with all the arts of engineering  The British forces erected a battery on shore  with which they made a breach in the principal fort  while the Admiral sent in a number of ships to divide the fire of the enemy  and to co operate with the endeavours of the army  The breach being deemed practicable  the forces advanced to the attack  but the Spaniards deserted the forts  which  had they cou¦rage  they might still have defended with success The troops  upon this success  were brought neare the city  where they found a greater opposition tha they had expected  The climate killed numbers o the men  and a dissension which arose between th land and naval officers  retarded all the operations Stimulated by mutual recriminations  the general or¦dered his troops to attack the fort of St  Lazar  but th guides being slain  the troops mistook their way  an attacked the strongest part of the fortification  where after suffering incredible slaughter  with the most se¦rene intrepidity  they were  at length  obliged to re¦tire    163 Bad provisions  a horrid climate  and epidemical fever  still more contributed to thin their numbers  and to deprive them of all hopes of success  It was determined therefore to reimbark the troops  and to conduct them  as soon as possible  from this scene of slaughter and contagion  The fortifications and harbour were demolished  and the fleet returned to Jamaica  This fatal miscarriage  which tarnished the British arms  was no sooner known in England  than the kingdom was filled with murmurs and discontent  a measure which  if it had succeeded  would have crowned the promoters of it with honour  now only served to cover them with reproach  The greatest part of this discontent fell upon the minister  his former conduct  which justly deserved censure  was not so powerfully objected against him  as this failure  of which he was innocent  It is not villainy  but misfortune that finds censure from mankind  Besides  the activity of the enemy  in distressing the trade of England contributed to increase the murmurs of the people  Their privateers were so numerous and successful  that in the beginning of this year they had taken  since
