this hint  which was much to my satisfaction in the main  since it spared me a slavery which I should have felt very unpleasantly at times  I left the marquis in his apartment  and withdrew to my garret  I went to bed  Not being able to sleep  it seemed good to follow the counsel of Pythagoras  and to examine all the actions of the day by the test of reason  to reprimand severely what had been done amiss  and if anything had been done well  to rejoice in it   On looking into the day book of my conscience  the balance was not sufficiently in my favour to keep me in good humour with myself  I felt remorse at having lent myself to Laura s imposition  It was in vain to urge  in self defence  that I could not  with any decency  give the lie to a girl who had no object in view but to do me a pleasure  and that I was in some sort under the necessity of becoming an accomplice in the fraud  This was a paltry excuse in the darkness of the night  for I pleaded against myself that at all events the matter should be pushed no further  and that it was the summit of impudence to remain upon the establishment of a nobleman whose confidence I so ill repaid  In short  after a severe trial  it was agreed in my own breast  that I was very little short of an arrant knave   But to have done with the morality of the act  and pass on to the probable issue  it was evidently playing a desperate game  to cozen a man of consequence who might be enabled  as an instrument for the visitation of my sins perhaps  to detect the imposture in its very infancy  A reflection at once so prudent and so virtuous acted as a refrigerator on my spirits  but visions of pleasure and of interest soon raised them again above the freezing point  Besides  the prophecy of the man with the elixir would have been enough to put me in heart once more  I therefore gave myself up to the indulgence of the most agreeable fancies  All the rules of arithmetic from simple addition to compound interest were set in array  to cast up what sum my salary would amount to at the end of ten years  service  Then there was a large allowance for presents and gratuities from my master  whose liberal disposition according admirably with my liberal desires  my imagination grew quite fantastical  and extended the landmarks of my fortune over innumerable acres of unsubstantial territory  Sleep overtook me in the calculation  and raised a magnificent aerial mansion on the estate where a new race of grandees was to originate   I got up the next morning about eight o clock to go and receive my patron s orders  but as I was opening my door to go out  what was my surprise at meeting him in his wrapping gown and night  cap  He was quite alone  Gil Blas  said he  on parting with your sister last night  I promised to pass this morning with her  but an affair of consequence will not admit of my keeping my word  Go and assure her from me that I am deeply mortified at the disappointment  but that I shall certainly sup with her to night  That is not all  added he  putting a purse into my hands and a little shagreen case set round with diamonds  carry her my portrait  and keep this purse of fifty pistoles  which I give you as a mark of my early conceived friendship  I took the picture in one hand  and in the other the purse to which I was so little entitled  I put my best leg foremost in my way to Laura  muttering to myself in the transports of excessive joy  Good  the prophecy is accomplished in the twinkling of an eye  What a windfall to be the brother of a girl so full of beauty and attraction  It is a pity the credit attached to the relationship is not commensurate with the lucre and the comfort   Laura  unlike most women in her profession  had a habit of early rising  I caught her at her toilette  where  while waiting for her illustrious foreigner  she was engrafting on her natural beauty all the adventitious charms which the cosmetic art could supply  Lovely Estella  said I  on accosting her  thou absolute lodestone of the tramontanes  I may now sit down at table with my master  since he has honoured me with a commission which gives me that prerogative  and which I am just come to fulfil  He cannot have the pleasure of waiting on you this morning  as he had purposed  but to make you amends for the disappointment  he will sup here this evening  and sends you his picture  which to all appearance is enclosed in something more valuable than itself   I put the box into her hand at once  and the lively sparkling of the brilliants which encompassed it made her eyes sparkle and her mouth water  She opened it out of mere curiosity  looked carelessly at the painting as people perform a duty for which they have little relish  then shut it  and once more fell greedily on the jewellery  Their beauty made her eloquent  and she said
