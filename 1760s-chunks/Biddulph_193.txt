case  he would not deprive his poor girl  looking at me  of the happiness of the good lady’s company for a while   Mr Ware said  we might go to town with him in his coach  and as we had but little preparation to make  we set out with him next day   When we arrived at his house in London  he welcomed us with all the marks of politeness and respect  I was surprized we did not see his sister the whole night  but as she was not apprized of our coming  I thought that either she was abroad  or had not yet quitted her friend with whom she lived   The next morning at breakfast Mr Ware made an apology for his sister’s absence  He said  that the lady  at whose house she lived  was ill  and that she could not possibly leave her till she was better  which he supposed would be in a few days  as her sickness was no other than the consequence of her lying in  mean while he hoped Mr Price would not be uneasy  as he was himself his daughter’s guardian   Though my father was not pleased at this excuse  he however concealed his thoughts from Mr Ware  but told me if Miss Ware did not come home in a few days  he purposed that we should take our leave and return into the country   We had very handsome apartments assigned us  and my father was put in possession of Mr Ware’s library  a very noble one  where that gentleman knew he would pass his most agreeable hours   For my part as I did not care to go abroad  ’till I had a proper person for me to appear with  I declined the offer Mr Ware very obligingly made of getting some ladies of his acquaintance to take me to public places  I expected his sister every day  and if she came  as I knew my father purposed staying for a month  I thought I should have time enough to see every thing  so I chose to entertain myself with working  and reading in my own room   But  Madam  I soon found that Mr Ware was a very base man  The third day after we came to his house  his behaviour towards me began to change intirely from what it was before  he took every opportunity of being particular to me in his compliments  I received them at first with that distant civility which I thought would neither encourage nor offend  I looked upon him as a worthy young man     and my father’s friend and benefactor  and thought in my humble station I should not be too quick at taking exceptions  as there had nothing as yet appeared in his behaviour which exceeded the bounds of respect  but he did not preserve this long  on the fifth day he came into a closet where I was reading  and there in the warmest manner declared himself my lover  I would fain have turned his discourse into pleasantry  but he had recourse to oaths and protestations  and swore he could not live without my favour  I represented the cruelty of the insult he offered me in his own house  and begged he would leave me  as I was determined to depart immediately  I will not  Sir  said I  let my father know the unkind return you have made for all his care of you  but I can easily prevail with him to leave your house  He fell at my feet  begged my pardon  and talked all that sort of stuff which I have read in romances  At length I got him out of the closet  and locked the door  resolving never to sit alone  without using the same precaution while we staid in his house  which I hoped would not be above a day or two longer  for I concluded there was no sister to come  and that this was only made use of as a snare to draw us to town   As I had a mind to try the young girl  I asked her  How came you to receive Mr Ware’s addresses in the manner you mentioned  how did you know but he intended to marry you   Ah no  Madam  said she  I could not entertain such a thought  I have not troubled you with the particulars of what he said to me  but young as I was  I knew too well what it tended to  besides the fear he shewed lest my father should know of his pretended courtship  was enough to convince me what his designs were  without any thing else to guide me   Did you like him  I asked  The ingenuous young woman blushed   I could have liked him  Madam  she replied  better than any body I had ever seen  if there had not been such a distance between us  I desired her to proceed   I told my father that same evening  that as I saw there was no likelihood of the lady’s coming to her brother  and as I led but a melancholy life  having no woman to converse with  I had much rather be at home amongst my neighbours and acquaintance  and begged he would return to Berkshire   My father said  it was what he had determined on after
