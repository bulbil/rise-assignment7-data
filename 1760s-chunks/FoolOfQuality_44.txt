asked   him what he wished for Alas   said this darling little trout  you   know  may it please your worship  that I am but a very foolish   and good for nothing little fish   and I don t know  not I  what is   good for me or what is bad for me   and I wonder how I came to   be worth bringing into the world  or what you could see in me   to take any thought about me  But  if I must wish for something    it is that you would do with me whatsoever you think best   and   that I should be pleased to live or die  even just as you would   have me      Now  as soon as this precious trout made this prayer hi his good   and humble little heart  God took such a liking and a love to him   as the like was never known  And God found it in his own heart    that he could not but take great care of this sweet little trout    who had trusted himself so wholly to his love and good pleasure     and God went wheresoever he went  and was always with him and   about him  and was to him as a father  and friend  and companion     and he put contentment into his mind  and joy into his heart    and so this little trout slept always in peace  and wakened in glad    ness   and  whether he was full or hungry  or whatever happened   to him  he was still pleased and thankful   and he was the happiest   of all fishes that ever swam in any water      Harry  at the close of this fable  looked down and grew thought    ful  and his patron left him to himself to ruminate on what he had         TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  11     heard  Now  Harry had often heard talk of God  and had some   general though confused notions of his power      The next day he requested his patron to repeat the story of the   three little silver trouts  When he had ended Dada  says Harry    I believe I begin to guess a little at what you mean  You would   not have me wish for any thing  but leave every thing to God    and if I thought that God loved me half as well as you love me    I would leave every thing to himself  like the good little trout    He does  my Harry  he loves you a thousand times better than   I love you  nay  a thousand times better than you love yourself    God is all love   it is he who made every thing  and he loves every   thing that he has made  Ay  but dada  1 can t  for the heart of   me  help pitying the two poor little naughty trouts  If God loves   every thing  why did he make any thing to die  You begin to   think too deeply  Harry  we will speak more of these matters   another time  For the present  let it suffice to know  that as he   can kill  he can also make alive again  at his own pleasure      Harry had now remained about twelve months with his patron    when it was intimated to the earl and his lady that the dumb man   had taken a fancy to their child  and that he was almost constantly   resident at his house  Alarmed at this news  and apprehending   that this man might be some impostor or kidnapper  they once   more sent orders to the nurse to bring the boy home      Nurse ran in a hurry to the stranger s  and  having informed   him of the necessity she was under to take away the child  many   mutual tears were shed at parting  but Harry was the sooner   pacified when nurse told him that it was but for a short visit  as   before      When they came to the castle  there was no company in the   parlour but the earl and his lady  with Lord Eichard and some   other masters of quality  about his age and size  Harry  however    looked about with a brow of disgust   and when my lady desired   him to come and kiss her May be you ll whip me  he answered   suddenly  No  she replied  if you don t strike your brother Dicky   any more  I won t beat him  says Harry  if he won t beat mammy    Come then and kiss me  my dear  said my lady  whereon Harry   advanced with a slow caution  and held up his little mouth to   receive her
