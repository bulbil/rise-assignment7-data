 and Mr Arnold remained with his lady   That at parting  which was not till late   as she would not  on account of her reputation  permit him to pass the night at her lodgings  he promised to bring her home to his house in a day or two  but unfortunately for her he was taken ill in the interim  which she did not know of  till she had an account that Mr Arnold had lost his senses  The reason she assigned for not enquiring after him sooner was  that her pride would not suffer her to make any advances to a man  who had been so injurious as to part with her  and she thought it his duty to recall her  without her taking any step towards it   This story seems plausible  yet none of our friends believe a word of it  and imagine somebody has contrived it for her  The gentleman  who was the companion of Mr Arnold that night  she says  can at a proper time be produced as a witness  as also her own maid  who can testify the truth of this story  In the mean time this maid is kept out of the way  and nobody can guess at the gentleman  for his name is kept a profound secret   I am delighted at the sweetness of Mr Arnold’s temper  vexatious as this affair is likely to be  even at the best  he does not suffer it to interrupt our pleasures or his own good humour  On the contrary  he is the more studious of promoting every thing  which he thinks will entertain me     February 28  At length the poor Miss Burchell is happily rid of her burden  a pretty little boy  my mother says it is  it was  immediately after its birth  at which my mother was present  privately baptized by the name of Orlando  and sent away with its nurse  a careful body  who had been before provided for it  It passes for the son of a captain Jefferis  abroad with the army  Miss Burchell would never suffer the nurse to see her  for as she intends to reassume her own name  as soon as she shall be in a condition to leave her present retirement  she would not chuse to be known by the woman  in case of her going to see her child  Every thing was managed with so much privacy  and Miss Burchell has lived so perfectly recluse  nobody visiting her but my mother  that in all probability this affair will always remain an intire secret   My mother says  that as soon as Miss Burchell  to whom she considers herself as a kind of patroness  is tolerably recovered  she will go down to Sidney castle  for she thinks herself in a strange land any where but there  And would you believe it my dear  she has taken such a fancy to Miss Burchell  that she talks of inviting her down with her  if she can obtain her uncle’s leave  The girl must certainly have some very amiable qualities  so to captivate my mother  or she has an immensity of art  I dare say the young lady will gladly accept of her invitation  it will undoubtedly be a most eligible situation for her  I do not know what Sir George may say to her carrying her humanity so far  as he hates the name of this poor girl  but no matter  it may be a means of preserving her character  which probably she might not long keep  if she returned to live with so vile a woman as I conclude her aunt to be  nor can she have any colour for quitting her  whilst her uncle lives  for I find she is an orphan  and has no relation but him  She must however go home for a while  in order to get leave from him for this visit to Sidney castle   March 26  1704  I am told the widow Arnold computes the time of her lying in about the latter end of the next month  if it should so happen  she saves her distance  as her husband died in July  a little before we went to Grimston hall  Mr Arnold treats the affair very lightly  and is only concerned at seeing my mother so much affected by it  For my part  I form my behaviour upon Mr Arnold’s conduct  and as long as he    appears easy  I shall certainly be so too   My brother throws out some unkind reflections  he says  he wonders the old Sybil at Grimston hall did not foresee this  and congratulates me on my good fortune  in having my jointure settled on that part of the estate which is not disputed  I really think he shews a sort of ill natured triumph even in his condolements  for he generally concludes them with thanking his stars that he had no hand in the match  I trust in God we shall none of us have any cause to repent it  I am sure I never shall  for if Mr Arnold were reduced to the lowest ebb of fortune  I should find my consolation in his kindness and affection   March 27  My mother is preparing to leave town  Miss Burchell is quite recovered  and purposes going down to
