Page  160  LETTER CCXXXIV  HENRY to FRANCES   My Dearest Life   I AM much alarmed about your Disorder  and extremely concerned at it  For Heaven s Sake take Care of yourself  Go early to Bed  though you lie awake three Hours after it  and get up early  though you should be obliged to dose in the Middle of the Day for it  Consider  my Heart s Passion  my Mind s Reflection  my Life s Happiness  and my Soul s Hope  that all these precious Concerns depend upon you  and are employed about you  If I had a more favourite Scheme in View  than your Felicity  or imagined to myself any Transport  but through that Means  you might then  perhaps  be at Liberty to trifle away your Time and Health  upon Persons who have neither Sense or Taste enough to conceive your Merits  nor Tenderness or Love to be affected by them  Remember now  my warmest Wish  that I trust you with yourself  and surely the high Confidence of so dear a Pledge deserves  at least  that it shall not be impaired in your Keeping   Since you do not approve of my Epitaphs  I beg you will frame others more to your Fancy  or  rather  let the Actions of our Lives form the Page  161 Mottos for our Graves  It was finely said of Socrates  when called upon by his Judges to make his Defence    I have been doing nothing else all my Life   Montaigne observes  very justly  upon the Subject of Death   that the Philosophy of the Schools but increases  by Prepensity  the Terrors of it  and only prepares us for the Preparation   What signifies all the Sophistry deduced from the Consideration of the Mortality of our State  that we had Life itself but upon these Conditions   that Death  a necessary End  will come when it will come   with other Quibbles of the same Kind —The only Way to make ready for Death  is to prepare our Lives for it  Actions  not Words  can comfort us at such a Crisis     After so solemn a Subject as this  it may appear light to mention such a Trifle  as I am going to speak of  but that  in Truth  though I expect to be laughed at  I have some Scruples of Conscience about it  There is a Butterfly in my Study  which would be dead some Time past  but that I watched it  at the End of the Season  and have frequently revived it by the Warmth of my Breath  every Day since  and you cannot conceive the Pleasure I receive  when I feel it flutter in my Hand  upon such Occasions  By this Means I have prolonged it s Life beyond the Date of Butterflies  Now perhaps I am counteracting the Order of Providence  and may Page  162 deserve the Punishment of Promotheus  for stealing Fire from Heaven  to animate his Man of Clay  Perhaps too  I am but making this poor Insect linger out a Life in Pain  for I believe no Creature  but Man  ever received Pleasure from any thing which was contrary to Nature  In short  I begin to fancy I am guilty of such a Cruelty  as the keeping a Man awake all Night  by Way of adding so many Hours to his Day  Should any Physician discover an Elixir  which might equal our Lives to the Age of the Patriarchs  would he not deserve to have his own cut short  for tempting Men to cheat themselves of some Portion of a glorious Immortality  merely to lengthen out some Years of Misery  here below  The Gymnosophists have a fine Sentiment  that we are  in this Life  but in a State of Conception  and that Death is our Delivery  A Man  then  who has lived beyond the Bounds prescribed by Nature  may  perhaps  be considered  in the next Life  as a monstrous Birth  For my Part  I desire not to die before the ordinary Fate of human Nature  but  at the same Time  wish  with Horace    Nec turpem senectutem degere   Not to consume a loathsome Age     Adieu  my Life  Remember your Health  and remember me   Henry   Page  163  LETTER CCXXXV  FRANCES to HENRY   I DO not  indeed  think it would be possible for me to support myself  under the very disagreeable Situation I am in  both of Body and Mind  were it not for the Pleasure I receive from my dear  dear Life s kind Letters  I own I am jealous of Solitude  and cannot help being uneasy  when I think your Fondness for that must  by Degrees  lessen your Love for me  And  should I ever be so happy as to live with you  my Company  or Converse  may appear an Interruption to your Scheme of Life  It will  of Course  grow distasteful  and I unhappy  I only speak my Fears  not my Opinion  for that shall always be guided by you  nor will I doubt your Love  your Truth  and Constancy   I am vastly
