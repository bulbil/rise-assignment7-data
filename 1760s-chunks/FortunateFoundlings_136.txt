was this       Dorilaus  when he left the lovers together  went directly to the baron   de Palfoy s  and related to him and to mademoiselle the whole history of   monsieur du Plessis and Louisa  on which they contriv d to make a   pleasant scene  by engaging the countess d Espargnes to go with them to   Dorilaus s  without letting her know on what account   The event   answered their wishes  madam d  Espargnes rallied her brother on finding   him alone with so beautiful a young lady  and mademoiselle Charlotta    for his inconstancy to his mistress at Bolognia  but when the riddle was   solved  and the countess came to know that the lady left in the   monastery and Louisa were the same  she no longer condemned an   attachment which before had given her so much pain       Mademoiselle Charlotta chid her for the reserve she had maintained to   her in this affair  especially  said she  as you were obliged to the   conversation you had with madam d Espargnes in my apartment  that you   received any intelligence of monsieur du Plessis  or knew how to direct   your commands to him to return       That  madam  is an obligation lies wholly on me  said monsieur du   Plessis  and I believe I shall find it very difficult to requite it  any   more than I shall to deserve my sister s pardon  for so industriously   endeavouring to conceal from her the secret of my passion and   its object       Louisa told the ladies that she now hoped they would excuse the disorder   she had been in at the countess s discourse  since they knew the   motive   a good deal of pleasantry passed between this agreeable   company  and as they were in the midst of it  the baron de Palfoy  who   had been hindered from accompanying Dorilaus  when he conducted the   ladies  now joined them  and tho  he was considerably older than any   there  was no less entertaining and good humoured than the youngest       Dorilaus had privately ordered a very magnificent collation  which being   served up  Louisa did the honours of the table with so good a grace    that madam d  Espargnes was charmed with her  and took an opportunity of   asking Dorilaus when she might hope the happiness of calling so amiable   a lady by the name of sister  Du Plessis thanked her for the interest   she took in his affairs  and the baron de Palfoy added  that as the   lovers wanted no farther proofs how worthy they were of each other  he   would join in solliciting for a completion of their happiness  To which   Dorilaus replied  that he was too well satisfied with his daughter s   conduct  not to leave her entirely at her own disposal  and as to what   related to fortune and settlement  he should be ready to enter into such   articles as  he believed  monsieur du Plessis would have no reason to   complain of       The passionate lover at these words cried out  that it was Louisa s self   alone he was ambitious of possessing  nor had either that lady or her   father any room to look on what he said as a mere compliment  because   his love had long since waved all the seeming disproportion   between them       In fine  not only at this time  but every day  almost every hour  was   Louisa  as it now depended wholly on herself  importuned by her lover   and the countess d Espargnes to render his happiness complete  but she   still delayed it  desiring to hear some news of Horatio  the baron de   Palfoy having settled every thing with Dorilaus concerning his marriage   with mademoiselle Charlotta  she was willing  she said  that as they   were born on the same day  their nuptials should be also celebrated at   the same time       Monsieur du Plessis was obliged to content himself with this since he   could obtain no more  and for a time every thing passed smoothly and   agreeably on  but news after news continually arriving of the king of   Sweden s ill success in Ukrania  rendered all the noble friends of   Horatio extremely dissatisfied   the public accounts were too deficient   for their information of any particular officer  and as there were very   few French in the Swedish army  they could hope for no intelligence of   him but from himself  which  as he omitted giving  they at last   concluded he was either killed or taken prisoner  which last misfortune   they looked upon as equal with the former   the Russian barbarity  and   their manner of treating those whom the chance of war threw into their   hands  was
