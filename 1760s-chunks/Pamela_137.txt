acquaintance  to run away with that college   novice       O good sir  said I  may I be heard one thing  And though I bring upon me   your highest indignation  I will tell you  perhaps  the unnecessary and   imprudent  but yet the whole truth       My honesty  I am poor and lowly  and am not entitled to call it honour    was in danger  I saw no means of securing myself from your avowed   attempts  You had shewed you would not stick at little matters  and   what  sir  could any body have thought of my sincerity  in preferring   that to all other considerations  if I had not escaped from these   dangers  if I could have found any way for it   I am not going to say   any thing for him  but  indeed  indeed  sir  I was the cause of putting   him upon assisting me in my escape  I got him to acquaint me what gentry   there were in the neighbourhood that I might fly to  and prevailed   upon him  Don t frown at me  good sir  for I must tell you the whole   truth  to apply to one Lady Jones  to Lady Darnford  and he was so good   to apply to Mr  Peters  the minister  But they all refused me  and then   it was he let me know  that there was no honourable way but marriage    That I declined  and he agreed to assist me for God s sake       Now  said he  you are going  I boldly put my hand before his mouth    hardly knowing the liberty I took  Pray  sir  said I  don t be angry    I have just done  I would only say  that rather than have staid to be   ruined  I would have thrown myself upon the poorest beggar that ever the   world saw  if I thought him honest   And I hope  when you duly weigh all   matters  you will forgive me  and not think me so bold  and so forward    as you have been pleased to call me       Well  said he  even in this your last speech  which  let me tell you    shews more your honesty of heart than your prudence  you have not   over much pleased me  But I must love you  and that vexes me not a   little  But tell me  Pamela  for now the former question recurs  Since   you so much prize your honour  and your virtue  since all attempts   against that are so odious to you  and since I have avowedly made   several of these attempts  do you think it is possible for you to love   me preferably to any other of my sex       Ah  sir  said I  and here my doubt recurs  that you may thus graciously   use me  to take advantage of my credulity       Still perverse and doubting  said he  Cannot you take me as I am at   present  And that  I have told you  is sincere and undesigning  whatever   I may be hereafter       Ah  sir  replied I  what can I say  I have already said too much  if   this dreadful hereafter should take place  Don t bid me say how well I   can  And then  my face glowing as the fire  I  all abashed  leaned upon   his shoulder  to hide my confusion       He clasped me to him with great ardour  and said  Hide your dear face in   my bosom  my beloved Pamela  your innocent freedoms charm me   But then   say  How well  what       If you will be good  said I  to your poor servant  and spare her  I   cannot say too much  But if not  I am doubly undone   Undone indeed       Said he  I hope my present temper will hold  for I tell you frankly    that I have known  in this agreeable hour  more sincere pleasure than   I have experienced in all the guilty tumults that my desiring soul   compelled me into  in the hopes of possessing you on my own terms  And    Pamela  you must pray for the continuance of this temper  and I hope   your prayers will get the better of my temptations       This sweet goodness overpowered all my reserves  I threw myself at his   feet  and embraced his knees  What pleasure  sir  you give me at these   gracious words  is not lent your poor servant to express   I shall be   too much rewarded for all my sufferings
