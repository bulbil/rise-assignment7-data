a doubt whether she  was really so whimsical and capriccios in her appetites as she herself  pretended to be  for her longings were not restricted to the demands of  the palate and stomach  but also affected all the other organs of sense   and even invaded her imagination  which at this period seemed to be  strangely diseased   One time she longed to pinch her husband s ear  and it was with infinite  difficulty that his sister could prevail upon him to undergo the  operation  Yet this task was easy  in comparison with another she  undertook for the gratification of Mrs  Pickle s unaccountable desire   which was no other than to persuade the commodore to submit his chin  to the mercy of the big bellied lady  who ardently wished for an  opportunity of plucking three black hairs from his beard  When this  proposal was first communicated to Mr  Trunnion by the husband  his  answer was nothing but a dreadful effusion of oaths  accompanied with  such a stare  and delivered in such a tone of voice  as terrified the  poor beseecher into immediate silence  so that Mrs  Grizzle was fain  to take the whole enterprise upon herself  and next day went to the  garrison accordingly  where  having obtained entrance by means of the  lieutenant  who  while his commander was asleep  ordered her to be  admitted for the joke s sake  she waited patiently till he turned out     6 22 15  3 45 PM   and then accosted him in the yard  where he used to perform his morning  walk  He was thunderstruck at the appearance of a woman in a place he  had hitherto kept sacred from the whole sex  and immediately began to  utter an apostrophe to Tom Pipes  whose turn it was then to watch  when  Mrs  Grizzle  falling on her knees before him  conjured him  with many  pathetic supplications  to hear and grant her request  which was no  sooner signified  than he bellowed in such an outrageous manner that the  whole court re echoed the opprobrious term b    and the word damnation   which he repeated with surprising volubility  without any sort of  propriety or connection  and retreated into his penetralia  leaving the  baffled devotee in the humble posture she had so unsuccessfully chosen  to melt his obdurate heart   Mortifying as this repulse must have been to a lady of her stately  disposition  she did not relinquish her aim  but endeavoured to interest  the commodore s counsellors and adherents in her cause  With this view  she solicited the interest of Mr  Hatchway  who  being highly pleased  with a circumstance so productive of mirth and diversion  readily  entered into her measures  and promised to employ his whole influence  for her satisfaction  and as for the boatswain s mate  he was rendered  propitious by the present of a guinea  which she slipped into his hand   In short  Mrs  Grizzle was continually engaged in this negotiation for  the space of ten days  during which  the commodore was so incessantly  pestered with her remonstrances  and the admonitions of his associates   that he swore his people had a design upon his life  which becoming a  burden to him  he at last complied  and was conducted to the scene like  a victim to the altar  or rather like a reluctant bear  when he is led  to the stake amidst the shouts and cries of butchers and their dogs   After all  this victory was not quite so decisive as the conquerors  imagined  for the patient being set  and the performer prepared with  a pair of pincers  a small difficulty occurred  she could not for some  time discern one black hair on the whole superficies of Mr  Trunnion s  face  when Mrs  Grizzle  very much alarmed and disconcerted  had  recourse to a magnifying glass that stood upon her toilet  and  after a  most accurate examination  discovered a fibre of a dusky hue  to which  the instrument being applied  Mrs  Pickle pulled it up by the roots  to  the no small discomposure of the owner  who  feeling the smart much more  severe than he had expected  started up  and swore he would not part  with another hair to save them all from damnation   Mr  Hatchway exhorted him to patience and resignation  Mrs  Grizzle  repeated her entreaties with great humility  but finding him deaf to all  her prayers  and absolutely bent upon leaving the house  she clasped his  knees  and begged for the love of God that he would have compassion upon  a distressed family  and endure a little more for the sake of the poor  infant  who would otherwise be born with a gray beard upon its chin   Far from being melted  he was rather exasperated by this reflection  to  which he replied with great indignation   D   you for a yaw sighted b     I ll be hanged  long enough before he has any beard at all   so saying   he disengaged himself from
