 it is necessary to create a Number of new Souls  to supply the Place of those  who have finished their Course  Thus I conclude  that what is stiled Sense  or Parts  in Men  is  but a Recollection of former Experience  and their having no Consciousness of this Matter  need be no Objection to the Truth of it  for Men have often  in their Sleep  exercised the Arts  they have been bred to  without any Recollection of their former Practice  The Fools then of this World  I take to be some of those new fashioned Souls  occasionally created  who must necessarily pass thro  an Infancy of three score Years  and be re born to every Stage of human Life  before they can arrive at an adult Understanding  and find Rest for their Souls in Elysium   The second Part of your Proposition must be deferred  to be considered the next Post   I am   my fair Querist   Your faithful Respondent  Harry     58  LETTER XXXVIII   IN Answer to the second Part of your Quere  I shall observe to you  that Fools are generally said to be       As I have not my Books by me  I must leave this Section imperfect  and proceed to another natural Reason  which is  that Thought and Reflection much waste the Strength  and dissipate the animal Spirits  which Weakness  Fools being especially free from—  here again  I am at a Loss—  so I shall quit this Subject  after having made one Reflection  that  as Women are said  in general  to be extremely fond of Fools  it is surprizing  that Men of Sense find so little Favour from them  as they are allowed to be incomparably the greatest Fools in Love  For a Man of Sense must beat a Fool  all to nothing  even in Folly  But this remarkable Distinction  with Women  must be owing to their extraordinary Piety  paying greater Regard to Ideots delivered from the Hands of their Creator  than to Fools of their own Making   Enough of this idle Subject —Adieu   Henry     59  LETTER XXXIX  FRANCES to HENRY   DOST thou expect to live  after all this prophane Sarcasm against Women  Or do you hope that Hesiod or Orpheus were to be the last Sacrifices to Female Justice  Observe that I enter the Lists  and draw my Pen  as Champion  for the Honour of my injured Sex  in which I shall proceed after your own Method  First  by denying  and then by admitting the Fact   First  then  I affirm that Souls are not of different Genders  Therefore  in the metaphysical Nature of the Question  your Sex has  originally  no Advantage over our s  I have indeed sometimes heard such an arbitrary Distinction made  as Virtues masculine  and Virtues feminine  but the Antients  who first classed all human Properties  were of a different Way of thinking  and tacitly confessed  that all virtuous Qualities belonged more properly to our Sex  for I have heard you say a very flattering Thing  that    in all the learned Languages  the moral Excellencies were Nouns of the feminine Gender   If you answer for Greek and Latin  I will do the same for French and Italian       60This shews  at least  the general Sense of lettered Philosophers  as also of great and warlike Nations  in our Favour  and what led them naturally into this Way of Thinking  was  the Observing that all Refinement in Sense  and all Improvement in Manners  was entirely owing to our Influence over your uncooth Natures  who afterwards polished those Virtues  which we first inspired — ye had been Brutes without us    But  not to insist on any Superiority in this Matter  would it not be cruel and prophane to suppose that the Creator should require as great Virtues from us  and subject us to as severe Trials  as Men  without inspiring our Minds with equal Strength  or making our Souls capable of as high moral Perfection   Your own Reading can furnish you with Instances in Women  of every manly Virtue  even of personal Courage  and Contempt of Death  sufficient to prove the Force of my Reasoning  which  however  I shall not enumerate  lest  my Memory failing me  you should pertly say  these Examples were but just sufficient to establish the contrary Rule  by their Exceptions to it  In Answer to which  I shall make a Reply  that a Lion did once to Man  you  keep the Art of Painting in your own Hands   But  grant that the Instances of female Heroism are but few  are not the Opportunities of exerting   61 it as few also  I mean with regard to Actions publick  and shining enough  for the Notice of History  which  however  are neither more amiable  or more difficult  than many Virtues  you  vile Men  give us the Occasion of exercising in private Life  to which you have arbitrarily confined the Sphere of our Activity   Now even those few extraordinary Examples  which you all admit of
