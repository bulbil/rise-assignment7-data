 when the lieutenant  hopping  eagerly towards the countryman  squeezed his hand with great affection   and asked if the old gentleman had actually taken his departure   Ay   Master Hatchway   replied the other   in such a woundy haste  that he  forgot to make a will     Body of me   exclaimed the seaman   these are  the best tidings I have ever heard since I first went to sea  Here  my  lad  take my purse  and stow thyself chuck full of the best liquor  in the land   So saying  he tipped the peasant with ten pieces  and  immediately the whole place echoed the sound of Tom s instrument   Peregrine  repairing to the walk  communicated the billet to his honest  friend  who at his desire went forthwith to the lodgings of Captain  Gauntlet  and returned in less than an hour with that gentleman  who  I  need not say  was heartily rejoiced at the occasion   CHAPTER CIV    Peregrine holds a Consultation with his Friends  in consequence of  which he bids Adieu to the Fleet  He arrives at his Father s House  and  asserts his Right of Inheritance   Nor did our hero keep the misanthrope in ignorance of this happy turn of  fortune  Pipes was despatched to the senior  with a message requesting  his immediate presence  and he accordingly appeared  in obedience to the  summons  growling with discontent for having been deprived of several  hours of his natural rest  His mouth was immediately stopped with the  letter  at which he  smiled horribly a ghastly grin   and  after a  compliment of gratulation  they entered into close divan  about the  measures to be taken in consequence of this event   There was no room for much debate  It was unanimously agreed that Pickle  should set out with all possible despatch for the garrison  to which  Gauntlet and Hatchway resolved to attend him  Pipes was accordingly  ordered to prepare a couple of post chaises  while Godfrey went to  procure bail for his friend  and provide them with money for the expense  of the expedition  but not before he was desired by Peregrine to  conceal this piece of news from his sister  that our youth might have  an opportunity to surprise her in a more interesting manner  after he  should have settled his affairs   All these previous steps being taken  in less than an hour our hero took  his leave of the Fleet  after he had left twenty guineas with the warden  for the relief of the poor prisoners  a great number of whom conveyed  him to the gate  pouring forth prayers for his long life and prosperity   and he took the road to the garrison  in the most elevated transports of  joy  unallayed with the least mixture of grief at the death of a parent  whose paternal tenderness he had never known  His breast was absolutely  a stranger to that boasted storm  or instinct of affection  by which  the charities are supposed to subsist   Of all the journeys he had ever made  this  sure  was the most  delightful  He felt all the ecstasy that must naturally be produced in a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   young man of his imagination  from such a sudden transition in point of  circumstance  he found himself delivered from confinement and disgrace   without being obliged to any person upon earth for his deliverance  he  had it now in his power to retort the contempt of the world in a manner  suited to his most sanguine wish  he was reconciled to his friend  and  enabled to gratify his love  even upon his own terms  and saw himself  in possession of a fortune more ample than his first inheritance  with  a stock of experience that would steer him clear of all those quicksands  among which he had been formerly wrecked   In the middle of their journey  while they halted at an inn for a short  refreshment and change of horses  a postilion running up to Peregrine in  the yard  fell at his feet  clasped his knees with great eagerness  and agitation  and presented to him the individual face of his old  valet de chambre  The youth perceiving him in such an abject garb and  attitude  commanded him to rise and tell the cause of such a miserable  reverse in his fortune  Upon which Hadgi gave him to understand  that he  had been ruined by his wife  who  having robbed him of all his cash  and valuable effects  had eloped from his house with one of his own  customers  who appeared in the character of a French count  but was in  reality no other than an Italian fiddler  that  in consequence of this  retreat  he  the husband  was disabled from paying a considerable sum  which he had set apart for his wine merchant  who being disappointed in  his expectation  took out an execution against his effects  and the  rest of his creditors following his example  hunted him out of house  and
