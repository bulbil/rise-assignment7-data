 he introduced me to the major domo  who thought he saw talent enough in me for a turnspit   No sooner was I in possession of so honourable an office  than master Diego  following the practice of cooks in great houses  who pamper up their pretty dears in private with all sorts of good things  selected me to supply a lady in the neighbourhood with a regular table of butcher s meat  poultry  and game  This good friend of his was a widow on the right side of thirty  very pretty  very lively  and to all appearance contenting herself with cupboard love for her cook  His generous passion was not confined to furnishing her with bread  meat  and garnish  she drank her wine too  and the archbishop was her wine merchant   The improvement of my parts kept pace with that of my carnal condition in his grace s palace  where I gave a specimen of rising genius  still ringing on the trump of fame at Seville  The pages and some others of the household had a mind to get up a play on my lord archbishop s birthday  They chose a popular Spanish tragedy  and wanting a boy about my age to personate the young King of Leon  cast me for the part  The major domo  a great spouter  undertook to train me for the stage  and after a few lessons  pronounced that I should not be the worst actor of the company  His grace not wishing to starve so handsome a compliment to himself  no expense was spared in getting it up magnificently  The largest hall in the palace was fitted up as a theatre  with appropriate decorations  At the side scene there was a bed of turf  on which I was to be discovered asleep  when the Moors were to rush in and take me prisoner  When we had got so forward with our rehearsals as to be sure of being ready by the time fixed  the archbishop sent out cards of invitation to all the principal families in the city   At length the great  the important day arrived  and each performer was big with the contrivance and adjustment of his dress  Mine was brought by a tailor  accompanied by our major  domo  who  after taking the trouble of drilling me at rehearsal  wished to see justice done to my outward appearance  The tailor put me on a rich robe of blue velvet  with hanging sleeves  gold lace  fringe  and buttons  the major domo himself crowned me with a pasteboard crown  studded with false diamonds and real pearls  Moreover  they gave me a sash of pink silk worked in silver  so that every new ornament was like a quill feather in the wing of a bird  At last  about dusk  the play began  The curtain drew up for my soliloquy  the purport of which was to express  in a roundabout  poetical way  that not being able to defend myself from the influence of sleep  I was going to lie down and take it as it came  To suit the action to the word  I sidled off to the corner between the flat and the wings  and squatted down on my bed of turf  but instead of going to sleep  according to promise  I was hammering upon the means of getting into the street  and running away with my coronation finery  A little private staircase  leading under the theatre into the lower saloon  seemed to furnish the probability of success  I slid away slily  while the audience were considering some necessary question of the play  and ran down the staircase  through the saloon  to the door  calling out   Make way  make way  I must change my dress  and run up again in a moment   They all made a lane  for fear of hindering me  so that in less than two minutes I got clear out of the palace  under cover of the darkness  and scampered to the house of my friend who saw gentlemen s trunks safe on board   He stared like a stuck pig at my equipment l But when I let him into the why and the wherefore  he laughed ready to split his sides  Then  shaking hands in the sincerity of his heart  because he flattered himself with the hope of a pension on the King of Leon s civil list  he wished me joy of so successful a first appearance  and joined issue with the major domo in the prognostic  that with encouragement and practice I should turn out a first rate actor  and make no little noise in the world  After we had diverted ourselves for some time at the expense of my manager and audience  I said to the bully    What shall we do with this magnificent dress  Do not make yourself uneasy about that  answered he  I know an honest broker  without an atom of curiosity in his composition  who will buy or sell anything with any person  provided that he gets the turn of the market upon the transaction  I will fetch him to you to morrow morning  The knowing fellow was as good as his word  for he went out early the next day  leaving me in bed  and returned two hours afterwards with the broker  carrying
