 and such   other trifling matters  diverted the other from those serious   reflections  which might otherwise  perhaps  have lasted somewhat   longer       When Miss Flora was undressed  they went down together into the parlour    where they found Mr  Goodman extremely uneasy  that Lady Mellasin was   not come home  He had been told in what manner she went out  and it now   being grown dark  he was frighted lest any ill accident should befal   her  as she had no man servant  nor any one with her but her woman    whom  he said  he could not look on as a sufficient guard for a lady of   quality  against those insults  which night  and the libertinism of the   age  frequently produced       This tender husband asked the young ladies a thousand questions    concerning the possibility of guessing to whom  and to what part of the   town  she was gone  in order that he might go himself  or send a servant   to conduct her safely home  but neither of them were able to inform him   any thing farther than what has already been related  that she had been   sent for to a sick relation  who  as it appeared to them  had been very   pressing to engage her ladyship to that charitable office       Mr  Goodman then began to endeavour to recollect the names  and places   of abode  of all those he had ever heard her say were of her kindred    for she had never suffered any of them to come to the house  under   pretence that some of them had not behaved well  and that others being   fallen to decay  and poor  might expect favours from her  and that she   would suffer nobody belonging to her to be burdensome to him       He was  notwithstanding  about to send his men in search of his beloved   lady  though he knew not where to direct them to go  when she and Mrs    Prinks came home  he received her with all the transports a man of his   years could be capable of  but gently chid her for the little care she   had taken of herself  and looking on her  as Mrs  Prinks was pulling off   her hood   Bless me  my dear   said he   what was your fancy for going   out in such a dress     My cousin   replied she   is in very wretched   circumstances  lives in a little mean lodging  and  besides  owes money    if I had gone any thing like myself  the people of the house might have   expected great things from me  I am very compassionate  indeed  to every   one under misfortunes  but will never squander Mr  Goodman s money for   their relief         I know thou art all goodness   said the old gentleman  kissing her with   the utmost tenderness   but something   continued he   methinks  might be   spared     Leave it to me  Mr  Goodman   answered she   I know best    they have not deserved it from me   She then told a long story  how kind   she had been to this cousin  and some others of her kindred  in her   first husband s time  and gave some instances of the ill use they had   made of her bounties  All she said had so much the appearance of truth    that even Miss Betsy  who was far from having a high opinion of her   sincerity  believed it  and thought no farther of what had passed  she   had  indeed  in a short time  sufficient businesses of her own to take   up all her mind       Mr  Goodman  the very next day  brought home a very agreeable young   gentleman to dine with him  who  though he paid an extraordinary respect   to Lady Mellasin  and treated her daughter with the utmost complaisance    yet in the compliments he paid to Miss Betsy  there was something which   seemed to tell her she had inspired him with a passion more tender than   bare respect  and more sincere than common complaisance       She had very penetrating eyes this way  and never made a conquest   without knowing she did so  she was not  therefore  wanting in all those   little artifices she had but too much made her study  in order to fix   the impression she had given this stranger as indelible as possible    this she had a very good opportunity for doing  he staid the whole   afternoon  drank tea with the ladies  and left them not till a crowd of   company coming in  he thought
