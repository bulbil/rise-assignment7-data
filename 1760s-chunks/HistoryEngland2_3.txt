 The two houses having in this manner answered the royal demands for money  the King  rather than give up the Duke  chose to be without the supply  and therefore once more dissolved the parliament   He had now a war to maintain  which he was engaged in by the advice of those very members who refused to contribute to its support  besides this  he was to put the kingdom in a proper posture of defence  and he wanted money to execute these purposes  To furnish the proper supplies he again had recourse to loans  and to granting protections to the Papists  for stipulated sums of money  such as refused   5 had soldiers billetted upon them  contrary to the customs of England  and even some were enrolled for soldiers themselves  Persons of birth and rank were summoned to appear before the council  and  upon their persisting in a refusal  were put into confinement  We now once more perceive the seeds of discord beginning to shoot forth  we now see  as in every other civil war  both parties guilty of injustice  yet on either side that injustice arising from principles of virtue  the one actuated by the inherent liberties of mankind  the other by the prescriptive privileges of the crown  such is the general lot of humanity  to have their actions degenerate from the producing motives   The King  now finding that nothing but the prospect of immediate danger could induce some future parliament to provide necessary supplies  was resolved to make a rupture with France  a war against which had ever been an expedient of producing unanimity at home  With this view he sent out Buckingham with a fleet to relieve Rochelle  a maritime town in that kingdom  which had long enjoyed its privileges independent of the French King  and which he was now actually preparing to deprive them of  This expedition was equally fruitless with that to the coasts of Spain  the Duke knew nothing of the art of war  and consumed his time in besieging a little fort in the isle of Rhee  from whence he was driven with the loss of half his army  The bad success of this served to render the unfortunate Duke still more obnoxious  and the King more needy  another parliament was therefore called  and a supply demanded in the usual form  The commons  in the first parliament  had begun with fictitious grievances  but their refusing then to contribute the supplies soon introduced an actual abuse of power  and rendered the King unjust  who  probably  only desired to be easy  He extorted supplies  and imprisoned the refractory  The   6 complaints of the commons were now real  their members had been imprisoned  loans had been extorted  a tax upon merchandize  called tonnage and poundage  had been exacted without parliamentary authority  and  last of all  the Duke of Buckingham was still suffered to rule the councils of the King  and inflame every proceeding  In this situation they seemed  as usual  resolved to grant no money till their grievances were redressed  and till the King had given a positive assurance to maintain the liberties of the subject  The King promised both  and they voted him a liberal supply  upon which they were prorogued  as was customary  This fresh supply enabled his Majesty to make another attempt to relieve Rochelle  and the Duke of Buckingham was again to have the command  Buckingham had ever behaved with some haughtiness  as being secure of the King s protection  but his greatest fault seemed to be too large a share of power  which gave offence to every order  It is the aim of all malecontents in a state rather to bring the great down to their own level  than to exalt the inferior order to theirs  and this might be a motive to the lords and commons for attempting to retrench Buckingham s power  The clamour raised against him in the house was not lost among the people  they re echoed it from one to the other  and the Duke had a million of foes only from his seeming prosperity  Among this number was one John Felton  an Irishman  a lieutenant in the army  this man was naturally melancholy  courageous  and enthusiastic  he felt for his country as if labouring under a calamity which he thought it in the power of his single arm to remove  he resolved to kill the Duke  and thus to do a service both to God and man  Animated with mistaken patriotism and gloomy zeal  he reached Portsmouth  where the Duke was then  surrounded with his levee  giving the necessary orders to embark  Felton came up among   7 the crowd and stabbed him with a long knife to the heart  the Duke instantly fell dead  and Felton walked composedly away  but his hat had fallen off while he was striking the blow  and this produced his discovery  He disdained denying a murder in which he gloried  and averred that he looked upon the Duke as an enemy to his country  and  as such  deserving to suffer  We shall see through the course of this reign several instances of great virtues and enormous vices  for the genius of England was at this time arrived at its highest pitch   The expedition to Rochelle again returned without success  as if it had
