subjects are   Every one avoids mentioning the name of the poor Count of Belvedere in the presence of Lady Clementina  yet we all pity him  We have reason to do so  from the account Signor Jeronymo receives of his distress of mind  while he endeavours to overcome his hopeless passion   Allow me  madam  to conclude this Letter here  We are to have a little concert this evening  and our company is beginning to assemble in the music room —I must go and attend the marchioness and Lady Clementina  who herself will be a performer  She is an admirable one  I can only stay to add  that I am  Your ever dutiful HARRIET GRANDISON     223  LETTER XLV  Lady GRANDISON  To Mrs  SHIRLEY    Grandison hall  Saturday  April 28   MY dearest grandmamma will not complain that my three last Letters  a were not filled with particulars of our engagements and Conversations here  What a scene of happiness  What have I to pray for but the continuance of it  Except that the admirable Lady Clementina were somehow settled to her own liking  and that her indulgent relations could be satisfied with it  Something seems to be wanting for her  and therefore for them  Yet can a lover of her  of her fame  of her family  say  what that something should be  I  for my part  ought to be the last who should decide for her  I  who never  I think  say Lady G  what she pleases of my romancings  could have been happy with any man in the world but Sir Charles Grandison  after I had known him  and once was led to hope for so great a blessing and who have not that notion that she has  or seems to have  of the dreariness  and disadvantages of a single state  on the contrary  who think the married life attended with so many cares and troubles  that it is rather  as it is a duty to enter into it  when it can be done with prudence  a kind of faulty indulgence and selfishness  in order to avoid these cares and troubles  to live single  But to leave this subject to the decision of Lady G  and Lady Gertrude  the latter of whom has given some unanswerable hints on her Side of the Question  I will proceed with my narrative   And here let me observe  that had not Lady Clementina made her rejection of the best of men her sole and deliberate Act  it is my humble opinion that her loss of him would have been insupportable to her  That consideration  and her noble motive for it  enable   224 her to behave gloriously under the self deprivation  as I may call it  Yet  I can see  at times  by her studiously avoiding his company  and frequently excusing herself from making one in little parties of Sir Charles s proposing  and by her chusing at all times  my company  that the noble Lady thinks self denial necessary to her peace   She was once for putting Jeronymo on proposing to leave England sooner than they had intended  and take my promise to follow them  I was present  She had tears in her eyes when she proposed it  We had been talking of Sir Charles in raptures  on some of his noble charities which had but lately come to our knowlege  and it was pretty evident to me  that she  at the time  was of opinion  that distance from him would be a means to quiet her heart—The dear Emily finds it so  thank God   Lady Clementina has been  however  tolerably chearful since  amusing herself with drawing up plans for her future life  Very pretty ones some of them  But a little too ideal  if I may so express myself  and she changes them too often to shew that steadiness  which I want to see in her mind  Poor Lady  How I pity her as I contemplate her  in her contrivances and proposals  I am often forced to turn away my face  that she may not see the starting Tear   Tuesday  May 1   THE Count of Belvedere being returned to London from a country excursion  and not very well  the Marquiss was desirous of making a visit to him  and at the same time to pass a few Days in London to see the Curiosities of the place  and to be present at some of the publick entertainments  The gentlemen at the first Motion made a party to attend him  and Sir Charles  you may suppose  would not  in complaisance  be excused  Dr  Bartlett and Father Marescotti  who are inseparable  had formed a scheme of their own and the Ladies declared  that not one of them would leave me     225 The gentlemen accordingly set out yesterday morning  In the afternoon arrived here  one of the most obliging of wives  tenderest of mothers  and amiable of nurses Who do you think  madam —No other than Lady G  and her Lord  Ungovernable Charlotte  Her month but just up  We have all blamed her  We blamed her Lord too for suffering her to come —But what could I do  said he  innocently—But
