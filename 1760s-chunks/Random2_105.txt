coming in that place  he at first peremptorily refused to leave me  until I perswaded him  that if our horses should remain where they were  till day light  they would certainly be discovered  and the whole county alarmed  On this consideration  he took his leave in a sorrowful plight  kissed my hand  and weeping  cried    God knows if ever I shall see you again  —  My kind landlady finding me obstinate  gave me her best advice how to behave in the execution of my project  and after having perswaded me to take a little refreshment  accommodated me with a bed  and left me to my repose —Early in the morning  I got up  and armed with a couple of loaded pistols and a hanger  went to the back of the Squire s garden  climbed over the wall  and  according to Mrs  Sagely s direction  concealed myself in a thicket  hard by an alcove which terminated a walk at a good distance from the house  which  I was told  my mistress chiefly frequented —Here I absconded from five a clock in the morning to six in the evening  without seeing a human creature  at last I perceived two women approaching  whom by my throbbing heart I soon recogniz d to be the adorable Narcissa and Miss Williams  I felt the strongest agitation of soul at the sight  and guessing that they would repose themselves in the alcove  I stept into it unperceiv d  and laid upon the stone table a picture of myself in miniature  for which I had sat in London  purposing   317 to leave it with Narcissa before I should go abroad  I exposed it in this manner  as an introduction to my own appearance  which  without some previous intimation  I was afraid might have an unlucky effect upon the delicate nerves of my fair enslaver  and then withdrew into the thicket  where I could hear their discourse  and suit myself to the circumstances of the occasion —As they advanced  I observed an air of melancholy in the countenance of Narcissa  blended with such unspeakable sweetness  that I could scarce refrain from flying into her arms  and kissing away the pearly drop that stood collected in each bewitching eye  According to my expectation  she entered the alcove  and perceiving something on the table  took it up  No sooner did she cast her eye upon the features  than she startled  crying    Gracious God    and the roses instantly vanished from her cheeks —Her confidante  alarm d at this exclamation  looked at the picture  and  struck with the resemblance  cried    O Jesus  the very features of Mr  Random    Narcissa having recollected herself a little  said    Whatever angel brought it hither as a comfort to me in my affliction  I am thankful for the benefit  and will preserve it as the dearest object of my care    So saying  she kissed it with surprising ardour  shed a flood of tears  and then deposited the lifeless image in her lovely bosom  Transported at these symptoms of her unaltered affection  I was about to throw myself at her feet  when Miss Williams  whose reflection was less engaged than that of her mistress  observed  that the picture could not transport itself hither  and that she could not help thinking I was not far off —The gentle Narcissa   318 starting at this conjecture  answered    Heaven forbid  for although nothing in the universe could yield me satisfaction equal to that of his presence for one poor moment  in a proper place  I would rather forfeit his company—almost for ever  than see him here  where his life would be exposed to so much danger  —  I could no longer restrain the impulse of my passion  but breaking from my concealment  stood before her  when she uttered a fearful shriek  and fainted in the arms of her companion  I flew towards the treasure of my soul  clasped her in my embrace  and with the warmth of my kisses  brought her again to life  O  that I were endowed with the expression of a Raphael  the graces of a Guido  the magick touches of a Titian  that I might represent the fond concern  the chastened rapture  and ingenuous blush that mingled on her beauteous face  when she opened her eyes upon me  and pronounced    O heavens  is it you      I am afraid I have already encroached upon the reader s patience  with the particulars of this amour  on which  I own  I cannot help being impertinently circumstantial  I shall therefore omit the less material passages of this interview  during which I convinced her reason  tho  I could not appease the sad presages of her love  with regard to the long voyage  and dangers I must undergo —When we had spent an hour  which was all she could spare from the barbarity of her brother s vigilance  in lamenting over our hard fate  and in repeating our reciprocal vows  Miss Williams reminded us of the necessity there was for our immediate parting  and sure  lovers never parted with such sorrow and reluctance as we    319 But because my
