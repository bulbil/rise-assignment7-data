is preparing to follow you        to London with all possible expedition  I once had thoughts of        accompanying him  but have since thought it proper to have Sir        Ralph Trusty s advice in something I have a mind to do  and for        that purpose shall take a journey into L    e  as soon as I receive        remittances from Mr  Goodman  to pay off some trifling debts I        have contracted here  and defray my travelling expences  so that if        things happen as I wish they may  my friend s passion will have        made a considerable progress before I see you            Indeed  my dear sister  if you have not already seen a man whose        person you like better  you can never have an offer that promises        more felicity  he left the college soon after I came into it         beloved and respected by all that knew him  for his discreet        behaviour  humanity  and affability  he went afterwards on his        travels  and brought home with him all the accomplishments of the        several countries he had been in  without being the least tainted        with the vices or fopperies of any of them  he has a much larger        estate than your fortune could expect  unincumbered with debts         mortgages  or poor relations  his family is ancient  and  by the        mother s side  honourable  but  above all  he has sense  honour         and good nature  rare qualities  which  in my opinion  cannot fail        of making him an excellent husband  whenever he comes to be such            But I shall leave him to plead his own cause  and you to follow        your own inclinations  I am  with the most unfeigned good wishes         my dear sister  your affectionate brother  and humble servant            F  THOUGHTLESS            P S  Mr  Trueworth knows nothing of my writing to you in his        behalf  so you are at liberty to receive him as you shall think        proper        Miss Betsy required no less a cordial than this to revive her spirits    pretty much depressed since her ill usage at Oxford       She had not time  however  to indulge the pleasure of reflecting on this   new triumph  on her first receiving the news of it  Lady Mellasin had   set that evening apart to make a grand visit to a person of her   acquaintance  who was just married  the young ladies were to accompany   her  and Miss Betsy was in the midst of the hurry of dressing when the   post brought the letter  so she only looked it carelessly over  and   locked it in her cabinet till she should have more leisure for the   examination  They were all ready  the coach with the best hammer cloth   and harnesses was at the door  and only waited while Mrs  Prinks was   drawing on her lady s gloves  which happened to be a little too tight       In this unlucky instant one of the footmen came running into the   parlour  and told Lady Mellasin that there was a very ill looking woman   at the door  who enquired for her ladyship  and that she must needs   speak with her  and that she had a letter to deliver  which she would   give into nobody s hand but her own  Lady Mellasin seemed a little angry   at the insolence and folly of the creature  as she then termed it  but   ordered she should be shewed into the back parlour  they were not above   five minutes together before the woman went away  and Lady Mellasin   returned to the room where Miss Betsy and Miss Flora were waiting for   her  A confusion not to be described sat on every feature in her face    she looked pale  she trembled  and having told the young ladies   something had happened which prevented her going where she intended    flew up into her dressing room  followed by Mrs  Prinks  who appeared   very much alarmed at seeing her ladyship in this disorder
