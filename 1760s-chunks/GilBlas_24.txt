intelligence was not lost upon me  I was at Seville in a twinkling  to administer in due form and order to his effects  but the tables were turned  My mother had paid the debt of nature  and in her last agonies had been so much off her guard as to confess the whole affair to the curate of the village and other competent witnesses  Don Rodrigo s son had already taken my place  or rather his own  and his popularity was increased by the deficiency of mine  so that as the trumps were all out in that hand  and I had no particular wish for the present my wife was likely to make me  I joined issue with some desperate blades  with whom I began my trading ventures   The young cut purse having finished his story  another told us that he was the son of a merchant at Burgos  that  in his youth  prompted more by piety than wit  he had taken the religious habit and professed in a very strict order  and that a few years afterwards he had apostatized  In short  the eight robbers told their tale one after another  and when I had heard them all  I did not wonder that the destinies had brought them together  The conversation now took a different turn  They brought several schemes upon the carpet for the next campaign  and after having laid down their plan of operations  rose from table and went to bed  They lighted their night candles  and withdrew to their apartments  I attended Captain Rolando to his  While I was fiddling about him as he undressed  Well  Gil Blas  said he  you see how we live  We are always merry  hatred and envy have no footing here  we have not the least difference  but hang together just like monks  You are sure  my good lad  to lead a pleasant life here  for I do not think you are fool enough to make any bones about consorting with gentlemen of the road  In what does ours differ from many a more reputable trade  Depend on it  my friend  all men love two hands in their neighbour s purse  though only one in their own  Men s principles are all alike  the only difference lies in the mode of carrying them into effect  Conquerors  for instance  make free with the territories of their neighbours  People of fashion borrow and do not pay  Bankers  treasurers  brokers  clerks  and traders of all kinds  wholesale and retail  give ample liberty to their wants to overdraw on their consciences  I shall not mention the hangers on of the law  we all know how it goes with them  At the same time it must be allowed that they have more humanity than we have  for as it is often our vocation to take away the life of the innocent for plunder  it is sometimes theirs for fee and reward to save the guilty       CH  VI     The attempt of Gil Blas to escape  and its success   AFTER the captain of the banditti had thus apologized for adopting such a line of life  he went to bed  For my part  I returned to the hall  where I cleared the table  and set everything to rights  Then I went to the kitchen  where Domingo  the old negro  and dame Leonarda had been expecting me at supper  Though entirely without appetite  I had the good manners to sit down with them  Not a morsel could I eat  and  as I scarcely felt more miserable than I looked  this pair so justly formed to meet by nature  undertook to give me a little comfort  Why do you take on so  my good lad  said the old dowager  you ought rather to bless your stars for your good luck  You are young  and seem a little soft  you would have a fine kettle of fish of it in the busy world  You might have fallen into bad hands  and then your morals would have been corrupted  whereas here your innocence is insured to its full value  Dame Leonarda is in the right  put in the old negro gravely  the world is but a troublesome place  Be thankful  my friend  for being so early relieved from the dangers  the difficulties  and the afflictions of this miserable life   I bore this prosing very quietly  because I should have got no good by putting myself in a passion about it  At length Domingo  after playing a good knife and fork  and getting gloriously muddled  took himself off to the stable  Leonarda  by the glimmering of a lamp  showed me the way to a vault which served as a last home to those of the corps who died a natural death  Here I stumbled upon something more like a grave than a bed  This is your room  said she  Your predecessor lay here as long as he was among us  and here he lies to this day  He suffered himself to be hurried out of life in his prime  do not you be so foolish as to follow his example  With this kind advice  she left me with the lamp for my companion and returned to the kitchen  I
