their poor father in  a few days before  He is an honest careful fellow  continued Mr Faulkland  and has lived in my family from a boy  He was married to a good sort of a body  who took great care of these children  and helped to maintain them decently by her work  The poor woman died in childbed last week  and the person who attended her in her illness  for she had no servant  took that opportunity of robbing the lodgings  and after plundering the poor creature of every thing that was worth carrying away  locked up those two children  which you saw with me  and the new born infant  with the corpse of their mother   The poor little wretches continued in that dismal situation all night  having cried themselves to sleep  without being heard  though there were some other people in the house  The morning following I happened to make an early visit in the neighbourhood of this distressed little family  and my coachman  who was a very affectionate husband and father  took that opportunity of calling on his wife whom he had not been able to see for three days  The cries of his children  now awake and almost starved  obliged him hastily to break open the room door  where the poor fellow was shocked with the dismal spectacle of his wife lying breathless in her bed  the infant almost    expiring at her side  and the other two poor little famished creatures calling to their dead mother for bread   The sight almost deprived the man of his senses  He snatched up his two eldest children in his arms  and ran raving to the house where I was  tearing his hair like a madman  He told me his mournful story  with which I was so affected  that I ordered one of my footmen to carry the two children home to my house directly  and desired their father to look out for some body to take care of the young one  which he soon did   The honest poor fellow was delighted  when he came home  to find his two children well and merry  for they were sensible of no want but their food  But his grief returned on him with great violence at the thoughts of his being obliged to put them into the hands of people  who  he said  he was sure would not be so kind to them as their own poor mother had been  and my man told me he did nothing but kiss them  and cry over them the whole day  To make his mind easy at once  I let him know they should remain here under his own eye  till they were old enough to be put to school  and accordingly directed my housekeeper to see that they were taken care of  which has made their father very happy   The little rogues have found their way up to me  and I love some times to hear them prattle  but this morning the eldest having told me a lye of his brother  I was checking him for it when you came in   My mother was so pleased with Mr Faulkland’s conduct in his little history  that she repeated it to me word for word as soon as she came home  and concluded with observing  how good a creature Mr Faulkland must be  who in so tender a manner interested himself in his poor servant’s misfortune  Most young gentlemen  said she  would have thought they had done enough in giving the servant money to have provided for his children how he could  it is in such trifles as these that we often discover the excellence of the heart   You will suppose  my dear  that I am not displeased at any circumstance that can raise Mr Faulkland’s character in my pious mother’s esteem  I heard the story with great pleasure  but not making any comments on it  Sir George  who was present at the relation   said  Well  Sidney  you are either very affected  or the greatest stoic in the world  why  any other girl would be in raptures at such a proof of the honest tenderness of that heart which she knows she possesses intirely  and on which the whole of her future happiness depends  I am very sensible of Mr Faulkland’s worth     brother  I replied  and I can feel without being transported  I will be hanged  said Sir George  if I think you love Faulkland  at least not half as well as he deserves  and I dare swear you have not been honest enough to tell him yet whether you do or not  It is time enough for that  I replied  if Mr Faulkland and I should be married  I hope I shall give him no cause to complain of my want of affection   If you marry  said my brother  I know of no possible ifs  unless they are of your own making  I know of none neither  answered my mother  yet I think Sidney is in the right to be doubtful about all human events  Many things  added she gravely  for she has a great veneration for old sayings   fall out between the cup and the lip   I think  mother  said Sir George  bluntly  you were disappointed in your
