this fellow  and   see what he saunters there for  And  Nan  do you and madam stay at the   gate       So they opened the iron gate and walked down towards the man  and   guessing the woman  if employed  must mean something by the tuft of   grass  I cast my eye that way  whence she pulled it  and saw more grass   seemingly pulled up  then I doubted not something was there for me  and   I walked to it  and standing over it  said to Nan  That s a pretty sort   of wild flower  that grows yonder  near the elm  the fifth from us on   the left  pray pull it for me  Said she  It is a common weed  Well  said   I  but pull it for me  there are sometimes beautiful colours in a weed       While she went on  I stooped  and pulled up a good handful of the grass    and in it a bit of paper  which I put instantly in my bosom  and dropt   the grass  and my heart went pit a pat at the odd adventure  Said I    Let s go in  Mrs  Anne  No  said she  we must stay till Mrs  Jewkes   comes       I was all impatience to read this paper  and when Colbrand and she   returned  I went in  Said she  Certainly there is some reason for my   master s caution  I can make nothing of this sauntering fellow  but    to be sure  there was some roguery in the gipsy  Well  said I  if there   was  she lost her aim  you see  Ay  very true  said she  but that was   owing to my watchfulness  and you was very good to go away  when I spoke   to you       I hastened up stairs to my closet  and found the billet to contain  in a   hand that seemed disguised  and bad spelling  the following words           Twenty contrivances have been thought of to let you know your danger    but all have proved in vain  Your friends hope it is not yet too late   to give you this caution  if it reaches your hands  The  squire is   absolutely determined to ruin you  and  because he despairs of any other   way  he will pretend great love and kindness to you  and that he will   marry you  You may expect a parson  for this purpose  in a few days  but   it is a sly artful fellow  of a broken attorney  that he has hired to   personate a minister  The man has a broad face  pitted much with the   small pox  and is a very great companion  So take care of yourself    Doubt not this advice  Perhaps you ll have had but too much reason   already to confirm you in the truth of it  From your zealous   well wisher   SOMEBODY           Now  my dear father and mother  what shall we say of this truly   diabolical master  O  how shall I find words to paint my griefs  and his   deceit  I have as good as confessed I love him  but  indeed  it was on   supposing him good   This  however  has given him too much advantage    But now I will break this wicked forward heart of mine  if it will not   be taught to hate him  O  what a black dismal heart must he have  So   here is a plot to ruin me  and by my own consent to   No wonder he did   not improve his wicked opportunities   which I thought owing to remorse   for his sin  and compassion for me   when he had such a project as   this in reserve   Here should I have been deluded with the hopes of a   happiness that my highest ambition could have had aspired to   But   how dreadful must have been my lot  when I had found myself an undone   creature  and a guilty harlot  instead of a lawful wife  Oh  this is   indeed too much  too much  for your poor Pamela to support  This is the   worse  as I hoped all the worst was over  and that I had the pleasure of   beholding a reclaimed man  and not an abandoned libertine  What now must   your poor daughter do  Now all her hopes are dashed  And if this fails   him  then comes  to be sure  my forced disgrace  for this shews he will   never leave till he has ruined me  O  the wretched  wretched Pamela
