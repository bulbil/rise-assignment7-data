leaves  for some time  an unsteadiness in the mind  My absence  as I proposed to settle in my native country  never more  perhaps  to return to Italy  the high notions she has of obligation and gratitude  her declared confidence in my honour and affection  all co operating  she may  thought I  change her mind  and if she does  I cannot doubt the favour of her friends  It was not  my Jeronymo  presumptuous to hope  It was justice to Clementina to attend the event  and to wait for the promised Letter  But now  that I see you are all of one mind  and that the dear Lady  tho  vehemently urged by all her friends to marry some other man  can appeal to me  only as to her fourth Brother  and a man not interested in the event—I give up all my hopes   I have written accordingly to your dear Clementina  but it could not be expected  that I should give the argument all the weight that might be given it  Yet  being of opinion that she was in duty obliged to yield to the entreaties of all her friends  I have been honest  But surely no man ever was involved in so many difficult situations as your Grandison  who yet never  by enterprize or rashness  was led out of the plain path into difficulties so uncommon   You wish  my dear friend  that I would set an example to your excellent sister  I will unbosom my heart to you   There is a Lady  an English Lady  beautiful as an Angel  but whose beauty is her least perfection  either in my eyes  or her own  Had I never known Clementina  I could not have loved her  and only her  of all the women I ever beheld  It would not be doing her   15 justice  if I could not say  I do love her  but with a flame as pure as the heart of Clementina  or as her own heart  can boast  Clementina s distressed mind affected me  I imputed her sufferings to her esteem for me  The farewel interview denied her  she demonstrated  I thought  so firm an affection for me  at the same time that she was to me  what I may truly call  a first Love  that  tho▪ the difficulties in my way seemed insuperable  I thought it became me  in honour  in gratitude  to hold myself in suspense  and not offer to make my addresses to any other woman  till the destiny of the dear Clementina was determined   It would look like vanity in me to tell my Jeronymo how many proposals  from the partial friends of women of rank and merit superior to my own  I thought myself obliged  in honour to the Ladies themselves  to decline  But my heart never suffered uneasiness from the uncertainty I was in of ever succeeding with your beloved sister  but on this Lady s account  I presume not  however  to say  I could have succeeded  had I thought myself at liberty to make my addresses to her  Yet  when I suffered myself to balance  because of my uncertainty with your Clementina  I had hopes  from the interest my two sisters had with her  her affections disengaged   that  had I been at liberty to make my addresses to her  I might   Shall I  my dear Jeronymo  own the truth —The two noblest minded women in the world  when I went over to Italy  on the invitation of my Lord the Bishop  held almost an equal interest in my heart  and I was thereby enabled justly  and with the greater command of myself  to declare to the Marchioness  and the General  at my last going over  that I held myself bound to you  but that your sister  and you all  were free  But when the dear Clementina began to shew signs of recovery  and seemed to confirm the hopes I had of her partiality to me  and my gratitude and attachment seemed of importance to her complete   16 restoration  then  my Jeronymo  did I content myself with wishing another husband to the English Lady  more worthy of her than my embarassed situation could have made me  And when I farther experienced the condescending goodness of your whole family  all united in my favour  I had not a wish but for your Clementina   What a disappointment  my Jeronymo  was her rejection of me  obliged  as I was  to admire the noble Lady the more for her motives of rejecting me   And now  my dear friend  what is your wish —That I shall set your sister an example  How can I  Is marriage in my power  There is but one woman in the world  now your dear Clementina has refused me  that I can think worthy of succeeding her in my affections  tho  there are thousands of whom I am not worthy  And ought that Lady to accept of a man whose heart had been another s  and that other living  and single  and still honouring him with so much of her regard  as may be thought sufficient to attach a grateful heart
