father s  In the latter cases  youth and passion might afford his crime some shadow of palliation  whereas  in the former  his schemes are so tedious and refined  that they become utterly repugnant to the fire of youth  and the fury of passion  and indicate either the most palpable villiany of heart  or the most palpable want of inclination    155 His reason too for delaying to marry the woman he loves is a pleasant one  he fears she is actually virtuous  O  Charles  how opposite is the motive of my conduct  but hush  recollection  down busy devil  down—I have waked a scorpion in that retrospect  which stings me to distraction   Your letter  Charles  is  as you justly call it  a very dull one  however  you are a happy fellow to make even your stupidity a means of shewing your understanding  My sister Haversham  without the advantage of your extensive erudition  writes fifty times more to the purpose  though I dare say you think her infinitely your inferior  both as to elegance of stile and energy of argument  Don t  however  be offended at the justice I do her in this place  for you are a mighty favourite with her ladyship    156 and  I dare say  may  in time  aspire at a match with her—Abigail Harper   Notwithstanding these attempts to be merry  I am fearful my endeavours at a joke will be to the full as unfortunate as your endeavours at letter writing  I shall not  like you  however  make the ridiculous parade of an apology  the business of this scrawl is to beg you will instantly go to lady Haversham s  and inform her I am every thing she could wish me—that I shall set off to morrow morning for London  and be with her by breakfast  In the mean time  if she would contrive to see Louisa  who must be in town by this  it would oblige me highly  as I know an interview between them would pave the readiest way to a reconciliation  Perhaps  Miss Mildmay  when she finds my sister so strenuous  and sees how ready I am myself to heal this unlucky breach  may give herself   157 some airs  and think of treating me with indifference—If she should  by Heaven—Yet  surely  I have deserved not only her indifference  but her scorn  have I not cruelly exposed her to the ridicule of the whole world  and the resentment of her whole family —Have I not equally endangered her reputation and her life  destroyed her fortune  and blasted her felicity —Yes  Melmoth  I have deserved not only her scorn but her absolute detetestation  I am astonished  when I review the state of the case  how I could be weak enough to prefer a number of the most affecting evils  to the precarious hazard at worst of a single misfortune  Mrs  Mildmay s letter cost me many tears  and I could not read lady Haversham s without an equal mixture of shame and distress  that worthiest  noblest of women  Charles  is entitled to every return both of my gratitude and affection  had it not been   158 for her indefatigable industry  even in opposition to the manifest call of her interest  and the dictates of her love  my father you know  would have disinherited me  Her marriage with lord Haversham  a man three times older than herself  was the price of my pardon  and yet  at the same time that Theodosia yielded to this match for my preservation  I knew her whole soul was devoted to my old friend Sir Edward Wilmington  Poor Sir Edward fell in the glorious affair of Minden  and  though I never hinted the circumstance to you before  yet he sacrificed himself on that memorable day  by running into unnecessary dangers merely through his incapacity to survive the loss of my sister—And does not this sister  Melmoth  deserve every thing at my hands —Go instantly to her  when you read this  and tell her  that  for the remainder of my days  I shall be entirely guided by her directions  tell her  that    159 without the continuation of her friendship  I never can be happy  and  that next to the forgiveness of the Deity himself  her s is the most essential requisite to my felicity  I blush  Melmoth  to be outdone in generosity  but this exalted woman always threw me at a distance  and  from my infancy up  continually excited both my envy and my admiration  You see  that  in all this readiness of acquiescence  Charles  I never once insinuate the pleasure it will necessarily give myself to make up matters with Louisa  nevertheless  my heart is transported at the thought  and I even love my friends the better for thus taking part against my pride  in favour of my inclination   The hints which you insinuate relative to consequences  Charles  in case I do not accommodate with the Mildmay family  would give me but little uneasiness    160 was I ever so pitiful a paltroon  and ever so much disinclined to the match  Colonel Mildmay is a young fellow of spirit  but he is also a man of understanding  he must therefore see
