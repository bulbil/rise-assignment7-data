seen a lady who seem d to shudder at a breeze in her own apartment  appear half naked in the streets  Farewell   LETTER IV  To the same   THE English seem as silent as the Japonese  yet vainer than the inhabitants of Siam  Upon my arrival I attributed that reserve to modesty  which I now find has its origin in pride  Condescend to address them first  and you are sure of their acquaintance  stoop to flattery  and you conciliate their friendship and esteem  They bear hunger  cold  fatigue  and all the miseries of life without shrinking  danger only calls forth their fortitude  they even exult in calamity  but contempt is what they cannot bear  An Englishman fears contempt more than death  he often flies to death as a refuge from its pressure  and dies when he fancies the world has ceased to esteem him   Pride seems the source not only of their national vices  but of their national virtues also  An Englishman is taught to love his king as his friend    11 but to acknowledge no other master than the laws which himself has contributed to enact  He despises those nations  who  that one may be free  are all content to be slaves  who first lift a tyrant into terror  and then shrink under his power as if delegated from heaven  Liberty is echoed in all their assemblies  and thousands might be found ready to offer up their lives for the sound  though perhaps not one of all the number understands its meaning  The lowest mechanic however looks upon it as his duty to be a watchful guardian of his country s freedom  and often uses a language that might seem haughty  even in the mouth of the great emperor who traces his ancestry to the moon   A few days ago  passing by one of their prisons  I could not avoid stopping  in order to listen to a dialogue which I thought might afford me some entertainment  The conversation was carried on between a debtor through the grate of his prison  a porter  who had stopped to rest his burthen  and a soldier at the window  The subject was upon a threatened invasion from France  and each seemed extreamly anxious to rescue his country from the impending danger   For my part  cries the prisoner  the greatest of my apprehensions is for our freedom  if the French should conquer  what would become of English liberty  My dear Friends  liberty is the Englishman s prerogotive  we must preserve that at the expence of our lives  of that the French shall never deprive us  it is not to be expected that men who are slaves themselves would preserve our freedom should they happen to conquer  Ay  slaves  cries the porter  they are all slaves  fit only to carry burthens every one of them  Before I would stoop to slavery  may this be my poison  and he   12 held the goblet in his hand  may this be my poison—but I would sooner list for a soldier    The soldier taking the goblet from his friend  with much awe fervently cried out  It is not so much our liberties as our religion that would suffer by such a change  Ay  our religion  my lads  May the Devil sink me into flames   such was the solemnity of his adjuration  if the French should come over  but our religion would be utterly undone  So saying  instead of a libation  he applied the goblet to his lips  and confirmed his sentiments with a ceremony of the most persevering devotion   In short  every man here pretends to be a politician  even the fair sex are sometimes found to mix the severity of national altercation  with the blandishments of love  and often become conquerors by more weapons of destruction than their eyes   This universal passion for politics is gratified by Daily Gazettes  as with us at China  But as in ours  the emperor endeavours to instruct his people  in theirs the people endeavour to instruct the administration  You must not  however  imagine  that they who compile these papers have any actual knowledge of the politics  or the government of a state  they only collect their materials from the oracle of some coffee house  which oracle has himself gathered them the night before from a beau at a gaming table  who has pillaged his knowledge from a great man s porter  who has had his information from the great man s gentleman  who has invented the whole story for his own amusement the night preceding     13The English in general seem fonder of gaining the esteem than the love of those they converse with  this gives a formality to their amusements  their gayest conversations have something too wise for innocent relaxation  though in company you are seldom disgusted with the absurdity of a fool  you are seldom lifted into rapture by those strokes of vivacity which give instant  though not permanent pleasure   What they want  however  in gaiety  they make up in politeness  You smile at hearing me praise the English for their politeness  you who have heard very different accounts from the missionaries at Pekin  who have seen such a different behaviour in their merchants and seamen at home  But I must still
