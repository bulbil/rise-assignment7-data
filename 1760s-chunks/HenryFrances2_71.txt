for an Ant  or a Straw  which gave you Occasion to exercise your own Reflections  would answer the End as well  Give but fair Play to the ingenuous Nature inhabiting thy Breast  my proudest Mansion  and all human Learning were superfluous to thee  Happy for Mankind  if Arts and Sciences were merely so  As all States thrive best upon their proper Forces  so these  like Auxiliaries  tho  called in as Friends  often remain as Tyrants   I am well  Amen to you   Fielding  in the second Page of this Paper  has rendered the decens of Horace too literally  In the Original  it comprehends all the higher Morals  but  in the Translation  it means no more than what the French stile Les petites Morales   LETTER CCXC   THOUGH you caution me about speaking my Opinion freely about Elfrida  I must not be confined or restrained by any Thing  but my own Judgment  as far as that will go   The Author s prefatory Letters shew him to be a better Critic  than his Work shews him Page  269 to be a Poet  There are some pretty Turns  which any one  who imitates  may write  But the Soul of Poetry is wanting  which I am certain of  from my not feeling  through the whole  and a Work must be very slight and insipid  which amuses only the Fancy  without affecting the Heart  I will not allow any Thing to make us wiser  which does not make us better  and the cold inanimate Contemplation of moral Beauty is not sufficient for this  He  who said  Virtue need but be seen  to be adored  expressed himself but faintly  I say  she must be felt   But to return — Orgar is a vile  unnatural Brute  who would prostitute his Daughter to the Honour of being a King s Mistress  Athelwold is but a poor Character thro  the whole  and  as to Elfrida  I will not compliment her so much  to say there is any Parity between your Sentiments and her s  She seems  in her first Speech  to be picqued  in Pride  that she is not more publickly manifested to the World  talks high of Orgar s Daughter  Courts   c  I think her rather like Semele  than you  and that impatient Temper of her s  jealous of his Love in Absence  and  not without Murmur  submitting to the Prudence of concealing their Marriage  perhaps drew upon her that Judgment of Providence  which destroyed her Husband  and rendered her miserable  I think the Stile very Page  270 indifferent  and  in some Places  mean and absurd  One or two of the Heroes  I think  says  Sdeath  which is not a Word in the English Dictionary   Adieu  my dear Pet  May you never have Elfrida s Fate  though I would rather you had that than Semele s   I met Yesterday with Bolingbroke s Letters upon the Method and Use of reading History   c  I have gone through but the two first Letters  I like them extremely  but dare not say they are sensible and clever  because I have several times spoke and wrote to you upon this Subject  and have often inculcated that we misapply our Study Leisure extremely  who read for mere Amusement  or even Theory Contemplation  Such Persons may be said to study  as the College Lad expressed himself  by an happy Blunder    I read six Hours a Day  and no one is the wiser     I think such a Man may as well be asleep  for he can only be said to have pleasant Dreams  who reads any Thing  but with a View of improving his Morals  or regulating his Conduct  I mean Men  who are happy enough to be under no Necessity of reading  but for themselves  for Arts and Sciences must be studied by some People for the useful Purposes of Life  Adieu   Henry   Page  271  LETTER CCXCI   My Pet   I DO not remember what I said in the Letter  which inclosed you Fielding s Essay  but am certain  from the Tenor of my Opinion of you  that I did not mean to reprimand you for the Misapplication of your Time  in reading Books of Amusement only  When I speak of Sense  Honour  or Virtue  you ought to understand it as a Compliment  a just one  to you  not meant to upbraid you for the Want of these Excellencies  Why am I eternally mistaken   You say  that the present Uneasiness of your Mind calls for Amusement  I should think  that Amusements were fitter for a Mind at Ease  Irksome Thoughts are not to be relieved by Trifles  and it requires high Studies  and deep Reflections  to divert us from present Ills  or melancholy Prospects  But let Amusement be the Word  Will not Shakespeare s Plays amuse you better than Durfey s  and would you not find better Entertainment in the Spectator than the Rambler  No Boarding School Girl reads more for Amusement  than I do  I would have you do so too  For I know very well
