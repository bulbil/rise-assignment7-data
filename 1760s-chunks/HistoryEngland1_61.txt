solemnly debated in the House of Peers  each side produced their reasons for or against the conqueror  This was the first time that a true spirit of liberty ever appeared to exert itself in England  and in which victory did not determine every inquiry  The Duke of York  though a conqueror  could not entirely gain his cause  it was determined that Henry should possess the throne during life  and that the Duke of York should be his successor  to the utter seclusion of the Prince of Wales     179 The Queen  to all appearance  seemed now utterly destitute of every resource  but  though she had lost all  she yet retained her native perseverance and intrepidity  She was a woman of a great mind  and some faults  but ambition seemed to be what called them into action  Being now a fugitive  distant from the capital  opposed by a victorious army  and a consummate General  she still tried every resource to repair her disastrous circumstances  she flew to Wales  animated her old friends  acquired new  and raised an army to defend her cause  She  and her old enemy  the Duke of York  once more met upon Wakefield Green  near the castle of Sandal  fortune this day turned the victory on her side  the Duke of York was slain  the Duke of Rutland  his second son  fell in the flight  and the father s head  being cut off  was fixed upon the walls of York   Margaret  being now victorious  marched towards London  in order to give the King his liberty  The Earl of Warwick  who now was at the head of the Yorkists  still commanded an army  in which he led about the captive King to give a sanction to his attempts  Another battle was to drench the kingdom with the blood of its inhabitants  the Queen and the Earl met near St  Alban s  where the Queen was now again victorious  she had the pleasure to see the General  by whom she was once defeated  now fly in his turn  and  what added to her glory  she had the fortune to release the King  her husband  from his captivity  Her triumph was great  though contaminated with cruelty  but it was of short continuance  The city of London was to be gained  but Warwick had already secured it in his interests  the citizens also feared her tumultuous army  and   180 refused to open their gates upon her summons  In the mean time  Warwick assembled the people in St  John s fields  and  shewing them the son of the late Duke of York  demanded  Whether they chose to have him or Henry for their King  Upon which  the people crying out a York  an assembly was quickly called  and the young Duke  being present  they elected him King  by the name of Edward IV  and conducted him  with great ceremony  to the palace where Henry used to lodge when within the walls of the city   In the mean time  Queen Margaret collected a great army in the North  amounting to sixty thousand men at arms  She was now to strike her strongest blow  the command of this army was given to a person who acted under her directions  On the other side Warwick conducted young Edward  at the head of forty thousand men  to oppose her  Both sides  at length  met near Santon in the county of York  never was England depopulated by so terrible a day  What a dreadful sight to behold almost an hundred thousand men  of the same country  fighting to satisfy the empty ambition of one or two weak and empty wretches  murdering each other for an ideot and a boy  the contest only which should wear a crown with diamonds  or wield an empty sceptre  Strange infatuation  yet  such as it was  not less than forty thousand men were left dead upon the field  in asserting this dispute  Warwick gained a complete victory  Edward IV  was established on the throne  and Margaret of Anjou abandoned  She fled  for protection  to Scotland  with her son and husband  in order to attempt new designs for the recovery of her kingdom  Edward now took down the head of his father from the walls of York  and put up the   181 heads of the conquered Generals in its stead  Each party  as it happened to be victorious  thus called in the executioner to complete the tragedy begun in the field  and our cruelty to each other  in civil discords  is what has impressed foreigners with an idea of English cruelty   Though wretched as this reign was  yet the art of printing  which was introduced into it at that time  seemed to make amends for a part of its calamities  William Caxton  a mercer  was the first who practised the art at London  he translated some books himself from the French  and printed the translations of others  Among the writers of that time were Lord Rivers and Earl Tiptoft  whose labours  however  never ventured higher than translation  To judge of the learning of those times by the works of the laity in the vulgar tongue  we shall entertain the
