   cried he    that I am in some measure culpable  for I think I see here   looking at my son Moses    one that I have injured  and by whom I wish to be forgiven    Page  110  My son immediately recollected his voice and features  though he had before seen him in disguise  and taking him by the hand  with a smile forgave him      Yet    continued he    I can t help wondering at what you could see in my face  to think me a proper mark for deception     My dear sir    returned the other    it was not your face  but your white stockings and the black ribband in your hair  that allured me  But no disparagement to your parts  I have deceived wiser men than you in my time  and yet  with all my tricks  the blockheads have been too many for me at last     I suppose    cried my son    that the narrative of such a life as yours must be extremely instructive and amusing     Not much of either    returned Mr  Jenkinson    Those relations which describe  Page  111  the tricks and vices only of mankind  by increasing our suspicion in life  retard our success  The traveller that distrusts every person he meets  and turns back upon the appearance of every man that looks like a robber  seldom arrives in time to his journey s end     Indeed I think from my own experience I may say  that the knowing one is the silliest fellow under the sun  I was thought cunning from my very childhood  when but seven years old the ladies would say that I was a perfect little man  at fourteen I knew the world  cocked my hat  and loved the ladies  at twenty  though I was perfectly honest  yet every one thought me so cunning  that not one would trust me  Thus I was at last obliged to turn sharper in my own defence  and have lived ever since  my head throbbing with  Page  112  schemes to deceive  and my heart palpitating with fears of detection     I used often to laugh at your honest simple neighbour Flamborough  and one way or another generally cheated him once a year  Yet still the honest man went forward without suspicion  and grew rich  while I still continued tricksy and cunning  and was poor  without the consolation of being honest     However    continued he    let me know your case  and what has brought you here  perhaps though I have not skill to avoid a gaol myself  I may extricate my friends    In compliance with his curiosity  I informed him of the whole train of accidents and follies that had plunged me into my present troubles  and my utter inabilty to get free     Page  113  After hearing my story  and pausing some minutes  he slapt his forehead  as if he had hit upon something material  and took his leave  saying he would try what could be done     Page   unnumbered   CHAP  VIII     The same subject continued     THE next morning I communicated to my wife and children the scheme I had planned of reforming the prisoners  which they received with universal disapprobation  alledging the impossibility and impropriety of it  adding  that my endeavours would no way contribute to their amendment  but might probably disgrace my calling      Excuse me    returned I    these people  however fallen  are still men  and that is a very good title to my affections  Good council rejected returns to enrich  Page  116  the giver s bosom  and though the instruction I communicate may not mend them  yet it will assuredly mend myself  If these wretches  my children  were princes  there would be thousands ready to offer their ministry  but  in my opinion  the heart that is buried in a dungeon is as precious as that seated upon a throne  Yes  my treasures  if I can mend them I will  perhaps they will not all despise me  Perhaps I may catch up even one from the gulph  and that will be great gain  for is there upon earth a gem so precious as the human soul    Thus saying  I left them  and descended to the common prison  where I found the prisoners very merry  expecting my arrival  and each prepared with some gaol trick to play upon the doctor  Thus  as I was going to begin  one turned my wig awry  as if by accident  and then asked my pardon   Page  117  A second  who stood at some distance  had a knack of spitting through his teeth  which fell in showers upon my book  A third would cry amen in such an affected tone as gave the rest great delight  A fourth had slily picked my pocket of my spectacles  But there was one whose trick gave more
