by sousing it in water as cold as ice     Yes   replied the doctor    downright murder  I affirm     I see you are a person of great learning  and sagacity   said the other   and I must beg you will be so good as  to signify your opinion in your own handwriting   The doctor immediately  complied with her request  and expressed himself upon a slip of paper to  this purpose          These are to certify whom it may concern  that I firmly      believe  and it is my unalterable opinion  that who soever      letteth an infant perish  by sousing it in cold water  even      though the said water should not be so cold as ice  is in      effect guilty of the murder of the said infant  as witness      my hand                           Comfit Colocynth    Having obtained this certificate  for which the physician was handsomely  acknowledged  she returned  exalting  and hoping  with such authority   to overthrow all opposition  Accordingly  next morning  when her nephew  was about to undergo his diurnal baptism  she produced the commission   whereby she conceived herself empowered to overrule such inhuman  proceedings  but she was disappointed in her expectation  confident as  it was  not that Mrs  Pickle pretended to differ in opinion from Dr   Colocynth   for whose character and sentiments   said she   I have such  veneration  that I shall carefully observe the caution implied in this  very certificate  by which  far from condemning my method of practice   he only asserts that killing is murder  an asseveration  the truth of  which  it is to be hoped  I shall never dispute    Mrs  Grizzle  who  sooth to say  had rather too superficially considered  the clause by which she thought herself authorized  perused the paper  with more accuracy  and was confounded at her own want of penetration   Yet  though she was confuted  she was by no means convinced that her  objections to the cold bath were unreasonable  on the contrary  after  having bestowed sundry opprobrious epithets on the physician  for his  want of knowledge and candour  she protested in the most earnest and  solemn manner the pernicious practice of dipping the child  a piece  of cruelty which  with God s assistance  she should never suffer to  be inflicted on her own issue  and washing her hands of the melancholy  consequence that would certainly ensue  shut herself up in her closet  to indulge her sorrow and vexation  She was deceived  however  in her  prognostic  The boy  instead of declining in point of health  seemed to  acquire fresh vigour from every plunge  as if he had been resolved to  discredit the wisdom and foresight of his aunt  who in all probability  could never forgive him for this want of reverence and respect  This  conjecture is founded upon her behaviour to him in the sequel of his  infancy  during which she was known to torture him more than once  when  she had opportunities of thrusting pins into his flesh  without any  danger of being detected  In short  her affections were in a little time  altogether alienated from this hope of her family  whom she abandoned to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the conduct of his mother  whose province it undoubtedly was to manage  the nurture of her own child  while she herself resumed her operations  upon the commodore  whom she was resoled at any rate to captivate and  enslave  And it must be owned that Mrs  Grizzle s knowledge of the human  heart never shone so conspicuous as in the methods she pursued for the  accomplishment of this important aim   Through the rough unpolished hulk that cased the soul of Trunnion  she  could easily distinguish a large share of that vanity and self conceit  that generally predominate even in the most savage beast  and to this  she constantly appealed  In his presence she always exclaimed against  the craft and dishonest dissimulation of the world  and never failed of  uttering particular invectives against those arts of chicanery in  which the lawyers are so conversant  to the prejudice and ruin of their  fellow creatures  observing that in a seafaring life  as far as she  had opportunities of judging or being informed  there was nothing but  friendship  sincerity  and a hearty contempt for everything that was  mean or selfish   This kind of conversation  with the assistance of certain particular  civilities  insensibly made an impression on the mind of the commodore   and the more effectual as his former prepossessions were built upon very  slender foundations  His antipathy to old maids  which he had conceived  upon hearsay  began gradually to diminish when he found they were not  quite such infernal animals as they
