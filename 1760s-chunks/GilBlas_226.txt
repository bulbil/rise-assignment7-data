to me with the smile of a satirist    These are copies which those mercenary things called actresses value much more highly than originals   I next acquainted her that the generous Portuguese  when giving me charge of the portrait  recommended it to my care by a purse of fifty pistoles  I beg you will accept of my congratulations  said she  this nobleman begins where it is even uncommon for others to leave off  It is to you  my divine creature  answered I  that this present is owing  the marquis only made it on the score of natural affection  I could be well pleased  replied she  that he were to make you a score such presents every day  I cannot express in what extravagance you are dear to me  From the first moment of our meeting  I became attached to you by so strong a tie  as time has not been able to dissolve  When I lost you at Madrid  I did not despair of finding you again  and yesterday  on your sudden appearance  I received you like a deodand  In a word  my friend  heaven has created us for one another  You shall be my husband  but we must get plenty of money in the first instance  I shall just lend myself out to three or four silly fellows more  and then you may live like a gentleman on your means   I thanked her in the most appropriate terms for such an instance of extreme condescension on my behalf  and we got insensibly into a conversation which lasted till noon  At that hour I withdrew  to go and give my master an account of the manner in which his present was received  Though Laura had given me no instructions thereupon  I was not remiss in composing a fine compliment on my way  with which I meant to launch out on her pan  but it was just so much flash in the pan  For  when I got home the marquis was gone out  and the fates had decreed that I should never see him more  for reasons which will be methodically stated in the succeeding chapter       CH  XI     A thunderbolt to Gil Blas   I REPAIRED to my inn  where meeting with two men of companionable talents  I dined and sat at table with them till the play began  We parted  they as their business and desire pointed them  and  for my own part  my bent was towards the theatre  It may be proper to observe by the way  that I had all possible reason to be in a good humour  The conversation with my chance companions had been joyous in the extreme  the colour of my fortune was gay and animating  yet for all that I could not help giving way to melancholy  without either knowing why  or being able to reason myself out of it  It was doubtless a prophetic warning of the misfortune which threatened me   As I entered the green room  Melchior Zapata came up  and told me in a low voice to follow him  He led me to an unfrequented part of the house  and opened his business thus    Worthy sir  I make it a point of conscience to give you a very serious warning  You are aware that the Marquis de Marialva had at first taken a fancy to Narcissa  my wife  he had even gone so far as to fix a day for trying the relish of my rib  when that cockatrice Estella contrived to flyblow the bill of fare  and transfer the banquet to her own untainted charms  Judge then  whether an actress can be gulled instead of gulling  and preserve the sweetness of her temper  My wife has taken it deeply to heart  and there is no species of revenge to which she would not have recourse  A fine opportunity has offered  Yesterday  if you recollect  all our supernumeraries were crowding together to see you  The deputy candle snuffer told some of the inferior comedians that he recollected you perfectly well  and that you might be anything but Estella s brother   This report  added Melchior  came to Narcissa s ears to day  she lost no time in questioning the author  and that grub of the interior stood to the whole story  He says that he knew you as Arsenia s servant  when Estella waited on her at Madrid under the name of Laura  My wife  full of glee at this discovery  means to acquaint the Marquis de Marialva with it  when he comes to the play this evening  so take your measures accordingly  If you are not Estella s brother in good earnest  I would advise you as a friend  and on the score of old acquaintance  to make your escape while your skin is whole  Narcissa  satisfied in her tender mercy with only one victim  and that of her own sex  has allowed me to give you this notice  that you may outrun your ill luck   It would have been waste of words to press the subject farther  I returned thanks for the caution to this fretter of his hour  who saw by my terrified aspect that I was not the man to give the deputy candle snuffer the lie  I did not feel the
