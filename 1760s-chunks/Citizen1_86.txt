poor  were very contented  Here  retired from   271 the gaze of the world  by the labour of her hands  she supported her parent  who was now incapable of supporting herself  While Catharina spun  the old woman would sit by  and read some book of devotion  thus when the fatigues of the day were over  both would sit down contentedly by their fire side  and enjoy the frugal meal with vacant festivity   Though her face and person were models of perfection  yet her whole attention seemed bestowed upon her mind  her mother taught her to read  and an old Lutheran minister instructed her in the maxims and duties of religion  Nature had furnished her not only with a ready but a solid turn of thought  not only with a strong but a right understanding  Such truly female accomplishments procured her several solicitations of marriage from the peasants of the country  but their offers were refused  for she loved her mother too tenderly to think of a separation   Catharina was fifteen when her mother died  she now therefore left her cottage  and went to live with the Lutheran minister  by whom she had been instructed from her childhood  In his house she resided  in quality of governess to his children  at once reconciling in her character unerring prudence with surprising vivacity   The old man  who regarded her as one of his own children  had her instructed in dancing and music by the masters who attended the rest of his family  thus she continued to improve till he died  by which accident she was once more reduced to pristine poverty  The country of Livonia was at this time wasted by war  and lay in a most miserable   272 state of desolation  Those calamities are ever most heavy upon the poor  wherefore Catharina  though possessed of so many accomplishments  experienced all the miseries of hopeless indigence  Provisions becoming every day more scarce  and her private stock being entirely exhausted  she resolved at last to travel to Marienburgh  a city of greater plenty   With her scanty wardrobe  packed up in a wallet  she set out on her journey on foot  she was to walk through a region miserable by nature  but rendered still more hideous by the Swedes and Russians  who  as each happened to become masters  plundered it at discretion  but hunger had taught her to despise the dangers and fatigues of the way   One evening  upon her journey  as she had entered a cottage by the way side  to take up her lodging for the night  she was insulted by two Swedish soldiers  who insisted upon qualifying her  as they termed it  to follow the camp  They might  probably have carried their insults into violence  had not a subaltern officer  accidentally passing by  come in to her assistance  upon his appearing  the soldiers immediately desisted  but her thankfulness was hardly greater than her surprise  when she instantly recollected in her deliverer  the son of the Lutheran minister  her former instructor  benefactor  and friend   This was an happy interview for Catharina  the little stock of money she had brought from home was by this time quite exhausted  her cloaths were gone  piece by piece  in order to satisfy those who   273 had entertained her in their houses  her generous countryman  therefore  parted with what he could spare  to buy her cloaths  furnished her with an horse  and gave her letters of recommendation to Mr  Gluck  a faithful friend of his father s  and Superintendant of Marienburgh   Our beautiful stranger had only to appear to be well received  she was immediately admitted into the Superintendant s family  as governess to his two daughters  and though yet but seventeen  shewed herself capable of instructing her sex not only in virtue  but politeness  Such was her good sense and beauty  that her master himself in a short time offered her his hand  which to his great surprize she thought proper to refuse  Actuated by a principle of gratitude  she was resolved to marry her deliverer only  even though he had lost an arm  and was otherwise disfigured by wounds in the service   In order therefore to prevent further solicitations from others  as soon as the officer came to town upon duty  she offered him her person  which he accepted with transport  and their nuptials were solemnized as usual  But all the lines of her fortune were to be striking  the very day on which they were married the Russians laid siege to Marienburgh  the unhappy soldier had now no time to enjoy the well earned pleasures of matrimony  he was called off before consummation to an attack  from which he was never after seen to return   In the mean time the siege went on with fury  aggravated on one side by obstinacy  on the other   274 by revenge  This war between the two northern powers at that time was truly barbarous  the innocent peasant and the harmless virgin often shared the fate of the soldier in arms  Marienburgh was taken by assault  and such was the fury of the assailants  that not only the garrison  but almost all the inhabitants  men  women  and children  were put to the sword  at
