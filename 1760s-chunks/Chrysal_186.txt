best  the only advice I can give you is to put a   stop to this trade  and open your eyes to your true interest  I   hate the English as much as you possibly can   but that should not   make me ruin myself to be revenged on them  They are your only   natural allies  They first delivered  they still sustain you  nor can   you support the very name of an independent state without them    Provoke them not  therefore  too far  I wonder how they have   borne so much already  Preserve a fair neutrality   they despise   your assistance  and desire no more   nor  by your avarice  force   them to measures that must end in your ruin  If you break with   them  to whom will you apply   The French have given you many   proofs that they only wait for an opportunity to enslave you  Spain   has at length learned its own interest  and will not break with the   only power whose friendship can be of real service to it   and this   very war gives a sufficient demonstration of Austrian faith and   gratitude        This is the obvious situation of things  and must strike a person   at the first view   but a moment s thought will show them even   in a  stronger light  For  to grant that France and Austria both     1 Alludes to the family compact entered into secretly by the Bourbon   houses of Spain and France          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 207     may be sincere in their professions to you  does not reason show   you the imprudence of trusting to promises  which it is more than   probable they will not be able to perform   For  it you would but   divest yourself of passion and prejudice for a moment  you would   see that the measures entered upon  and the means used to carry   them on by the English  at this time must  in all human appearance    disappoint the schemes of their enemies  and retort  upon their own   heads  the ruin they meditated for others  Indeed  the prospect is   such  that it is impossible to say where things will end  Every   interior fund is exhausted  every external resource cut off  Their   own trade is absolutely ruined   the treasures of Spain  which sup    plied them in their last wars  are no longer at their command  so   that I can foresee nothing less than their becoming bankrupts    not only to themselves  but also to every foreign state and individual    whose avarice of present gain has made them supply their wants        Nor is this distress the effect of chance  or of an unfortunate   campaign  which the success of another  or some lucky hit  may re    store  It is the natural consequence of a system of measures    planned with judgment  and prosecuted with vigour  by a minister   who win not fail to improve it to the most solid advantage  and   this  I say  not solely from my own opinion  You know I have had   connections with persons able to give me the best information    by the assistance of which I have traced the progress of these affairs   with astonishment   and therefore  as England has thus at length   shown a superiority in council  the usual resource of patching up   a good peace at the end of an unsuccessful war seems also to be   precluded from them  As for the house of Austria  it has ever   been a dead weight upon its friends  though its infatuated ingrati    tude to England  which has been in a manner its sole support for   near a century  will  probably  prevent any other state from under    taking such a burthen  so that it must sink back into its original   obscurity and barbarism  Thus you see  my friend  that depending   upon France is leaning on a broken reed  and trusting to Austria    going for shelter under a falling wall  What  then  can you do  if   the English should take offence at your behaviour  and exert that   power which is in their hands  to pimish your avaricious partiality   to their enemies         Your power is  in every instance  contemptible   your navy is   gone absolutely to decay   your land forces are filled with old men   and children   jovn ofiScers  who might have served you  have been   obliged to enter into other services for bread  to make room for   ignorant  indolent  pusillanimous burghers  who barter their votes   for such a share of the spoils of the public  Your finances are
