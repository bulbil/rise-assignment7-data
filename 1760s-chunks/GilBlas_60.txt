our tender years  but his stubborn heart was relentless  He rejected moreover the proposal of relinquishing the necklace  ear rings  and candlestick  nay  he was deaf to the rhetoric of my ring  perhaps because I offered it before too many witnesses  in short  he was the most obdurate dog of his kennel  He ordered my companions to be handcuffed  and sent us in a body to the public prison  As we were on our way  one of the marshalmen acquainted me that Camilla s old vixen  suspecting us not to be licensed scouts of justice  had dogged us to the tavern  and having satisfied her doubts  in revenge informed against us to the patrole   We were searched in the first instance  Away went the necklace  the ear rings  and the candlestick  They picked my pocket of my ring  and my ruby of the Philippine Isles  without even sparing the few fees I had received in the forenoon for my prescriptions  so that it was plain trade was carried on by the same firm at Valladolid as at Astorga  and that all these reformers held the same creed  While they rifled me of my trinkets and money  the lord in waiting of the patrole made known our adventure to the inferior agents of legal rapine  The trespass appeared so audacious that the majority voted it capital  A few kind souls were of opinion that we might come off for two hundred lashes a piece  with a few years on board the galleys  Waiting his worship s sentence  we were locked up in a cell  where we lay upon straw  spread over our stable like a litter for horses  There might we have foddered for an age  and at last have been turned out to grass in the galleys  if on the morrow Signor Manuel Ordonnez had not got wind of our affair  and determined to release Fabricio  which he could not do without making a general gaol delivery  He was a man of the first credit in the town  his interest was exerted for us  and partly by his own influence  and partly by that of his friends  he obtained our enlargement at the end of three days  But the period of delivery is always moulting time with gaol birds  the candlestick  the necklace  the ear  rings  my ring  and the ruby  all was left behind  One could not help repeating those excellent lines of Virgil  beginning with Sic vos non vobis   As soon as we were at liberty we returned to our masters  Doctor Sangrado received me kindly  My poor Gil Blas  said he  it was but this morning I was acquainted with thy misfortune  I was just setting about an active canvass for thee  We must derive comfort from adversity  my friend  and attach ourselves more than ever to the practice of physic  I affirmed that to be my intention  and in truth I laid about me  Far from wanting employment  it happened by a kind providence  as my master had foretold  to be a very sickly season  The smallpox and a malignant fever took alternate possession of the town and the suburbs  All the physicians in Valladolid had their share of business  and we not the least  We saw eight or ten patients a day  so that the kettle was kept on the simmer  and the blood in the action of transpiring  But things will happen cross  they died to a man  either by our fault or their own  If their case was hopeless  we were not to blame  and if it was not hopeless  they were  Three visits to a patient was the length of our tether  About the second  we sometimes ran foul of the undertaker  or when we had been more fortunate than usual  the patient had got no further than the point of death  As I was but a young physician  not yet hardened to the trade of an assassin  I grieved over the melancholy issue of my own theory and practice  Sir  said I  one evening to Doctor Sangrado  I call heaven to witness on the spot that I have never strayed from your infallible method  and yet I have never saved a patient  one would think they died out of spite  and were on the other side of the great medical question  This very day I came across two of them  going into the country to be buried  My good lad  replied he  my experience nearly comes to the same point  It is but seldom I have the pleasure of curing my kind and partial friends  If I had less confidence in my principles  I should think my prescriptions had set their faces against the work they were intended to perform  If you will take a hint  sir  replied I  we had better vary our system  Let us give  by way of experiment  chemical preparations to our patients  the worst they can do is to tread in the steps of our pure dilutions and our phlebotomizing evacuations  I would willingly give it a trial  rejoined he  if it were a matter of indifference  but I have published on the practice of bleeding and the use of drenches  would you have me cut the throat of my own fame as an author
