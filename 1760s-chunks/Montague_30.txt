his  which attempts to speak  and says nothing  I am in doubt whether I shall let Emily marry him  she will die in a week  of no distemper but his conversation       They dine with us  I am called down  Adieu   Eight at night       Heaven be praised  our lover is gone  they parted with great philosophy on both sides  they are the prettiest mild pair of inamoratoes one shall see       Your brother s servant has just called to tell me he is going to his master  I have a great mind to answer his letter  and order him back     LETTER XXXIV   34   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Oct  12   I HAVE been looking at the estate Madame Des Roches has to sell  it is as wild as the lands to which I have a right  I hoped this would have amused my chagrin  but am mistaken  nothing interests me  nothing takes up my attention one moment  my mind admits but one idea  This charming woman follows me wherever I go  I wander about like the first man when driven out of paradise  I vainly fancy every change of place will relieve the anxiety of my mind       Madame Des Roches smiles  and tells me I am in love   tis however a smile of tenderness and compassion  your sex have great penetration in whatever regards the heart   Oct  13       I have this moment a letter from Miss Fermor  to press my return to Quebec  she tells me  Emily s marriage is postponed till spring  My Lucy  how weak is the human heart  In spite of myself  a ray of hope I set off this instant  I cannot conceal my joy     LETTER XXXV   35   To Colonel RIVERS  at Quebec   London  July 23   YOU have no idea  Ned  how much your absence is lamented by the dowagers  to whom  it must be owned  your charity has been pretty extensive       It would delight you to see them condoling with each other on the loss of the dear charming man  the man of sentiment  of true taste  who admires the maturer beauties  and thinks no woman worth pursuing till turned of twenty five   tis a loss not to be made up  for your taste  it must be owned  is pretty singular       I have seen your last favorite  Lady H—  who assures me  on the word of a woman of honour  that  had you staid seven years in London  she does not think she should have had the least inclination to change  but an absent lover  she well observed  is  properly speaking  no lover at all   Bid Colonel Rivers remember   said she   what I have read somewhere  the parting words of a French lady to a bishop of her acquaintance  Let your absence be short  my lord  and remember that a mistress is a benefice which obliges to residence        I am told  you had not been gone a week before Jack Willmott had the honor of drying up the fair widow s tears       I am going this evening to Vauxhall  and to morrow propose setting out for my house in Rutland  from whence you shall hear from me again       Adieu  I never write long letters in London  I should tell you  I have been to see Mrs  Rivers and your sister  the former is well  but very anxious to have you in England again  the latter grows so very handsome  I don t intend to repeat my visits often   Yours   J  TEMPLE     LETTER XXXVI   36   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Quebec  Oct  14   I AM this moment arrived from a ramble down the river  but  a ship being just going  must acknowledge your last       You make me happy in telling me my dear Lady H— has given my place in her heart to so honest a fellow as Jack Willmott  and I sincerely wish the ladies always chose their favorites as well       I should be very unreasonable indeed to expect constancy at almost four thousand miles distance  especially when the prospect of my return is so very uncertain       My voyage ought undoubtedly to be considered as an abdication  I am to all intents and purposes dead in law as a lover  and the lady has a right to consider her heart as vacant  and to proceed to a new election       I claim no more than a share in her esteem and remembrance  which I dare say I shall never want       That I have amused myself a little in the dowager way  I am very far from denying  but you will observe  it was less from taste than the principle of doing as little mischief as possible in my few excursions to the world of gallantry  A little deviation from the exact rule of right we men all allow ourselves in love affairs  but I was willing to keep as near it as I could
