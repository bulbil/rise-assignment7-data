the chariot   brought us home  and then our supper succeeded in the same agreeable   manner  And thus  in a rapturous circle  the time moves on  every hour   bringing with it something more delightful than the past   Sure nobody   was ever so blest as I          Sunday  the fourth day of my happiness       Not going to chapel this morning  the reason of which I told you  I   bestowed the time  from the hour of my beloved s rising  to breakfast    in prayer and thanksgiving  in my closet  and now I begin to be quite   easy  cheerful  and free in my spirits  and the rather  as I find myself   encouraged by the tranquillity  and pleasing vivacity  in the temper   and behaviour of my beloved  who thereby shews he does not repent of his   goodness to me       I attended him to breakfast with great pleasure and freedom  and he   seemed quite pleased with me  and said  Now does my dearest begin to   look upon me with an air of serenity and satisfaction  it shall be   always  added he  my delight to give you occasion for this sweet   becoming aspect of confidence and pleasure in me   My heart  dear sir    said I  is quite easy  and has lost all its foolish tumults  which    combating with my gratitude  might give an unacceptable appearance to my   behaviour  but now your goodness  sir  has enabled it to get the better   of its uneasy apprehensions  and my heart is all of one piece  and   devoted to you  and grateful tranquillity  And could I be so happy as to   see you and my good Lady Davers reconciled  I have nothing in this world   to wish for more  but the continuance of your favour  He said  I wish   this reconciliation  my dearest  as well as you  and I do assure you    more for your sake than my own  and if she would behave tolerably  I   would make the terms easier to her  for that reason       He said  I will lay down one rule for you  my Pamela  to observe in your   dress  and I will tell you every thing I like or dislike  as it occurs   to me  and I would have you do the same  on your part  that nothing may   be upon either of our minds that may occasion the least reservedness       I have often observed  in married folks  that  in a little while  the   lady grows careless in her dress  which  to me  looks as if she would   take no pains to secure the affection she had gained  and shews a slight   to her husband  that she had not to her lover  Now  you must know  this   has always given me great offence  and I should not forgive it  even in   my Pamela  though she would have this excuse for herself  that thousands   could not make  That she looks lovely in every thing  So  my dear    I shall expect of you always to be dressed by dinner time  except   something extraordinary happens  and this  whether you are to go abroad    or stay at home  For this  my love  will continue to you that sweet ease   in your dress and behaviour  which you are so happy a mistress of  and   whomsoever I bring home with me to my table  you ll be in readiness   to receive them  and will not want to make those foolish apologies to   unexpected visitors  that carry with them a reflection on the conduct   of those who make them  and  besides  will convince me  that you think   yourself obliged to appear as graceful to your husband  as you would to   persons less familiar to your sight       This  dear sir  said I  is a most obliging injunction  and I most   heartily thank you for it  and will always take care to obey it   Why    my dear  said he  you may better do this than half your sex  because   they too generally act in such a manner  as if they seemed to think it   the privilege of birth and fortune  to turn day into night  and night   into day  and are seldom stirring till it is time to sit down to dinner    and so all the good old family rules are reversed  For they breakfast    when they should dine  dine  when they should sup  and sup  when they   should go to bed  and  by the help of dear quadrille  sometimes go to   bed when they should rise
