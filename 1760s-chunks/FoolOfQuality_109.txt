desired the man to drive to some neighbouring   street  and stop at the first door where he saw a bill for lodgings    For lodgings again  I demanded   for whom does my Arabella   desire to take lodgings  For you and me  Mr  Clement for you   and me  she cried  wringing her hands together   Lord Stivers lies   weltering in his blood ait our house  deprived of life within this half   hour by my unhappy hand      I was suddenly struck dumb with surprise and horror  All the   occasions and consequences of this direful event whirled through   my imagination in a fearful succession  What must now become of   my soufs sole enjoyment  what indignities must have been offered    what outrage might she not  or rather  must she not have suffered    before she could be brought to perpetrate so terrible a deed  I   grew instantly sick  and putting my head through the window    desired the coachman to stop at the first tavern  I ordered the   drawer to hasten  with a pint of Spanish white wine  to the door    and I pressed and compelled my wife to swallow a part  Our   spirits being in some degree settled thereby  we drove to a private   street  on the right hand of Cheapside  where I took a back room   and closet  up two pair of stairs  at one Mrs  Jennett s  an old   maid and a mantua maker  I immediately ordered a fire to be   kindled  and the tea things to be laid  and  giving the servant a   crown  desired her to bring the value in proper ingredients      The evening was now shut in   and  while the maid was abroad    not a syllable passed between my wife and me  I dreaded to   inquire of what I still more dreaded to understand   and Arabella   seemed to labour under some mighty oppression  When retiring to   the closet  where our bed stood  she covered her child up warm  and   kneeling down by his side  broke forth into a violent torrent of   tears  intermingled with heavings and half strangled sobs      I sat still without seeming to observe her emotion  I was sensible   that nature wanted this kindly relief  The teas and sugars were   brought  the kettle was put on the fire  and the maid had again   retired   when I gently called to my Arabella to come forth  with   a voice of the truest love  and softest endearment  that ever yet   breathed from a human bosom      Her eyes were already wiped  her countenance composed  and   her motions and demeanour much more settled than before  She   sat down with a rising sigh  which she checked with a half smile    My Arabella  said I  my only joy  my unmeasured blessing   what   is it that thus distracts my dearer part of existence   Your mind    your spirit  my angel  is still pure and unpolluted   and bodies are    merely as booses  incapable of defilement  being doomed from our   birth to dissolution and corruption  Ah  my Hammy  she ex    claimed  you are quite beside the mark   I sigh not  I weep not  I   grieve not for myself  I fear not  nor regard the consequences          92 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      however fatal  of what has happened Suppose a sudden and     shameful death   I thank my God for it  death will offer me a   victim still pure and unpolluted  But  O the wretched Stivers    what is now become of him  sent  so suddenly and unprovided  to   his eternal audit   Unhappy that I am   perhaps an instrument of   perdition to an immortal being  Ah  rather that I had not been   born   would I had perished in his stead   A death in the cause of   virtue had been my advocate for mercy      How is this  my Arabella   I cried  Is condemnation then to be   brought upon the good because they oppose themselves to evil    Would you have censured any one living  except yourself  for   having given you this deliverance by the death of the spoiler   No    surely  in the daily and nightly robberies  massacres  and assassina    tions  that the violent machinate against the peaceful  is it the   fault of those who stand in the defence of righteousness  that   villains often perish in the act of transgression   Tell me  my sweet   mourner  in the sacking of a city  when the wild and bloody soldiery   are
