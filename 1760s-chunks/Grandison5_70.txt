a farewel visit  when she had shewn a little before  on a first  that marriage seemed not to be in her thoughts   And had she not been entrusted to the management of the cruel Laurana  said the Bishop—  From which  thank God  said the Father  I was the instrument of freeing her   By all this  proceeded I  I mean not recrimination  but only to observe the consistency of the noble Lady s mind  when she was able to reflect  And what now remains for me to do  but to reconcile myself  if possible  to a conduct that I must ever admire  however I may  in its consequences  as to my own particular  regret it —Your Lordship  I am afraid  thinks  that she adheres to the contents of the paper she put into my hands   Page  175 Unless you  Chevalier—  That  my Lord is out of the question  Let it  however  be remembred  that I have not prescribed to her that hard condition  which is made an indispensable one to me  Yet is Lady Clementina the only woman on earth that I would have wished to call mine  on the terms on which I should have been proud to receive her hand  For it is easy to foresee  that  generally  great inconveniencies must attend a marriage between persons of a different religion  one of them zealous  the other not indifferent   But  Chevalier  you acquit Father Marescotti and me   I do  my Lord  Be you your own judges  The condition was not proposed by me  I consented to it  for the sake of those who prescribed it  and for your sister s sake  I could not wish to prosecute my humble suit  notwithstanding her declared favour for me  against the pleas of conscience which she so earnestly urged  How could I  while religion  and the generosity of her friends to her  required  as she thought  that she should get above all regards for me  I was therefore willing to comply with the proposal  and to wait the issue of her spontaneous determination  and to be governed by it  But now that your Lordship and Father Marescotti have dispensed with the condition  I presume that I am not bound by it   What means my Grandison   Only this  I could not be thought to bear a Love so fervent to the admirable Clementina  as the man ought to bear who aspires to the honour of calling her his  if I made not one effort to convince her  that she may be happy with me as to the article she is so solicitous about—From female delicacy  she may perhaps  expect to be argued with  and to be persuaded  Allow me to give her assurances of my inviolable honour in that point  It becomes me  as a man  and as her Page  176 admirer  to remove her scruples  if I can  before I yield up my Love to the force of them   Would you argue with her on the merits of the two persuasions   I would not  I never did  I would only assure her of my firm resolution never to attempt to bring her over to mine  nor to traverse the endeavours of her confessor  to keep her steady in hers  But were we to consider only her future ease of mind  You  see my Lord  that she herself has a view to that  in the proposal made me  as from herself  in which the happiness of all your family is included  it is right to see if she builds on a foundation that cannot be shaken  that she may not hereafter regret the steps she has taken  which might possibly—  I understand you  Chevalier—It is prudently  it is kindly  put  as well for her sake  as ours   I shall be glad  my Lord  that you should be within hearing of every word that shall pass between us on this occasion  One effort I ought to make  If she is determined  I will not urge her further  For all the world  and the dear Clementina in it  I would not have her act against her conscience  Nor will I take advantage of the declaration she has repeatedly made  that it is in my power to hold her fast  or to set her free  I will not so much as urge it to her  left  if she should alter her purpose  it should be from the conscience of a kind of promise implied in that declaration  and not from her heart  No  my Lord  she shall be wholly free  I will not  excellent as she is  accept of her hand against her conscience  Neither my conscience  nor let me say  my pride  will permit me to do so  But the world  as well as my own heart  would blame me if I made not one effort  If it fail  I shall be easier in my own mind  and so will she in hers  Be you  my Lord  within hearing of our next conversation   I would not  Dr  Bartlett  propose to Father Marescotti  Page  177 that he should  for fear
