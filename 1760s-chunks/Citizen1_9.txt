act of complaisance in their power  One takes me under the arm  and in a manner forces me along  another catches me round the neck  and desires to partake in this office of hospitality  while a third kinder still  invites me to refresh my spirits with wine  Wine is in England reserved only for the rich  yet here even wine is given away to the stranger   A few nights ago  one of those generous creatures  dressed all in white  and flaunting like a meteor by my side  forcibly attended me home to my own apartment  She seemed charmed with the elegance of the furniture  and the convenience of my situation  And well indeed she might  for I have hired an apartment for not less than two shillings of their money every week  But her civility did not rest here  for at parting  being desirous to know the hour  and perceiving my watch out of order  she kindly took it to be repaired by a relation of her own  which you may imagine will   27 save some expence  and she assures me that it will cost her nothing  I shall have it back in a few days when mended  and am preparing a proper speech expressive of my gratitude on the occasion  Celestial excellence  I intend to say  happy I am in having found out  after many painful adventures  a land of innocence  and a people of humanity  I may rove into other climes  and converse with nations yet unknown  but where shall I meet a soul of such purity as that which resides in thy breast  Sure thou hast been nurtured by the bill of the Shin Shin  or suck d the breasts of the provident Gin Hiung  The melody of thy voice could rob the Chong Fou of her whelps  or inveigle the Boh that lives in the midst of the waters  Thy servant shall ever retain a sense of thy favours  and one day b•ast of thy virtue  sincerity  and truth  among the daughters of China  Adieu   LETTER IX  To the same   I Have been deceived  she whom I fancied a daughter of Paradise has proved to be one of the infamous disciples of Han  I have lost a trifle  I have gained the consolation of having discovered a deceiver  I once more  therefore  relax into my former indifference with regard to the English ladies  they once more begin to appear disagreeable in my eyes  Thus is my whole time passed in forming conclusions which the next minute s experience may probably destroy  the present moment becomes a comment on the past  and I improve rather in humility than wisdom     28Their laws and religion forbid the English to keep more than one woman  I therefore concluded that prostitutes were banished from society  I was deceived  every man here keeps as many wives as he can maintain  the laws are cemented with blood  praised and disregarded  The very Chinese  whose religion allows him two wives  takes not half the liberties of the English in this particular  Their laws may be compared to the books of the Sybils  they are held in great veneration  but seldom read  or seldomer understood  even those who pretend to be their guardians dispute about the meaning of many of them  and confess their ignorance of others  The law therefore which commands them to have but one wife  is strictly observed only by those for whom one is more than sufficient  or by such as have not money to buy two  As for the rest  they violate it publicly  and some glory in its violation  They seem to think like the Persians  that they give evident marks of manhood by encreasing their seraglio  A mandarine therefore here generally keeps four wives  a gentleman three  and a stage player two  As for the magistrates  the country justices and squires  they are employed first in debauching young virgins  and then punishing the transgression   From such a picture you will be apt to conclude  that he who employs four ladies for his amusement  has four times as much constitution to spare as he who is contented with one  that a Mandarin is much cleverer than a gentleman  and a gentleman than a player  and yet it is quite the reverse  a Mandarine is frequently supported on spindle shanks  appears emaciated by luxury  and is obliged to have recourse to variety  merely from   29 the weakness  not the vigour of his constitution  the number of his wives being the most equivocal symptom of his virility   Beside the country squire  there is also another set of men  whose whole employment consists in corrupting beauty  these the silly part of the fair sex call amiable  the more sensible part of them  however  give them the title of abominable  You will probably demand what are the talents of a man thus caressed by the majority of the opposite sex  what talents  or what beauty is he possessed of superior to the rest of his fellows  To answer you directly  he has neither talents nor beauty  but then he is possessed of impudence and assiduity  With assiduity and impudence  men of all ages  and all figures  may commence admirers  I have even been told of some
