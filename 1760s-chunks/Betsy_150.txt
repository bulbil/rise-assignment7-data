would allow him to pay his respects to her where she lived  This was a   favour Miss Betsy was never very scrupulous of granting  and consented   the now more readily  as she thought the report of a new lover would   gall Mr  Trueworth  who  she heard by some  who had very lately seen   him  was not yet gone out of town       Mr  Munden  to testify the impatience of his love  waited on her the   very next day  as soon as he thought dinner would be over  at Mr    Goodman s  he had the satisfaction of finding her alone  but  fearing   she might not long be so  suffered but a very few minutes to escape   before he acquainted her with the errand on which he came  the terms in   which he declared himself her admirer  were as pathetick as could be   made use of for the purpose  but though this was no more than Miss Betsy   had expected  and would have been strangely mortified if disappointed by   his entertaining her on any other score  yet she affected  at first  to   treat it with surprize  and then  on his renewing his protestations  to   answer all he said with a sort of raillery  in order to put him to the   more expence of oaths and asseverations       It is certain  that whoever pretended to make his addresses to Miss   Betsy  stood in need of being previously provided with a good stock of   repartees  to silence the sarcasms of the witty fair  as well as fine   speeches to engage her to more seriousness  Mr  Munden often found   himself at his  ne plus ultra   but was not the least disconcerted at   it  he was a courtier  he was accustomed to attend at the levees of the   great  and knew very well  that persons in power seldom failed to   exercise it over those who had any dependance on them  and looking on   the case of a lover with his mistress  as the same with one who is   soliciting for a pension or employment  had armed himself with patience    to submit to every thing his tyrant should inflict  in the hope that it   would one day be his turn to impose those laws  according to the poet s   words             The humbled lover  when he lowest lies        But kneels to conquer  and but falls to rise        Miss Betsy was indeed a tyrant  but a very gentle one  she always   mingled some sweet with the sharpness of her expressions  if in one   breath she menaced despair  in the next she encouraged hope  and her   very repulses were sometimes so equivocal  as that they might be taken   for invitations  She played with her lovers  as she did with her monkey    but expected more obedience from them  they must look gay or grave    according as she did so  their humour  and even their very motions  must   be regulated by her influence  as the waters by the moon  In fine  an   exterior homage was the chief thing to be required  for  as to the   heart  her own being yet untouched  she gave herself but little trouble   how that of her lovers stood affected       Mr  Munden  with less love perhaps than any man who had addressed her    knew better how to suit himself to her humour  he could act over all the   delicacies of the most tender passion  without being truly sensible of   any of them  and though he wished  in reality  nothing so much as   attaining the affections of Miss Betsy  yet wishing it without those   timid inquietudes  those jealous doubts  those perplexing anxieties    which suspense inflicts on a more stolid mind  he was the more capable   of behaving towards her in the way she liked       He was continually inviting her to some party of pleasure or other  he   gallanted her to all publick shews  he treated her with the most   exquisite dainties of the season  and presented her with many curious   toys  Being to go with these ladies  at whose appointment he first   commenced his acquaintance with her  and some other company  to a   masquerade  he waited on her some hours before the time  and taking out   of his pocket a ruby  cut in the shape of a heart  and illustrated with   small brilliants round about   I beg  Madam   said he   you will do me   the honour of wearing this to night  either on your sleeve or breast  or   some other conspicuous place  There will be a great deal of company
