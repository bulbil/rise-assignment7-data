to be outdone  provided another next door to the Sungate  that these two nymphs had their larder regularly supplied every morning  while the cook  following a good example  sent a few little nice things to a widow of his acquaintance in the neighbourhood  but as he winked at the table arrangements of his dear and confidential friends  it was but fair that he should draw whenever he pleased upon the wine cellar  in short  by the practices of these three bloodsuckers  a most horrible system of extravagance had found its way into my lord the count s establishment  If you doubt my veracity  added the scullion  only take the trouble of going to  morrow morning about seven o clock into the neighbourhood of St Thomas s college  and you will see me with a load upon my back  which will convert your suspicions into certainty  Then you  said I  are in the confidence of these honest purveyors  I am factor to the clerk of the kitchen  answered he  and one of my comrades runs on errands for the steward   I had the curiosity the next day to loiter about St  Thomas s college at the appointed hour  My informer was punctual to time and place  He brought with him a large tray full of butcher s meat  poultry  and game  I took an account of every article  and drew out the bill of fare in my memorandum book  for the purpose of shewing it to my master  at the same time telling my little turnspit to execute his commission as usual   His Sicilian lordship  naturally warm in his temper  would have turned his countryman and the Italian out of doors together  in the first fury of his anger  but after cooling upon it  he got rid of the former only  and gave me his vacant place  Thus my office of supervisor was suppressed very shortly after its creation  nor did I relinquish it with any reluctance  To define it strictly and properly  it was nothing better than that of a spy with a sounding title  there was nothing substantial in the nature of the appointment  whereas to the stewardship was tied the key of the strong box  and with that goes the mastery of the whole family  There are so many little perquisites and so much patronage attached to that department of administration  that a man must inevitably get rich  almost in spite of his own honesty   But our Neapolitan was not so easily to be driven from his strongholds  Observing to what a pitch of savage zeal I carried my integrity  and that I was up every morning time enough to enter in my books the exact quantity of meat that came from market  he abandoned the practice of sending it off by wholesale  yet the plunderer did not therefore contract the scale of his demands on the animal creation  He was cunning enough to make it as broad as it was long  by arranging the services with so much the more profusion  Thus  what was sent down again untouched being his property by culinary common law  he had nothing to do but to pamper up his pet with victuals ready dressed  instead of giving her the trouble of cooking for herself  The devil will levy his due out of every transaction  so that the count was very little the better for his paragon of a steward  The unbounded prodigality in our style of setting out a table  even to a surfeiting degree  was a plain hint to me of what was going forward  I therefore took upon myself to retrench the superfluities of every course  This  however  was done with so judicious a hand  that there was no thing like parsimony to be discovered  No one would ever have missed what was taken away  and yet the expense was reduced very considerably by a well  regulated economy  That was just what my employer wanted  good housewifery  but a magnificent establishment  There was a love of saving at the bottom  but a taste for grandeur was the ostensible passion   Abuses seldom exist alone  The wine flowed too freely  If  for instance  there were a dozen gentlemen at his lordship s table  the consumption was seldom less than fifty  sometimes sixty bottles  This was strange  and looked as if there was more in it than met the lips of the guests  Hereupon I consulted my oracle of the scullery  whence I derived most of my wisdom  for he brought me a faithful account of all that was said and done in the kitchen  where they had not the least suspicion of him  It seemed that the havoc of which I complained proceeded from a new confederacy between the clerk of the kitchen  the cook  and the under butler  The latter carried off the bottles half full  and shared their contents with his allies  I spoke to him on the subject  threatening to turn him and all the footmen under him out of doors at a minute s warning  if ever they did the like again  The hint was understood  and the evil remedied  I took especial care lest the slightest of my services should be lost upon my master  who overwhelmed me with commendations  and took a greater liking to me every day  On my part  as a reward to
