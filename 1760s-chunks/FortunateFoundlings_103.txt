as she was  and trembling for the hazards   she knew he had been exposed to  seen him thus caressed and honoured by   the most glorious prince and greatest hero in the world  they could   scarce have wished him to quit the post he was in  much less persuaded   him to do it       He hitherto indeed had experienced only the happiness of a martial life    for the fatigues  hardships  and dangers of it he as little regarded as   the intrepid and indefatigable prince he served  but now arrived the   time which was to inflict on him the worst miseries of it  and make him   almost curse a vocation he had been in his soul so much attached to       The king of Sweden  with his usual success having passed the   Boristhenes  encountered a party of 10 000 Muscovites and 6000 Calmuck   Tartars  but they gave way on the first onset and fled into a wood    where the king  following the dictates of his great courage more than   prudence  pursuing them  fell into an ambuscade  which  throwing   themselves between him and three regiments of horse that were with him    hem d him in  and now began a very unequal fight   Many of the gallant   Swedes were cut to pieces  and the Muscovites made quite up to his   majesty   two aid de camps were killed within his presence  his own   horse was shot under him  and as an equerry was presenting him with   another  both horse and man was struck dead in the same moment   Horatio   immediately alighted in order to mount the king  who now on foot behaved   with incredible valour  in that action was surrounded and taken   prisoner  as were several others that had fought near his person  He had   the satisfaction  however  while they were disarming and tying his   hands  to see colonel Dardoff with his regiment force thro  the   Calmucks  and arrive timely enough to disengage the king  after which   the army recovering its rank  and pouring in upon the enemy  he was not   without hopes of regaining his liberty  but he was sat upon a horse and   bound fast to the saddle  and compelled  with the others that were taken   with him  to accompany the Muscovites in their flight  so was ignorant   in what manner this re encounter ended  Soon after repairing to the   czar s quarters  these unfortunate officers of the king of Sweden were    with some others who had before become their prize  sent under a strong   guard to Petersburgh  and thrown altogether into a miserable dungeon       It would be impossible to describe the horrors of this place   light   there was  but it was only so much as just served to shew to each of   these unhappy sufferers the common calamity of them all   The roof was   arched indeed  but so low  that the shortest among them could scarce   stand upright   no kind of furniture  not even straw to cover the damp   earthen floor  which served them for a seat by day and bed at night    Inured as they had been to hardships  the noisomeness of this dreadful   vault killed many of them  and among the rest a young Swedish officer   named Gullinstern  one with whom Horatio had contracted a very intimate   friendship  and who  for his many excellent qualities  had been so dear   to the king  that seeing him one day greatly wounded  and in danger of   being taker  prisoner  that generous prince obliged him to mount on his   own horse  and fought on foot himself till another could be brought       The light of this gentleman expiring in his arms  filled Horatio with so   poignant an anguish  that he wanted but little of following him  and    indeed  had it not been for the sanguine hopes that the king would in a   short time complete the ruin of the czar  and not only restore them   liberty  but also add vengeance to it for the ill treatment they had   found in his dominions  few  if any of them  had been able to support   the miseries inflicted on them by these inhuman wretches  who  not   content with burying them in a manner alive  for the dungeon they were   in was deep underground  and allowing them no other food than bread and   water once in four and twenty hours  made savage sport at their   condition  ridiculed the conquests of their king  and spoke in the most   opprobrious terms of his royal person  which  when some of them were   unable to restrain themselves from answering in a manner befitting their   duty and love of justice  they were silenced by the most cruel stripes
