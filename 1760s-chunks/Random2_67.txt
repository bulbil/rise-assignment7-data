the money found exactly as it had been described  Upon which  we committed him to the charge of the countryman  who guarded him to the town of Hounslow  which it seems the farmer had alarmed  and having satisfied the footman for his trouble according to promise  returned with Strap to the coach  where I found the captain and lawyer busy in administring smelling bottles and cordials to the grave lady  who had gone into a fit at the noise of the firing     When I had taken my seat  Miss Snapper  who from the coach had seen every thing that happened  made me a compliment on my behaviour  and said  she was glad to see me returned  without having received any injury  her mother too owned herself obliged to my resolution  and the lawyer told me  that I was intitled by act of parliament to a reward of forty pounds  for having apprehended a highwayman —The soldier observed  with a countenance in which impudence and shame struggling  produced   196 some disorder  that if I had not been in such a damned hurry to get out of the coach  he would have secured the rogues effectually  without all this bustle and loss of time  by a scheme which my heat and precipitation ruined —   For my own part   continued he  I am always extremely cool on these occasions  —   So it appeared  by your trembling   said the young lady  —   Death and damnation  cried he  your sex protects you  madam  if any man on earth durst tell me so much  I d send him to hell  d—n my heart  in an instant  —  So saying  he fixed his eyes on me  and asked if I had seen him tremble —I answered without hesitation    Yes  —   Damme  Sir   said he  d ye doubt my courage  —  I replied    Very much  —  This declaration quite disconcerted him —He looked blank  and pronounced with a faultering voice    O   tis very well—d—n my blood  I shall find a time  —  I signified my contempt of him  by thrusting my tongue in my cheek  which humbled him so much  that he scarce swore another oath during the whole journey     The precise lady  having recruited her spirits by the help of some strong waters  began a soliloquy  in which she wondered that any man  who pretended to maintain the character of a gentleman  could  for the sake of a little paultry coin  throw persons of honour into such quandaries as might endanger their lives  and professed her surprize  that women were not ashamed to commend such brutality  At the same time vowing  that for the future she would never set foot in a stage coach  if a private convenience could be had for love or money     197 Nettled at her remarks  I took the same method of conveying my sentiments  and wondered in my turn  that any woman of common sense  should be so unreasonable as to expect that people who had neither acquaintance nor connexion with her  would tamely allow themselves to be robbed and mal treated  meerly to indulge her capricious humour  I likewise confessed my astonishment at her insolence and ingratitude in taxing a person with brutality  who deserved her approbation and acknowledgment  and vowed  that if ever we should be assaulted again  I would leave her to the mercy of the spoiler  that she might know the value of my protection   This person of honour did not think fit to carry on the altercation any further  but seemed to chew the cud of her resentment  with the crestfallen captain  while I entered into discourse with my charmer  who was the more pleased with my conversation  as she had conceived a very indifferent opinion of my intellects from my former silence  I should have had cause to be equally satisfied with the sprightliness of her genius  could she have curbed her imagination with judgment  but she laboured under such a profusion of talk  that I dreaded her unruly tongue  and felt by anticipation the horrors of an eternal clack  However  when I considered on the other hand  the joys attending the possession of twenty thousand pounds  I forgot her imperfections  seized occasion by the fore lock  and endeavoured to insinuate myself into her affection —The careful mother kept a strict watch over her  and though she could not help behaving civilly to me  took frequent opportunities of discouraging our communication  by reprimanding   198 her for being so free with strangers  and telling her she must learn to speak less  and think more —A bridged of the use of speech  we conversed with our eyes  and I found the young lady very eloquent in this kind of discourse  In short  I had reason to believe  that she was sick of the old gentlewoman s tuition  and that I should find it no difficult matter to supersede her authority   When we arrived at the place where we were to breakfast  I alighted and helped my mistress out of the coach  as well as her mother  who called for a private room  to which they withdrew  in
