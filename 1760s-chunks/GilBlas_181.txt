 and owned all to her husband  and had perhaps  in concert with him  suffered herself to be immured  in order to lie hid from a pursuit so dangerous to her virtue  The prince appeared deeply afflicted at my relation  I was not unmoved by his distress  and repented more than once of what I had done  but it was too late to retract  Besides  I must acknowledge  a spiteful joy tingled in my veins  when I meditated on the distressed condition of the disdainful fair  who had spurned my vows   I was feeding with impunity on the pleasure of revenge  so palatable to all the world  but most of all to Spaniards  when one day the grand duke  chatting with five or six nobles of his court and myself  said to us  In what manner would you judge it fitting for a man to be punished  who should have abused the confidence of his prince  and designed to step in between him and his mistress  The best way  said one of the courtiers  would be to have him torn to pieces by four horses  Another gave it as his verdict  that he should be soundly beaten  till he died under the blows of the executioner  The most tender hearted and merciful of these Italians  with comparative lenity towards the culprit  wished only just to admonish him of his fault  by throwing him from the top of a tower to the bottom  And Don Raphael  resumed the grand duke after a pause  what is his opinion  The Spaniards  in all likelihood  would improve upon our Italian severity  is a case of such aggravated treachery   I fully understood  as you may well suppose  that Mascarini had not kept his oath  or that his wife had devised the means of acquainting the prince with what had passed between her and me  My countenance sufficiently betokened my inward agitation  But for all that  suppressing as well as I could my rising emotion and alarm  I replied to the grand duke in a steady tone of voice    My lord  the Spaniards are more generous  under such circumstances  they would pardon the unworthy betrayer of his trust  and by that act of unmerited goodness would kindle in his soul an everlasting abhorrence of his own villany  Yes  truly  said the prince  and I fed in my own breast a similar spirit of forbearance  Let the traitor then be pardoned  since I have myself only to blame for having given my confidence to a man of whom I had no knowledge  but  on the contrary  much ground of suspicion  according to the current of common report  Don Raphael  added he  my revenge shall be confined to this single interdict  Quit my dominions immediately  and never appear again in my presence  I withdrew in all haste  less hurt at my disgrace  than delighted to have got off so cheaply  The very next day I embarked in a Barcelona ship  just setting sail from the port of Leghorn on its return   At this period of his history I interrupted Don Raphael to the following effect  For a man of shrewdness  methinks you were not a little off your guard  in trusting yourself at Florence for even so short a time  after having discovered the prince s love of Lucretia to Mascarini  You might well have foreboded that the grand duke would not be long in getting to the knowledge of your duplicity  Your observation is very just  answered the well  matched son of so eccentric a mother as Lucinda  and for that reason  not trusting to the minister s promise of screening me from his master s indignation  it had been my intention to disappear without taking leave   I got safe to Barcelona  continued he  with the remnant of the wealth I had brought from Algiers  but the greater part had been squandered at Florence in enacting the Spanish gentleman  I did not stay long in Catalonia  Madrid was the dear place of my nativity  and I had a longing desire to see it again  which I satisfied as soon as possible  for mine was not a temper to stand parleying with its own inclinations  On my arrival in town  I chanced to take up my abode in a ready furnished lodging  where dwelt a lady  by name Camilla  Though at some distance from her teens  she was a very spirit stirring creature  as Signor Gil Blas will hear me out in saying  for he fell in with her at Valladolid nearly about the same time  Her parts were still more extraordinary than her beauty  and never had a lady with a character to let a happier talent of inveigling fools to their ruin  But she was not like those selfish jilts  who put out the cullibility of their lovers to usury  The pillage of the plodding merchant  or the grave family man  was squandered upon the first gambler or prize fighter who happened to find his way into her frolicsome fancy   We loved one another from the first moment  and the conformity of our tempers bound us so closely together  that we soon lived on the footing of joint property  The amount  in sober sadness  was little better than a cypher  and a few good
