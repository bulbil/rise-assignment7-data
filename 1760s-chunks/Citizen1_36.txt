disposal of their daughters  and I have always taken care not to give any  I have contracted a friendship with an alderman  only by observing  that if we take a farthing from a thousand pound it will be a thousand pound no longer  I have been invited to a pawnbroker s table  by pretending to hate gravy  and am now actually upon treaty of marriage with a rich widow  for only having observed that the bread was rising  If ever I am asked a question  whether I know it or not  instead of answering  I only smile and look wise  If a charity is proposed  I go about with the hat  but put nothing in myself  If a wretch solicits my pity  I observe that the world is filled with impostors  and take a certain method of not being deceived by never relieving  In short  I now find the truest way of Ending esteem even from the indigent  is to give away nothing  and thus have much in our power to give    LETTER XXVII  To the same   LATELY in company with my friend in black  whose conversation is now both my amusement and instruction  I could not avoid observing the great numbers of old bachelors and maiden ladies   112 with which this city seems to be over run  Sure marriage  said I  is not sufficiently encouraged  or we should never behold such crowds of battered beaux and decayed coquets still attempting to drive a trade they been have so long unfit for  and swarming upon the gaiety of the age  I behold an old bachelor in the most contemptible light  as an animal that lives upon the common stock without contributing his share  he is a beast of prey  and the laws should make use of as many stratagems and as much force to drive the reluctant savage into the toils as the Indians when they hunt the hyena or the rhinoceros  The mob should be permitted to halloo after him  boys might play tricks on him with impunity  every well bred company should laugh at him  and if  when turned of sixty  he offered to make love his mistress might spit in his face  or  what would be perhaps a greater punishment  should fairly grant him the favour   As for old maids  continued I  they should not be treated with so much severity  because I suppose none would be so if they could  No lady in her senses would chuse to make a subordinate figure at christenings and lyings in  when she might be the principal herself  nor curry favour with a sister in law  when she might command an husband  nor toil in preparing custards  when she might lie abed and give directions how they ought to be made  nor stifle all her sensations in demure formality  when she might with matrimonial freedom shake her acquaintance by the hand  and wink at a double entendre  No lady could be so very silly as to live single  if she could help it  I consider an unmarried lady declining into the vale of years  as one of those charming countries bordering on China   113 that lies waste for want of proper inhabitants  We are not to accuse the country  but the ignorance of its neighbours  who are insensible of its beauties  though at liberty to enter and cultivate the soil   Indeed  Sir  replied my companion  you are very little acquainted with the English ladies to think they are old maids against their will  I dare venture to affirm that you can hardly select one of them all  but has had frequent offers of marriage  which  either pride or avarice has not made her reject  Instead of thinking it a disgrace  they take every occasion to boast of their former cruelty  a soldier does not exult more when he counts over the wounds he has received  than a female veteran when she relates the wounds she has formerly given  exhaustless when she begins a narrative of the former death dealing power of her eyes  She tells of the knight in gold lace who died with a single frown  and never rose again till—he was married to his maid  Of the squire  who being cruelly denied  in a rage  flew to the window  and lifting up the sash  threw himself in an agony— into his arm chair  Of the parson  who crossed in love  resolutely swallowed opium  which banished the stings of despised love by—making him sleep  In short  she talks over her former losses with pleasure  and  like some tradesmen  finds consolation in the many bankruptcies she has suffered   For this reason  whenever I see a superannuated beauty still unmarried  I tacitly accuse her either of pride  avarice  coquetry  or affectation    114 There s Miss Jenny Tinderbox  I once remember her to have had some beauty  and a moderate fortune  Her elder sister happened to marry a man of quality  and this seemed as a statute of virginity against poor Jane  Because there was one lucky hit in the family  she was resolved not to disgrace it by introducing a tradesman  by thus rejecting her equals  and neglected or despised by her superiors  she now acts in the capacity of tutoress to her sister s children  and undergoes the
