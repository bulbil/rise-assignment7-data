Bless me  to stand  for two or three hours together  mute   as a fish  upright as an arrow  and  when the scene is over  walk   backward like a crab  curtseying at every step  though their legs are so   tired  they are scarce able to go through the ceremony         A masquerade  then   resumed Mr  Trueworth  willing to try her farther     What say you  Madam  to a masquerade  I hope you will allow no freedom   of behaviour is wanting there     I should like a masquerade extremely     answered she   if conducted in the same manner I have been told they are   in Italy  and some other places  where only persons of condition are   admitted  and none presume to say that under a vizard  which he either   would or ought to be ashamed of when it is plucked off  But the venal   ones you have here  are my utter detestation  they seem to me to   license  under a shew of innocent diversion  not only folly  but all   kind of prophaneness and indecency         It must be owned  Madam   said Mr  Trueworth   that your sentiments on   both these subjects are extremely just  but you can have no such   objection against a play or opera     No  Sir   answered she   I look   upon a good play as one of the most improving  as well as agreeable    entertainments a thinking mind can take  and as for an opera     Aye    sister   cried Sir Bazil  interrupting her   the opera  Take care what   you say of the opera  My friend here is a passionate lover of musick    and  if you utter one syllable against his favourite science  you will   certainly pass in his opinion for a stoick     I should deserve it     said she   and be in reality as insensible as that sect of philosophers   affect to be  if I were not capable of being touched by the charms of   harmony         Then  Madam   said Mr  Trueworth   there are two of the pleasures of   London  which are so happy to receive your approbation     Not only my   approbation   replied she   but my applause  I am  indeed  a very great   admirer of both  yet can find ways to make myself easy without being   present at either  and  at the distance of an hundred miles  enjoy in   theory all the satisfaction the representation could afford         This is somewhat extraordinary indeed  Madam   cried Mr  Trueworth   be   so good as to let us know by what method     It is this  Sir   answered   she   as for the plays  I have a very good collection of the old ones by   me  and have all the new ones sent down to me as they come out  When I   was last in London  I was several times at the theatre  I observed how   the actors and actresses varied their voices and gestures  according to   the different characters they appeared in on the stage  and thus  whilst   I am reading any play  am enabled to judge pretty near how it shews in   representation  I have  indeed  somewhat more difficulty in bringing the   opera home to me  yet I am so happy as to be able to procure a shadow of   it  at least  We have two or three gentlemen in the neighbourhood who   play to great perfection on the violin  and several ladies  who have   very pretty voices  and some skill in musick  My sister touches the   bass viol finely  and I play a little on the harpsichord  We have all   our parts in score before us  which we execute to the best of our power    It serves  however  to divert ourselves  and those friends who think it   worth their while to come to hear us        Mr  Trueworth cried out  in a kind of rapture  as soon as she had done   speaking   Who would not think himself happy to be one of the audience   at such a performance   He was going on  but Mrs  Wellair returned  on   which he directed the compliments he was about to make Miss Harriot    equally to the other  which she returned with a great deal of   politeness  The conversation afterwards turned on different subjects    and was very entertaining  Some other company coming in  Mr  Trueworth   would have taken leave  but Sir Bazil would not permit him
