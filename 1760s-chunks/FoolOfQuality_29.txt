  His great friends  and the Prince among them  wrote to him in   his retirement  letters which are said to have perished in some fire    He published  too  from time to time  a paraphrase of   The Man   of Law s Tale   for Ogle s Chaucer  which we shall not prefer to   the original  The Earl of Westmoreland  a tragedy  was performed   at Dublin  as good as other tragedies of the day  For several   years  indeed  his hankering for the stage continued  to the scandal   of some of his biographers   one of whom  Mr  Richard Ryan  a   Romish compiler of   Lives of Irish Worthies   thus vents his  or   his Methodist informer s  respectability on the matter        During the greater part of his life his religious opinions   approached to what are called Methodistical  yet he uniformly   supported the stage   nevertheless  it is certain he lived more   consistently than he wrote  No day passed in which he did not   collect his family to prayer  and read and expounded the Scriptures   to them with a clearness and fervency edifying and interesting   A   strange phenomenon must Henry Brooke have been  throughout   his life  to bigots and precisians of all denominations  I have not   had the pleasure of reading Mr  Richard Ryan s biography  a mis    fortune which is much softened to me by the perusal of this   quotation from it  Doubtless Brooke s Methodist friends  had they          PREFACE      and not high heaven  had the making of Henry Brooke  would   have treated him after the same Procrustean method as John   Wesley treated the Fool of Quality  which he purged of such   passages as were not to his mind  and then republished during the   author s lifetime  as the   History of Harry  Earl of Moreland   a   plan which was so completely successful  that country Wesleyans   still believe their great prophet to have been himself the author of   the book      In 1745  Chesterfield came to Ireland as Viceroy   and though   Brooke  who was of an independence of spirit too rare in Ireland   then   was among the last to pay his respects to him   he was   appointed barrack master of Mullingar  with a salary worth a clear   400 a year  A rational Irishman of those days would have   pocketed his money  and held his tongue   but Brooke must needs    with that foolish honesty which always hampered him  thoroughly   work out the history of these and other Irish barracks  their   jobbery  peculation  and what not  and throw the whole into a   satirical pamphlet   The Secret History and Memoirs of the   Barracks of Ireland    thereby putting a sufficiently wet blanket   upon any chance of future government preferment  That year saw   the publication of his   Farmer s Letters   written in the expecta    tion of a revolt of the Irish Koman Catholics  They excited   much attention at the time  but were denounced by some for their   supposed severity  Brooke s vindication of them  containing an anec    dote honourable to the Irish for his ill founded expectation of a   rebellion  may be found in Brookiana  vol  i  p  85 a model of that   English prose of which he was a perfect master  and a model too of   good sense and humanity  In nothing  I may say here  does   Brooke show more in advance of his generation  than in his   opinions as to the right method of governing the Irish Catholics    opinions which have been since  when all but too late  universally   accepted and acted on      In 1747  he wrote four poems for Moore s  Fables for the   Female Sex   one at least of which   The Sparrow and the   Dove   is a beautiful reflection of his own pure wedded life   but    indeed  Henry Brooke is never more noble  not even when he talks   theology  than when he speaks of woman      Two years after  we find him   solicited by a large body of the   independent electors of Dublin to stand for that city   and de    cliningas one would have expected him because there was   another candidate in the field  who was not only  what he was   not  an excelling trader   but had   an acknowledged superiority   in every other merit       Garrick  about this time   offered him a shilling a line for   everything he would write for the stage  provided
