The champion finding himself so smartly handled  changed his battery  and began to expatiate on his own exploits —   You talk of shot  madam   said he  damme    186 I have both given and received some shot in my time—I was wounded in the shoulder by a pistol ball at Dettingen  where—I say nothing—but by G—d  if it had not been for me—all s one for that—I despise boasting  G—d d—me  —  So saying  he whistled one part and hummed another of Black Joke  then addressing himself to the lawyer  went on thus    Wouldn t you think it damn d hard  after having  at the risk of your life  recovered the standard of a regiment  that had been lost  to receive no preferment for your pains  I don t chuse to name no names  sink me  but howsomever  this I will refer  by G—d  and that is this  a musqueteer of the French guards  having taken a standard from a certain cornet of a certain regiment  damme  was retreating with his prize as fast as his horse s heels could carry him  damme  Upon which  I snatched up a firelock that belonged to a dead man  damme  and shot his horse under him  d—n my blood  The fellow got upon his feet and began to repose me  upon which I charged my bayonet breast high  and run him through the body  by G—d —One of his comrades coming to his assistance  shot me in the shoulder  as I told you before  and another gave me a confusion on the head with the butt end of his carbine  but damme  that did not signify—I killed one  put the other to flight  and taking up the standard carried it off very deliberately—But the best joke of all was  the son of a b—ch of a cornet who had surrendered it in a cowardly manner  seeing it in my possession  demanded it from me  in the front of the line  —   D—n my blood   187  sa he  where did you find my standard    says he  —   D—n my blood  said I  where  said I  did you lose it    said I  —   That s nothing to you  says he   tis my standard  says he  and by G—d I ll have it    says he  —   D—n—ti—n seize me  says I  if you shall  says I  till I have first delivered it to the General  says I   and accordingly I went to the head quarters  after the battle  and delivered it to my Lord Stair  who promised to do for me  but I am no more than a poor lieutenant still  d—n my blood      Having vented this repetition of expletives  the lawyer owned he had not been requited according to his deserts  observed  that the labourer is always worthy of his hire  and asked if the promise was made before witnesses  because in that case the law would compel the General to perform it —but understanding that the promise was performed during a tête a tête  over a bottle  without being restricted to time or terms  he pronounced it not valid in law  proceeded to enquire into the particulars of the battle  and affirmed  that although the English had drawn themselves into a premunire at first  the French managed their cause so lamely in the course of the dispute  that they would have been utterly nonsuited  had they not obtained a noli prosequi —In spite of these enlivening touches  the conversation was like to suffer another long interruption  when the lieutenant  unwilling to conceal any of his accomplishments that could be displayed in his present situation  offered to regale the company with a song  and interpreting our silence into a desire of hearing  began to   188 warble a fashionable air  the first stanza of which be pronounced thus    Would task the moon ty d hair    To yon flagrant beau repair    Where waving with the poppling vow   The bantling fine will shelter you   c      The sense of the rest he perverted as he went on  with such surprizing facility  that I could not help thinking he had been at some pains to burlesque the performance —Miss Snapper ascribed it to the true cause  namely ignorance  and when he asked her how she relished his musick  answered  that in her opinion  the musick and the words were much of a piece —   O  d—n my blood   said he  I take that as a high compliment  for every body allows the words are damnable fine  —   They may be so   replied the lady  for ought I know  but they are above my comprehension  —   I an t obliged to find you comprehension  madam  curse me    cried he  —   No  nor to speak sense neither    said she  —   D—n my heart  said he  I ll speak what I please  —  Here the lawyer interposed  by telling him there were some
