was concluded in the manner we began the morning  my youngest boys being appointed to read the lessons of the day  and he that read loudest  distinctest  and best  was to have an halfpenny on Sunday to put in the poor s box   When Sunday came  it was indeed a day of finery  which all my sumptuary edicts could not restrain  How well so ever I fancied my lectures against pride had conquered the vanity of my daughters  yet I still found them secretly attached to all their former finery  they still loved laces  ribbands  bugles and catgut  my wife herself retained a passion for her crimson paduasoy  because I formerly happened to say it became her   The first Sunday in particular their behaviour served to mortify me  I had desired my  Page  38  girls the preceding night to be drest early the next day  for I always loved to be at church a good while before the rest of the congregation  They punctually obeyed my directions  but when we were to assemble in the morning at breakfast  down came my wife and daughters  drest out in all their former splendour  their hair plaistered up with pomatum  their faces patched to taste  their trains bundled up into an heap behind  and rustling at every motion  I could not help smiling at their vanity  particularly that of my wife  from whom I expected more discretion  In this exigence  therefore  my only resource was to order my son  with an important air  to call our coach  The girls were amazed at the command  but I repeated it with more solemnity than before —   Surely  my dear  you jest    cried my wife    we can walk it perfectly well  we want no coach to carry us now     You mistake  child    returned I    we do want a coach  for if we walk to church in this trim  the very children in the parish  Page  39  will hoot after us for a show    —   Indeed    replied my wife    I always imagined that my Charles was fond of seeing his children neat and handsome about him    —   You may be as neat as you please    interrupted I    and I shall love you the better for it  but all this is not neatness  but frippery  These rufflings  and pinkings  and patchings  will only make us hated by all the wives of all our neighbours  No  my children    continued I  more gravely    those gowns may be altered into something of a plainer cut  for finery is very unbecoming in us  who want the means of decency  I don t know whether such flouncing and shredding is becoming even in the rich  if we consider  upon a moderate calculation  that the nakedness of the indigent world may be cloathed from the trimmings of the vain      This remonstrance had the proper effect  they went with great composure   Page  40  that very instant  to change their dress  and the next day I had the satisfaction of finding my daughters  at their own request employed in cutting up their trains into Sunday waistcoats for Dick and Bill  the two little ones  and what was still more satisfactory  the gowns seemed improved by being thus curtailed   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  V   A new and great acquaintance introduced  What we place most hopes upon  generally proves most fatal   AT a small distance from the house my predecessor had made a seat  overshaded by an hedge of hawthorn and honeysuckle  Here  when the weather was fine  and our labour soon finished  we usually all sate together  to enjoy an extensive landschape  in the calm of the evening  Here too we drank tea  which now was become an occasional banquet  and as we had it but seldom  it diffused a new joy  the preparations for it being made with no small share of bustle and ceremony  On these occasions  our two little ones always read for us  and they were regularly served after we had done  Sometimes  to give a variety to our amusements  the girls  Page  42  sung to the guitar  and while they thus formed a little concert  my wife and I would stroll down the sloping field  that was embellished with blue bells and centaury  talk of our children with rapture  and enjoy the breeze that wafted both health and harmony   In this manner we began to find that every situation in life might bring its own peculiar pleasures  every morning waked us to a repetition of toil  but the evening repaid it with vacant hilarity   It was about the beginning of autumn  on a holiday  for I kept such as intervals of relaxation from labour  that I had drawn out my family to our usual place of amusement  and our young musicians began their usual concert  As we were thus engaged  we saw a stag bound nimbly by  within about twenty paces of where we were sitting  and by its panting  it seemed prest by the hunters
