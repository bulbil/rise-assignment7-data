knew some of them to be men of real genius  how ridiculous soever their  carriage might be modified  and was of that laughing disposition  which  is always seeking food for mirth  as Horace observes of Philippus   Risus undique quaerit     he resolved to frequent the college  notwithstanding this accident   which happened at his inauguration  being thereto  moreover  induced by  his desire of knowing the private history of the stage  with which he  supposed some of the members perfectly well acquainted  He was also  visited  before the next meeting  by his introductor  who assured him   that such a tumult had never happened since the first institution of the  assembly  till that very night  and promised that  for the future  he  should have no cause to be scandalized at their behaviour   Persuaded by these motives and assurances  he trusted himself once more  in the midst of their community  and everything proceeded with great  decorum  all dispute and altercation was avoided  and the college    6 22 15  3 45 PM   applied itself seriously to the purposes of its meeting  namely  to hear  the grievances of individuals  and assist them with salutary advice   The first person that craved redress was a noisy North Briton  who  complained  in a strange dialect  that he had  in the beginning of the  season  presented a comedy to the manager of a certain theatre  who   after it had lain six weeks in his hands  returned it to the author   affirming there was neither sense nor English in the performance   The president  who  by the bye  had revised the piece  thinking his own  reputation concerned  declared  in presence of the whole society   that  with regard to sense  he would not undertake to vindicate the  production  but  in point of language  no fault could be justly laid to  its charge   The case  however  is very plain   said he   the manager  never gave himself the trouble to peruse the play  but formed a judgment  of it from the conversation of the author  never dreaming that it had  undergone the revisal of an English writer  be that as it will  you are  infinitely obliged to him for having despatched you so soon  and I shall  have the better opinion of him for it so long as I live  for I have  known other guise authors than you  that is  in point of interest and  fame  kept in continual attendance and dependence during the best part  of their lives  and  after all  disappointed in the expectation of  seeing their performances exhibited on the stage    CHAPTER XCIV   Further proceedings of the College   This affair was no sooner discussed  than another gentleman exhibited a  complaint  signifying  that he had undertaken to translate into English  a certain celebrated author  who had been cruelly mangled by former  attempts  and that  soon as his design took air  the proprietors of  those miserable translations had endeavoured to prejudice his work  by  industrious insinuations  contrary to truth and fair dealing  importing   that he did not understand one word of the language which he pretended  to translate  This being a case that nearly concerned the greatest part  of the audience  it was taken into serious deliberation  Some observed   that it was not only a malicious effort against the plaintiff  but also  a spiteful advertisement to the public  tending to promote an inquiry  into the abilities of all other translators  few of whom  it was well  known  were so qualified as to stand the test of such examination   Others said  that over and above this consideration  which ought to have  its due weight with the college  there was a necessity for concerting  measures to humble the presumption of booksellers  who had  from  time immemorial  taken all opportunities to oppress and enslave their  authors  not only by limiting men of genius to the wages of journeymen  tailors  without even allowing them one Sabbath in the week  but also  in taking such advantages of their necessities as were inconsistent with  justice and humanity    For example   said one of the members   after I myself had acquired a  little reputation with the town  I was caressed by one of those tyrants   who professed a friendship for me  and even supplied me with money     6 22 15  3 45 PM   according to the exigencies of my situation  so that I looked upon  him as the mirror of disinterested benevolence  and had he known my  disposition  and treated me accordingly  I should have writ for him upon  his own terms  After I had used his friendship in this manner for some  time  I happened to have occasion for a small sum of money  and with  great confidence made another application to my good friend  when all of  a sudden he put a stop to his generosity  refused to accommodate me  in the most abrupt
