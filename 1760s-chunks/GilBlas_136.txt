given you so excellent a character  that he would let me have no peace till I consented to part with you  He is a very worthy old nobleman  so that you will be quite in your element in his family   I thanked Aurora for all her kindness  and  as my occupation was over about her  I so much the more readily accepted the post that offered  as it was merely a transfer from one branch of the Pachecos to another  One morning  therefore  I called on the illustrious Don Gonzales with a message from the bride  He ought at least to have over slept himself  for he was in bed at near noon  When I went into his chamber  a page had just brought him a basin of soup which he was taking  The dotard cherished his whiskers  or rather tortured them with curling papers  though his eyes were sunk in their sockets  his complexion pale  and his visage emaciated  This was one of those old codgers who have been a little whimsical or so in their youth  and have made poor amends for their freedoms by the discretion of their riper age  His reception of me was affable enough  with an assurance that if my attachment to him kept pace with my fidelity to his niece  my condition should not be worse than that of my fellows  I promised to place him in my late mistress s shoes  and became the working partner in a new firm   A new firm it undoubtedly was  and heaven knows we had a strange head of the house  The resurrection of Lazarus was an ordinary event compared to his getting up  Imagine to yourself a long bag of dry bones  a mere skeleton  a dissection  an anatomy of a man  a study in osteology  As for the legs  three or four pair of stockings one over the other  had no room to make any figure upon them  In addition to the foregoing  this mummy before death was asthmatic  and therefore obliged to divide the little breath he had between his cough and his loquacity  He breakfasted on chocolate  On the strength of that refreshment  he ventured to call for pen  ink  and paper  and to write a short note  which he sealed and sent to its address by the page who had administered the broth  But this henceforth will be your office  my good lad  said he  as he turned his haggard eyes upon me  all my little concerns will be in your hands  and especially those in which Donna Euphrasia takes an interest  That lady is an enchanting young creature  with whom I am distractedly in love  and by whom  though I say it who should not say it  I am met with all the mutual ardour of inextinguishable and unutterable passion   Heaven defend us  thought I within myself  good now  if this old antidote to rapture can fancy himself an object on which the fair should waste their sweets  is it any wonder that among our young folks each fancies himself the Adonis  for whom every Venus pines  Gil Blas  pursued he with a chuckle  this very day will I take you to this abode of pleasure  it is my house of call almost every evening for a bit of supper  You will be quite petrified at her modest appearance  and the rigid propriety of her behaviour  Far from taking after those little wanton vagrants  who are hey  go mad after striplings  and give themselves up to the fascinations of exterior appearance  she has a proper insight into things  staid  ripe  and judicious  what she wants is the bon√¢ fide spirit and discretion of a man  a lover who has served an apprenticeship to his trade  in preference to all the flashy fellows of the modern school  This is but an epitome of the panegyric  which the noble dupe Don Gonzales pronounced upon his mistress  He burdened himself with the task of proving her a compendium of all human perfection  but the lecture was little calculated for the conviction of the hearer  I had attended an experimental course among the actresses  and had always found that the elderly candidates had been plucked in their amours  Yet  as a matter of courtesy  it was impossible not to put on the semblance of giving implicit credit to my master s veracity  I even added chivalry to courtesy  and threw down my glove on Euphrasia s penetration and the correctness of her taste  My impudence went the length of asserting  that it was impossible for her to have selected a better provided crony  The grown up simpleton was not aware that I was fumigating his nostrils at the expense of his addled brain  on the contrary  he bristled at my praises  so true is it  that a flatterer may play what game he likes against the pigeons of high life  They let you look over their hand  and then wonder that you beat them   The old crawler  having scribbled through his billet doux  restrained the luxuriance of a straggling hair or two with his tweezers  then bathed his eyes in the nostrum of some perfumer to give them a brilliancy which their natural gum would have eclipsed  His ears were to be picked and washed  and his hands to be cleansed from
