 of whom she is extremely fond  that she went to reside with her sister  in order to support them more agreeably to their rank  their father having been a general officer  and a man of high birth  Lady V——’s jointure is a thousand pound a year  but as I hear the family make a respectable figure in the country  and I am sure Lady V——’s fondness for her nieces  would induce her to save what she could  in order to leave them something at her death  I cannot reconcile it to her prudence  notwithstanding the liberality of her spirit  and the friendship she has for me  that she should make so considerable a present  at the same time give me as it were an unbounded letter of credit on her  Had she sent me the sixth part of the sum  I should not have doubted its being only the effects of her kindness towards me  and in her present situation  as considerable a proof of it  as she ought in regard to have given to one whom she has already bound under strong obligations  But the largeness of the sum renders it suspicious  and to tell you the secret inspirations of my heart  I fear it comes from a different quarter   I made Mrs Faulkland acquainted with my mother’s death  about the same time that I informed Lady V—— of it  To neither did I give the most distant hint of my circumstances  yet Mr Faulkland knows they cannot be happy  He too knows better than any body  how far Sir George’s resentment may carry him  Is it not natural then  my dear  to imagine that this man  who is generosity itself  should have taken this method of making Lady V—— the channel through which he conveys his liberality  I am sure it must be so  It is three weeks since Lady V—— had the notice of my mother’s death  Why thought she not sooner of reaching out her supporting hand  if she imagined I stood in need of it  I gave her no cause to believe I did  otherwise I make no question of her ready friendship  as far as her abilities would go  but she could not know as well as Mr Faulkland how much my    brother was exasperated against me  and therefore could not suppose me to be as destitute as I really am  She desires to know how my brother and I stand  This question is not Her’s  Sir George  for his own credit  perhaps has not told Mr Faulkland what his conduct has been towards me  but he wants to be informed  Contriving man  I will disappoint him  nor shall he heap such obligations on me as must sink me under their weight  I will not receive this suspected gift of Lady V——‘s  but it is a delicate point  and  whilst I refuse  I must take care not to offend  I will send Lady V—— her bill back again  but in such a manner as to shew her  I refuse her gift for no other reason but its being too valuable   November 24  See  my Cecilia  whether I have succeeded in my endeavours to refuse  with a good grace  my Lady V——’s offered kindness   This is my answer to her   To Lady V——   ‘You oppress me  my dear and ever honoured Lady V——  by a generosity and friendship that knows no bounds  Why will you force me to appear proud  or ungrateful  by refusing the favours of so true a friend  But  my dear Madam  do not believe me either the one or the other  Had you sent me a trifling token of your love  you would have been convinced of my respect for you  by the thankfulness with which I would have accepted it  but do not seek to humble me so far  my good Lady V——  by heaping favours on me  which I can never have a prospect of returning  With equal respect and gratitude  permit me  Madam  to return your too considerable present  I cannot in honour  receive a liberality  which I am so little intitled to  and the less  as Justice now demands  that your bounteous heart  so diffusive in its generosity  should a little restrain itself   ‘I cannot say that my circumstances are as happy as they have been  yet have I  I thank Heaven  accommodated my mind to them  My brother has not been in town since my mother’s death  but I am not without hope that he will make my situation easy  On this account  I know my dear Lady V—— will the more readily pardon my refusal of her obliging offer  and believe that her goodness is not bestowed on an unthankful heart   ‘I am   c ’    In this letter I re inclosed her bill  and have sent it off  Did I not well  my Cecilia  If  as I strongly suspect  this present came from Mr Faulkland  I should never endure myself  had I retained it  If it should have really come from Lady V—— herself  I must still approve my own conduct  The sum  circumstanced as she now is  was certainly too much for her to bestow  or me to receive
