true  Chevalier  You  who were always telling me how dearly they all loved me  will hardly believe it  I suppose  Nothing now is said  but You shall  Clementina —from those who used to call me Sister  and dear Sister  at every word   They said  I was well  and quite well  and ought to be treated with a high hand—I know from whom   321 they have that  From myself  I said so to Mrs  Beaumont  but she need not to have told them  I won t go to her again  for that  They say I shall  God help me  I don t know where to go for a quiet mind  A high hand won t do  Chevalier  I wish I knew what would  I would tell it to them  I once thought it would  else I had not said it to Mrs  Beaumont  But let them go on with their high hand•  with all my heart  That heart will not hold always  It had been gone before now  had not Mrs  Beaumont got out of me—Something—I won t tell you what—And then they sent for Somebody—And Somebody came—And what then —They need not threaten me so—Somebody is not so much to blame as they will have it he is  And that Somebody did make proposals—Did you not  Chevalier —I had like to have betrayed myself—I stopt just in time   But  Chevalier  I ll tell you a secret—Don t speak of it to any body—May I depend upon you —I know I may  Why  Camilla tells me  that the Count of Belvedere is to come again—Are you not sorry for your poor pupil  But I ll tell you another secret—And that is  what I intend to say to him—   Look you here  my Lord  you are a very good sort of a man  and you have great estates  You are very rich  You are  in short  a very good sort of man  but there is  however  a man in the world with whom I had rather live in the poorest hermitage in a wilderness  than with you in the richest palace in the world    After this  if he be not the creeping mean man you said he was not  he will be answered—Every thing you said to me in former happy times  I rememher  You always said things to me  that were sit to be remembered  Yet I don t tell you who my hermit is  that I had rather live with  Perhaps there is no such man  But this  you know  will be a sufficient answer to the Count of Belvedere  Don t you think so       322 Here I have been tormented again —Would you think it  I have been pleading for somebody  boldly  confidently  I said I could depend upon his honour  Ah  Chevalier  Don t you think I might —I am to be locked up  and I can t tell what —They won t let me see somebody—They won t let me see my poor Jeronymo —You and I  and Jeronymo  are all put together —I don t care  as I tell Camilla  I don t care  They will quite harden me   But just now my mamma  O she is the best of mothers —My mamma tells me  She will not persuade me  if I will be patient  if I will be good  My dear mamma  as I told her  I will be patient  and good  But don t let them inveigh against the Chevalier  then  What harm has he done —Was he not—Ah  Sir  now I blush —Was he not sent for —And did he not weep over me—Yet none of your bold men  who look as proudly as if they were sure of your approbation —Well  but what do you think my mamma said—Ah  Clementina  said she  would to God the Chevalier for his own sake  yes  she said for his own sake  and that made a great impression upon me  it was so good  you know  of my mamma  that the Chevalier was in England  or a thousand miles off  So  Sir  this is my advice—Pray take it  for I and Camilla heard some words  and Camilla  as  well as I  is much troubled about them—Get away to England as soon as you can—Be sure do —And some months hence  bring your two sisters over with you  and by that time all our feuds will be over  you know  And you shall take a house  and then I can go and visit your sisters  you know  and your sisters will visit us  You will come sometimes with them  Won t you  Well  and I ll tell you how we will pass part of our time  They shall perfect me in my English  I will perfect them in Italian  They know as much of that  I suppose  at least  as I do of English  And we will visit every court  and every city    323 So  God bless you  Sir  and get away  as soon as you can  I put no name  for fear this should miscarry  and I
