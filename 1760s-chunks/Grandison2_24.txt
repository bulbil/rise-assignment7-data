which was so contrary to all laws divine and human  and particularly to that true heroism which Christianity enjoins  when it recommends meekness  moderation  and humility  as the glory of the human nature  But I am running into length   Again Sir Charles took out his watch  They were clamorous for him to proceed   When I found  continued he  that this unchristian custom owed its rise to the barbarous northern nations  who had  however  some plea to make in excuse  which we have not  as they were governed by particular lords  and were not united under one head or government  to which  as to a last resort  persons supposing themselves aggrieved  might appeal for legal redress  and that these barbarous nations were truly barbarous  and enemies to all politeness  my reasoning on this occasion added new force to prejudices so well founded     59 The gentlemen seemed afraid  that Sir Charles had done speaking  They begged he would go on   I then had recourse  proceeded he  to the histories of nations famous for their courage  That of the Romans  who by that quality obtained the empire of the world  was my first subject  I found not any traces in their history  which could countenance the sa age custom  When a dispute happen d  the challenge from both parties generally was     That each should appear at the head of the army the next engagement  and give proofs of his intrepidity against the common foe    The instance of the Horatii and Curiatii  which was a publick  a national combat  as I may call it  affords not an exception to my observation  And yet even that  in the early ages of Rome  stands condemned by a better example  For we read  that Tullus challenged Albanus  general of the Albans  to put the cause of the two nations upon the valour of each captain s arm  for the sake of sparing a greater essusion of blood  But what was the answer of Albanus  tho  the inducement to the challenge was so plausible    That the cause was a publick  not a private one  and the decision lay upon the two cities of Alba and Rome      Many ages afterwards  Augustus received a challenge from Mark Antony  Who  gentlemen  thought of branding as a coward that prince  on his answering     That if Antony were weary of his life  he night find many other ways to end it than by his sword      Metellus  before that  challenged by Sertorius  answer d with his pen  not his sword     That it was not for a captain to die the death of a common soldier      The very Turks know nothing of this savage custom  And they are a nation that raised themselves by their bravery from the most obscure beginnings into one of the greatest empires on the globe  at this day  They take occasion to exalt themselves above   60 Christians  in this very instance  and think it a scandal upon Mussulmans to quarrel  and endeavour to wreak their private vengeance on one another   All the Christian doctrines  as I have hinted  are in point against it  But it is dreadful to reflect  that the man who would endeavour to support his arguments against this infamous practice of duelling  by the Laws of Christianity  tho  the most excellent of all Laws  Excuse me  Mr  Merceda  your own are included in them  would subject himself to the ridicule of persons who call themselves Christians  I have mentioned therefore Heathens and Mahometans  tho  in this company  perhaps—But I hope I need not  however  remind any body here  That that one doctrine of returning good for evil  is a nobler and more heroic doctrine than either of those people  or your own  Mr  Merceda  ever knew   Mr  Jord  You have shewn it  Sir Charles  by example  by practice  to be so  I never saw an hero till now   Sir Ch  One modern instance  however  of a challenge refused  I recollect  and which may be given  by way of inference  at least  to the advantage of my argument  The army of the famous Mareschal Turenne  in revenge for injuries more than hostile  as was pretended  had committed terrible depredations in the Palatinate  The Elector  incensed at the unsoldierly destruction  challenged the Mareschal to a single combat  The Mareschal s answer was to this effect     That if the trust which the King his master had reposed in him  would permit him to accept of his challenge  he would not refuse it  but on the contrary  would deem it an honour to measure his arms with those of so illustrious a Prince  But that  for the sake of his master s service  he must be excused      Now  tho  I think the Mareschal might have returned a still better answer  tho  this was not a bad   61 one for a military man   yet where we can  as Christians and as Men  plead the
