in a fright  muttering curses as she went down stairs  We afterwards learned that she was married to an ensign  who had already spent all her fortune  and that her sister had bore a child to her mother s footman  who is now her husband  and keeps a petty ale house in the country     The fame of our flourishing condition having arrived at this place before us  we got notice that the magistrates intended next day to compliment us with the freedom of their town    363 upon which my father  considering their complaisance in the right point of view  ordered the horses to the coach early in the morning  when we proceeded to our estate  which lay about a dozen miles from this place   When we came within half a league of the house  we were met by a prodigious number of poor tenants  men  women and children  who testified their joy by loud acclamations  and accompanied our coach to the gate —As there is no part of the world  in which the peasants are more attached to their Lords  than in Scotland  we were almost devoured by their affection  in getting out of the coach  My father had always been their favourite  and now that he appeared their master  after being thought dead so long  their joy broke out into a thousand extravagancies  When we got into the court yard  we were surrounded by a vast number  who crowded together so closely to see us  that several were in danger of being squeezed to death  those who were near Don Rodriguez fell upon their knees  and kissed his hand  o the hem of his garment  praying aloud for long life and prosperity to him  others approached Narcissa and me in the same manner  while the rest clapped their hands at a distance  and invoked heaven to shower its choicest blessings on our heads —In short  the whole scene  though rude  was so affecting  that the gentle partner of my heart wept over it  and my father himself could not refrain from dropping a tear   Having welcomed his daughter and me to his house  he ordered some bullocks to be killed  and some hogsheads of ale to be brought from   364 the neighbouring village  to regale those honest people  who had not enjoyed such a holiday for many years before   Next day we were visited by the gentlemen in the neighbourhood  most of them our relations  one of whom brought along with him my cousin  the fox hunter  who had staid at his house  since he was obliged to leave his own  My father was generous enough to receive him kindly  and even promise to purchase for him a commission in the army  at which he expressed great thankfulness and joy   My charming Narcissa was universally admired and loved for her beauty  affability and good sense  and so well pleased with the situation of the place  and the company around  that she has not  as yet  discovered the least desire of changing her habitation   We had not been many days settled  when I prevailed upon my father to pay a visit to the village where I had been at school  Here we were received by the principal inhabitants  who entertained us in the church  where Mr  Syntax the schoolmaster  my tyrant being dead  pronounced a Latin speech in honour of our family  And none exerted themselves more than Strap s father and relations  who looked upon the honest valet as the first gentleman of their race  and honoured his benefactors accordingly —Having received the homage of this place  we retired  leaving forty pounds for the benefit of the poor of the parish  and that very night  Strap being a little elevated with the regard that had been shewn to him  and to me on his account  ventured to tell me  that he had a sneaking kindness   365 for Miss Williams  and that if his lady and I would use our interest in his behalf  he did not doubt that she would listen to his addresses  Surprized at this proposal  I asked if he knew the story of that unfortunate young gentlewoman  Upon which  he replied     Yes  yes  I know what you mean—she has been unhappy  I grant you—but what of that  I am convinced of her reformation  or else you and my good lady would not treat her with such respect —As for the censure of the world  I value it not a fig s end—besides  the world knows nothing of the matter    I commended his philosophy  and interested Narcissa in his cause  who interceded so effectually  that in a little time  Miss Williams  yielded her consent  and they were married with the approbation of Don Rodriguez  who gave him five hundred pounds to stock a farm  and made him overseer of his estate  My generous bedfellow gave her maid the same sum  so that they live in great peace and plenty within half a mile of us  and daily put up prayers for our preservation     If there be such a thing as true happiness on earth  I enjoy it —The impetuous transports of my passion are now settled and mellowed into endearing fondness and tranquillity of love  rooted by
