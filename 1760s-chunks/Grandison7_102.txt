of the man  And you own that your heart is far from being indifferent to Lord Reresby—Good girl —Confirmation of all my Doctrines  We women prate and prate of what we can  and what we can not  what we ought  and what we ought not  to do  But none of us stay till we are asked mortals know what we shall  or can do  till we are tried by the power of determining being put into our hands  Was it possible for me to have loved that sorry wretch Anderson  so well as I really love my honest Lord G  It was not  But   262 tho  I name that creature myself  never do you presume to do it  I blush even to this hour at looking back to certain giddinesses that debased my character—But let me quit a subject so disagreeable   Lady Clementina has had a bad night▪ it seems—Came not down to breakfast  The poor Enamore to was in despair  I tried to hearten him up a little  But my brother will not let any body flatter him with a hope that too probably may end in disappointment   Yonder  I am writing at my window  you must know  is the fair Inflexible musing in the garden  I have a good mind to call to her  for I see by her motions and downcast looks  that Resverie is no favourable sign for the Count—No need of my calling to her  my Prother has this minute joined her  As soon as he came in sight  she went to him —Now  dear brother  put in a word for the poor man   Well  but Lucy  this Lord of yours must come among us  He snall not carry you to Ireland this year  Let all who would be good husbands and good wives  come to Grandison hall  and learn  And  pray  let them come while I am here  Yet I have something to say against our Harriet too —She is so taken up with her heroic friendship  that Clementina is now almost the only subject of her pen  What godlike instances of my brother s goodness does she leave untold tho  she admires him for them  as much as ever  Every rising  every setting fun  are witnesses of his divine Philanthropy  I suppose she looks upon his praises now to be her own  Well she may  Never were hearts so united  so formed for one another  But Harriet used to praise herself formerly  Did she not  uncle Selby   Believe me  I will praise my honest man whenever he gives me cause  For instance  Yesterday  I was well enough pleased with what he said to my   263 brother —You  Sir Charles  ought not to give yourself up to a private life  Your country has a claim upon such a character as yours   Without doubt  said I—Shall we  my Lord  make my brother an embassador  or a justice of peace  Lord G  rubbed his forehead  but seeing me smile  his countenance brightened up  Don t you know  Charlotte  said my brother  that nothing but the engagements our noble guests have given me  would have prevented me from acting in the useful character you have last named   O that you had  brother  What admirable causes would then have been brought before US  en dernier ressort  How delightfully would your time have been taken up with the appeals of scolding wives  forsaken damsels  and witches presumptive   L dy G  most be herself  whatever be the subject  replied Sir Charles  You and I love her  my Lord  for her charming vivacity  But think you  my sister  that a day spent in doing good  be the objects of it ever so low  is not more pleasing to reflect upon▪ than a day of the most elegant indulgence  Would persons of sense and distinction  myself out of the question  more frequently than they do  undertake the task  it would be lighter to every one  and would keep the great power vested in this class of magistrates  and which is every year increasing  out of mean and mercenary hands  And  surely  men of consideration in the world owe it to their tenants and neighbours  and to those of their fellow creatures to whose industry they are obliged for their affluence  to employ in their service  those advantages of rank and education  which make it perhaps easy for them to clear up and adjust  in half an hour  matters that would be of endless perplexity and entanglement to the parties concerned   Mind this  uncle Selby  for I think you are too fond of your own ways and your own ho•rs  to do your duty as an active justice  tho  of the quorum     264 But I should have told you  Lucy  how this conversation began  I got the occasion for it out of Dr  Bartlett af erwards  You must know  that I visit him now and then as Harriet used to do  to learn some of my brother s good deeds  that otherwise would not come to our knowledge  by which I understand that notwithstanding he gives his guests so much of his company  and appears so easy and free
