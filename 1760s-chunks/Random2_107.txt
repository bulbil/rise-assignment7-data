observe two tire of guns in the ship which pursued us  and which was now but two short miles astern  This discovery had an evident effect upon the sailors  who did not scruple to say  that we should be tore to pieces  and blown out of the water  and that if in case any of them should lose their precious limbs  they must go abegging for life  for there was no provision made   322 by the merchants for those poor souls who are maimed in their service  The captain understanding this backwardness  ordered the crew abaft  and spoke to them thus    My lads  I am told you hang an a—se —I have gone to sea thirty years  man and boy  and never saw English sailors afraid before —Mayhap you think I want to expose you for the lucre of gain —Whosoever thinks so  thinks a damned lie  for my whole cargo is insured  so that in case I should be taken  my loss will not be great —The enemy is stronger than we to be sure —What then  have we not a chance for carrying away one of her masts  and so get clear of her —If we find her too hard for us   tis but striking at last —If any man is hurt in the engagement  I promise on the word of an honest seaman  to make them a recompence according to his loss —So now  you that are lazy  lubberly  cowardly dogs  get away  and sculk in the hold  and bread room  and you that are jolly boys  stand by me  and let us give one broad side for the honour of old England    This eloquent harangue was so well adapted to the disposition of his hearers  that one and all of them  pulling off their hats  waved them over their heads  and saluted him with three chears  upon which he sent his boy for two large case bottles of brandy  and having treated every man with a dram  they repaired to their quarters  and waited impatiently for the word of command —I must do my uncle the justice to say  that in the whole of his disposition  he behaved with the utmost intrepidity  conduct and deliberation —The enemy being very near  he ordered me to my station  and was just going to   323 give the word for hoisting the colours  and firing  when the supposed Frenchman  hauled down his white pennant jack and ensign  hoisted English ones  and fired a gun a head of us  This was a joyful event to captain Bowling  who immediately shewed his colours  and fired a gun to leeward  Upon which the other ship run alongside of him  hailed him  and giving him to know that she was an English man of war of forty guns  ordered him to hoist out his boat and come on board —This he performed with the more alacrity  because upon enquiry  he found that she was commanded by an old mess mate of his  who was overjoyed to see him  detained him to dinner  and sent his barge for the supercargo and me  who were very much caressed on his account —As this commander was destined to cruise upon the French  in the latitude of Martinico  his stem and quarters were adorned with white flowers de lis  and the whole shell of the ship so much disguised  for a decoy to the enemy  that it was no wonder my uncle did not know her  although he had sailed on board of her many years —We kept company with her four days  during which time the captains were never asunder  and then parted  our course lying different from hers     In less than a fortnight after  we made the land of Guinea  near the mouth of the river Gambia  and trading along the coast as far to the southward of the Line as Angola and Bengula  in less than six months disposed of the greatest part of our cargo  and purchased four hundred negroes  my adventure having been laid out chiefly in gold dust     324 Our compliment being made up  we took our departure from Cape Negro  and arrived in the Rio de la Plata in six weeks  having met with nothing remarkable in our voyage  except an epidemic fever  not unlike the jail distemper  which broke out among our slaves  and carried off a good many of the ship s company  among whom I lost one of my mates  and poor Strap had well nigh given up the ghost —Having produced our passport to the Spanish governor  we were received with great courtesy  sold our slaves in a very few days  and could have put off five times the number at our own price  being obliged to smuggle the rest of our merchandize  consisting of European bale goods  which however we made shift to dispose of at a great advantage     325  CHAP  LXVI    I am invited to the Villa of a Spanish Don  where we meet with an English gentleman  and make a very interesting discovery—we leave Buenos Ayres  and arrive at Jamaica   OUR ship being freed from the disagreeable lading of Negroes  to whom indeed I had been a miserable slave  since our leaving the coast of Guinea  I began to
