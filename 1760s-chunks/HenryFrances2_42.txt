— and you  is at an End  though  I am certain  you judged it right   Though we can have no perfect Knowledge of the Attributes of God  I cannot think it Presumption to form an Idea  according to our finite Capacity  that he is just and merciful  If we believe the Bible to be a Work of Inspiration  we must assent to this Opinion  If we consider it as the Work of mere Man  unassisted  uninspired  it appears  that the Result of natural Reason  as far as finite can comprehend infinite  has given us an Idea both of the Almighty and his Attributes  and sure it cannot be criminal to employ that Reason  which he hath bestowed upon us  in Contemplation of his Excellence  The Fault  which I think the Generality of Men  and particularly Divines  run into  is not the Reasoning on the divine Attributes  but daring to set Bounds to what their poor finite Capacities cannot comprehend  —I cannot  by any Means  agree with you  Page  157 that it is probable there should be no Analogy between the divine and human Mind  We believe God to be all wise  all good  We must change the Idea of these Attributes into Folly and Cruelty  if we supposed he did not form the Faculties of our Souls by the most perfect Model—by himself  though he confined their Operation within a narrow Sphere  But when we shall put off this frail Mortality  that now clogs and incloses the Faculties of our Souls  I do believe they will be enlarged  and of what Use could they be  had they no Analogy to the divine Being  in the Contemplation of whose endless Glory and Perfection our chief Happiness will  I presume  consist   I am quite charmed with your Argument for unbounded Mercy  I think it is carried as far as finite Wisdom can go  and  to make use of your own Expression    has shewn  that   God is not made up of Parts  but is one perfect Being   whose Attributes co operate and correspond together     In Compliance with your often repeated Desire  you see I have ventured to touch upon a Subject infinitely beyond my Capacity  but it is in such a Manner  as Boys first learn to swim  conscious I am out of my Depth  and afraid of drowning every Instant  But my dear Teacher Page  158 will  I am sure  reach out his Hand to save his little trembling Pupil  Adieu   Frances   LETTER CCXXXIII  FRANCES to HENRY   AS I am still in the same disagreeable Way  with Regard to my Health  I would not write to my sweet Love this Night  but to prevent his Apprehension of my being worse  There is something extremely odd in my Disorder  as there is not the least Alteration in it  Time has  however  lessened my Feelings  but not abated my Complaints  I own I am greatly alarmed at my Illness  but I will not say more on a Subject  which  I am sure  occasions you almost as much Pain as me   I will not  by any Means  accept either of the Epitaphs  you offer me  unless I should survive you   What a Thought was that   Forgive me  Heaven  when I say  thy Joys  as far as my poor finite Views can reach  could hardly counterpoise my Henry s Loss  I will not  cannot bear to part with thee  My Spirits are much too low  to be able to get the better of this melancholy Reflection  and  believe me  Harry  fully certain as I am of the Mercies of Page  159 my Creator  I find no Pang in the Thoughts of dying  nor do I think I should find a Sting in Death itself  but that of being torn from thee  my Life  my Soul  my Immortality  and could I call it  an Escape  a blest Exchange   ah  no —I must want much of that passionate Regard I feel for thee  e er I can think it Bliss to part from you  I ll not endure the Thought   I hope  indeed  you will take Care to see me laid in some Place  where Death shall not divide our poor Remains    where thou  with frequent Eyes  my Sepulchre may st see   Oh  grant  thou good  thou great  all merciful  and all glorious God  that the last Object  which I view on Earth  may be my Henry  that he may close my Eyes   and smooth my Passage to the Realms of Day     I gladly accept of every Mark of Age  which it shall ever be in your Power to devote to me  provided they give no Hints of your Mortality  I own I rejoice at every Pain  or Sickness  that I feel  which seems to promise I shall not be left behind  for I can much better bear the Thoughts of quitting you  than of your leaving me   Adieu  my Life  my Love  Believe me your s  till Death  and ever after   Frances
