you yourself was concerned  d ye see —For my own part  brother  I put my trust in God  and steer by the compass  and I value not your paw wawing and your conjuration of a rope s end  d ye see    The conjurer was by no means pleased  either with the matter or the manner of this address  He therefore began to soothe the captain s choler  by representing that he did not pretend to omniscience  which was the attribute of God alone  that human art was fallible and imperfect  and all that it could perform was to discover certain partial circumstances of any particular object to which its inquiries were directed  That being questioned by the other man concerning the cause of his master s disappearing  he had exercised his skill upon the subject  and found reason to believe that Sir Launcelot was assassinated  that he should think himself happy in being the instrument of bringing the murderers to justice  though he foresaw they would of themselves save him that trouble  for they would quarrel about dividing the spoil  and one would give information against the other   The prospect of this satisfaction appeased the resentment  and  in some measure  mitigated the grief of Captain Crowe  who took his leave without much ceremony  and  being joined by Crabshaw  proceeded with a heavy heart to the house of Sir Launcelot  where they found the domestics at breakfast  without exhibiting the least symptom of concern for their absent master  Crowe had been wise enough to conceal from Crabshaw what he had learned of the knight s fate  This fatal intelligence he reserved for the ear of his nephew  Mr  Clarke  who did not fail to attend him in the forenoon   As for the squire  he did nothing but ruminate in rueful silence upon the dappled gelding  the nosegay  and the predicted fate of Gilbert  Him he forthwith visited in the stable  and saluted with the kiss of peace  Then he bemoaned his fortune with tears  and by the sound of his own lamentation was lulled asleep among the litter             CHAPTER TWENTY THREE  IN WHICH THE CLOUDS THAT COVER THE CATASTROPHE BEGIN TO DISPERSE   We must now leave Captain Crowe and his nephew Mr  Clarke  arguing with great vehemence about the fatal intelligence obtained from the conjurer  and penetrate at once the veil that concealed our hero  Know then  reader  that Sir Launcelot Greaves  repairing to the place described in the billet which he had received  was accosted by a person muffled in a cloak  who began to amuse him with a feigned story of Aurelia  to which  while he listened with great attention  he found himself suddenly surrounded by armed men  who seized and pinioned down his arms  took away his sword  and conveyed him by force into a hackney coach provided for the purpose  In vain he expostulated on this violence with three persons who accompanied him in the vehicle  He could not extort one word by way of reply  and  from their gloomy aspects  he began to be apprehensive of assassination  Had the carriage passed through any frequented place  he would have endeavoured to alarm the inhabitants  but it was already clear of the town  and his conductors took care to avoid all villages and inhabited houses   After having travelled about two miles  the coach stopped at a large iron gate  which being opened  our adventurer was led in silence through a spacious house into a tolerably decent apartment  which he understood was intended for his bed chamber  In a few minutes after his arrival  he was visited by a man of no very prepossessing appearance  who endeavouring to smooth his countenance  which was naturally stern  welcomed our adventurer to his house  exhorted him to be of good cheer  assuring him he should want for nothing  and desired to know what he would choose for supper   Sir Launcelot  in answer to this civil address  begged he would explain the nature of his confinement  and the reasons for which his arms were tied like those of the worst malefactor  The other postponed till to morrow the explanation he demanded  but in the meantime unbound his fetters  and  as he declined eating  left him alone to his repose  He took care  however  in retiring  to double lock the door of the room  whose windows were grated on the outside with iron   The knight  being thus abandoned to his own meditations  began to ruminate on the present adventure with equal surprise and concern  but the more he revolved circumstances  the more was he perplexed in his conjectures  According to the state of the mind  a very subtle philosopher is often puzzled by a very plain proposition  and this was the case of our adventurer —What made the strongest impression upon his mind was a notion that he was apprehended on suspicion of treasonable practices  by a warrant from the Secretary of State  in consequence of some false malicious information  and that his prison was no other than the house of a messenger  set apart for the accommodation of suspected persons  In this opinion he comforted himself by recollecting his own conscious innocence  and reflecting that he should be entitled to the privilege of
