subsidy  and supplying a con    tingent that fought gloriously at Minden and other battlefields          INTRODUCTION ix     In the East Indies  Olive and Coote were winning victories   and establishing the British ascendency   in the West Indies   our fleet was engaged in a ceaseless struggle with France   and then with Spain  A series of expeditions against the   French in Canada culminated in Wolfe s triumph at Quebec     whilst in the Mediterranean and the narrow seas the navy   and a host of privateers were destroying the enemy s fleete   and making enormous captures of mercantile shipping      At home  when the narrative opens  everything was un    settled  though there was no clear contest of political parties    In 1754 died Henry Pelham  the all powerful leader of the   Whigs  and left to his incompetent brother Newcastle the   task of governing England  From that time onward for   many years ministries were more short lived than ever before    and each carried in its own bosom the elements of disinte    gration  These disruptive forces were the crude personal   aims of the men forming them  many of whom are portrayed   in all their selfishness and turpitude in the s following    The contentious attitude of Henry Fox and Pitt upset the initial   arrangements of the new premier  forcing him to admit the   ambitious and thoroughly unscrupulous Fox into his Cabinet    Newcastle was an unpopular man  and well known to be   unequal to the strain of conducting the affairs of the nation   through the perils of a great war  now recognized as imminent    The country was not only unprepared for war  but in a state   of irresolution  Braddock s defeat before Fort Duquesne    in July 1755  was a terrible shock to Newcastle  who was   bewildered with nervousness  The whole country was in   a state of panic   and  as related by Chrysal  the suspected   movements of the French at Brest and Dunkirk threw the   ministry into humiUating terrors  As a compromise  it was   decided not to declare war  but that French ships  whether   merchantmen or vessels of war  should be seized  and con    vulsive efiorts made to bring the army and navy up to strength    At this point  the government had wind of the threatened   attack on Minorca  Still vacillating  they let the time go   by for interrupting it  and then sent out Byng with a fleet   hastily manned  and orders  so it was alleged  of an indecisive   nature  The fall of Minorca  and the sacrifice of Byng to   the popular outcry  are related here      Meanwhile  the Newcastle ministry had fallen  after desperate   attempts had been made by that famous old dispenser of   patronage to gain the support of WiUiam Pitt  the strongest   statesman of the day  The Duke of Devonshire and Pitt    after considerable negotiation  succeeded in forming a Cabinet     but it could not last in opposition to Newcastle and the powerful     b         X INTRODUCTION     interests he controlled  In five months  Pitt was dismissed    and became the most popular man in England  For eleven   weeks there was no government  although the war was now   in full swing  Then the famous coalition ministry was formed   by Newcastle and Pitt  the latter declaring that he had     borrowed the majority of the Duke of Newcastle to carry   on the government of the country    Under this arrangement   Fox  though excluded by his old rival Pitt from a seat in the   Cabinet  obtained the office of Paymaster of the Forces and   Â£25 000 a year  with unlimited opportunities for peculation    The coalition  in spite of these heterogeneous elements  had   one of the most glorious careers in the annals of British   governments  A series of splendid victories brought the   country out of the depths of panic to the position of mistress   of the seas  and laid the secure foundations of her empire in   East and  West      In 1760  the accession of George III brought a new force   to bear on the strength of this ministry and the continuance   of its policy  The new king had very definite personal in    tentions â€” he meant to govern â€” and his first object was to   break down the Whig ascendency  and get the appointment   of ministers into his own hands  Opposed to the war pohcy   of Pitt  he dissembled his actual purposes for a while  playing   ofi Pitt against Newcastle  and Newcastle against Pitt  by   means of his favourite  the Earl of Bute  whom he proposed
