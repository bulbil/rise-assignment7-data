  Lady G  Sir  seems pleased with the house  She writes  that there is somebody else about it  It may not  then  be to be had   Shall I then commission her to take it directly   What you please  Sir   He bowed to me  and said  Then that matter is settled  And now  madam  let me own all my arts  You would penetrate into them  if I did not  You see that the great question is never out of my view—I cannot but hope and believe  that you are above regarding mere punctilio —Have you  my dearest Miss Byron  thought  can you think  of some early weak  in which to fix my happy day —Some preparation on your part  I presume  will be thought necessary  As to mine  were you to bless me with your hand next week  I should be aforehand in that particular     181 I was silent  I was considering how to find some middle way that should make non compliance appear neither disobliging  nor affected   He looked up at me with Love and Tenderness in his aspect  but  having no answer  proceeded   Your uncle  madam  and Mr  Deane  will inform you  that the settlements are such as cannot be disapproved of  I expect every day some slight tokens of my affection for my dear Miss Byron  which will be adorned by the lovely wearer  I have not been so extravagant in them  as shall make her think I build on toys for her approbation  She will allow me to give her my notions on this subject  In the article of personal appearance  I think that propriety and degree should be consulted  as well as fortune  Our degree  our fortune  madam  is not mean  but I  who always wished for the revival of Sumptuary Laws  have not sought  in this article  to emulate Princes  In my own dress  I am generally a conformist to the fashion  Singularity is usually the indication of something wrong in judgment  I rather perhaps dress too shewy  tho  a young man  for one who builds nothing on outward appearance  But my father loved to be dressed  In matters which regard not morals  I choose to appear to his friends and tenants  as not doing discredit to his magnificent spirit  a   I could not think it becoming  as those perhaps do  who have the direction of the royal stamp on the coin  to set my face the contrary way to that of my predecessor  In a word  all my father s steps  in which I could tread  I did  and have chosen rather to build upon  than demolish  his foundations —But how does my vanity mislead me  I have vanity  madam  I have pride  and some consequential failings  which I cannot always get above  But    182 anxious as I ever shall be for your approbation  my whole heart shall be open to you  and every motive  every spring of action  so far as I can trace it  be it to my advantage or not  shall be made known to you  Happy the day that I became acquainted with Dr  Bartlett  He will tell you  madam  that I am corrigible  You must perfect  by your sweet conversation  un  coupled with fear  what Dr  Bartlett has so happily begun  and I shall then be more worthy of you than at present I am   O  Sir  you do me too much honour  You must be my monitor  As to the ornaments you speak of  I hope I shall always look upon simplicity of manners a grateful return to the man I shall vow to honour  and a worthy behaviour to all around me  as my principal ornaments   His eyes glistened  He bowed his face upon my hand  to hide  as I thought  his emotion  Excellent Miss Byron  said he  Then  after a pause  Now let me say  that I have the happiness to find my humble application to you acceptable to every one of your friends  The only woman on earth whom  besides yourself  I ever could have wished to call mine  and all her ever to be respected family  pleading their own sakes  join their wishes in my favour  and  were you to desire it  would  I am sure  signify as much to you under their own hands  I know not whether I could so far have overcome my own scruples in behalf of your delicay  placing myself  as persons always ought when they hope for favour  in the granter s place  as to supplicate you so soon as I have done  but at the earnest request of a family  and for the sake of a Lady  I must ever hold dear  The world about you expects a speedy celebration  I have not  I own  been backward to encourage the expectation  It was impossible to conceal from it the motive of my coming down  as my abode was at an inn  I came with an equi  because my pride  How great is my pride  permitted   183 me not
