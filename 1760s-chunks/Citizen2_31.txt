each of the owners condescending to mount and be his own driver  The odds at starting were dust against dung five to four  but after half a miles going  the knowing ones found themselves all on the wrong side  and it was turnip against the field  brass to silver   Soon however the contest became more doubtful  Turnip indeed kept the way  but it was perceived that Dung had better bottom  The road re ecchoed with the shouts of the spectators  Dung against Turnip  Turnip against Dung  was now the universal cry  neck and neck  one rode lighter    93 but the other had more judgment  I could not but particularly observe the ardour with which the fair sex espoused the cause of the different riders on this occasion  one was charmed with the unwashed beauties of Dung  another was captivated with the patibulary aspect of Turnip  while in the mean time unfortunate gloomy Dust  who came whipping behind  was cheared by the encouragements of some  and pity of all   The contention now continued for some time  without a possibility of determining to whom victory designed the prize  The winning post appeared in view  and he who drove the turnip cart assured himself of success  and successful he might have been  had his horse been as ambitious as he  but upon approaching a turn from the road  which led homewards  the horse fairly stood still  and refused to move a foot farther  The dung cart had scarce time to enjoy this temporary triumph  when it was pitched headlong into a ditch by the way side  and the rider left to wallow in congenial mud  Dust in the mean time soon came up  and not being far from the post  came in amidst the shouts and acclamations of all the spectators  and greatly caressed by all the quality of Brentford  Fortune was kind only to one  who ought to have been favourable to all  each had peculiar merit  each laboured hard to earn the prize  and each richly deserved the cart he drove   I do not know whether this description may not have anticipated that which I intended giving of Newmarket  I am told there is little else to be seen even there  There may be some minute differences in the dress of the spectators  but none at   94 all in their understandings  the quality of Brentford are as remarkable for politeness and delicacy  as the breeders of Newmarket  The quality of Brentford drive their own carts  and the honourable fraternity of Newmarket ride their own horses  In short  the matches in one place are as rational as those in the other  and it is more than probable  that turnips  dust  and dung  are all that can be found to furnish out description in either   Forgive me  my friend  but a person like me  bred up in a philosophic seclusion  is apt to regard  perhaps with too much asperity  those occurrences which sink man below his station in nature  and diminish the intrinsic value of humanity   LETTER LXXXIV  From Fum Hoam to Lien Chi Altangi   YOU tell me the people of Europe are wise  but where lies their wisdom  You say they are valiant too  yet I have some reasons to doubt of their valour  They are engaged in war among each other  yet apply to the Russians  their neighbours and ours  for assistance  Cultivating such an alliance argues at once imprudence and timidity  All subsidies paid for such an aid is strengthening the Russians  already too powerful  and weakening the employers  already exhausted by intestine commotions   I cannot avoid beholding the Russian empire as the natural enemy of the more western parts of   95 Europe  as an enemy already possessed of great strength  and  from the nature of the government  every day threatening to become more powerful  This extensive empire  which  both in Europe and Asia  occupies almost a third of the old world  was  about two centuries ago  divided into separate kingdoms and dukedoms  and from such a division consequently feeble  Since the times  however  of Johan Basilides  it has encreased in strength and extent  and those untrodden forests  those innumerable savage animals which formerly covered the face of the country  are now removed  and colonies of mankind planted in their room  A kingdom thus enjoying peace internally  possessed of an unbounded extent of dominion  and learning the military art at the expence of others abroad  must every day grow more powerful  and it is probable  we shall hear Russia  in future times  as formerly  called the Officina Gentium   It was long the wish of Peter  their great monarch  to have a fort in some of the western parts of Europe  many of his schemes and treaties were directed to this end  but happily for Europe he failed in them all  A fort in the power of this people would be like the possession of a flood gate  and whenever ambition  interest  or necessity prompted  they might then be able to deluge the whole western world with a barbarous inundation   Believe me  my friend  I cannot sufficiently contemn the politics of Europe  who thus make this powerful people arbitrators in their quarrel
