          2 112       Past Twelve      There is something in agitation with which I am unacquainted  Lord and Lady Belmont have been an hour in close consultation with Lady Mary  la bella Julia is this moment summoned to attend them  This unknown lover  I tremble for Harry  should another          Almost One      I Have your letter  this Russian event    true    as you say  these violent convulsions    Yes  you are right  your reflexions are perfectly just  but my thoughts are at present a little engaged  This consultation I fear bodes Harry no good    Should my Lord s authority    I am on the rack of impatience          The door opens  Lady Julia comes this way  she has been in tears  I tremble at          2 113       the sight    Bellville  they are not tears of sorrow  they are like the dew drops on the morning rose  she looks a thousand times more lovely through them  her eyes have a melting languishment  a softness inexpressible  a sensibility mixed with transport    There is an animation in her look  a blush of unexpected happiness    She moves with the lightness of a wood nymph    Lady Belmont follows with a serene joy in that amiable countenance  They approach  they are already in my apartment   Adio      Bellville  In what words    How shall I explain to you    I am breathless with pleasure and surprise    My Lord    Harry Mandeville    Lady Julia    They were always intended for each other        A letter from Harry this morning  confessing his passion for Lady Julia  determined          2 114       them to make an immediate discovery    Read the enclosed letters  and adore the goodness of Providence  which leads us  by secret ways  to that happiness our own wisdom could never arrive at     To Colonel Mandeville   Belmont  August 10  1752      My dear Col        BY a clause in the patent  which has been hitherto kept secret in our part of the family  it is provided  that  on default of heirs male in the younger branch  the title of Earl of Belmont should go to the elder  in favor also of this disposition  the greatest part of the estate then in our possession  which is about half what I now enjoy  is  by a deed  in which  however  my lawyer tells me there is a flaw which          2 115       makes it of no effect  annexed to the title for ever  Julia being the only child we ever had  it is very probable the estate and title will be yours  Heaven having blest you with a son  it would be infinitely agreeable to me  and would keep up the splendor of our name  to agree on an inter marriage between our children  I would have you educate your son with this view  and at an expence becoming the heir of the titles and possessions of our family  but  as it is possible I may yet have a son  in that case  Lady Mary  our relation  whose heart is greatly set on this marriage  will settle her estate on yours  and I will give him my daughter  with twenty thousand pounds      I insist on being at the whole expence of his education as my heir  as the estate will probably be his own  it is only anticipating his rents a few years  and does not lay him under the shadow of an obligation            2 116          I have mentioned above  that there is a defect in the deed  which puts it in my power to rob you of your right in the estate  but  as the design of our ancestor is clear  I take no merit to myself from not being the most infamous of mankind  which I should be  were I capable of making use of such a circumstance to your disadvantage        But  could I reconcile so base an action to myself in a private light  no consideration could make it easy to me in a public one  I know nothing so dangerous to our happy constitution as an indigent nobility  chained down to a necessity of court dependence  or tempted  by making faction the tool of ambition  to disturb the internal peace of their country  Men who are at ease in their fortunes are generally good subjects  the preservation of what they have is a powerful tie of obedience  it is the needy  the dissolute  the CÃ¦sars  the Catilines of
