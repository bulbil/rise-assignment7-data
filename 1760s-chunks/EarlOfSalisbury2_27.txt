followers  whose sword was now ready to descend with fury upon his head   But I stopped his arm  and  perceiving our situation  that we were  unseconded  and now surrounded by our enemies  I deemed it madness to  provoke them by any farther resistance  I yielded myself a prisoner   and the few who had leaped on board with me  soon followed my example   At first  the attention of our enemies was wholly engaged on securing  their escape  When they had left our vessel at sufficient distance   their captain accosted me  and  with a gloomy courtesy  thanked me for  rescuing him from his danger  I answered  that  as he had experienced  our valour  and  when we still might have sold our liberties at a dearer  rate  we had declined the effusion of blood  I hoped he would treat us  nobly  He demanded to know who we were  and what our purpose  He had  taken us  he said  for merchants  that  as he approached  our numbers  and appearance had alarmed his people  but  as we had made every attempt  in our power to avoid him  he was encouraged to persevere in his design  of attacking us  that he himself lived by plunder  and he suspected   that we were engaged in the same pursuit         — If  so we might unite our force with his  and share his fortunes         To convince him of his mistake  I informed him freely of my country  my  condition  and my destination  earnestly conjuring him to restore me to  my companions  and promising the most ample rewards for a service so  important             Let me once regain my countrymen         said I       and they shall enrich thee with such a ransom  as shall exceed thy  wishes         But not all my promises could prevail upon      the pirate again to seek our ship  He had experienced our force  and  dreaded a severe revenge for his attempt  Yet my repeated sollicitations  at length so far prevailed  that  after some time ineffectually roving  in search of prey  he proposed to keep three of my companions and myself  on board  to land the rest  with a small number of his own men  on the  coast of England   as it was probable our friends had sought this coast   and that  if they could regain them and send back the stipulated ransom   I should then be free  I gladly embraced this proposal  The pirate  steered towards the land  the coast was alarmed at the sight of his  vessel  but to prevent all opposition  we chose the dead hour of night   and sent off our men in a boat  which brought them unnoticed to shore   They travelled for some time  ere they had the good fortune to find  those of our attendants whom Lord Chauvigny had left to treat for my  liberty  At length  however  they were found  and the men returned   unmolested  with my ransom  To this I added a rich jewel taken from my  finger  which I presented to the pirate  in acknowledgement of my  gratitude             I now hastened to join my friends  and from them I learned that Lord  Chauvigny had proceeded to the city of Marlborough  I was earnest to  follow him  but my fatigues demanded some refreshment  I was conducted  to the house of an inhabitant of the coast  who received me with all  hospitable kindness —Let us unite in adoring the invisible power  that directed my steps thither —The friendly repast was prepared for me   nor were my followers neglected  I was pleased at the honest  undesigning affection of my host  and taught to revere the generous  people amongst whom fortune had now placed me  At the hour of rest  I  was courteously conducted to my chamber  but my mind had been too long  and too violently agitated to admit repose  I revolved the dangers and  distresses I had experienced  I thought of the great purpose for which I  had visited this country  I thought of my daughter and my friend  I  sometimes indulged my hopes of finding them  and  again  checked and  condemned these flattering imaginations  Thus did I pass the weary  night   till roused by a voice in the adjacent chamber  I listened  attentively  and heard my host in earnest conference with his wife          I like not   said he       this message from the castle of Salisbury         —      I started at the name  and redoubled my attention         —      This boy is to be carefully guarded and concealed  But
