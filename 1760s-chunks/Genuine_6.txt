for one hundred and twenty pounds  at the suit of the jeweller abovementioned     25To the occasion of this arrest he was an absolute stranger  but he was obliged to submit to it  and go to the house of a bailiff  where  on sending for the plaintiff  he was surprised to find that he was arrested for a fraud  and the solitaire  which he told the jeweller cost two hundred guineas  and sold for one hundred and twenty at second hand  assuring it on his honour to be brilliant  was only an excellent paste   This intelligence struck him to the heart  and he was more concerned to find he had been imposed on  than to recollect the fraud in his own intention —Here it will be necessary to explain this mystery   Most of Miss ELLIOT S acquaintance knew she was possessed of this valuable jewel  which want of cash  for immediate purposes  obliged her to part with  and desiring to conceal her necessity from her friends  she had agreed with an ingenious lapidary to make one of paste for her  which resembled the real diamond as much as possible  it was this that MARIVEAUX   26 had artfully stolen from her  and afterwards ignorantly sold it for that which it was only the representation of   He was no sooner at liberty than he accidentally met his Dulcinea  who branded him with the odious titles of impostor  villain  sharper  and every other opprobrious appellation that female rage could possibly suggest  in consequence of which  Mons  le Marquis became the butt of general ridicule  and was pointed at everywhere  as  what he really he was  a French sharper   This induced him to change the scene of action  by removing to Bath  but he was soon exploded there  and treated with that contempt such insolent pretenders to merit and dignity justly deserve   Miss ELLIOT S fame now grew daily  insomuch that she was invited to frequent Mr  Brown s  near Pallmall  a house to which none resort but ladies of the first rank  and such gentlemen who pay very liberally for their entertainment  Here she has been honoured with a téte a téte conversation   27 with some of the first rank  who have thought themselves happy in her arms  pressing her panting bosom  tasting the ambrosial sweets that exhaled from her coral lips  and dissolving in these extasies which transcend all description  and can only be fully perceived by the most exquisite sensation  Nor was she inattentive to the benefits  which  on due observance  result from the best company  she acquired the art of saying a great deal with very little meaning  of observing a due distance between the heart and the tongue  of passing a double entendre with a good grace  and  in a word  of casting the veil of ambiguity over all her words and actions   Hence she was adapted to the different tempers and dispositions of the students who frequent this seminary of Venus  and could turn their several inclinations and peculiarities to her own emolument   Among the rest of the company  none vsited her oftner  or paid her more liberally than Lord T—  who  though emaciated by a life of excess in every enervating pleasure  always fixed his eye on   28 the most blooming girl  and coveted the society of those most  whom  in a sensual view  he could least gratify  However  he always made up his defect in one point by his profusion in another  and was therefore looked on a very valuable acquaintance   It happened one evening  as his lordship was drinking tea with Miss ELLIOT  at her lodgings  a loud knock was heard at the door  and the maid  after going down  came up and informed her it was Captain F—t—ue  who desired immediately to see her   The Captain  who received his title from being honoured with a company in the guards  had very little more than his commission to maintain him  and therefore though he wanted not the will of compensating the favours of a fine woman  he wanted the power  Our heroine was in a dilemma how to proceed in the case  however  as the present situation of affairs did not admit of long deliberation  she sent down her compliments and desired to see him after the opera at the house of Mrs  Brown     29Such is the infatuation of amorous propensity in dotards  that the old Lord would by no means part with his choice piece till the hour in which she appointed to meet the Captain  when relying on the folly and weakness of the most sensible and experienced of men where female charms are concerned  she abruptly insisted upon his lordship s absence at that time  as she had upon her hands an indispensable engagement  Lord T—departed in a rage  declaring that she had received the last favour from him  but his attachment to her soon compelled him to renew his visits   Having delivered herself from the irksome fondling of an impotent letcher  she hastened to the embraces of youth  ul vigour  and made one of a brilliant assembly that evening  where she had the satisfaction of being taken notice of by a young nobleman  who having attained the long wished for term of twenty one  and
