honour —It is but the shadow of it  What but that stands against your grant of an early day —Do not think me misled by my impatience to call you mine  to take an undue advantage of your condescension  Is it not the happiness of both that I wish to confirm  And shall I suffer false delicacy  false gratitude  to take place of the true —Allow me  madam—But you seem uneasy—I will prolong the time I had intended to beg you would permit me to limit you to  Let me request from you the choice of some one happy day before the expiration of the next fourteen—  Consider  Sir —  Nothing  madam  happening in my behaviour to cause you to revoke the generous trust  From abroad there cannot   He looked to be in earnest in his request  Was it not almost an ungenerous return to my confidence in him  Twelve days only had elasped since his personal declaration  the Letters from Italy which he had allowed me to wait for  unreceived  Lady D  one of the most delicate minded of women  knowing too my   186 preferable regard for your brother  And must not the hurry have the worse appearance for that  No preparation yet thought of  My aunt thinking his former urgency  greatly as she honours him  rather too precipitating—My spirits  hurried before  were really affected  Do not call me a silly girl  dearest Lady G  I endeavoured to speak  but  at the instant  could not distinctly   I am sorry  madam  that what I have said has so much disturbed you  Surely  some one day in the fourteen—  Indeed  indeed  Sir  interrupted I  you have surprised me  I did not think you could have wished so to limit me—I did not expect—  What  loveliest of women  will you allow me to expect  The day is still at your own choice  Revoke not  however  the generous concession  till Mrs  Shirley  Mrs  Selby  and our Lucy  are consulted  Will you  dearest madam  be determined by them   Say  not  Sir  to any of them  after such an instance of my confidence in you—for the honour of your accustomed generosity  say it not—that you could so limit me  and I will endeavour to forget it   Consider  my dearest Miss Byron—  I believe my grandmamma is come  said I—  They are all goodness  They will indulge me  I will tell you  madam  taking my hand  and seating me  what is my intention  if you approve of it  All the country suppose that my application for your favour meets with encouragement  They expect  as I have told you  a speedy solemnization  I took my lodgings at some little distance from you  at a place of public entertainment  perhaps  pardon me  madam  for the sake of my ingenuousness  with some view  that the general talk  See  Lady G  it is well he is a good man   would help to accelerate my happy day  But  madam  to continue my daily visits from thence  when my happiness is supposed to be   187 near  will not perhaps look so well  We are to be studious of looks  it seems —Indeed I would not be thought to despise the world s opinion  The world  when it will have patience to stay till it is master of facts  is not always wrong  It can judge of others  better than it can act itself—The change of my lodgings to others in this house  or in Shirley manor  will not perhaps be allowed till I am blessed with the hand of the dearest relation of both  I therefore think of going up to town  declaredly  Why not   to prepare for our nuptials  and to return near the time agreed upon for the happy celebration  Then will either this house  or Shirley manor  be allowed to receive the happiest of men   He stopt  I was silent  He proceeded  looking tenderly  yet smilingly  in my downcast face  still holding my hand —And now  dearer to me than life  let me ask you—Can you think it an unpardonable intrusion on your condescending goodness  that I make the time of my return to my Miss Byron not over tedious —Fourteen days  were you to go to the extent of them  would be an age to me  who have been for so many days past the happiest man that a person in expectation can be  I do assure you  madam  that I had not the insolence to suppose I was making you a request that was rather expected to be forgiven  than complied with  I thought myself not ungenerous to the confidence you reposed in me  that I gave you so much time  I thought of a week  and began apologizing  lest you should think it too short  but  when I saw you disturbed  I concluded with the mention of a fortnight  My dearest creature  think me not unreasonable in my expectations of your compliance—  What  Sir  in a fortnight —  As to preparations  madam  you know the pleasure my sisters will have in executing any commissions you
