 that you mean not to affront me   I do not  my Lord  While you was apprehensive that you might be a sufferer by me  you acted with your usual prudence to discourage an application  My father had  in your Lordship s judgment  but one fault  and he was the principal sufferer by it himself  Had he looked into his affairs  he would have avoided the necessity of doing several things that were disagreeable to him  and must ever be  to a man of spirit  His very timber  that required  as I may say  the ax  would have furnished him with all he wanted  And he paid interest for a less sum of money than actually was in the hands of his stewards  unaccounted for   But what a glory to you  cousin—  No compliment to me  my Lord  I pray you  to the discredit of my father s memory  He had a right to do what he did  Your Lordship does what you think fit  I too  now I am my own master  do as I please  My taste is different from both  I pursue mine  as he did his  If I should happen to be more right than my father in some things  he might have the advantage of me in others  and in those I happen to do  that are generally thought laudable  what merit have I  Since all this time  directed by a natural bias  I am pursuing my own predominant passion  and that  perhaps  with as much ardour  and as little power to resist it as my father had to restrain his   Bravo  bravo  said my Lord—Let me ask you  nephew—May all young men  if they will  improve by travelling  as you have done —If they may  by my troth nine parts in ten of those who go abroad  ought to be hanged up at their fathers doors on their return   Very severe  my Lord  But thinking minds will be thoughtful  whether abroad or at home  Unthinking ones call for our pity     59 Well  Sir  I do assure you  that I am proud of my nephew  whatever you are of your uncle  And there are two or three things that I want to talk to you about  and one or two that I would consult you upon   He rang  and asked  What time dinner would be ready   In half an hour  was the answer   Mrs  Gissard came in  Her face glowed with passion  My Lord seemed affected at her entrance  It was easy to see  that they were upon ill terms with each other  and that my Lord was more afraid of her  than she was of him   She endeavoured to assume a complaisant air to me  but it was so visibly struggled for  that it sat very aukwardly on her countenance  and her lips trembled when she broke silence  to ask officiously  as she did  after the health of my sister Charlotte   I would be alone with my nephew  said my Lord  in a passionate tone   You shall be alone  my Lord  impertinently replied she  with an air that looked as if they had quarrelled more then once before  and that she had made it up on her own terms  She pulled the door after her with a rudeness that he only could take  and deserve  who was conscious of having degraded himself   Foolish woman  Why came she in when I was there  except to shew her supposed consequence  at the expence of his honour  She knew what my opinion was of her  She would  by a third hand  once  have made overtures to me of her interest with my Lord  but I should have thought meanly of myself  had I not  with disdain  rejected the tender of her services   A damned woman  said my lord  but looked  fist  as if he would be sure she was out of hearing   This woman  nephew  and her behaviour  is one of the subjects I wanted to consult you upon     60 Defer this subject  my Lord  till you have recovered your temper  You did not design to begin with it  You are discomposed   And so I am  And he puffed  and panted  as if out of breath   I asked him some indifferent questions  To have followed him upon the subject at that time  whatever resolutions he had taken  they would probably have gone off  when the passion  to which they would have owed their vigour  had subsided   When he had answered them  his colour and his wrath went down together   He then ran out into my praises again  and  particularly  for my behaviour to Mrs  Oldham  who  he said  lived now very happily  and very exemplarily  and never opened her lips  when she was led to mention me  but with blessings heaped upon me   That woman  my Lord  said I was once good  A recovery  where a person is not totally abandoned  is more to be hoped for  than the
