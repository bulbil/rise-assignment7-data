at the mercy of the Japonese —With respect to the reduction of Quib quab  he had heard  indeed  that the besiegers ought to be ten times the   13 number of the garrison besieged  but as every Japonese was equivalent to ten subjects of China  he thought the match was pretty equal  He reflected  that even if this expedition should not succeed  it would be of little consequence to his reputation  as he could plead at home  that he neither conceived the original plan  nor appointed any of the officers concerned in the execution  It is true  he might have reinforced the army in Fatsisio  so as to leave very little to Fortune  but then he must have substracted something from the strength of the operations in Tartary  which was now become the favourite scene of the war  or he must have altogether suspended the execution of another darling scheme  which was literally his own conception  There was an island in the great Indian ocean  at a considerable distance from Fatsisio  and here the   14 Chinese had a strong settlement  Taycho was inflamed with the ambition of reducing this island  which was called Thin quo  and for this purpose he resolved to embark a body of forces which should co operate with the squadron of Fune destined to cruize in those latitudes —The only difficulty that remained was to choose a general to direct this enterprize —He perused a list of all the military officers in Japan  and as they were all equal in point of reputation  he began to examine their names  in order to pitch upon that which should appear to be the most significant  and in this particular  Taycho was a little superstitious  Not but that surnames  when properly bestowed  might be rendered very useful terms of distinction  but I must tell thee  Peacock  nothing can be more preposterously absurd than the practice of inheriting   15cognomina  which ought ever to be purely personal  I would ask thee  for example  what propriety there was in giving the name Xenophon  which signifies one that speaks a foreign language  to the celebrated Greek who distinguished himself  not only as a consummate captain  but also as an elegant writer in his mother tongue  What could be more ridiculous than to denominate the great philosopher of Crotona Pythagoras  which implies a stinking speech  Or what could be more misapplied than the name of the weeping philosopher Heraclitus  signifying military glory  The inheritance of surnames  among the Romans  produced still more ludicrous consequences  The best and noblest families in Rome derived their names from the coarsest employments  or else from the corporeal blemishes of their ancestors    16 The Pisones were millers  the Cicerones and the Lentuli were so called from the vetches and the lentils which their forefathers dealt in  The Fabij were so denominated from a dung pit  in which the first of the family was begot by stealth in the way of fornication  A ploughman gave rise to the great family of the Serrani  the ladies of which always went without smocks  The Suilli  the Bubulci  and the Porci  were descended from a swine herd  a cow herd  and a hogbutcher —What could be more disgraceful than to call the senator Strabo  Squintum  or a fine young lady of the house of Poeti  Pigsnies  or to distinguish a matron of the Limi  by the appellation of Sheep s eye —What could be more dishonourable than to give the surname of Snub nose to P  Silius  the propraetor  because his great great great grand father had a nose of that   17 make  Ovid  indeed  had a long nose  and therefore was justly denominated Naso  but why should Horace be called Flaccus  as if his ears had been stretched in the pillory  I need not mention the Burrhi  Nigri  Rusi  Aquilij  and Rutilij  because we have the same foolish surnames in England  and even the Lappa  for I myself know a very pretty miss called Rough head  tho  in fact there is not a young lady in the Bills of Mortality  who takes more pains to dress her hair to the best advantage  The famous dictator whom the deputies of Rome found at the plough  was known by the name of Cincinnatus  or Ragged head  Now I leave you to judge how it would found in these days  if a footman at the play house should call out     My Lady Ragged head s coach  Room for my Lady Ragged head    I am doubtful whether the English name of Hale  18 does not come from the Roman cognomen Hala  which signified stinkingbreath  What need I mention the Plauti  Panci  Valgi  Vari  Vatiae  and Scauri  the Tuditani  the Malici  Cenestellae  and Leccae  in other words  the Splay foots  Bandy legs  Shamble shins  Baker knees  Clubfoots  Hammer heads  Chubby cheeks  Bald heads  and Letchers —I shall not say a word of the Buteo  or Buzzard  that I may not be obliged to explain the meaning of the word Triorchis  from whence it takes its denomination  yet all those were great families in Rome  But I cannot help taking notice of some of the same improprieties  which have crept into the language and customs
