says   Harry  Yes  my lord  I am wounded just as I could wish   and   I would not exchange my present blessed death for the longest   and happiest life that the world could bestow  But it is time to   undeceive you  and reveal a secret which nothing but death should   ever have extorted from me  I am not what I seem  my most   beloved master  I am a foolish and fond girl  who at the first   glance conceived a passion for you  My name is Maria de Lausanne    I am niece to that bad woman whom you justly rejected  But   what did I propose by this disguise   First  your   leliverance  my   lord  and that I effected  But did I further aspire to the honour   of your hand   Far from it far from it  I felt my own unworthi    ness   I did not think you could be mated by any thing less than   an angel  But then to see you to hear you to serve to touch   to be near you to fix my eyes on you unheeded and  if possible    to win your attention by the little offices of my fondness this was   my happiness the whole of the heaven that I proposed upon   earth  I have had it I have enjoyed it  and I ought to die   content  But  alas   to part from you there is the pang of pangs     O  if this day merits any thing by the offer of my own life for the   preservation of my beloved  then cause my chaste clay to be kindly   deposited in the tomb of your ancestors that when time shall     come my dust may be neighboured to your precious dust     and there sleep in peace beside you till we spring together     from corruption to glory and immortality       During these short sentences and difficult respirations  Harry   could answer nothing  He was suffocated by his grief  but    putting his speechless lips to the fading lips of his Maria  he drew   her latest breath into his own affectionate bosom  and angels in    stantly caught her spirit into the regions of purity  of love  and of   faith unfailing      Harry then  plucking up strength from oppression  and courage   from despair  pressed his lips to the pale and unfeeling lips of his   lover  and cried Yes  my Maria  our dust shall be joined  and   I feel that our spirits too shall shortly be wedded   Then raising   her in his arms  and pressing her to his bosom  he bore her to   the town  while he poured upon her all the way the two fountains   of his affection      When he got to the inn  and came to his uncle Here  sir  said   he  I present you with a very precious little burthen a burthen   that lies much heavier on my heart than it did in my arms  He   then related to Mr  Ch nton the whole of what had passed   when    heavily sighing  and shedding a tear  Mr  Clinton cried Ah  my   Harry  I would to heaven that your Maria had lived   her beauty   her services but above all the excess of her love  made her truly   deserving of you      Harry ordered a carriage on purpose for himself and his beloved    She was deposited in a coffin hurried up for the occasion  and    notwithstanding all the remonstrances and entreaties of his parent      Dd2         404 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Harry proved a rebel for the first time  and would not be divided   from his Maria till they reached London      There our Harry ordered a coffin of unalloyed and beaten silver   to be prepared for her reception   and  though near five days had   passed since the departure of her spirit  her chaste flesh remained   as pure and untainted as that of a lamb newly slain      While they were putting her into her solemn repository Ah  sir     said Harry  I pretend not to compare with you   your losses  I own    have been greater than mine  You are a man  like your divine   Master  wholly made up of sorrows  and acquainted with killing   griefs  But still you must allow that  for my little time  I have   had a competent share  It matters not  I am reconciled to   them  I begin to be pleased with them  And  indeed  joy is   become my utter aversion while I think on this loved creature    who willingly bled and died for my
