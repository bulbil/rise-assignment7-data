viz        A copy of his proposals to me  of a great parcel of gold  and fine   clothes and rings  and an estate of I can t tell what a year  and 50l  a   year for the life of both you  my dear parents  to be his mistress  with   an insinuation  that  may be  he would marry me at the year s end  All   sadly vile  With threatenings  if I did not comply  that he would ruin   me  without allowing me any thing  A copy of my answer  refusing all    with just abhorrence  But begging at last his goodness towards me  and   mercy on me  in the most moving manner I could think of  An account   of his angry behaviour  and Mrs  Jewkes s wicked advice hereupon  His   trying to get me to his chamber  and my refusal to go  A deal of stuff   and chit chat between me and the odious Mrs  Jewkes  in which she was   very wicked and very insulting  Two notes I wrote  as if to be carried   to church  to pray for his reclaiming  and my safety  which Mrs    Jewkes seized  and officiously shewed him  A confession of mine  that    notwithstanding his bad usage  I could not hate him  My concern for Mr    Williams  A horrid contrivance of my master s to ruin me  being in   my room  disguised in clothes of the maid s  who lay with me and Mrs    Jewkes  How narrowly I escaped   it makes my heart ache to think of it   still   by falling into fits  Mrs  Jewkes s detestable part in this sad   affair  How he seemed moved at my danger  and forbore his abominable   designs  and assured me he had offered no indecency  How ill I was for   a day or two after  and how kind he seemed  How he made me forgive Mrs    Jewkes  How  after this  and great kindness pretended  he made rude   offers to me in the garden  which I escaped  How I resented them   Then   I had written   How kindly he behaved himself to me  and how he praised   me  and gave me great hopes of his being good at last  Of the too tender   impression this made upon me  and how I began to be afraid of my own   weakness and consideration for him  though he had used me so ill    How sadly jealous he was of Mr  Williams  and how I  as justly could    cleared myself as to his doubts on that score  How  just when he had   raised me up to the highest hope of his goodness  he dashed me sadly   again  and went off more coldly  My free reflections upon this trying   occasion        This brought down matters from Thursday  the 20th day of my   imprisonment  to Wednesday the 41st  and here I was resolved to end  let   what would come  for only Thursday  Friday  and Saturday  remain to give   an account of  and Thursday he set out to a ball at Stamford  and Friday   was the gipsy story  and this is Saturday  his return from Stamford  And   truly  I shall have but little heart to write  if he is to see all       So these two parcels of papers I have got ready for him against   to morrow morning  To be sure I have always used him very freely in my   writings  and shewed him no mercy  but yet he must thank himself for   it  for I have only writ truth  and I wish he had deserved a better   character at my hands  as well for his own sake as mine   So  though I   don t know whether ever you ll see what I write  I must say  that I will   go to bed  with remembering you in my prayers  as I always do  and as I   know you do me  And so  my dear parents  good night          Sunday morning       I remembered what he said  of not being obliged to ask again for my   papers  and what I should be forced to do  and could not help  I thought   I might as well do in such a manner as might shew I would not disoblige   on purpose  though I stomached this matter very heavily too  I had   therefore got in readiness my two parcels  and he  not going to church   in the morning  bid Mrs  Jewkes tell me he was gone into the garden       I knew that was for me to go to him
