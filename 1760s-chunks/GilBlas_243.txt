whom it was imputed  the nurse had not altogether cleared herself from my suspicions  They hovered sometimes over one and sometimes over the other  but let them light where they would  it was all the same to me  I said nothing about the matter to the old woman  not even so much as to haggle about the items of her fine bill  I should not have been an atom the richer for doing so  and we must all live by our trades  The utmost of my malice was to pay her and send her packing three days afterwards   I am inclined to think that at her departure she gave the apothecary notice of her quitting the premises  and having left me sufficiently in possession of myself to take French leave without acknowledging my obligations to him  for she had not been gone many minutes before he came in puffing and blowing  with his bill in his hand  There  under names which had escaped my conscription  though as arrant a physician as the worst of them  he had set down all the hypothetical remedies which he insisted that I had taken during the time when I could take nothing  This bill might truly be called the epitome of an apothecary s conscience  Such being the case  we had a bustle about the payment  I pleaded for an abatement of one half  He swore that he would not take a doit less than his just demand  He kept his oath and yet relaxed  for considering that he had to do with a young man who might run away from Madrid within four and twenty hours  he preferred my offer of three hundred per cent  on the prime cost of his drugs  though a pitiful profit for an apothecary  to the risk of losing all  I counted out the money with an aching heart  and he withdrew  chuckling over his revenge for the scurvy trick I had played him on the day of evacuation   The physician made his appearance next  for beasts of prey inhabit the same latitudes  I fee d him for his visits  which had been quite as frequent as necessary  and his object was answered  But he would not leave me without proving how hardly he had earned his money  for that he had not only expelled the enemy from the interior  but had defended the frontiers from the attack of all the disorders on the army list of the materia medica  He talked very learnedly  with good emphasis and discretion  so much so  that I did not comprehend one word he said  When I had got rid of him  I flattered myself that the destinies had now done their worst  But I was mistaken  for there came a surgeon whose face I had never seen in the whole course of my life  He accosted me very politely  and congratulated me on the imminent danger I had escaped  attributing the happy issue of my complaints to those which he had himself cut  with the profuse application of bleeding  cupping  blistering  and all sorts of torments  consequent and inconsequent  Another feather out of my poor wing  I was obliged to pay toll to the surgeon also  After so many purgatives  my purse was brought to such a state of debility  that it might be considered as dead and gone  a mere skeleton  drained of all its vital juices   My spirits began to flag  on the contemplation of my wretched case  In the service of my two last masters I had wedded myself to the pomps and vanities of this wicked world  and could no longer  as heretofore  look poverty in the face with the sternness of a cynic  It must be owned  however  that I was in the wrong to give way to melancholy  after experiencing so often that fortune had never cast me down  but for the purpose of raising me up again  so that my pitiful plight at the present moment  if rightly considered  was only to be hailed as the harbinger of approaching prosperity       BOOK THE EIGHTH       CH  I     Gil Blas scrapes an acquaintance of some value  and finds wherewithal to make him amends for the Count de Galiano s ingratitude  Don Valerio de Luna s story   IT seemed so strange to have heard not a syllable from Nunez during this long interval  that I concluded he must be in the country  I went to look after him as soon as I could walk  and found the fact to be  that he had gone into Andalusia three weeks ago  with the Duke of Medina Sidonia   One morning when rubbing my eyes after a sound sleep  Melchior de la Ronda started into my recollection  and that bringing to mind my promise at Grenada  of going to see his nephew  if ever I should return to Madrid  it seemed advisable not to defer fulfilling my promise for a single day  I inquired where Don Balthazar de Zuniga lived  and went thither straightway  On asking if Signor Joseph Navarro was at home  he made his appearance immediately  We exchanged bows with a well bred coolness on his part  though I had taken care to announce my name audibly  There was no reconciling such a frosty reception with the glowing portrait ascribed to
