to expel the English out of his dominions  Upon the first intelligence of his march  Colonel Clive begged from the Admiral a reinforcement of men from the ships  and six hundred seamen were accordingly soon added to his little army  The numerous forces of the Viceroy of Bengal appeared  and Colonel Clive advanced in three columns to attack him  But  though the forces were so seemingly disproportioned  with respect to number  the victory soon declared in favour of the English commander  In fact  what could the timid Asiatic soldier do against European troops  hardened by war  and inured to all the vicissitudes of climate  All the customs  habits  opinions  of the Asiatics tend to enfeeble the body  and effeminate the mind  When we conceive a body of men led up to the attack  dressed in long silk garments  with no other courage but that inspired by opium  with no other fears from defeat but that of changing their mode of slavery  their chief commander mounted on an elephant  and consequently a more conspicuous object for aim  their artillery drawn by oxen  impatient and furious upon the slightest wound  every soldier utterly unacquainted with that cool intrepidity which provides against danger  and only taught to fight by the same arts that raise their passions  If we consider all these circumstances  it will be no way surprising if one or two thousand Europeans should easily discomfit thirty thousand Indians  And all the heroism of a Cyrus  or an Alexander  in gaining such disproportioned   227 victories  will no longer be the subject of admiration   A victory so easily acquired by a foreign enemy  soon rendered the Viceroy of Bengal contemptible to his subjects at home  His present cowardice rendered him despicable  his former insolence and cruelty odious  A conspiracy was projected against him by Alikan  his prime minister  and the English having private intimations of the design  resolved to seize the opportunity of seconding it with all their endeavours  Accordingly Colonel Clive marched forward  took the town of Cutwa in his march  and soon came up with the Viceroy s army  and  after a short contest  put the whole to flight  with terrible slaughter  Alikan  who had first incited his master to this undertaking  had hitherto concealed his attachments  either through fear or perfidy  but  after this victory  he openly espoused the cause of the English  and was therefore solemnly proclaimed Viceroy of Bengal  Bahar  and Oriza  in the room of the former Viceroy  who was as solemnly deposed  and soon after put to death by his successor  The new Viceroy was not insensible of the gratitude he owed the English  for their assistance in his promotion  He granted liberally all their demands  satisfied them even to the most extended wish of avarice  and took every method to demonstrate his pride in their alliance   Yet not the Indians alone  but the French also  submitted to Colonel Clive s assiduity and courage  seconded by the endeavours of the Admirals Watson and Pocock  Chadenagore  a French settlement higher up the river than Calcutta  of great strength  and the most important of any possessed by that nation in the bay of Bengal  submitted to the English arms  The goods and money found in the place were considerable  but the chief damage the French sustained was  in the ruin of their head settlement on the Ganges  by which they had long divided the   228 commerce of this part of India  Thus  in one campaign  the English  in some measure  became possessors of an immense tract of country  superior in wealth  fertility  extent  and number of inhabitants  to many of Europe  Above two millions sterling were paid to the company and sufferers at Calcutta  the soldiers and seamen shared six hundred thousand pounds  and the English forces became too formidable for resistance  Yet  perhaps  this remote power will  one day  either serve to drain from the mother country all its useful hands  or our victories will serve to teach the native barbarians to avail themselves of their numbers  and  by being frequently defeated  they will  at last  learn to conquer   The success of the English was not a little alarming to the French ministry at home  and it is believed that even the Dutch themselves entertained some jealousy of their growing greatness  A considerable reinforcement was therefore sent from France  under the command of General Lally  an Irishman  who was reckoned one of the bravest  yet the most whimfical man in the French service  He had been  from his earliest years  bred a soldier of fortune  and carried the military spirit of honour to its utmost limits  Under his guidance the French affairs seemed  for some time  to wear a better face  he took fort St  David s  plundered a town belonging to the King of Tanjour  in alliance with the English  and after laid siege to his capital  Failing in his design upon this city  he entered the province of Arcot  and prepared for laying siege to Madrass  the chief settlement of our company  upon the coast of Coromandel  In the siege of this important fortress  a greater variety of difficulties presented than he had expected  The artillery of the garrison
