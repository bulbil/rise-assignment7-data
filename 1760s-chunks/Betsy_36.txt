of the temper of your sex  have reason to believe  this I now send        will meet a double portion of welcome from you  It brings a        confirmation of your beauty s power  the intelligence of a new        conquest  the offer of a heart  which  if you will trust a        brother s recommendation  is well deserving your acceptance  but         that I may not seem to speak in riddles  you may remember that the        first time I had the pleasure of entertaining you at my rooms  a        gentleman called Trueworth was with us  and that the next day when        you dined with that person  who afterwards treated you with such        unbecoming liberties  he made one of the company  since then you        could not see him  as he was obliged to go to his seat  which is        about thirty miles off  on an extraordinary occasion  and returned        not till the day after you left this town  He seemed more than        ordinarily affected on my telling him what had happened on your        account  and  after pausing a little   How unhappy was I   said he          to be absent  had I been here there would have been no need for        the brother of Miss Betsy to have exposed his life to the sword of        an injurious antagonist  or his character to the censure of the        university  I would have taken upon myself to have revenged the        quarrel of that amiable lady  and either have severely chastised        the insolence of the aggressor  or lost the best part of my blood        in the attempt   I was very much surprized at these words  as well        as the emphasis with which they were delivered  but  recovering        myself as soon as I could   We are extremely obliged to you  Sir          said I   but I know not if such a mistaken generosity might not        have been fatal to the reputation of us both  What would the world        have said of me to have been tamely passive  and suffer another to        revenge the affront offered to my sister  What would they have        thought of her  on finding her honour vindicated by one who had no        concern in it     No concern   cried he  with the utmost eagerness          yes  I have a concern  more deep  more strong  than that of        father  brother  or all the ties of blood could give  and that you        had before now have been convinced of it  had I not been so        suddenly and so unfortunately called hence             Perceiving I looked very much confounded  as well I might   Ah         Frank   cried he   I love your charming sister  my friends have         for these six months past  been teazing me to think of marriage         and several proposals have been made to me on that score  but never        till I saw the amiable Miss Betsy  did I behold the face for whom I        would exchange my liberty  in fine   tis she  and only she  can        make me blest  and I returned to Oxford full of the hopes of an        opportunity to lay my heart  my person  and my fortune  at her        feet             It would require a volume  instead of a letter  to repeat half the        tender and passionate expressions he uttered in your favour  What I        have already said is enough to give you a specimen of the rest  I        shall only add  that being impatient to begin the attack he is        determined to make upon your heart  he
