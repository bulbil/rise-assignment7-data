 but the fair inflictor of his torments was punished for her   insensibility and ingratitude  by a way her inexperience of the world    and the temper of mankind in general  had made her far from   apprehending       While the company were employed  some in dancing  and others in   particular conversation  the beau found an opportunity to slip into Miss   Betsy s hand a little billet  saying to her at the same time   You have   got my heart  and this little bit of paper will convey to you the   sentiments it is inspired with in your favour   She  imagining it was   either a sonnet or epistle  in praise of her beauty  received it with a   smile  and put it in her pocket  After every body had taken leave  and   she was retired to her chamber  she examined it  and found  to her great   astonishment  the contents as follows              Dear Miss            I must either be the most ungrateful  or most consumedly dull        fellow upon earth  not to have returned the advances you have been        so kind to make me  had the least opportunity offered for my doing        so  but Lady Mellasin  her daughter  the fool Saving  or some        impertinent creature or other  has always been in the way  so that        there was not a possibility of giving you even the least earnest of        love  but  my dear  I have found out a way to pay you the whole sum        with interest  which is this  you must invent some excuse for going        out alone  and let me know by a billet  directed for me at White s         the exact hour  and I will wait for you at the corner of the street        in a hackney coach  the window drawn up  and whirl you to a pretty        snug place I know of  where we may pass a delicious hour or two        without a soul to interrupt our pleasures  Let me find a line from        you to morrow  if you can any way contrive it  being impatient to        convince you how much I am  my dear creature  yours   c   c            J  GAYLAND        Impossible it is to express the mingled emotions of shame  surprize  and   indignation  which filled the breast of Miss Betsy  on reading this bold   invitation  she threw the letter on the ground  she stamped upon it  she   spurned it  and would have treated the author in the same manner  had he   been present  but the first transports of so just a resentment being   over  a consciousness of having  by a too free behaviour towards him    emboldened him to take this liberty  involved her in the utmost   confusion  and she was little less enraged with herself  than she had   reason to be with him  She could have tore out her very eyes for having   affected to look kindly upon a wretch who durst presume so far on her   supposed affection  and though she spared those pretty twinklers that   violence  she half drowned their lustre in a deluge of tears  Never was   a night passed in more cruel anxieties than what she sustained  both   from the affront she had received  and the reflection that it was   chiefly the folly of her own conduct which had brought it on her  and   what greatly added to her vexation  was the uncertainty how it would   best become her to act on an occasion which appeared so extraordinary to   her  She had no friend whom she thought it proper to consult  she was   ashamed to relate the story to any of the discreet and serious part of   her acquaintance  she feared their reproofs for having counterfeited a   tenderness for a man  which she was now sensible she ought  if it had   been real  rather to have concealed with the utmost care both from him   and all the world  and as for Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora  though their   conduct inspired her not with any manner of awe  yet she thought she saw   something in those ladies which did not promise much sincerity  and   shewed as if they would rather turn her complaints into ridicule  than   afford her that cordial and friendly advice she stood in need of
