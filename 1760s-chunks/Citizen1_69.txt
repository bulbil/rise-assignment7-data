and the old continue in force  the subjects are oppressed  burthen d with a multiplicity of legal injunctions  there are none from whom to expect redress  and nothing but a strong convulsion in the state can vindicate them into former liberty  thus the people of Rome  a few great ones excepted  found more real freedom under their Emperors tho  tyrants  than they had experienced in the old age of the common wealth  in which their laws were become numerous and painful  in which new laws were every day enacting and the old ones executed with rigour    218 They even refused to be reinstated in their former prerogatives  upon an offer made them to this purpose  for they actually found Emperors the only means of softening the rigours of their constitution   The constitution of England  is at present possessed of the strength of its native oak  and the flexibility of the bending tamarisk  but should the people at any time  with a mistaken zeal  pant after an imaginary freedom  and fancy that abridging monarchy was encreasing their privileges  they would be very much mistaken  since every jewel plucked from the crown of majesty would only be made use of as a bribe to corruption  it might enrich the few who shared it among them  but would in fact impoverish the public   As the Roman senators by slow and imperceptible degrees became masters of the people  yet still flattered them with a shew of freedom  while themselves only were free  so is it possible for a body of men  while they stand up for privileges  to grow into an exuberance of power themselves  and the public become actually dependent  while  some of its individuals only governed   If then  my friend  there should in this country  ever be on the throne a King who thro  good nature or age  should give up the smallest part of his prerogative to the people  if there should come a minister of merit and popularity— But I have room for no more  Adieu     219  LETTER XLIX  To the same   AS I was yesterday seated at breakfast over a pensive dish of tea  my meditations were interrupted by my old friend and companion  who introduced a stranger  dressed pretty much like himself  The gentleman made several apologies for his visit  begged of me to impute his intrusion to the sincerity of his respect  and the warmth of his curiosity   As I am very suspicious of my company  when I find them very civil  without any apparent reason  I answered the stranger s caresses at first with reserve  which my friend perceiving  instantly let me into my visitant s trade and character  asking Mr  Fudge  whether he had lately published any thing new  I now conjectured that my guest was no other than a bookseller  and his answer confirmed my suspicions    Excuse me  Sir  says he  it is not the season  books have their time as well as cucumbers  I would no more bring out a new work in summer  than I would sell pork in the dog days  Nothing in my way goes off in summer  except very light goods indeed  A review  a magazine  or a sessions paper  may amuse a summer reader  but all our stock of value we reserve for a spring and winter trade   I must confess  Sir  says I  a curiosity to   220 know what you call a valuable stock  which can only bear a winter perusal   Sir  replied the bookseller  it is not my way to cry up my own goods  but without exaggeration I will venture to shew with any of the trade  my books at least have the peculiar advantage of being always new  and it is my way to clear off my old to the trunkmakers every season  I have ten new title s now about me  which only want books to be added to make them the finest things in nature  Others may pretend to direct the vulgar  but that is not my way  I always let the vulgar direct me  wherever popular clamour arises  I always eccho the million  For instance  should the people in general say that such a man is a rogue  I instantly give orders to set him down in print a villain  thus every man buys the book  not to learn new sentiments  but to have the pleasure of seeing his own reflected   But Sir  interrupted I  you speak as if you yourself wrote the books you publish  may I be so bold as to ask a sight of some if those intended publications which are shortly to surprize the world   As to that  Sir  replied the talkative bookseller  I only draw out the plans myself  and though I am very cautious of communicating them to any  yet  as in the end I have a favour to ask  you shall see a few of them  Here  Sir  here they are diamonds of the first water  I assure you  Imprimis  a translation of several medical precepts for the use of such physicians as do not understand Latin  Item  the young clergyman s art of placing patches regularly  with a dissertation on the different manner of smiling without
