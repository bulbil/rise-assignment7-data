adherents  Pity then procured friends which prosperity could not procure  and now the barons were struck with   99 some remorse to see their native country  by their procurement  thus laid desolate  and their King a wanderer  but what added to their afflictions was  that their services were hitherto slightly repaid by the new crowned Monarch  and  from a knowledge of his disposition  they could hope for no increase of future favours  It was even reported among them  that his intentions were to banish them for their disloyalty to their former sovereign  though exerted in his own favour  Whatever their motives might be  forty barons addressed letters of submissive suit to King John  the Pope also held the justice of his claim in suspense  a gleam of distant prosperity seemed to brighten his affairs  but  while the conjuncture seemed big with new events  the death of both the Pope  and of John  decided the contest  This Monarch died in the fifty first year of his age  after a reign of more than seventeen years  spent in wars without success  and exertions of power without increase of authority  I am   Dear Charles   c   LETTER XV   Dear Charles   HAD Lewis  who was crowned King  dissembled till possessed of uncontrouled power  he might have retained the crown  But the barons wanted a Monarch subservient to their power  and Lewis refused a kingdom upon such conditions  They now  therefore  turned from the French intruder to the young Monarch  from whom they expected greater condescension     100 Henry III  appointed successor to the crown by John his father  was but ten years of age when made King  and the Earl of Pembroke was  by mutual consent  constituted his guardian  The inconstancy of the English was now more than ever apparent  Lewis was  in some measure  forsaken by his new subjects  and  after a defeat  obliged to relinquish all pretensions to the kingdom  What the barons  however  had hoped from the King s tender age  did not answer their expectations  The Earl of Pembroke  who governed his nonage  made a powerful interest with the clergy  and  by their means  served to balance the state   While Henry acted under the direction of others  the power of the barons seemed to have been kept under  he had the clergy for him  and consequently the people  and these two were equivalent to all the nobility  But  as soon as Henry came to take the reins into his own hands  numberless insurrections and calamities were the result of his obstinacy  folly  and vice  Infinite were the struggles for power between the barons and the King  Henry s luxury and profuseness continually rendered him a petitioner to the assembly of barons for money  for now the Kings began to ask money instead of men  and they as constantly demanded a confirmation of those privileges which had been granted them under the reign of his predecessor   In order to render himself independent of them  he found a thousand ridiculous pretences for raising money without their assistance  He would invite himself to the houses of his subjects  and always expected a present at the door  he extorted from the Jews  wherever he found them  without any   101 remorse  He even scrupled not to defraud minors of their lawful inheritances  to which he had been left protector  while the people had the mortification to see those sums lavished upon undeserving favourites  foreigners without merit  strumpets  flatterers  and all the vermin of a vicious court   But all his exactions were not sufficient to supply his prodigality  he still wanted money  he still was obliged to have recourse to his barons  and yet he still desired to be absolute  The barons  on the contrary  who had long aimed at independence  and who detested his cowardice and luxury  refused his request  Though no Monarch was more timid in danger  none was more presumptuous in prosperity  he threatened them  for refusing  with his severe dipleasure  and strengthened himself by the assistance of the Pope  in order to plunder the kingdom   Whilst the English were complaining of the avarice of their King  and his profusion to foreign favourites  the Pope s legate made his triumphal entry to rob them of what the King had not laid hands on  the interests of the clergy and of the Pope were formerly one  but they now began to flow in divided channels  The riches  which some years before settled in their monasteries at home  were now drained off to enrich a distant kingdom  already too luxurious  The clergy  therefore  justly dreaded the arrival of an extraordinary legate  whose only aims were directed by avarice and extortion  They expostulated  but in vain  to the King  against this unnecessary ambassador from the head of the church  the King hoped to reap some private advantage from his arrival  and he was but little concerned for public grievances    102 In every demand the King made for himself  the legate would take care to make one for the Pope also  he even proposed  that the Monks should sign their names to notes  where a blank was left for the sum specified  The
