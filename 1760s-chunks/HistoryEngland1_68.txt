remorse  he at last smothered them between two pillows  and caused them to be buried under a little stair case  near where they lay  Vengeance  though late  followed this execrable wretch  he was executed for this fact in the succeeding reign  when he confessed his crime and the manner of its execution   The warlike spirit  first excited by the conquest of France  and then kept up by the long civil war  seemed to have banished every sentiment of   199 virtue from the kingdom  cruelty and executions were grown so common  that the people now became familiar with blood and death  scarce a noble family in the kingdom which was not thinned by these terrible dissensions  The clergy seemed  at this time  quite separated from the laity  they seldom suffered for treason  and were but little conversant in the bloody politics of the times  As for arts  sciences  and commerce  they were totally neglected  In all this carnage and desolation  one power was imperceptibly gaining ground  as the lords were declining  the commons were coming into authority  not so much exposed  as the former  to the tempests of regal resentment  they continued to increase in wealth and favour  and found safety from their humility   I am   c   LETTER XXVI   THERE is somewhat that peculiarly strikes the imagination in the transactions of this and the preceding reign  I have therefore treated them with more than usual prolixity  Our tragic poets seem to have been sensible how much these strange instances of depravation were susceptible of a poetic dress  Every picture of the times is marked with strong lines  like an African prospect  where all is vast  wild  and terrible   Richard had  at length  waded through every obstacle to the throne  and now began  after the usual manner of all usurpers  to strengthen  by his ill got power  foreign alliances  Sensible also of the influence of antry and shew upon the minds of the people  he caused himself to be   200 crowned first at London  and then at York  The clergy he endeavoured to secure in his interests  by great indulgences to them  and by his own hypocritical behaviour   But  while he endeavoured to establish his power  he found it undermining  on a side from whence he least expected it  the Duke of Buckingham  who had been the principal instrument in placing him upon the throne  now began to expect the reward of his adherence  Richard  indeed  had given him several posts and governments  but denied him a moiety of the consiscated lands of Hereford  to which he had some family claims  Very great obligations between two friends  on either side  generally end in disgust  Buckingham supposed that his services could never be over rewarded  while Richard  on the contrary  was willing to curb his desires  which seemed to increase by gratification  Soon  therefore  the Duke was disgusted with the new Monarch  and as soon conceived a scheme for depriving him of the crown  Doubtful  for a while  whether he should put in for the crown himself  or set up another  the latter opinion prevailed  and he was resolved to declare for Henry  Duke of Richmond  then an exile in Bretagne  Henry  of Richmond  was one of those who had the good fortune to survive the numerous massacres of the preceding reigns  he was the only remaining branch of the house of Lancaster  he was descended from John of Ghaunt  but  by the female line  his right to the throne was very doubtful  but the crimes of the usurper strengthened his claims  He had long lived in exile  and was once delivered up to the ambassadors of Edward IV  and just upon the point of being brought back to England  to suffer a cruel   201 death  when the Prince  who had delivered him up  repented of what he had done  and took him from the ambassadors  just as he was brought on shipboard  This was the youth whom the Duke of Buckingham pitched upon to dethrone the tyrant  and a negotiation was commenced between them for that purpose   Richard  in the mean time  either informed by his creatures  or made distrustful by conscious guilt  suspected a conspiracy  and could not avoid thinking Buckingham among the number of the conspirators  Impressed with these suspicions  he came to a resolution of sending for him to court  and the Duke s refusing to come confirmed him in his belief  but soon he had no cause to doubt of his treachery  for word was brought  that the Duke of Buckingham was up in arms  The Duke  having found that he could dissemble with Richard no longer  had drawn together some Welch forces  and began to march to the western shore  where he had appointed young Richmond to land  Richard  however  no way dismayed at the approaching danger  prepared to meet him with the few forces he then had in readiness  but fortune seemed to favour the usurper  and rendered his preparations  for this time  needless  As Buckingham was advancing  by hasty marches  towards Gloucester  where he designed to pass the Severn  just then the river was
