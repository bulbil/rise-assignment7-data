diffident voice and downcast look on his own part  why   this constraint  why all this blushing  my dear Mrs  Clement   in    deed it is a compliment that we cannot deserve      Ah  sir   cried Mrs  Clement  it is a compliment which I would   very gladly spare  if I could help it  But I must be a very guilty   body  to be sure   and my faults I find must be very much my   enemies  when they are ready to fly in my face every moment      Why  Mrs  Clement  said Mr  Fenton  do you hold blushing to be   any evidence of guilt  Certainly  sir  said Arabella  it can be   nothing but a consciousness of somewhat amiss that ought to give   shame  to any sensible person  Mr  Sergeant Clement  cried Mr    Fenton  pray  what is your judgment on the case in hand       In truth  sir  said Clement  it is a case to which I am not pre    pared to plead  I have  indeed  heard many and various opinions   on the subject  though generally coinciding with that of my Arabella    And more particularly in conversations of ribald entendre  I have   heard it affirmed that the blushing of a woman is a sure proof of   her understanding much more than became her      Hold there  cried Mr  Fenton  the mere understanding of good   or evil can no more be a fault in the creature than in the Creator     the offence of guilt bears no reference to knowledge  but consists in   the approbation of evil alone  A woman therefore  who blushes   at what she disapproves  blushes not for herself  but for the faults   of her rude and ill mannered company  who have not the grace to   blush for themselves      When I speak here of blushing  I would not be understood  by   any means  to include the flushing of vanity  or the reddenings of         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  125     anger  or any such like turbulent and irregular motions  I mean   no other than that ready expression of shame  which  as our Arabella   sweetly hinted just now  arises from an apprehension of something   being amiss in ourselves  or others  But who or what is it that   apprehends in this case  Is it guilt that is afraid or ashamed of   guilt   No  surely  It is virtue alone that can fear or be ashamed   of the neighbourhood of its adversary      I will take an instance from a person who is actually guilty of   something very enormous   and who blushes on his being questioned   or suspected of the transgression  His blushing here demonstrates   his sensibility  and his sensibility demonstrates some principle   within him  that disapproved and reproached him for what he had   committed  And so long as this spark or principle remains un    quenched in the bosom   so long as the wicked themselves can feel   compunction  and be ashamed of wickedness   so long their recovery   is not to be despaired of      It is therefore  from the fountain of virtue alone  that this flush   of shamefacedness can possibly flow   and a delicacy of compunction    on such occasions  is a sensitive plant of virtue in the soul  that   feels  shrinks  and is alarmed on the slightest apprehension of   approaching evil      Well  sir  said Arabella  allowing all that you have advanced in   behalf of blushers  and that is doing them more favour than I fear   they deserve   can it amount to more than this  that however   faulty they may be  they still have goodness enough to acknowledge   their guilt  or  in other words  that they have the justice to be   ashamed of themselves       Yes  madam  said Mr  Fenton  it amounts to much more  and you   know that it does  But you are a wicked little sophister  and de    serve to be punished  by our yielding to you the cause that you   have undertaken against yourself      When I observed that nothing but virtue could undesignedly   express a disapprobation of vice  I ought further to have observed    that the greater and the purer  the more excellent and more vivid   that this virtue is  the more apt it will be to take alarm at the bare   apprehension of having said or done  or of being suspected to have   said  or done  or thought of any thing amiss  or contrary to its own   nature
