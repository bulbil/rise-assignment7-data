his indifference after I have given him my whole self  In other words  I could not bear to have my Love slighted  or to be despised for it  instead of being encouraged to shew it  And how shall extravagant passion warrant hopes of this nature—if the man be not a man of gratitude  of principle  and a man whose Love is founded in reason  and whose object is mind  rather than person   But Mr  Orme  replied Mr  Reeves  is all this  Such  I believe  in his Love   Be it so  But if I cannot love him so well as to wish to be his  a man  I have heard my uncle▪ as   152 well as Sir Hargrave  say  is his own  a woman is a man s   if I cannot take delight in the thought of bearing my part of the yoke with him  in the belief  that  in case of a contrariety of sentiments  I cannot give up my judgment  in points indifferent  from the good opinion I have of his  what  but a fondness for the state  and an irksomeness in my present situation  could byass me in favour of any man  Indeed  my cousin  I must love the man to whom I could give my hand  well enough to be able  on cool deliberation  to wish to be his wife  and for his sake  with my whole heart  choose to quit the single state  in which I am very happy   And you are sure that your indifference to Mr  Orme is not either directly or indirectly owing to his obsequious Love of you  and to the milkiness of his nature  as Shakespeare calls it   Very  sure  All the leaning towards him that I have in preference  as I think  to every other man who has beheld me with partiality  is  on the contrary  owing to the grateful sense I have of his respect to me  and to the gentleness of his nature  Does not my behaviour to Mr  Greville  to Mr  Fenwick  to Sir Hargrave  compared with my treatment of Mr  Orme and Mr  Fowler  confirm what I say   Then you are  as indeed  I have always thought you  a nonsuch of a woman   Not so  your own Lady  whom you first brought to pity you  as I have heard you say  is an instance that I am not   Well  that s true  But is she not  at the same time  an example  that pity melts the soul to Love   I have no doubt  said Mrs  Reeves  but Miss Byron may be brought to love the man she can pity   But  madam  said I  did you not let pity grow into Love before you married Mr  Reeves   I believe I did  smiling   Well then I promise you  Mr  Reeves  when that   153 comes to be the case with me  I will not give pain to a man I can like to marry   Very well  replied Mr  Reeves  And I dare say  that at last Mr  Orme will be the man  And yet how you will get off with Sir Hargrave  I cannot tell  For Lady Betty Williams  this very day  told me  That he declared to her  he was resolved you should be his  And she has promised him all her interest with you  and with us  and is astonished that you can refuse a man of his fortune and address  and who has many  very many  admirers  among people of the first rank   The baronet is at the door  I suppose he will expect to see me   Wednesday Afternoon   SIR Hargrave is just gone  He desired to talk with me alone  I thought I might very well decline obligeing him  as he had never scrupled to say to me all he had a mind to say before my cousins  and as he had thought himself of consequence enough to behave moodily  and even made this request rather with an air of expectation  than of respect  and I accordingly desired to be excused  He stalked about  My cousins  first one  then the other  withdrew  His behaviour had not been so agreeable  as to deserve this compliance  I was vexed they did   He offered  as soon as they were gone  to take my hand   I withdrew it   Madam  said he  very impertinently angry  you would not do thus to Mr  Greville  You would not do thus to any man but me   Indeed  Sir  I would  were I left alone with him   You see  madam  that I cannot forbear visiting you  My heart and soul are devoted to you  I own I have pride  Forgive me  it is piqued  I did not believe I should have been rejected by any Lady  who had no dislike to a change of condition  and was disengaged  You declare that you are so  and I am   154 willing  I am desirous  to believe you
