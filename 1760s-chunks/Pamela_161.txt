have written thus far  while Mrs  Jewkes lies   snoring in bed  fetching up her last night s disturbance  I long for her   rising  to know how my poor master does   Tis well for her she can sleep   so purely  No love  but for herself  will ever break her rest  I am   sure  I am deadly sore all over  as if I had been soundly beaten  I did   not think I could have lived under such fatigue       Mrs  Jewkes  as soon as she got up  went to know how my master did  and   he had had a good night  and  having drank plentifully of sack whey    had sweated much  so that his fever had abated considerably  She said   to him  that he must not be surprised  and she would tell him news  He   asked  What  And she said  I was come  He raised himself up in his bed    Can it be  said he  What  already   She told him I came last night    Monsieur Colbrand coming to inquire of his health  he ordered him to   draw near him  and was highly pleased with the account he gave him of   the journey  my readiness to come back  and my willingness to reach   home that night  And he said  Why  these tender fair ones  I think  bear   fatigue better than us men  But she is very good  to give me such an   instance of her readiness to oblige me  Pray  Mrs  Jewkes  said he  take   great care of her health  and let her be a bed all day  She told him I   had been up these two hours  Ask her  said he  if she will be so good as   to make me a visit  If she won t  I ll rise  and go to her  Indeed  sir    said she  you must be still  and I ll go to her  But don t urge her too   much  said he  if she be unwilling       She came to me  and told me all the above  and I said  I would most   willingly wait upon him  for  indeed  I longed to see him  and was much   grieved he was so ill   So I went down with her  Will she come  said   he  as I entered the room  Yes  sir  said we  and she said  at the first   word  Most willingly   Sweet excellence  said he       As soon as he saw me  he said  O my beloved Pamela  you have made me   quite well  I m concerned to return my acknowledgments to you in so   unfit a place and manner  but will you give me your hand  I did  and   he kissed it with great eagerness  Sir  said I  you do me too much   honour   I am sorry you are so ill   I can t be ill  said he  while you   are with me  I am very well already       Well  said he  and kissed my hand again  you shall not repent this   goodness  My heart is too full of it to express myself as I ought  But   I am sorry you have had such a fatiguing time of it   Life is no life   without you  If you had refused me  and yet I had hardly hopes you would   oblige me  I should have had a severe fit of it  I believe  for I was   taken very oddly  and knew not what to make of myself  but now I shall   be well instantly  You need not  Mrs  Jewkes  added he  send for the   doctor from Stamford  as we talked yesterday  for this lovely creature   is my doctor  as her absence was my disease       He begged me to sit down by his bed side  and asked me  if I had obliged   him with sending for my former packet  I said I had  and hoped it would   be brought  He said it was doubly kind       I would not stay long because of disturbing him  And he got up in the   afternoon  and desired my company  and seemed quite pleased  easy    and much better  He said  Mrs  Jewkes  after this instance of my good   Pamela s obligingness in her return  I am sure we ought to leave her   entirely at her own liberty  and pray  if she pleases to take a turn in   our chariot  or in the garden  or to the town  or wherever she will    let her be left at liberty  and asked
