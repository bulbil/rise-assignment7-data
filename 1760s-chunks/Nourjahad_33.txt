at first lay down to regulate thy conduct  thou gavest thyself up to all manner of vile excesses  and didst shew the depravity of the human heart  when unrestrained by divine laws     It was now time  I thought  to punish thee  and to shew thee the vanity of all  Page  230  earthly enjoyments  By opiates infused into thy wine that night on which thou didst debase thyself by drunkenness  I threw thee into a sound sleep  and though it lasted not much longer than the usual term of ordinary repose  it yet gave me an opportunity of making such farther dispositions  as I thought necessary for the carrying on of my design     I laid hold of this juncture to withdraw Mandana from thy arms  promising however to restore her to thee  if I found thee ever worthy of her     I believe it is needless to inform you  that the confinement I laid you under was for no other end than to cut off all  Page  231  intercourse between you and any others than those of your own household  every one of whom were of my placing about you  even to the ladies of your seraglio  who were no others than the prettiest slaves I could find  amongst those who attended on my own women     Every one entrusted with my secret  were tied down by the most solemn oaths to keep it inviolably  and this with a promise of reward  served  as the event has shewn  to secure their fidelity     There was not an action of thy life but I was made acquainted with  and whilst thou didst triumph in the joys of my successful illusion  I sometimes  Page  232  pitied thy weakness  and sometimes laughed at thy extravagance     That magnificent palace of which thou thoughtest thyself master  was one which I had borrowed for the purpose from an emir who was in my secret  and who was himself often present in disguise amongst your slaves  a witness to your extravagancies  I will not encrease thy confusion by reminding thee of the inordinate excesses thou wert guilty of in thy retirement  Thou canst not have forgot the project of creating for thyself an earthly paradise  This was the second crisis I laid hold on to punish thee  and by tearing thee from thy impious pleasures  to remind thee that crimes  Page  233  cannot be committed with impunity  A second sleep  procured as the former was  but of somewhat a longer duration  gave me full opportunity to make a total change in the face of thy affairs  Hasem  whom thou didst suppose to be dead  remained still secretly concealed in thy house  to be as it were the grand spring to move all the rest of thy domestics  The hags whom thou hadst imposed upon thee for the decayed beauties of thy seraglio  were really a set of notable old dames  whom he had tutored for the purpose  Thy former mistresses  who were insignificant slaves  were dismissed  She who personated the feigned Cadiga  acted her part to admiration  and with the artful contrivance of having  Page  234  a rose bud painted on her breast  a mark which your young favourite really bore from nature  she had cunning and address enough to impose herself on you for the very Cadiga whom you formerly loved     I believe  proceeded the sultan  you are by this time convinced  that there was nothing supernatural in the several events of your life  and that you were in reality nothing more than the dupe of your own folly and avarice     Thou mayst remember after this period  that  sated with voluptuousness  thy licentious heart began to grow hardened  and from rioting without controul in pleasures  which  however criminal  Page  235  in themselves  carry at least with them the excuse of temptation  thou wantonly didst stir up  and indulge the latent cruelty of thy nature  Thy ungoverned passions led thee to an act of blood  thou piercedst with thy poniard the honest creature who remonstrated with thee on thy evil works  but Heaven did not  however  permit thee to deprive her of life     See  ← Nourjahad →   of what the heart of man is capable  when he shuts his eyes against the precepts of our holy prophet  Thou stoodst as it were alone in the creation  and self dependent for thy own happiness or misery  thou lookedst not for rewards or punishments in that invisible world  from which thou  Page  236  thoughtest thyself by thy own voluntary act excluded     This last barbarous deed  however  called aloud for chastisement  and thou wast for the third time deceived with a belief that thou hadst slept a number of years  in which many mortifying revolutions had happened in thy family     I was now resolved to be myself an eye witness of thy behaviour  and to try if there was any spark of virtue remaining in thy soul which could possibly be rekindled     I disguised myself in the habit of a slave  and having altered my face  and my voice  I presented myself to thee under the name of
