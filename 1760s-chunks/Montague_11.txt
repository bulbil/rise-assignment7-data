romantic  nature reigns here in all her wanton luxuriance  adorned by a thousand wild graces which mock the cultivated beauties of Europe  The scenery about the town is infinitely lovely  the prospect extensive  and diversified by a variety of hills  woods  rivers  cascades  intermingled with smiling farms and cottages  and bounded by distant mountains which seem to scale the very Heavens       The days are much hotter here than in England  but the heat is more supportable from the breezes which always spring up about noon  and the evenings are charming beyond expression  We have much thunder and lightening  but very few instances of their being fatal  the thunder is more magnificent and aweful than in Europe  and the lightening brighter and more beautiful  I have even seen it of a clear pale purple  resembling the gay tints of the morning       The verdure is equal to that of England  and in the evening acquires an unspeakable beauty from the lucid splendor of the fire flies sparkling like a thousand little stars on the trees and on the grass       There are two very noble falls of water near Quebec  la Chaudiere and Montmorenci  the former is a prodigious sheet of water  rushing over the wildest rocks  and forming a scene grotesque  irregular  astonishing  the latter  less wild  less irregular  but more pleasing and more majestic  falls from an immense height  down the side of a romantic mountain  into the river St  Lawrence  opposite the most smiling part of the island of Orleans  to the cultivated charms of which it forms the most striking and agreeable contrast       The river of the same name  which supplies the cascade of Montmorenci  is the most lovely of all inanimate objects  but why do I call it inanimate  It almost breathes  I no longer wonder at the enthusiasm of Greece and Rome   twas from objects resembling this their mythology took its rise  it seems the residence of a thousand deities       Paint to yourself a stupendous rock burst as it were in sunder by the hands of nature  to give passage to a small  but very deep and beautiful river  and forming on each side a regular and magnificent wall  crowned with the noblest woods that can be imagined  the sides of these romantic walls adorned with a variety of the gayest flowers  and in many places little streams of the purest water gushing through  and losing themselves in the river below  a thousand natural grottoes in the rock make you suppose yourself in the abode of the Nereids  as a little island  covered with flowering shrubs  about a mile above the falls  where the river enlarges itself as if to give it room  seems intended for the throne of the river goddess  Beyond this  the rapids  formed by the irregular projections of the rock  which in some places seem almost to meet  rival in beauty  as they excel in variety  the cascade itself  and close this little world of enchantment       In short  the loveliness of this fairy scene alone more than pays the fatigues of my voyage  and  if I ever murmur at having crossed the Atlantic  remind me that I have seen the river Montmorenci       I can give you a very imperfect account of the people here  I have only examined the landscape about Quebec  and have given very little attention to the figures  the French ladies are handsome  but as to the beaux  they appear to me not at all dangerous  and one might safely walk in a wood by moonlight with the most agreeable Frenchman here  I am not surprized the Canadian ladies take such pains to seduce our men from us  but I think it a little hard we have no temptation to make reprisals       I am at present at an extreme pretty farm on the banks of the river St  Lawrence  the house stands at the foot of a steep mountain covered with a variety of trees  forming a verdant sloping wall  which rises in a kind of regular confusion     Shade above shade  a woody theatre     and has in front this noble river  on which the ships continually passing present to the delighted eye the most charming moving picture imaginable  I never saw a place so formed to inspire that pleasing lassitude  that divine inclination to saunter  which may not improperly be called  the luxurious indolence of the country  I intend to build a temple here to the charming goddess of laziness         A gentleman is just coming down the winding path on the side of the hill  whom by his air I take to be your brother  Adieu  I must receive him  my father is at Quebec       Yours    ARABELLA FERMOR       Your brother has given me a very pleasing piece of intelligence  my friend Emily Montague is at Montreal  and is going to be married to great advantage  I must write to her immediately  and insist on her making me a visit before she marries  She came to America two years ago  with her uncle Colonel Montague  who died here  and I imagined was gone back to England  she is however at Montreal with Mrs  Melmoth
