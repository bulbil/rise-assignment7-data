end  my dear Gil Blas  continued the prelate  there is one thing requisite from your zeal and friendship  Whenever it shall strike you that my pen begins to contract  as it were  the ossification of old age  whenever you see my genius in its climacteric  do not fail to give me a hint  There is no trusting to one s self in such a case  pride and conceit were the original sin of man  The probe of criticism must he intrusted to an impartial stander by  of fine talents and unshaken probity  Both those requisites centre in you  you are my choice  and I give myself up to your direction  Heaven be praised  my lord  said I  there is no need to trouble yourself with any such thoughts yet  Besides  an understanding of your grace s mould and calibre will last out double the time of a common genius  or to speak with more certainty and truth  it will never be the worse for wear  if you live to the age of Methusalem  I consider you as a second Cardinal Ximenes  whose powers  superior to decay  instead of flagging with years  seemed to derive new vigour from their approximation with the heavenly regions  No flattery  my friend  interrupted he  I know myself to be in danger of failing all at once  At my age one begins to be sensible of infirmities  and those of the body communicate with the mind  I repeat it to you  Gil Blas  as soon as you shall be of opinion that my head is not so clear as usual  give me warning of it instantly  Do not be afraid of offending by frankness and sincerity  to put me in mind of my own frailty will be the strongest proof of your affection for me  Besides  your very interest is concerned in it  for if it should  by any spite of chance towards you  come to my ears that the people say in town   His grace s sermons produce no longer their accustomed impression  it is time for him to abandon his pulpit to younger candidates   I do assure you most seriously and solemnly  you will not only lose my friendship  but the provision for life that I have promised you  Such will be the result of your silly tampering with truth   Here my patron left off to wait for my answer  which was an echo of his speech  and a promise of obeying him in all things  From that moment there were no secrets from me  I became the prime favourite  All the household  except Melchior de la Ronda  looked at me with an eye of envy  It was curious to observe the manner in which the whole establishment  from the highest to the lowest  thought it necessary to demean themselves towards his grace s confidential secretary  there was no meanness to which they would not stoop to curry favour with me  I could scarcely believe they were Spaniards  I left no stone unturned to be of service to them  without being taken in by their interested assiduities  My lord archbishop  at my entreaty  took them by the hand  He got a company for one  and fitted him out so as to make a handsome figure in the army  Another he sent to Mexico  with a considerable appointment which he procured him  and I obtained a good slice of his bounty for my friend Melchior  It was evident from these facts  that if the prelate was not particularly active in good works  at least he rarely gave a churlish refusal  when any one had the courage to importune him for his benevolence   But what I did for a priest seems to deserve being noticed more at large  One day a certain licentiate  by name Lewis Garcias  a well looking man still in the prime of life  was presented to me by our steward  who said    Signor Gil Blas  in this honest ecclesiastic you behold one of my best friends  He was formerly chaplain to a nunnery  Scandal has taken a few liberties with his chastity  Malicious stories have been trumped up to hurt him in my lord archbishop s opinion  who has suspended him  and unfortunately is so strongly prejudiced by his enemies  as to be deaf to any petition in his favour  In vain have we interested the first people in Grenada to get him re established  our master will not hear of it   These first people in Grenada  said I  have gone the wrong way to work  It would have been much better if no interest at all had been made for the reverend licentiate  People have only done him a mischief by endeavouring to serve him  I know my lord archbishop thoroughly  entreaties and importunate recommendations do but aggravate the ill condition of a clergyman who lies under his displeasure  it is but a very short time ago since I heard him mutter the following sentiment to himself The more persons a priest  who has been guilty of any misconduct  engages to speak to me in his behalf  the more widely is the scandal of the church disseminated  and the more severe is my treatment of the offender  That is very unlucky  replied the steward  and my friend would be put to his last shifts
