evil  Had that been pos    sible  my lord  it would unquestionably have been effected  But   if certain relations arise between God and his creatures  and be    tween man and man  which could not arise save on the previous   supposition of evil  without which  indeed  neither the attributes of   God himself  nor the insufficiency  dependence  or obligation of the   creature  could have been duly discoverable throughout eternity    then temporary evil becomes indispensably necessary to the con    sequence and consummation of the greatest good      Your notion  exclaimed the earl  is great  amazing  truly glorious    and every way worthy of a God who  in such a case  would be in    finitely worthy of all worship  Is this the reason  Mr  Meekly    that what we all so earnestly seek for is nowhere to be found    that no portion or taste of happiness is to be had upon earth       I do not say so  my lord  I think that a man  even on earth    may be occasionally  nay  durably and exceedingly happy      What  happy durably  exceedingly happy  repeated the earl    I was told that the experience of ages  that philosophy  and even   divinity    had agreed with Solomon in this that all upon earth   was vanity and vexation of spirit  If any may enjoy happiness   on this side of the great consummation that you speak of  I am   persuaded  Mr  Meekly  that you yourself are the man  Your   lips  indeed  say nothing of the matter   but neither your eyes nor   your aspect can restrain the expression of some extraordinary peace   that abides within  O  say then  my dear  my estimable friend    whence  how  by what means  may a man arrive at happiness  By   getting out of himself  my lord          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  31     Out of himself  Mr  Meekly  You astonish me greatly  A con    tradiction in terms  unnatural  impossible  God himself  my lord    cannot make a man happy in any other way  either here or here    after      It is  said the earl  an established maxim among all thinking   men  whether divines or philosophers  that SELF LOVE is the   motive to all human actions  Virtue forbid  exclaimed Mr    Meekly  All actions are justly held good or evil  base or honour    able  detestable or amiable  merely according to their motives    but if the motive is the same to all  there is an end  at once  to   the possibility of virtue the cruel and the kind  the faithful and   the perfidious  the prostitute and the patriot  are confounded   together      Do not all men  retained the earl  act agreeably to their   own propensities and inclinations  Do they not act so or so    merely because it pleases them so to act  And is not this pleasure   the same motive to all   By no means  my lord   it never was nor   can be the motive in any  We must go a question deeper to   discover the secret principle or spring of action  One man is   pleased to do good  another is pleased to do evil   now  whence   is it that each is pleased with purposes in their nature so opposite   and irreconcilable   Because  my lord  the propensities or motives   to action in each are as opposite and as irreconcilable as the ac    tions themselves   the one is prompted  and therefore pleased    with his purpose of doing evil to others through some base pro    spect of interest redounding to himself   the other is prompted and   spurred  and therefore pleased  with his purpose of endangering   his person  or suffering in his fortune  through the benevolent   prospect of the good that shall thereby redound to others      Pleasure is itself an effect  and cannot be the cause  or prin    ciple  or motive  to any thing   it is an agreeable sensation that   arises  in any animal  on its meeting or contemplating an object   that is suited to its nature  As far as the nature of such an animal   is evil  evil objects can alone effect it with pleasure   as far as the   nature of such an animal is good  the objects must be good whereby   its pleasures are excited      When Damon was sentenced  by Dionysius of Syracuse  to die   on such a day  he prayed permission  in the
