 Yes  said Lady Darnford  my dear neighbour    as I will call you  we that are here present have all heard of your   uncommon story  Madam  said I  you have then heard what must make your   kind allowance for me very necessary  No  said Mrs  Peters  we have   heard what will always make you valued as an honour to our sex  and as   a worthy pattern for all the young ladies in the county  You are very   good  madam  said I  to make me able to look up  and to be thankful for   the honour you are pleased to do me       Mrs  Jewkes came in with the canary  brought by Nan  to the alcove  and   some cakes on a silver salver  and I said  Mrs  Jewkes  let me be your   assistant  I will serve the ladies with the cake  And so I took the   salver  and went round to the good company with it  ending with my   master  The Lady Jones said  She never was served with such a grace    and it was giving me too much trouble  O  madam  said I  I hope my good   master s favour will never make me forget  that it is my duty to wait   upon his friends  Master  sweet one  said Sir Simon  I hope you won t   always call Mr  B     by that name  for fear it should become a fashion   for all our ladies to do the like through the county  I  sir  said I    shall have many reasons to continue this style  which cannot affect your   good ladies       Sir Simon  said Lady Jones  you are very arch upon us but I see very   well  that it will be the interest of all the gentlemen  to bring their   ladies into an intimacy with one that can give them such a good example    I am sure then  madam  said I  it must be after I have been polished and   improved by the honour of such an example as yours       They all were very good and affable  and the young Lady Darnford  who   had wished to see me in this dress  said  I beg your pardon  dear miss    as she called me  but I had heard how sweetly this garb became you  and   was told the history of it  and I begged it  as a favour  that you   might oblige us with your appearance in it  I am much obliged to your   ladyship  said I  that your kind prescription was so agreeable to my   choice  Why  said she  was it your choice then   I am glad of that    though I am sure your person must give  and not take  ornament from any   dress       You are very kind  madam  said I  but there will be the less reason to   fear I should forget the high obligations I should have to the kindest   of gentlemen  when I can delight to shew the humble degree from which   his goodness had raised me   My dear Pamela  said my master  if you   proceed at this rate  I must insist upon your first seven days  You know   what I mean  Sir  said I  you are all goodness       They drank a glass of sack each  and Sir Simon would make me do so too    saying  It will be a reflection  madam  upon all the ladies  if you   don t do as they  No  Sir Simon  said I  that can t be  because the   ladies  journey hither makes a glass of canary a proper cordial for   them  but I won t refuse  because I will do myself the honour of   drinking good health to you  and to all this worthy company       Said good Lady Darnford  to my master  I hope  sir  we shall have Mrs    Andrews s company at table  He said  very obligingly  Madam  it is her   time now  and I will leave it to her choice  If the good ladies  then    will forgive me  sir  said I  I had rather be excused  They all said    I must not be excused  I begged I might  Your reason for it  my dear   Pamela  said my master  since the ladies request it  I wish you would   oblige them  Sir  replied I  your goodness will make me  every day    worthier of the honour the ladies do me  and when I can persuade myself   that I am more worthy of it than at present  I shall with great joy
