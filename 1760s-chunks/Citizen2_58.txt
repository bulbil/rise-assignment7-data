even at the hazard of his salvation  After a weak Monarch s reign the quantity of court vermin in every corner of the palace is surprizing  but a prudent king and a vigilant officer soon drives them from their sanctuaries behind the matts and the tapestry  and effectually frees the court  Such an officer in England would in my opinion be serviceable at this juncture  for if  as I am told  the palace be old  much vermin must undoubtedly have taken refuge behind the wainscot and hangings  A minister should therefore be invested with the title and dignities of Court vermin killer  he should have full power either to banish  take  poison or destroy them  with enchantments  traps  ferrets  or ratsbane  He might be permitted to brandish his besom without remorse  and brush down every part of the furniture  without sparing a single cobweb however sacred by long prescription  I communicated this proposal some days ago in a company of the first distinction  and enjoying the most honourable offices of the state  Among the number were the inspector of Great Britain  Mr  Henriques the Director of the Ministry  Ben  Victor the Treasurer  John Lockman the secretary  and the Conductor of the Imperial Magazine  They all acquiesced   180 in the utility of my proposal  but were apprehensive it might meet with some obstructions from court upholsterers and chamber maids  who would object to it from the demolition of the furniture  and the dangerous use of ferrets and ratsbane   My next proposal is rather more general than the former  and might probably meet with less opposition  Though no people in the world flatter each other more than the English  I know none who understand the art less  and flatter with such little refinement  Their panegyric  like a Tartar feast  is indeed served up with profusion  but their cookery is insupportable  A client here shall dress up a fricassee for his patron  that shall offend an ordinary nose before it enters the room  A town shall send up their address to a great minister  which shall prove at once a satire on the minister and themselves  If the favourite of the day sits  or stands  or sleeps  there are poets to put it into verse  and priests to preach it in the pulpit  In order therefore to free both those who praise  and those who are praised from a duty probably disagreeable to both  I would constitute professed flatterers here as in several courts of India  These are appointed in the courts of their princes  to instruct the people where to exclaim with admiration  and where to lay an emphasis of praise  But an officer of this kind is always in waiting when the Emperor converses in a familiar manner among his Rajas and other nobility  At every sentence  when the Monarch pauses  and smiles at what he has been saying  the Karamatman  as this officer is called  is to take it for   181 granted  that his Majesty has said a good thing  Upon which he cries out Karamat  Karamat  a miracle  a miracle  and throws up his hands and his eyes in extacy  This is ecchoed by the courtiers around  while the Emperor sits all this time  in sullen satisfaction  enjoying the triumph of his joke  or studying a new repartee   I would have such an officer placed at every great man s table in England  By frequent practice he might soon become a perfect master of the art  and in time would turn out pleasing to his patron  no way troublesome to himself  and might prevent the nauseous attempts of many more ignorant pretenders  The clergy here  I am convinced  would relish this proposal  It would provide places for several of them  And indeed by some of their late productions many appear to have qualified themselves as candidates for this office already   But my last proposal I take to be of the utmost importance  Our neighbour the Empress of Russia has  you may remember  instituted an order of female knighthood  The Empress of Germany has also instituted another  the Chinese have had such an order time immemorial  I am amazed the English have never come into such an institution  When I consider what kind of men are made knights here  it appears strange  that they have never conferred this honour upon women  They make cheesemongers and pastrycooks Knights  then why not their wives  They have called up tallow chandlers to maintain the hardy profession of chivalry and arms  then why not their wives  Haberdashers are sworn  as I suppose all knights must be sworn  never to fly in time of mellay or battle    182 to maintain and uphold the noble estate of Chivalry  with horse harnishe and other Knightlye habiliments  Haberdashers  I say  are sworn to all this  then why not their wives  Certain I am their wives understand fighting and feats of mellay and battle better than they  and as for Knightlye horse and harnishe  it is probable both know nothing more than the harness of a one horse chaise  No  no  my friend  instead of conferring any order upon the husbands  I would knight their wives  However the State should not be troubled with a new institution upon this occasion  Some ancient exploded order might be
