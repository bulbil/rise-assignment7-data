than friendship  than gratitude  his merits   had inspired her with  she was conscious that  while she most resisted   the glowing pressure of his lips  she had felt a guilty pleasure in the   touch which had been near depriving her of doing so  and that  though   she had resolved never to see him more  it would be very difficult to   refrain wishing to be for ever with him       This she thought so highly criminal in herself  that she ought not to   indulge the remembrance of so dear  so dangerous  an invader of her   duty  yet when she considered that  merely for her sake  and not through   the weak resistance she had made  his own honour had nobly triumphed   over wild desire in a heart so young and amorous as his  it increased   that love and admiration which she in vain endeavoured to subdue  and   she could not help crying out  with Calista in the play             Oh  had I sooner known thy wond rous virtue        Thy love  thy truth  thou excellent young man        We might have both been happy        But  to banish as much as possible all those ideas which her nicety of   honour made her tremble at  it was her fixed determination to retire   into L    e as soon as she had ended her affairs with her husband  and   pass the remainder of her days  where she should never hear the too dear   name of Trueworth       She did not  therefore  neglect sending her servant to town  but he   returned that day  and several succeeding ones  without the least   intelligence  no letter nor message from Mr  Munden having been left for   her at her brother s  on which she began to imagine that he never had    in reality  intended to put his threats in execution       Mr  Markland  in the mean time  had been twice to wait upon him  but the   servants told him that their master was extremely indisposed  and could   not be seen  this he looked upon as a feint to put off giving him an   answer as he had promised  and both Mr  Thoughtless and his sister were   of the same opinion when they heard it  Mr  Markland went again and   again  however  but was still denied access  near a whole week passing   over in this manner  Mrs  Munden grew very uneasy  fearing she should be   able to obtain as little justice as favour from her husband       But  guilty as he had been in other respects  he was entirely innocent   in this  the force of the agitation he had of late sustained  joined to   repeated debauches  had over heated his blood  and thrown him into a   very violent fever  insomuch that in a few days his life was despaired   of  the whispers of all about him  the looks of the physician that   attended him  and  above all  what he felt within himself  convincing   him of the danger he was in  all his vices  all his excesses  now   appeared to him such as they truly were  and filled him with a remorse   which he had been but too much addicted to ridicule in others  in fine    the horrors of approaching dissolution  rendered him one of those many   examples which daily verify these words of Mr  Dryden              Sure there are none but fear a future state         And when the most obdurate swear they do not         Their trembling hearts belie their boasting tongues        Among the number of those faults which presented him with the most   direful images  that of the ill treatment he had given a wife  who so   little deserved it  lay not the least heavy upon his conscience  he sent   his servants to Mr  Thoughtless  at whose house he imagined she still   was  to intreat he would prevail on her to see him before he died  but   that gentleman giving a very slight answer  as believing it all   artifice  he engaged the apothecary who administered to him  and was   known by Mr  Thoughtless  to go on the same errand  on which the brother   of Mrs  Munden said she was not with him at present  but he would send   to let her know what had happened  Accordingly  he dispatched one of his   men immediately to her with the following billet             To Mrs  Munden
