to foot  and answered in a grave tone  What place would you wish to have  I should like  replied I  to be footman in some family where I should do well  He inquired whether the matter pressed  With all possible importunity  said I  for unless I have the good luck to get settled very soon  the alternative will be horrible  death by the gripe of absolute famine  or a livelihood in the ranks of your fraternity  If the latter were  after all  to be your lot  resumed he  it certainly would be rather hard upon you  who have not been brought up to our habits of life  but  with a little use and practice  you would prefer our condition to service  which  partiality apart  is far less respectable than the beggar s vocation  Nevertheless  since you like a menial occupation better than leading a free and independent life like me  you shall have a berth without more ado  Mean as my appearance  is  you must not measure my power by it  Meet me here at the same hour to morrow   I took care to keep the appointment  Though at the spot before the time  I had not long to wait before the beggar joined me  and told me to follow him  I did so  He led me to a cellar not far from the church where he resided  We went in together  and sitting down on a long bench  at least a hundred years the worse for wear  the conversation took this turn on his part  A good action  as the proverb says  always meets with its reward  you gave me alms yesterday  and that has determined me to get you a place  which shall be soon done  with a blessing on my endeavours  I know an old Dominican  by name Father Alexis  a holy monk  a ghostly confessor  I have the honour to do all his little odd jobs  performing my task with so much discretion and good faith  that he always lends his interest to me and my friends  I have spoken to him about you  and in such terms as to prepossess him in your favour  You may be introduced to his reverence whenever you please   There is not a moment to be lost  said I to the old beggar  let us go to the good monk immediately  The mendicant agreed  and led me by the arm to Father Alexis  whom we found in his room  hard at work  writing spiritual letters  He broke off to talk with me  As it was the wish of the mendicant  he would do all in his power to serve me  Having learnt  pursued be  that Signor Balthasar Velasquez is in want of a footboy  I wrote to him this morning on your behalf  and he just sent me for answer  that he would take you without further inquiry on my recommendation  This very day you may call on him from me  he is one of my flock  and my very good friend  Thereupon the monk preached to me for three quarters of an hour on my moral and religious duties  and how to fulfil them in conscience and honour  He enlarged principally on the obligation of serving Velasquez with diligence and devotion  and then assured me that he would take care and keep me in my place  provided my master had no very material fault to find with me   After having thanked the holy person for his goodness towards me  I left the convent with the beggar  who told me that Signor Balthasar Velasquez was an old woollen draper  but with much simplicity and good nature in his character  I doubt not  added he  but you will be perfectly comfortable in his house  I begged to know his place of residence  and repaired thither immediately  after promising to make my gratitude manifest  as soon as I had taken root in my new soil  I went into a large shop  where two fashionable young apprentices were walking up and down  practising new grimaces against the entrance of the next customer  I inquired whether their master was at home  saying that I wanted to speak with him from Father Alexis  At that venerable name they shewed me into the counting house  where their principal was turning over the ledger  I made a low bow  and coming up to him  Sir  said I  Father Alexis ordered me to call here and offer myself as a servant to your honour  Ah  my smart lad  answered he  you are heartily welcome  It is enough that the holy man sent you  and I shall take you in preference to three or four others who have been recommended  It is a clear case  your wages begin from this day   A very short time in the family convinced me that the head of it was just such a man as he had been described  In point of simplicity  be was everything that could be wished  so exquisite a subject for imposition  that it seemed next to an impossibility not to exercise my craft upon such a handle  He had been a widower four years  and had two children  a son five and twenty  and a daughter in her eleventh year
