 how could you do so  and ever love me  Did you not know  there was but one way to   9 escape the grievous consequences of the importunities of those who justly lay claim to my obedience —And they do claim it   And in what forcible manner  claim it —Shall I tell you  Thus  then  My father  with tears in his eyes  beseeches me  My mother gently reminds me of what she has suffered for me in my illness  and declares  that it is in my power to make the rest of her days happy  Nor shall she think my own tranquility of mind secured  ▪till I oblige her —O Chevalier  what pleas are these from a father  whose eyes plead more strongly than words  and from a mother  on whose bright days I cast a cloud —The Bishop pleads  How can a Catholic Bishop plead  and not for me  The General declares  that he never wooed his beloved wife for her consent with more fervour than he does me for mine  to oblige them all  Nay  Jeronymo  Blush  sisterly love  to say it—Jeronymo  your friend Jeronymo  is solicitous on the same side—Even Father Marescotti is carried away by the example of the Bishop —Mrs  Beaumont argues with me in their favour —And Camilla  who was ever full of your praises  teazes me continually   They name not the man  They pretend to leave me free to choose through the world  They plead  that  zealous as they are in the Catholic faith  they were so earnest for me to enter into the state  that they were desirous to see me the wife even of a Protestant  rather than I should remain single  And they remind me  that it was owing to my scruple only  that this was not effected —But why  why will they weaken rather than strengthen my scruple  Could I have got over three points—The sense of my own unworthiness  after my mind had been disturbed  The insuperable apprehension  that  drawn aside by your Love  I should probably have ensnared my own Soul  and that I should be perpetually lamenting the certainty of the loss of his whom it would be my   10 duty to love as my own  their importunity would hardly have been wanted   Tell me advise me  my good Chevalier  my fourth brother  You are not Now interested in the debate  if I may not lawfully stand out  Tell me  as I know that I cannot answer their views  except I marry  and yet cannot consent to marry  whether I may not as well sequester myself from the world  and insist upon so doing   What  what can I do —I am distressed—O thou  my Brother  my Friend  whom my heart ever must hold dear  advise me  To you I have told them I will appeal  They are so good as to promise to suspend their solicitations  if I will hold suspended my thoughts of the veil till I have your advice —But give it not against me—If you ever valued Clementina   Give it not against her   LETTER IV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Lady CLEMENTINA    London  Monday  Sept  18—29   WHAT can I say  most excellent of women  to the contents of the Lerter you have honoured me with  What a task have you imposed upon me  You take great  and  respecting your intentions  I will call it  kind care  to let me know that I can have no interest in the decision of the case you refer to me  I repeat my humble acquiescence  but must again declare  that it would have been next to impossible to do so  had you not made a point of conscience of your scruples   But what weight is my advice likely to have with a young Lady  who repeatedly  in the close of her Letter  desires me not to give it for her parents   I  madam  am far from being unprejudiced in this case  For can the man who once himself hoped for   11 the honour of your hand  advise you against Marriage —Are not your parents generously indulgent  when they name not any particular person to you  I applaud both their wisdom and their goodness  on this occasion  Possibly  you guess the man whom they would recommend to your choice  And I am sure  Lady Clementina would not refuse their recommendation merely because it was theirs  Nor indeed upon any less reason than an unconquerable aversion  or a preference to some other Catholic  A Protestant  it seems  it cannot be   But let me ask my Sister  my Friend  What answer can I return to the Lady who had shewn  in one instance  that she had not an insuperable aversion to Matrimony  yet on conscientious reasons refusing one man  and not particularly favouring any  can scruple to oblige  obey is not the word they use     a Father  who with tears in his eyes beseeches her  a Mother who gently reminds her of what she has suffered for her  who declares  that it is in her power to make the rest of her days happy  and who urges a still stronger plea
