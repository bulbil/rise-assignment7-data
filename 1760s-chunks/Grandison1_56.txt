 and from his answers to the questions asked him   Sir Hargrave has been here again  Mrs  Revees  Miss Dolyns  Miss Clements  and I  were in the back room together  We had drank tea  and I excused myself to his message  as engaged   He talked a good deal to Mr  Reeves  Sometimes high  sometimes humble  He had not intended  he said  to have renewed his visits  My disdain had stung him to the heart  Yet he could not keep away  He called himself names  He was determined I should be his  and swore to it  A man of his fortune to be refused  by a Lady who had not  and whom he wished not to have  an answerable fortune  and no preserable liking to any other man  There Sir Hargrave was mistaken  for I like almost every man I know  better than him   his person not contemptible  And then  my cousin says  he surveyed himself from head to foot in the glass   was very  very unaccountable   He asked if Mr  Greville came up with any hopes   Mr  Reeves told him that I was offended at his coming  and he was sure he would not be the better for his journey   He was glad of that  he said  There were two or three free things  proceeded he  said to me in conversation by Mr  Greville  which I knew not well what to make of  But they shall pass  if he has no more to boast of than I  I know Mr  Greville s blustering character  but I wish the carrying of Miss Byron were to depend upon the sword s point between us  I would not come into so paltry a compromise with him as Fenwick has done  But still the imputing   135 want of morals to me  sticks with me  Surely I am a better man in point of morals  than either Greville or Fenwick  What man on earth does not take liberties with the Sex  Hay  you know  Mr  Reeves  Women were made for us  And they like us not the worse for loving them  Want of morals —And objected to me by a lady —Very extraordinary  by my soul —Is it not better to sow all one s wild oats before matrimony  than run riot afterwards —What say you  Mr  Reeves   Mr  Reeves was too patient with him  He is a mild man  Yet wants not spirit  my cousin says  on occasion  He gave Sir Hargrave the hearing  who went away  swearing  that I should be his  in spite of man or devil   Monday Night   MR  Greville came in the Evening  He begged to be allowed but ten words with me in the next room  I desired to be excused  You know  Sir  said I  that I never complied with a request of this nature  at Selby house  He looked hard at my cousins  and first one  then the other  went out  He then was solicitous to know what were Sir Hargrave s expectations from me  He expressed himself uneasy upon his account  He hoped such a man as that would not be encouraged  Yet his ample fortune—Woman  woman —But he was neither a wiser nor a better man than himself  And he hoped Miss Byron would not give a preference to fortune merely  against a man who had been her admirer for so long a time  and who wanted neither will nor power to make her happy   It was very irksome to me  I answered  to be obliged so often to repeat the same things to him  I would not be thought assronting to any body  especially to a neighbour with whom my friends were upon good terms  But I did not think myself answerable to him  or to any one out of my own family    136 for my visitors  or for whom my cousin Reeves s thought fit to receive as theirs   Would I give him an assurance  that Sir Hargrave should have no encouragement   No  Sir  I will not  Would not that be to give you indirectly a kind of controul over me  Would not that be to encourage an hope  that I never will encourage   I love not my own soul  madam  as I love you  I must  and will persevere  If I thought Sir Hargrave had the least hope  by the great God of heaven  I would pronounce his days numbered   I am but too well acquainted with your rashness  Mr  Greville  What formerly passed between you and another gentleman  gave me pain enough  In such an enterprize your own days might be numbered as well as another s  But I enter not into this subject—Henceforth be so good as not to impute incivility to me  if I deny myself to your visits   I would have withdrawn—  Dear Miss Byron  stepping between me and the door  leave me not in anger  If matters must stand as they were  I hope you can  I hope you will  assure me  that this Sir Fopling—  What right have you  Sir
