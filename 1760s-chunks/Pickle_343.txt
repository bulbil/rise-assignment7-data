milder and more agreeable than our hero  expected from the misanthrope  that they had a very favourable effect  upon his transports  which gradually subsided  until he became so  tractable as to promise that he would conform to his advice  in  consequence of which  he next morning waited upon his lordship  who  received him very politely  as usual  and with great patience heard his  complaint  which  by the bye  he could not repeat without some hasty  ebullitions of passionate resentment  This peer  after having gently  disapproved of the letter of expostulation  which had produced such  unfortunate effects  kindly undertook to recommend his case to the  minister  and actually performed his promise that same day  when Sir  Steady informed him  to his utter astonishment  that the poor young  gentleman was disordered in his brain  so that he could not possibly be  provided for in a place of importance  with any regard to the service   and it could not be expected that he  Sir Steady  would support his  extravagance from his own private purse  that he had  indeed at the  solicitation of a nobleman deceased  made him a present of three  hundred pounds  in consideration of some loss that he pretended to have  sustained in an election  but  since that time  had perceived in him  such indisputable marks of lunacy  both by his distracted letters and  personal behaviour  as obliged him to give order that he should not be  admitted into the house  To corroborate this assertion  the minister  actually called in the evidence of his own porter  and one of the  gentlemen of his household  who had heard the execrations that escaped  our youth  when he first found himself excluded  In short  the nobleman  was convinced that Peregrine was certainly and bona fide mad as a March  hare  and  by the help of this intimation  began to recollect some  symptoms of distraction which appeared in his last visit  he remembered  a certain incoherence in his speech  a violence of gesture and wildness  of look  that now evidently denoted a disturbed understanding  and he  determined  for his own credit and security  to disentangle himself from  such a dangerous acquaintance   With this view  he  in imitation of Sir Steady  commanded his gate to be  shut against our adventurer  so that  when he went to know the result of  his lordship s conference with the minister  the door was flung in his  face  and the janitor told him through an iron grate  that he needed not  to give himself the trouble of calling again  for his lord desired to  be excused from seeing him  He spoke not a word in answer to this  declaration  which he immediately imputed to the ill offices of the  minister  against whom he breathed defiance and revenge  in his way to  the lodgings of Cadwallader  who  being made acquainted with the manner  of his reception  begged he would desist from all schemes of vengeance   until he  Crabtree  should be able to unriddle the mystery of the whole   which he did not doubt of unveiling by means of his acquaintance with a  family in which his lordship often spent the evening at whist   It was not long before he had the desired opportunity  the nobleman  being under no injunctions or obligation to keep the affair secret   discovered the young gentleman s misfortune  by way of news  to the  first company in which he happened to be  and Peregrine s name was not  so obscure in the fashionable world  but that his disorder became the  general topic of conversation for a day  so that his friend soon partook  of the intelligence  and found means to learn the particulars of the  minister s information  as above related  Nay  he was in danger of  becoming a proselyte to Sir Steady s opinion  when he recalled and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   compared every circumstance which he knew of Pickle s impatience and  impetuosity  Indeed  nothing more easily gains credit than an imputation  of madness fixed upon any person whatsoever  for when the suspicion of  the world is roused  and its observation once set at work  the wisest   the coolest man upon earth  will  by some particulars in his behaviour   convict himself of the charge  every singularity in his dress and manner   and such are observable in every person   that before passed unheeded   now rises up in judgment against him  with all the exaggeration of the  observer s fancy  and the sagacious examiner perceives distraction in  every glance of the eye  turn of the finger  and motion of the head   When he speaks  there is a strange peculiarity in his argument and  expression  when he holds his tongue  his imagination teems with some  extravagant reverie  his sobriety of demeanour is no other than a lucid  interval  and his passion mere delirium   If people of the most sedate and insipid life and conversation are  subject to such criticisms  no wonder that they
