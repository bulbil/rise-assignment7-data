for which he is obliged only to his own merit  his tender heart  full of the most laudable  the most engaging sensibility  melts at the idea of a separation which will not be less painful to us       The Count  after expressing the most obliging concern at the thought of losing me  and the warmest gratitude for these supposed marks of my friendship  insisted on my spending the rest of the day with them  I consented  but begged first to return to my lodgings  on pretence of giving some necessary orders  but in reality to give vent to my full heart  torn with a thousand contrary emotions  amongst which  I am shocked to own  hatred to the generous Count was not the weakest  I threw myself on the ground  in an agony of despair  I wept  I called Heaven to witness the purity of my love  I accused the Countess          1 29       of cruelty in thus forcing me from Rome  I rose up  I begun a letter to her  in which I vowed an eternal silence and respect  but begged she would allow me still the innocent pleasure of beholding her  swore I could not live without seeing her  and that the day of my leaving Rome would be that of my death     But why do I thus tear open wounds which are but just healed  let it suffice  that a moment s reflexion convinced me of my madness  and shewed the charming Countess in the light of a guardian angel snatching me from the edge of a precipice  My reason in some degree returning  I drest myself with the most studious care  and returned to the Melespini palace  where I found the Abbate Camilli  a near relation of the family  whose presence saved me the confusion of being the third with my injured friends  and whose lively conversation soon dissipated the air of constraint I felt on        1 30       entering the room  and even dispelled part of my melancholy      The Count  whose own probity and virtue set him far above suspecting mine  pressed me  with all the earnestness of a friendship I so little merited  to defer my journey a week  on which I raised my downcast eyes to Madam Melespini  for such influence had this lovely woman over my heart  I did not dare to consent till certain of her permission  and  reading approbation in a smile of condescending sweetness  I consented with a transport which only those who have loved like me can conceive  my chearfulness returning  and some of the most amiable people in Rome coming in  we past the evening in the utmost gaiety  At taking leave  I was engaged to the same company in different parties of amusement for the whole time I had to stay  and had the joy of being every day with the Countess  though I never found an opportunity          1 31       of speaking to her without witnesses  till the evening before I left Rome  when  going to her house an hour sooner than I was expected  I found her alone in her closet  When I approached her  my voice faltered  I trembled  I wanted power to address her  and this moment  fought with such care  wished with such ardor  was the most painful of my life  Shame alone prevented my retiring  my eyes were involuntarily turned towards the door at which I entered  in a vain hope of that interruption I had before dreaded as the greatest misfortune  and even the presence of my happy envied rival would at that moment have been most welcome      The Countess seemed little less disconcerted than myself  however  recovering herself sooner   Signor Enrico   said she   your discretion charms me  it is absolutely necessary you should leave Rome  it has already cost me an artifice unworthy          1 32       of my character to conceal from the Count a secret which would have wounded his nice honor and destroyed his friendship for you  After this adored husband  be assured  you stand first of all your sex in my esteem  the sensibility of your heart  though at present so unhappily misplaced  encreases my good opinion of you  may you  my dear Enrico  meet with an English Lady worthy of your tenderness  and be as happy in marriage as the friends you leave behind  Accept   pursued she  rising and going to a cabinet   these miniatures of the Count and myself  which I give you by his command  and  when you look on them  believe they represent two faithful friends  whose esteem for you neither time nor absence can lessen       I took the pictures eagerly  and kissed that of the Countess with a passion I could not restrain  of which however she took          1 33       not the least notice  I thanked her  with a confused air
