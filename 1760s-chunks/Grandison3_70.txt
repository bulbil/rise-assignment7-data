spoke highly of it  Twice  afterwards  I saw her in company where I was a visiter  I had not the presumption to look up to her with hope  but my countryman Mr  Jervois gave me to understand  that I might be master of my own fortune with Lady Olivia  I pleaded difference of religion  He believed  he said  that matter might be made easy—But could I be pleased with the change  would she have made it  when passion  not conviction  was likely to be the motive —There could be no objection to her person  Nobody questioned her virtue  but she was violent and imperious in her temper  I had never left MIND out of my notions of love  I could not have been happy with her  had she been queen of the globe  I had the mortification of being obliged to declare myself to the Lady s face  It was a mortification to me  as much for her sake as my own  I was obliged to leave Florence upon it  for some time  having been apprized  that the spirit of revenge had taken place of a gentler passion  and that I was in danger fromit   How often did I lament the want of that refuge in a   172 father s arms  and in my native country  which subjected me to evils that were more than a match for my tender years  and to all the inconveniencies that can attend a banished man  Indeed I often considered myself in this light  and  as the inconveniencies happened  was ready to repine  and the more ready  as I could not afflict myself with the thought of having forfeited my father s love  on the contrary  as the constant instances which I received of his paternal goodness  made me still more earnest to acknowlege it at his feet   Ought I to have forborn  Lucy  shewing a sensibility at my eyes on this affecting instance of filial gratitude  If I ought  I wish I had had more command of myself  But consider  my dear  the affecting subject we were upon  I was going to apologize for the trickling tear  and to have said  as I truly might  Your filial goodness  Sir  affects me  But  with the consciousness that must have accompanied the words  would not that  to so nice a discerner  have been to own  that I thought the tender emotion wanted an apology  These little tricks of ours  Lucy  may satisfy our own punctilio  and serve to keep us in countenance with ourselves  and that  indeed  is doing something   but  to a penetrating eye  they tend only to shew  that we imagined a cover  a veil  wanting  and what is that veil  but a veil of gauze   What makes me so much afraid of this man s discernment  Am I not an honest girl  Lucy   He proceeded   From this violent Lady I had great trouble  and to this day—But this part of my story I leave to Dr  Bartlett to acquaint you with  I mention it as a matter that yet gives me concern  for her sake  and as what I find has given some amusement to my sister Charlotte s curiosity   Bu• I hasten to the affair which  of all others  has most embarrassed me  and which  engaging my compassion    173 tho  my honour is free  gives torture to my very soul   I found myself not well—I thought I should have fainted—The apprehension of his taking it as I wished him not to take it  for indeed  Lucy  I don t think it was that  made me worse  Had I been myself  this faintishness might have come over my heart  I am sure it was not that  But it seized me at a very unlucky moment  you ll say   With a countenance full of tender concern  he caught my hand  and rang  In ran his Emily  My dear Miss Jervois  said I  leaning upon her—Excuse me  Sir—And I withdrew to the door  And  when there  finding my faintishness going off  I turned to him  who attended me thither  I am better  Sir  already  I will return  instantly  I must beg of you to proceed with your interesting story   I was well the moment I was out of the Study  It was kept too warm  I believe  and I sat too near the fire  That was it  to be sure  and I said so  on my return  which was the moment I had drank a glass of cold water   How tender was his regard for me  He did not abash me by causlesly laying my disorder on his story  and by offering to discontinue or postpone it  Indeed  Lucy  it was not owing to that  I should easily have distinguished it  if it had  On the contrary  as I am not generally so much affected at the moment when any thing unhappy befals me  as I am upon reflexion  when I extend  compare  and weigh consequences  I was quite brave in my heart  Any thing  thought I  is better than suspense
