 She has not stirred out of her chamber since Wednesday morning  nor designs it for a week or two to come   Sunday   MY dearest Friend  my Lover  my Husband  every tender word in one  left his noble guests for their sakes early last night  and he was pleased to tell me  for his own sake  longing to see  to thank  to applaud his Harriet  He brought with him the two young noblemen  who are our own immediate guests   He gave me  last night and this morning  an account of what passed between the family and himself  from his arrival at Dover  to their coming to town last night   They confessed the highest obligations to him for attending them in person  and for bringing Mr  Lowther with him  But when  on their eager questions to him after their Clementina  he told them  that he had heard from her  and that she had owned herself to be in honourable and tender hands  the Marquis lifted up his eyes in thankful rapture  The Marchioness  with clasped hands  seemed to praise God  but her lips only moved  All the rest expressed their joy in words dictated by truly affectionate hearts   Sir Charles found them all most cordially disposed to forgive the dear fugitive  as the Bishop called her  But  depend upon it  added the Prelate  nothing will secure her head  but our yielding to her in her long wished for hope of the convent  or on prevailing on her to marry  And if you  Grandison  join with us  I question not  but the latter may be effected   Sir Charles blamed them for having precipitated her as they had done   That  said the Bishop  was partly the fault of our well meaning Giacomo  and partly her own  for more than once she gave us hope that she would comply with our wishes     166 I besought Sir Charles  that he would not be prevailed upon to take part with them  if she continued averse to a change of condition   I waved the subject  my dearest Life  replied he  at the time  I have continued to do so ever since  I want only to see them settled  and Lady Clementina composed  and then I shall know what can be done  Till then  arguments on either side  will rather strengthen than remove difficulties   The Bishop  with great concern  told Sir Charles  that when the first news of Clementina s flight was brought to Bologna  her poor mother was for two days as unhappy in her mind  as ever her daughter had been  and when it was found likely that Clementina was gone to England  she insisted so vehemently on following her  that they had no other way to pacify her  but by promising that they would out of hand  pay to Sir Charles the visit they intended  and some of them had engaged to make him  Nor would she  when she grew better on their promise  acquit them of it  This determined them to this winter excursion  sorely against the will of some of them  And it was in compassion to this unhappy state of the poor mother s mind  that Mrs  Beaumont consented to accompany her   Sir Charles is gone to attend Lady Clementina  He then proposes to welcome the Count of Belvedere into England  and afterwards to wait on the noble family  and know when I shall be permitted to pay my devoirs to them   Sunday  Two o clock   SIR Charles has found it very difficult to quiet the apprehensions of Lady Clementina  He is grieved for her  God grant  he prays  that she keep in her right mind  Lady L  thinks the poor Lady is already disturbed   Sir Charles was joyfully received by Signor Marsigli  He owned to that Lord  that he knew where to   167 send Letters to Lady Clementina  He is to introduce me by and by to his guests at Grosvenor Square   Sunday night   SIR Charles presented me to this expecting family  I admire them all   The Marquis and Marchioness are a fine couple  There is dignity in their aspects and behaviour  A fixed kind of melancholy sits upon the features of each  The Bishop has the man of quality in his appearance  but he has something more solemn in his countenance than even Father Marescotti  who  at a glance  is not unlike our Dr  Bartlett  The more like  as goodness and humility both shine in his countenance   But Signor Jeronymo is an amiable young man  I could  almost at first sight  and his winning grace confirmed me  have called him Brother  With signal kindness did my Sir Charles present me to this his dear friend  and with equal kindness did Signor Jeronymo receive me  and congratulate Sir Charles  They all joined in the congratulation   The amiable Mrs  Beaumont —She embraced me  She felicitated me  with such a grace  as made her manner surpass even her words   The good Camilla was presented to me  She has the look of a gentlewoman  How many scenes did the sight of this good woman revive in my memory
