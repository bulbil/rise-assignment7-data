him  reap  bind  and gather is your harvest  when the sun sets  the gleaners are sent home  I asked Fabricio whether his suspicions were surely founded  and he returned me this answer  My information comes from an old knight of Calatrava  who pokes his nose into secrets of all sorts  his authority passes current at Madrid  much as that of the Pythian newsmongers did through Greece  and thus his oracle was pronounced in my hearing  My lord duke has a host of enemies in battle array against him  he reckons too securely upon his influence with the king  for his majesty  as the report goes  begins to take in hostile representations with patience  I thanked Nunez for his friendly warning  but without much faith in his prediction  my master s authority seemed rooted in the court  like the tempest scoffing firmness of an oak in the native soil of the forest   Cu  VIII     Gil Blas finds that Fabricio s hint was not without foundation  The king s journey to Saragossa   THE poet of the Asturias was no bad politician  There was a court plot against the duke  with the queen at the bottom  but their plans were too deeply laid to bubble at the surface  During the space of a whole year  my simplicity was insensible to the brewing of the tempest   The revolt of the Catalans  with France at their back  and the ill success of the war for their suppression  excited the murmurs of the people  and whetted their tongues against government  A council was held in the royal presence  and the Marquis de Grana  the emperor s ambassador  was specially requested to assist  The subject in debate was whether the king should remain in Castile  or go and take the command of his troops in Arragon  The minister spoke first  and gave it as his opinion that his majesty should not quit the seat of government All the members supported his arguments  with the exception of the Marquis de Grana  whose whole heart was with the house of Austria  and the sentiments of his soul on the tip of his tongue  after the homely honesty of his nation  He argued so forcibly against the minister  that the king embraced his opinion from conviction  though contrary to the vote of council  and fixed the day when he would set out for the army   This was the first time that ever the sovereign had differed from his favourite  and the latter considered it as an inexpiable affront  Just as the minister was withdrawing to his closet  there to bite upon the bridle  he espied me  called me in  and told me with much discomposure what had passed in debate  Yes  Santillane  observed he  the king  who for the last twenty years has spoken only through my mouth  and seen with my eyes  is now to be wheedled over by Grana  and that on the score of zeal for the house of Austria  as if that German had a more Austrian soul in his body than myself   Hence it is easy to perceive  continued the minister  that there is a strong party against me  with the queen at the head  Heaven forbid it  said I  Has not the queen for upwards of twelve years been accustomed to your paramount authority  and have you not taught the king the knack of not consulting her  The desire of making a campaign may for once have enlisted his majesty on the side of the Marquis de Grana  Say rather that the king  argued my lord duke  will be surrounded by his principal officers when in camp  and then the disaffected will find their opportunity for poisoning him against my administration  But they overreach themselves  for I shall completely insulate the prince from all their approaches  and so he did  in a manner which  for example  deserves not to be passed over   The day of the king s departure being arrived  the monarch  leaving the queen regent  proceeded for Saragossa by way of Aranjuez  a delightful residence  where he whiled away three weeks  Cuen√ßa was the next stage  where the minister detained him still longer by a succession of amusements  A hunting party was contrived at Molina in Arragon  and hence there was no choice of road but to Saragossa  The army was near at hand  and the king was preparing to review it  but his keeper sickened him of the project  by making him believe that he would be taken by the French  who were in force in the neighbourhood  so that he was cowed by a groundless apprehension  and consented to be a prisoner in his own court  The minister  from an affectionate regard to his safety  secluded him from all approach  so that the principal nobility  who had equipped themselves at enormous charges to be about his person  could not even procure an occasional audience  Philip  weary of bad lodgings and worse recreation at Saragossa  and perhaps feeling himself scarcely his own master  soon returned to Madrid  Thus ended the royal campaign  and the care of maintaining the honour of the Spanish colours was left to the Marquis de los Velez  commander in chief       CH  IX
