for to my knowledge  she has seven thousand pounds  as I was informed by Lady V——  who knew her circumstances   Sir George vented two or three curses on her head  I am not surprized at any instance of her falshood  said he  she is made up of deceit  Such characters as her’s are not uncommon  but none of them ever fell in your way before  and I hope never will again  If you will    look back on her whole conduct  however it may surprize you  you will find there is nothing inconsistent in it  She is only a sly rake in petticoats  of which there are numbers  that you good women would stare at  if you knew their behaviour  She considers men just as the libertines of our sex do women  She likes for the present  she seduces  her inclinations cool towards an old lover  and are warmed again by a new face  She retained not Faulkland long enough to grow tired of him  and therefore possibly still preserved some tenderness for him  indeed his uncommon attractions must have made an impression even on her heart  but this did not hinder her from indulging her inclinations elsewhere  You must throw into the account too that she had by accident got a sort of hold on him  of which  by my mother’s indulgence  and some other concurring circumstances  she hoped one day or other to avail herself  With so pretty a person as she has  and the fortune you tell me she is mistress of  do you think she could have failed of marrying creditably  if that had been her view  No  no she meant not to confine herself  Her passion for Faulkland  whether real or pretended  gave a colour to her preserving that liberty  in the licentious use of which she placed her happiness  nor would she in the end have confined herself within the bounds of marriage  if an immense fortune had not sweetened the restraint   I pray heaven it may  answered I  ’tis all we have now to trust to  You have given me an idea of a character  which I thought was not in the female world   I own  replied Sir George  I live in perpetual fears of her relapsing into vice  A woman without principle  Sidney  is not to be relied on  Love  if in such a breast it can merit that name  even towards the most deserving object  is never permanent  Fear  and even shame  are subdued by repeated crimes  what hold then remains  Interest alone  where that happens to interfere   but if detection can be avoided  even that can have do farther influence   Sir George took his leave of me  in order to go home to dress  but I was not to say a word of his morning visit  so that I found I needed not to be under any apprehensions of reproaching Lady Sarah with her behaviour towards me  for he meant not to let her know he was informed of it  So much the better  I should be extremely sorry to be the occasion of any difference between them   They came at the appointed hour  I entertained them magnificently  and we were all harmony and good humour  When dinner was    over  I told them  they must not be surprized  if we should have a visit from our West Indian relation  in the evening  for that it was very probable he would call  and if I should be denied  he would never forgive me  as he possibly might find it out  Lady Sarah looked frightened  and said she would not stay  but Sir George declared he would arm himself with a few bumpers  and stand his ground   I affected to treat the interview with pleasantry and reconciled them both to it  for I was really apprehensive that Mr Warner would take it very ill  and think I betrayed him  if I let them escape  I supposed too  that after he had indulged himself in a short triumph  all would be over  and they might afterwards meet on better terms   In less than half an hour  we heard a loud rap  Lady Sarah turned pale  Sir George laughed at her  but was himself a little disconcerted  The parlour door flew open—a footman entered—Mr Warner—and in stalked my kinsman  with a very stately tread  He was dressed out  I assure you  A large well powdered wig  tied with a rose  a suit of the finest cinamon coloured cloth  and over it a surtout of the richest mohair and silk  with gold frogs  and a fine clouded cane  with a gold head  silk stockings of the same colour with his coat  a fine lace cravat  his hat under his arm  He really looked very gentleman like  and venerable  for he appears older than he is   He glanced his eyes with a supercilious scorn  over my brother and sister  who stood up at his entrance  and making up directly to me  saluted me  and took his place by me  A short silence ensued  which was broken by my asking Mr Warner to drink a glass of wine  I could almost have smiled at the
