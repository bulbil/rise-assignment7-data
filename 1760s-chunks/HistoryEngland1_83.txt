a country house  and directed that an inventory of his goods should be taken  which contained immense riches  acquired by various methods of guilt and extortion  of fine holland alone there were found in his house a thousand pieces  which may serve to give an idea of the rest of his wealth  The parliament confirmed the sentence of the courts  and he was sent an exile to his country   243 seat  there to await the King s disposal of his person  with all the fluctuations of hope and apprehension  Still  however  he was left the archbishopric of York  and  even shattered as his fortunes were  he was resolved to perform the ceremony of his instalment there with a magnificence little suitable to his present condition  but  while he was preparing to enjoy  in this retreat  those splendors which he ever loved  by another unexpected revolution  he was at the King s command arrested by the Earl of Northumberland for high treason  He at first refused to comply  as being a Cardinal  but  finding the Earl bent upon performing his commission  he complied  and set out  by easy journies  for London  to appear as a criminal in a place where he formerly acted as a King  In his way he stayed a fortnight at the Earl of Shrewsbury s  where one day at dinner he was taken ill  not without violent suspicions of having poisoned himself  being brought forward from thence  with much difficulty he reached Leicester abbey  where  the Monks coming out to receive him  he said  Father Abbot  I am come to lay my bones among you  as his disorder increased  an officer being placed near his bed side at once to guard and attend him  he cried out to him    O  if I had served my God as I have served my King  he would not thus have forsaken me in adversity   He died soon after  in all the pangs of repentance and remorse  and left a life which he had all along rendered turbid by ambition  till he found that all his ambition was but vanity at the last  He left two natural children behind him  one of whom being a priest  was loaded with church preferments  Henry  being thus freed from a person whom he considered as an obstacle to his intentions  by the advice of Cranmer had the legality of his present   244 marriage canvassed in the different universities of Europe  It was very extraordinary to see the King on one side soliciting the universities to be favourable to his passion  and on the other the Emperor pressing them to incline to his aunt  Henry liberally rewarded those Doctors who declared in his favour  and the Emperor granted benefices to such as voted on his side of the debate  Time has discovered these intrigues  in one of Henry s account books we find the disbursements he made upon these occasions  to a deacon he gave a crown  to a subdeacon two crowns  and so of the rest  to each in proportion to his consequence  The person who bribed on these occasions  however  excused himself by declaring  that he never paid the money till after the vote was given  Henry at length prevailed  his liberalities were greater than those of his rival  as he was most interested in the success of the debate  all the colleges of Italy and France unanimously declared his present marriage against all law  divine and human  and that therefore it was not at first in the power of the Pope to grant a dispensation  The only places where it was most warmly opposed  were at Cambridge and Oxford  these universities  it seems  had  even then  more freedom and integrity than were to be found else where  but at last they also concurred in the same opinion     The agents of Henry were not content with the suffrages of the universities  the opinions of the Rabbi s were also demanded  but they were easily bought up in his favour  Thus fortified  the King was resolved to oppose even the Pope himself  for his passion by no means could brook the delays and subterfuges of the Holy See  being    245 therefore  supported by his clergy  and authorised by the universities  having seen the Pope formerly degraded by a lay Monarch  and Luther s doctrine followed by thousands  and yet  still further instigated by the King of France  he  without further dispensation  annulled his marriage with Queen Catharine  and Cranmer  now become an Archbishop  pronounced the decree   The Queen  during this contest  always supported her rights with resolution  and yet with modesty  at length  however  having found the inutility of further resistance  she retired to the country  without once offering to complain  she saw the power of her rival  and yielded without murmuring  Anna Bullen had already consented to marry the King  and even shared his bed two months before his marriage with Catharine was dissolved  Though her prudence and her virtue demanded esteem in the former parts of her conduct  yet she now for a moment forgot the ties of each  and gave a loose to her triumph  She passed through London with a magnificence greater than had ever been known before
