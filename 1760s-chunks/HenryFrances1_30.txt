make you  at some Time of your Life  not ashamed of having loved me  In short  if you bear any Affinity to that Omnipotence which accepts a contrite Heart  you cannot meet a more sincere Devotee  but  if you are like one of those Heathen Deities  which required an human Sacrifice  I declare  I have no Offering for your Altar   Frances     93  LETTER LV   Dear HARRY   THO  you have ventured upon that same Subject again  yet you have done it with so much Address  that I need not hold any Resolution of not answering your Letter  The sudden Change in your Morals  I confess  surprizes me  but too prompt Converts  they say  are seldom sincere  and it must be a Goose indeed  that is not aware  when a Fox preaches   Now  I think  even your former Letter more tolerable than this  for there you declared open War  here you would circumvent  and it would humour my Pride  rather to be overpowered  than to be over reached  What you propose  would do well enough for a Woman  who only waited for an Excuse  But  in my Opinion  this would only mend the Matter  like Hypocrisy added to Vice  or  at best  a Sort of don t know  as it were  neither this  nor that  nor one  nor t other  nor good  nor bad  but hanging  like Erasmus s Paradise  between Heaven and Hell  without Vice enough to repent of  or Virtue sufficient to boast of — Away  away — I ll ha  none on t  I ll ha  none on t —    94I am not so unreasonable to take it ill  that you do not offer what  I know  is not  at present  within your Power and Prudence  but  I have really great Reason to resent  that you should attempt to offer me any Thing short of it   You rally me  very unfairly  upon what you call my Platonicks  For  I never pretended to carry Affectation to such a ridiculous Length  so that I only declare myself a Platonick in Virtue  not in Romance   Your Scheme is  perhaps  a very plausible one for the World  if I should have Occasion   To tell them by and by  how the Rogue served me     But  notwithstanding  there is wanting to me a certain Self conviction  without which  all your Sense and Logick serve only to puzzle the Will  not to determine it   You have  without Doubt  a very extraordinary Art  which I never perceived in any other Person  and which it is impossible for me to describe without a Paradox  it is a Faculty of convincing the Reason  without satisfying the Mind  I know  before hand  your ready Answer to this  that it shews People s Prejudices stronger than their Reason  But be it so  for me —when Prejudices are on the safe Side  it is a Virtue to listen to them  and I have just now luckily recollected an admirable   95 Sentiment  I heard you once quote  from some antient Ethicks    That we should never venture upon any Action  where we have the least Doubt about its being honest or dishonest  for this very Doubt declares  at least  our own innate Consciousness about it  which is higher  and prior to Logick and Casuistry   This  and such other good Things  has my dear Harry often said  read  and wrote to me  for  when you are not on your Guard  I have often detected you to be a Man of Honour and Virtue  and  whenever you appear otherwise  I am convinced that it is more the Vice of the Times  than of the Man  which was the Apology made for the Puns of Shakespear — Indeed  I tremble often  to think how my dear Harry may be  beaten with many Stripes      I have burned your last  and former Letter  upon this Subject  lest they should ever happen to appear  to the Disadvantage of your Character  or to the Prejudice of mine   I would have preserved the Wit of them  if I had been Chymist enough to separate the Gold from the Dross  but they perished together in the Flames  the natural Consequence of keeping bad Company   Adieu   Frances     96  LETTER LVI   I HOPE my dear Harry will excuse my Selfishness  when I honestly confess  that I am better pleased his Negligence should be owing to almost any Cause  than his Forgetfulness of me  Do not infer from this  that I am unconcerned at your Illness  for  indeed  I have felt it severely  and Doubt has added a thousand Fears  which I hope will never exist  but in my tortured Fancy  and  surely  your Neglect of Writing could not be worse timed  for  I really wanted something to support my Spirits  in the Scene of Sorrow  I have gone thro   since we parted  Were I to repeat the Circumstances  which have happened
