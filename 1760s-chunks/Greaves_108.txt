I have your happiness very much at heart—your father was an honest man  to whom my family had manifold obligations  I have had these many years a personal regard for yourself  derived from your own integrity of heart and goodness of disposition—I see  you are affected  and shall be brief —Besides this regard  I am indebted to your friendship for the liberty— what shall I say —for the inestimable happiness I now enjoy  in possessing the most excellent—But I understand that significant glance of my Aurelia  I will not offend her delicacy—The truth is  my obligation is very great  and it is time I should evince my gratitude— If the stewardship of my estate is worth your acceptance  you shall have it immediately  together with the house and farm of Cockerton in my neighbourhood  I know you have a passion for Mrs  Dolly  and believe she looks upon you with the eyes of tender prepossession—don t blush  Dolly —Besides your agreeable person  which all the world must approve  you can boast of virtue  fidelity  and friendship  Your attachment to Lady Greaves neither she nor I shall ever forget—If you are willing to unite your fate with Mr  Clarke  your mistress gives me leave to assure you she will stock the farm at her own expense  and we will celebrate the wedding at Greavesbury Hall —  By this time the hearts of these grateful lovers had overflowed  Dolly was sitting on her knees  bathing her lady s hand with her tears  and Mr  Clarke appeared in the same attitude by Sir Launcelot  The uncle  almost as affected as the nephew by the generosity of our adventurer  cried aloud   I pray God that you and your glorious consort may have smooth seas and gentle gales whithersoever you are bound  as for my kinsman Tom  I ll give him a thousand pounds to set him fairly afloat  and if he prove not a faithful tender to you his benefactor  I hope he will founder in this world  and be damned in that which is to come   Nothing now was wanting to the completion of their happiness but the consent of Dolly s mother at the Black Lion  who they did not suppose could have any objection to such an advantageous match for her daughter  but in this particular they were mistaken   In the meantime they arrived at the village where the knight had exercised the duties of chivalry  and there he received the gratulation of Mr  Fillet and the attorney who had offered to bail him before Justice Gobble  Mutual civilities having passed  they gave him to understand that Gobble and his wife were turned Methodists  All the rest of the prisoners whom he had delivered came to testify their gratitude  and were hospitably entertained  Next day they halted at the Black Lion  where the good woman was overjoyed to see Dolly so happily preferred  but when Sir Launcelot unfolded the proposed marriage  she interrupted him with a scream— Christ Jesus forbid—marry and amen —match with her own brother    At this exclamation Dolly fainted  her lover stood with his ears erect  and his mouth wide open  Crowe stared  while the knight and his lady expressed equal surprise and concern  When Sir Launcelot entreated Mrs  Cowslip to explain this mystery  she told him  that about sixteen years ago  Mr  Clarke  senior  had brought Dolly  then an infant  to her house  when she and her late husband lived in another part of the country  and as she had then been lately delivered of a child which did not live  he hired her as a nurse to the little foundling  He owned she was a love begotten babe  and from time to time paid handsomely for the board of Dolly  who he desired might pass for her own daughter  In his last illness  he assured her he had taken care to provide for the child  but since his death she had received no account of any such provision  She moreover informed his honour  that Mr  Clarke had deposited in her hands a diamond ring  and a sealed paper  never to be opened without his order  until Dolly should be demanded in marriage by the man she should like  and not then  except in the presence of the clergyman of the parish   Send for the clergyman this instant   cried our hero  reddening  and fixing his eyes on Dolly   I hope all will yet be well    The vicar arriving  and being made acquainted with the nature of the case  the landlady produced the paper  which  being opened  appeared to be an authentic certificate  that the person commonly known by the name of Dorothy Cowslip  was in fact Dorothy Greaves  daughter of Jonathan Greaves  Esq   by a young gentlewoman who had been some years deceased    The remaining part of the mystery I myself can unfold   exclaimed the knight  while he ran and embraced the astonished Dolly as his kinswoman   Jonathan Greaves was my uncle  and died before he came of age  so that he could make no settlement on his child  the fruit of a private amour  founded on a promise of marriage  of which this ring was a token  Mr  Clarke  being his confidant  disposed of the child  and
