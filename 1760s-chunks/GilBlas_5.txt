and melancholy consequences  of his dejection     CH  XII     The proceedings at the Castle of Loeches after his lordship s death  and the course which Santillane adopted     CH  XIII     The return of Gil Blas to his seat  His joy at finding his god daughter Seraphina marriageable  and his own second venture in the lottery of love     CH  XIV     A double marriage  and the conclusion of the history     THE AUTHOR S DECLARATION   THERE are some people in the world so mischievous as not to read a work without applying the vicious or ridiculous characters it may happen to contain to eminent or popular individuals  I protest publicly against the pretended discovery of any such likenesses  My purpose was to represent human life historically as it exists  God forbid I should hold myself out as a portrait painter  Let not the reader then take to himself public property  for if he does  he may chance to throw an unlucky light on his own character  as Phaedrus expresses it  Stulte nudabit animi conscientiam   Certain physicians of Castille  as well as of France  are sometimes a little too fond of trying the bleeding and lowering system on their patients  Vices  their patrons  and their dupes  are of every day s occurrence  To be sure  I have not always adopted Spanish manners with scrupulous exactness  and in the instance of the players at Madrid  those who know their disorderly modes of living may reproach me with softening down their coarser traits  but this I have been induced to do from a sense of delicacy  and in conformity with the manners of my own country     GIL BLAS TO THE READER   READER  hark you  my friend  Do not begin the story of my life till I have told you a short tale  Two students travelled together from Penafiel to Salamanca  Finding themselves tired and thirsty  they stopped by the side of a spring on the road  While they were resting there  after having quenched their thirst  by chance they espied on a stone near them  even with the ground  part of an inscription  in some degree effaced by time  and by the tread of flocks in the habit of watering at that spring  Having washed the stone  they were able to trace these words in the dialect of Castille  Aqui esta encerrada el alma del licenciado Pedro Garcias   Here lies interred the soul of the licentiate Peter Garcias    Hey day  roars out the younger  a lively  heedless fellow  who could not get on with his deciphering for laughter  This is a good joke indeed   Here lies interred the soul           A soul interred          I should like to know the whimsical author of this ludicrous epitaph  With this sneer he got up to go away  His companion  who had more sense  said within himself  Underneath this stone lies some mystery  I will stay  and see the end of it  Accordingly  he let his comrade depart  and without loss of time began digging round about the stone with his knife till he got it up  Under it he found a purse of leather  containing an hundred ducats with a card on which was written these words in Latin   Whoever thou art who hast wit enough to discover the meaning of the inscription  I appoint thee my heir  in the hope thou wilt make a better use of my fortune than I have done   The student  out of his wits at the discovery  replaced the stone in its former position  and set out again on the Salamanca road with the soul of the licentiate in his pocket   Now  my good friend and reader  no matter who you are  you must be like one or the other of these two students  If you cast your eye over my adventures without fixing it on the moral concealed under them  you will derive very little benefit from the perusal  but if you read with attention you will find that mixture of the useful with the agreeable  so successfully prescribed by Horace       INTRODUCTION by WM  MORTON FULLERTON   WALTER SCOTT  who craved the beatitude    the word is his own    that would attend the perusal of another book as entrancing as Gil Blas  was on the side of the untutored public which knows nothing of technical classifications or of M  Brunetière s theory of the  evolution des genres   Lesage s great book  though scarcely answering to the exact technical definition of a picaresque novel    the biography of a picaro or rogue    belongs  nevertheless  by its external form  to the picaresque type of fiction  and Scott would certainly have admitted that its picaresqueness was very good of its kind  that it was in fact as picaresque as could be expected of a Frenchman who was conspicuously an  honnête homme  and who signed himself  bourgeois de Paris   But In all likelihood he would have instantly added that it was not the  picaresqueness  of Gil Blas which has
