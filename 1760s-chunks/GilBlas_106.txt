You are right  said Arsenia  we never lose an author till we have made his fortune  When that is done  as soon as we have provided for the ungrateful devils  they get to be in good case  and then they run restive  Luckily the manager does not break his heart after them  and one is just as good as another to the public   These liberal and sagacious remarks met with their full share of approbation  It was carried unanimously that authors  though treated rather too scurvily be hind the scenes  were on the whole the obliged persons  These fretters of an hour upon the stage ranked the inhabitant of Parnassus below themselves  and malice could not degrade him lower       CH  XII     Gil Blas acquires a relish for the theatre  and takes a full swing of its pleasures  but soon becomes disgusted   THE party sat at table till it was time to go to the theatre  I went after them  and saw the play again that evening  I took such delight in it  that I was for attending every day  I never missed  and by degrees got accustomed to the actors  Such is the force of habit  I was particularly delighted with those who were most artificial and unnatural  nor was I singular in my taste   The beauties of composition affected me much on the same principle as the excellence of representation  There were some pieces with which I was enraptured  I liked  among others  those which brought all the cardinals or the twelve peers of France upon the stage  I got hold of striking passages in these incomparable performances  I recollect that in two days I learnt by heart a whole play  called  The Queen of Flowers  The Rose  who was the queen  had the Violet for her maid of honour  and the Jessamin for her prime minister  I could conceive nothing more elegant or refined  such productions seemed to be the triumph of our Spanish wit and invention   I was not content to store my memory and discipline my mind with the choicest selections from these dramatic masterpieces  but I was bent on polishing my taste to the highest perfection  To secure this grand object  I listened with greedy ears to every word which fell from the lips of the players  If they commended a piece  I was ravished by it  but suppose they pronounced it bad  why  then I maintained that it was infernal stuff  I conceived that they must determine the merits of a play  as a jeweller the water of a diamond  And yet the tragedy by Pedro de Moya was eminently successful  though they had predicted its entire miscarriage  This  however  was no disparagement of their critical skill in my estimation  and I had rather believe the audience to be divested of common sense  than doubt the infallibility of the company  But they assured me  on all hands  that their judgments were usually confirmed by the rule of contraries  It seemed to be a maxim with them  to set their faces point blank against the taste of the public  and as a proof of this  there were a thousand cases in point of unexpected successes and failures  All these testimonies were scarcely sufficient to undeceive me   I shall never forget what happened one day at the first representation of a new comedy  The performers had pronounced it uninteresting and tedious  they had even prophesied that it would not be heard to the end  Under this impression  they got through the first act  which was loudly applauded  This was very astonishing  They played the second act  the audience liked it still better than the first  The actors were confounded  What the devil  said Rosimiro  this comedy succeeds  At last they went on in the third act  which rose as a third act ought to rise  I am quite thrown upon my back  said Ricardo  we thought this piece would not be relished  and all the world are mad after it  Gentlemen  said one of the players archly  it is because we happened accidentally to overlook all the wit   From this time I held my opinion no longer of the players as competent judges  and began to appreciate their merit more truly than they had estimated that of the authors  All the lampoons which were current about them were fully justified  The actors and actresses ran riot on the applauses of the town  and stood so high in their own conceit  as to think that they conferred a favour by appearing on the boards  I was shocked at their public misconduct  but unfortunately reconciled myself too easily to their private manners  and plunged into debauchery  How could I do otherwise  Every word they uttered was poison in the ears of youth  and every scene that was presented  an alluring picture of corruption  Had I been a stranger to what passed with Casilda  with Constance  and with the other actresses  Arsenia s house alone would have been sufficient for my ruin  Besides the old noblemen of whom I have spoken  there came thither young debauchees of fashion  who forestalled their inheritances by the disinterested mediation of money lenders  and sometimes we had officers under government  who were so far from
