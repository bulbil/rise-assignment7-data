in furnishing the ways and means  It is true that hitherto  heaven be praised  we have rubbed on  but what witch to conjure for a wind  now  I know not  the case is desperate  All this prosing is extremely impertinent  interrupted Don Matthias  this countinghouse talk makes me hideously nervous  So then  Rodriguez  you really think to undertake my reform  and metamorphose me into a plodding manager of my own estates  A very elegant sort of pastime for a man in my station of life  a man of rank and fashion  Grant me patience  replied the steward  at the rate we are driving now  it is easily calculated how soon you will be released from all those cares  You are a very great bore  resumed the young nobleman rather peevishly  this brutal importunity is downright murder to one s feelings  I hate loud music  be so good as to let me be ruined pianissimo  I tell you I want two hundred pistoles  and I must have them  Why  then  said Rodriguez  we must have recourse to the old rascal who has lent you so much already on usurious terms  Have recourse to the devil  if he will do you any good  answered Don Matthias  only let me have two hundred pistoles  and it is the same thing to me how you manage to get them   While he was uttering these words in a hasty and fretful tone  the steward went out  and Don Antonio Centellés  a young man of quality  came in  What is the matter  my friend  said this last to my master  your atmosphere is overcast  I trace passion in the lines of your countenance  Who can have ruffled that sweet temper  I would lay a wager  it was that booby just gone out  Yes  answered Don Matthias  he is my steward  Every time he comes to speak to me  I am in an agony for a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes  He rings the changes on the state of my affairs  and tells me that I am spending principal and interest A beast  He will say next  that I have ruined him into the bargain  My dear fellow  replied Don Antonio  I am exactly in the same situation  My man of business is just such another scarecrow as your steward  When the sneaking scoundrel  after repeated demands  brings me some niggardly supply  it is just as if he was lending me his own  He expostulates most barbarously  Sir  says he  you are going to rack and ruin  there is an execution out against you  I am obliged to cut him short  and beg him to remonstrate in epitome  The worst of it is  said Don Matthias  that there is no doing without these fellows  they are the penance attached to our elegant indiscretions  Just so  replied Centellés  But listen  pursued he  bursting into a fit of laughter  a pleasant idea has just struck me  Nothing was ever more farcically fancied  We may introduce a buffo caricato into our serious opera  and relieve the knell of our departed goods and chattels with an humorous divertissement  The plot is thus  let me try to borrow from your steward whatever you want  You shall do the same with my man of business  Then let them both preach as they please  we shall hearken with the utmost composure  Your steward will come and open his case to me  my man of business will plead the poverty of the land to you  I shall hear of nothing but your extravagance  and you will see your own in mine as in a glass  It will be vastly entertaining   A thousand brilliant conceits followed this flight of genius  and put the young patricians into high spirits  so that they kept up the ball with vivacity  if not with wit  Their conversation was interrupted by Gregorio Rodriguez  who brought back with him a little old man with a bald head  Don Antonio was for moving off  Farewell  Don Matthias  said he  we shall meet again anon  I leave you with these gentlemen  you have  doubtless  some state affairs to discuss in council  Oh  no  no  answered my master  you had better stop  you will not interrupt us  This warm old gentleman has the moderation to lend me money at twenty per cent  What  at twenty per cent  exclaimed Centellés in a tone of astonishment  In good truth  I wish you joy on being in such hands  I do not come off so cheaply  for my part  I pay through the nose for every farthing I get  My loans are generally raised at double that per cent  There is usury  said the father of the usurious tribe  unconscionable dogs  Where do they expect to go when they die  I do not wonder there is so strong a prejudice against money lenders  It is the exorbitant profit which some of them derive from their discounts  that brings reproach and ill  will upon us all  If all my brethren of the blue balls were like me  we should not be treated so scurvily  for my part  I only lend to do my duty towards my
