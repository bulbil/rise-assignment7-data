company s admission  The owner of this  collection was a cheesemonger  who received them in a woollen nightcap     6 22 15  3 45 PM   with straps buttoned under his chin  As he understood no language but  his own  he told them  by the canal of one of their conductors  that he  did not make a practice of showing his curiosities  but understanding  that they were Englishmen  and recommended to his friends  he was  content to submit them to their perusal  So saying  he led them up a  dark stair  into a small room  decorated with a few paltry figures in  plaster of Paris  two or three miserable landscapes  the skins of an  otter  seal  and some fishes stuffed  and in one corner stood a glass  case  furnished with newts  frogs  lizards  and serpents  preserved in  spirits  a human foetus  a calf with two heads  and about two dozen of  butterflies pinned upon paper   The virtuoso having exhibited these particulars  eyed the strangers with  a look soliciting admiration and applause  and as he could not perceive  any symptom of either in their gestures or countenances  withdrew a  curtain  and displayed a wainscot chest of drawers  in which  he  gave them to understand  was something that would agreeably amuse the  imagination  Our travellers  regaled with this notice  imagined that  they would be entertained with the sight of some curious medals  or  other productions of antiquity  but how were they disappointed  when  they saw nothing but a variety of shells  disposed in whimsical figures   in each drawer  After he had detained them full two hours with a tedious  commentary upon the shape  size  and colour of each department  he  with  a supercilious simper  desired that the English gentlemen would frankly  and candidly declare  whether his cabinet  or that of Mynheer Sloane   at London  was the most valuable  When this request was signified in  English to the company  the painter instantly exclaimed   By the Lard   they are not to be named of a day  And as for that matter  I would not  give one corner of Saltero s coffee house at Chelsea for all the trash  he hath shown   Peregrine  unwilling to mortify any person who had done  his endeavour to please him  observed  that what he had seen was very  curious and entertaining  but that no private collection in Europe was  equal to that of Sir Hans Sloane  which  exclusive of presents  had cost  an hundred thousand pounds  The two conductors were confounded at this  asseveration  which  being communicated to the cheesemonger  he shook  his head with a significant grin  and  though he did not choose to  express his incredulity in words  gave our hero to understand  that  he did not much depend upon his veracity  From the house of this  Dutch naturalist  they were draggled all round the city by the painful  civility of their attendants  who did not quit them till the evening was  well advanced  and then not till after they had promised to be with  them before ten o clock next day  in order to conduct them to a country  house  situated in a pleasant village on the other side of the river   Pickle was already so much fatigued with their hospitality  that  for  the first time of his life  he suffered a dejection of spirits  and  resolved  at any rate  to avoid the threatened persecution of to morrow   With this view  he ordered his servants to pack up some clothes and  linen in a portmanteau  and in the morning embarked  with his governor   in the treckskuyt  for the Hague  whither he pretended to be called by  some urgent occasion  leaving his fellow travellers to make his apology  to their friends  and assuring them  that he would not proceed for  Amsterdam without their society  He arrived at the Hague in the  forenoon  and dined at an ordinary frequented by officers and people of  fashion  where being informed that the princess would see company in the  evening  he dressed himself in a rich suit of the Parisian cut  and went  to court  without any introduction  A person of his appearance could not    6 22 15  3 45 PM   fail to attract the notice of such a small circle  The prince himself   understanding he was an Englishman and a stranger  went up to him  without ceremony  and  having welcomed him to the place  conversed with  him for some minutes on the common topics of discourse   CHAPTER LXV    They proceed to the Hague  from whence they depart for Amsterdam  where  they see a Dutch Tragedy  Visit the Music house  in which Peregrine  quarrels with the Captain of a Man of War  They pass through Haerlem  in  their way to Leyden  Return to Rotterdam  where the Company separates   and our Hero  with his Attendants  arrive in safety at Harwich
