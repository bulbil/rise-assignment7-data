of our eastern posture masters or show men have ever ventured to England  I should be pleased to see that money circulate in Asia  which is now sent to Italy and France  in order to bring their vagabonds hither  Several of our tricks would undoubtedly give the English high satisfaction  Men of fashion would be greatly pleased with the postures as well as the condescention of our dancing girls  and ladies would equally admire the conductors of our fire works  What an agreeable surprize would it be to see a huge fellow with whiskers flash a charged blunderbuss full in a lady s face  without singing her hair  or melting her pomatum  Perhaps when the first surprize was over  she might then grow familiar with danger  and the ladies might vie with each other in standing fire with intrepidity   But of all the wonders of the east  the most useful  and I should fancy  the most pleasing  would be the looking glass of Lao  which reflects the mind as well as the body  It is said that the emperor Chusi used to make his concubines dress their heads and their hearts in one of these   196 glasses every morning  while the lady was at her toilet  he would frequently look  over her shoulder  and it is recorded that among the three hundred which composed his seraglio  not one was found whose mind was not even more beautiful than her person   I make no doubt but a glass in this country would have the very same effect  The English ladies  concubines and all  would undoubtedly cut very pretty figures in so faithful a monitor  There  should we happen to peep over a lady s shoulder while dressing  we might be able to see neither gaming nor ill nature  neither pride  debauchery  nor a love of gadding  We should find her  if any sensible defect appeared in the mind  more careful in rectifying it  than plaistering up the irreparable decays of the person  nay  I am even apt to fancy  that ladies would find more real pleasure in this utensil in private  than in any other bauble imported from China  though never so expensive  or amusing   LETTER XLV  To the same   UPON finishing my last letter I retired to rest  reflecting upon the wonders of the glass of Lao  wishing to be possessed of one here  and resolved in such a case to oblige every lady with a sight of it for nothing  What fortune denied me waking  fancy supplied in a dream  the glass  I know not how  was put into my possession  and I   197 could perceive several ladies approaching  some voluntarily  others driven forward against their wills by a set of discontented genii  whom by intuition I knew were their husbands   The apartment in which I was to show away was filled with several gaming tables  as if just forsaken  the candles were burnt to the socket  and the hour was five o clock in the morning  Placed at one end of the room  which was of prodigious length  I could more easily distinguish every female figure as she marched up from the door  but guess my surprize  when I could scarce perceive one blooming or agreeable face among the number  This  however  I attributed to the early hour  and kindly considered that the face of a lady just risen from bed ought always to find a compassionate advocate   The first person who came up in order to view her intellectual face was a commoner s wife  who  as I afterwards found  being bred during her virginity in a pawn broker s shop  now attempted to make up the defects of breeding and sentiment by the magnificence of her dress  and the expensiveness of her amusements  Mr  Showman  cried she  approaching  I am told you has something to shew in that there sort of magic lanthorn  by which folks can see themselves on the inside  I protest  as my lord Beetle says  I am sure it will be vastly pretty  for I have never seen any thing like it before  But how  are we to strip off our cloaths and be turned inside out  if so  as lord Beetle says  I absolutely declare off  for I would not strip for the world before a man s face  and so I tells his lordship almost every night of my life   I informed the lady that   198 I would dispense with the ceremony of stripping  and immediately presented my glass to her view   As when a first rate beauty  after having with difficulty escaped the small pox  revisits her favourite mirror  that mirror which had repeated the flattery of every lover  and even added force to the compliment  expecting to see what had so often given her pleasure  she no longer beholds the cherried lip  the polished forehead  and speaking blush  but an hateful phyz  quilted into a thousand seams by the hand of deformity  grief  resentment  and rage fill her bosom by turns  she blames the fates and the stars  but most of all the unhappy glass feels her resentment  So it was with the lady in question  she had never seen her own mind before  and was now shocked at its deformity
