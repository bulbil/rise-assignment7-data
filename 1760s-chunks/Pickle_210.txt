He plied his steed to the height of his mettle  and so much  was his imagination engrossed by the prospect of having Emilia in his  power  that he did not perceive the road on which he travelled was quite  different from that which led to the habitation of Mrs  Gauntlet  The  valet de chambre was an utter stranger to that part of the country  and   as for Mr  Pipes  such considerations were altogether foreign to the  economy of his reflection   Ten long miles had our hero rode  when his eyes were blessed with the  sight of the chaise ascending an hill  at the distance of a good league   upon which he doubled his diligence in such a manner  that he gained  upon the carriage every minute  and at length approached so near to  it  that he could discern the lady and her conductor  with their heads  thrust out at the windows  looking back  and speaking to the driver  alternately  as if they earnestly besought him to augment the speed of  his cattle   Being thus  as it were  in sight of port  while he crossed the road  his  horse happened to plunge into a cart rut with such violence  that he  was thrown several yards over his head  and  the beast s shoulder being  slipped by the fall  he found himself disabled from plucking the fruit   which was almost within his reach  for he had left his servants at a  considerable distance behind him  and although they had been at his  back  and supplied him with another horse  they were so indifferently  mounted  that he could not reasonably expect to overtake the flyers  who  profited so much by this disaster that the chaise vanished in a moment   It may be easily conceived how a young man of his disposition passed his  time  in this tantalizing situation  He ejaculated with great fervency   but his prayers were not the effects of resignation  He ran back  on foot  with incredible speed  in order to meet his valet  whom he  unhorsed in a twinkling  and  taking his seat  began to exercise his  whip and spurs  after having ordered the Swiss to follow him on the  other gelding  and committed the lame hunter to the care of Pipes   Matters being adjusted in this manner  our adventurer prosecuted the  race with all his might  and  having made some progress  was informed  by a countryman  that the chaise had struck off into another road  and   according to his judgment  was by that time about three miles ahead   though  in all probability  the horses would not be able to hold out  much longer  because they seemed to be quite spent when they passed  his door  Encouraged by this intimation  Peregrine pushed on with great  alacrity  though he could not regain sight of the desired object  till  the clouds of night began to deepen  and even then he enjoyed nothing  more than a transient glimpse  for the carriage was no sooner seen  than  shrouded again from his view  These vexatious circumstances animated his  endeavours  while they irritated his chagrin  In short  he continued his  pursuit  till the night was far advanced  and himself so uncertain about  the object of his care  that he entered a solitary inn  with a view of  obtaining some intelligence  when  to his infinite joy  he perceived the  chaise standing by itself  and the horses panting in the yard     6 22 15  3 45 PM   In full confidence of his having arrived at last at the goal of all his  wishes  he alighted instantaneously  and  running up to the coachman   with a pistol in his hand  commanded him  in an imperious tone  to  conduct him to the lady s chamber  on pain of death  The driver   affrighted at this menacing address  protested  with great humility   that he did not know whither his fare had retired  for that he himself  was paid and dismissed from the service  because he would not undertake  to drive them all night across the country without stopping to refresh  his horses  But he promised to go in quest of the waiter  who would  show him to their apartment  He was accordingly detached on that errand   while our hero stood sentinel at the gate  till the arrival of his  valet de chambre  who  joining him by accident  before the coachman  returned  relieved him in his watch  and then the young gentleman   exasperated at his messenger s delay  rushed  with fury in his eyes   from room to room  denouncing vengeance upon the whole family  but he  did not meet with one living soul  until he entered the garret  where he  found the landlord and his wife in bed  This chicken hearted couple  by  the light of a rush candle that burned on the hearth  seeing a stranger  burst into the chamber  in such a terrible attitude  were seized with  consternation  and  exalting
