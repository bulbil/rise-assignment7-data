Part of me  but I hope he will get the better of every Thing  and never have Reason to sigh as much as he does now from Constitution   I am to sit  for the first Time  to Hudson  on Saturday  He has been engaged every Day since I came to Town  I repent of my Folly already  but do not know how to get off  Page  303 Indeed I think it a very great one  to have my Picture drawn  especially as you cannot take it with you — But it is too late to help it now  and I must go on with the Farce   As your Affairs are in such an irregular Way  I suppose you will not stay long at Hermitage  Let me know when you intend coming to Town  I wish I were to change my Lodgings every Time you leave me  for I can neither sleep or wake  without having your Idea continually before me  nor can I sit or walk in any Part of the House  without recollecting that you sat or walked there  at such or such a Time  As this local Memory is but a Kind of Interruption to the constant Remembrance I have always of you  independent of Time or Place  I am sometimes tempted to take up my Abode in the Kitchen  where  to the best of my Knowledge  you never were  that I may be free to think of you  without Regard to particular Circumstances  or material Objects   I have  with great Care and Attention  read about half of Brown  but I must give him a second Reading  before I pretend to give my Opinion  or communicate my Remarks   Your Brother and Sister are come to dine with me  I cannot say they interrupt me  as I have nothing farther to add  but that I am  and ever will be  your s   Frances   Page  304  LETTER CCCVI   Dear FANNY   HERE am I at the Bishop s House quite alone  and shall be so  till Monday next  when the Family return from —  I met some of the Servants of this House about six Miles off  and they acquainted me with the State of Matters here  which would have been Hint enough for any reasonable Man to turn back upon  but  you know  it was rather a Matter for me to rejoice at  that I should have so much Time to myself  my Books  Paper  and Music  The Servants  who are left behind  are the higher Sort  and  as we are unfortunately old Acquaintance  they fall foul on me  from mistaken Kindness  at an unmerciful Rate  The Butler was immediately for sending to the Parson of the Parish    to notify the Arrival of a Relation and Friend of the Bishop s  who was in such a lonesome Way  that it would pity one s Heart to see it   But  upon Inquiry  I found this Man would not go away  when I bid him  nor take a Denial  if he asked me to go home with him  and  not being at the Top of his Preferment in this Diocese  I begged to be excused from the Over abounding of his Civility  My Friend  the Butler  then  Page  305 apprehending that I thought the Parson too grave and wise for me   for he could not get it into his Head  that a Man should chuse to be alone  recommended the Bishop s Agent to me  who  he said  would much delight me  as he was a brave  jolly Batchelor  like myself  and could crack a Bottle and a Joke with any Man  I asked him  whether this Man would give me any of my Lord s Money  without his Leave  and  being answered▪ No  I said I desired no Acquaintance with him     Lady — and I had a good deal of Conversation about you  the Day before I came away  She spoke very handsomely of you  and kindly too  She said also  that you had but a slight Constitution  and was subject to low Spirits often  which she attributed to Irregularity of Hours  late at Night and Morning  and recommended to me to take some Care about that Matter for you  She assured me  that she was herself so sensible of the great Effect of rising early  that  as she has naturally such a Flow of Spirits  which were first owing to early Hours  she is now obliged to lie in Bed some Time longer than she is inclined  lest she should run wild about the Country  to the utter Scandal and Astonishment of all her Neighbours   Adieu   Page  306  LETTER CCCVII   I Congratulate my dear Harry on the unexpected Indulgence  which his Taste for Retirement has met with  I am not at all surprized that you neither returned to Hermitage  nor accepted the Company that has been offered you at —  for I am well aware how pleasant it must be to a Mind like your s  to be allowed the free Exercise of it s own Faculties  I have often looked with great Pity  not entirely unmixed with Contempt  on
