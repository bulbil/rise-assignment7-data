  Be pleased to accept this   said   she   you may possibly want something after having paid your debt   The   other thanked her  and told her she doubted not but her aunt would send   her something  and she would then repay it   I shall give myself no pain   about that   said Miss Betsy  and then took her leave  desiring she   would let her know by a letter what success she had with her friends    Miss Forward told her she might depend not only on hearing from her  but   seeing her again  as soon as she had any thing to acquaint her with                CHAPTER XV       Brings many things on the carpet  highly pleasing to Miss Betsy  in   their beginning  and no less perplexing to her in their consequences          The accounts of those many and dreadful misfortunes which the ill   conduct of Miss Forward had drawn upon her  made Miss Betsy extremely   pensive   It is strange   said she to herself   that a woman cannot   indulge in the liberty of conversing freely with a man  without being   persuaded by him to do every thing he would have her   She thought    however  that some excuse might be made for Miss Forward  on the score   of her being strictly debarred from all acquaintance with the other sex     People   cried she   have naturally an inclination to do what they are   most forbid  The poor girl had a curiosity to hear herself addressed    and having no opportunity of gratifying that passion  but by admitting   her lover at so odd a time and place  was indeed too much in his power   to have withstood her ruin  even if she had been mistress of more   courage and resolution than she was        On meditating on the follies which women are sometimes prevailed upon to   be guilty of  the discovery she had made of Miss Flora s intrigue with   Gayland came fresh into her mind   What   said she   could induce her to   sacrifice her honour  Declarations of love were not new to her  She   heard every day the flatteries with which our sex are treated by the   men  and needed not to have purchased the assiduities of any one of them   at so dear a rate  Good God  are innocence  and the pride on conscious   virtue  things of so little estimation  as to be thrown away for the   trifling pleasure of hearing a few tender protestations  perhaps all   false  and uttered by one whose heart despises the early fondness he has   triumphed over  and ridicules the very grant of what he has so   earnestly solicited        It is certain this young lady had the highest notions of honour and   virtue  and whenever she gave herself time to reflect  looked on every   thing that had a tendency to make an encroachment on them with the most   extreme detestation  yet had the good nature enough to pity those faults   in others  she thought it impossible for her to be once guilty of   herself       But  amidst sentiments as noble and as generous as ever heart was   possessed of  vanity  that foible of her soul  crept in  and would have   it s share  She had never been thoroughly attacked in a dishonourable   way  but by Gayland  and the gentleman commoner at Oxford  both which   she rebuffed with a becoming disdain  In this she secretly exulted  and   had that dependence on her power of repelling all the efforts  come they   in what shape soever  that should be made against her virtue  that she   thought it beneath her to behave so as not to be in danger of incurring   them       How great a pity it is  that a mind endued with so many excellent   qualities  and which had such exalted ideas of what is truly valuable in   womankind  should be tainted with a frailty of so fatal a nature  as to   expose her to temptations  which if she were not utterly undone  it must   be owing rather to the interposition of her guardian angel  than to the   strength of human reason  but of that hereafter  At present there were   none had any base designs upon her  we must shew what success those   gentlemen met with  who addressed her with the most pure and honourable   intensions  Of this number we shall speak first of Mr  Trueworth and Mr    Staple  the one  as has been already said  strenuously recommended by   her brother  the other by Mr  Goodman       Mr  Staple had
