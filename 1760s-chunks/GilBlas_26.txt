hypocrite  I aimed at looking a little more cheerful  began to laugh and sing  though it was some times on the wrong side of my mouth  in a word  I put so good a face on the matter  that Leonarda and Domingo were completely taken in  They thought the bird was reconciled to his cage  The robbers entertained the same notion  I looked as brisk as the beverage I poured out  and put in my oar whenever I thought I could say a good thing  My freedom  far from offending  was taken in good part  Gil Blas  quoth the captain one evening  while I was playing the buffoon  you have done well  my friend  to banish melancholy  I am delighted with your wit and humour  Some people wear a mask at first acquaintance  I had no notion what a jovial fellow you were   My praises now seemed to run from mouth to mouth  They were all so partial to me  that  not to miss my opportunity     Gentlemen  quoth I  allow me to tell you a piece of my mind  Since I have been your guest  a new light breaks in upon me  I have bid adieu to vulgar prejudices  and caught a ray at the fountain of your illumination  I feel that I was born to be your knight companion  I languish to make one among you  and will stand my chance of a halter with the best  All the company cried Hear     I was considered as a promising member of the senate  It was then determined unanimously to give me a trial in some inferior department  afterwards to bespeak me a good desperate encounter in which I might show my prowess  and if I answered expectation to give me a high and responsible employment in the commonwealth   It was necessary therefore to go on exhibiting a copy of my countenance  and doing my best in my office of cup bearer  I was impatient beyond measure  for I only aspired after the honours of the sitting  to obtain the liberty of going abroad with the rest  and I was in hopes that by running the risk of getting my neck into one noose I might get it out of another  This was my only chance  The time nevertheless seemed long to wait  and I kept my eye on Domingo  with the hope of outwitting him  but the thing was not feasible  he was always on the watch  Orpheus as leader of the band  with a complete orchestra of performers as good as himself  could not have soothed the savage breast of this Cerberus  The truth is  by the by  that for fear of exciting his suspicion  I did not set my wits against him so much as I might have done  He was on the look out  and I was obliged to play the prude  or my virtue might have come into disgrace  I therefore stopped proceedings till the time of my probation should expire  to which I looked forward with impatience  just as if I was waiting for a place under government   Heaven be praised  in about six months I gained my end  The commandant Rolando addressing his regiment  said  Comrades  we must stand upon honour with Gil Blas  I have no bad opinion of our young candidate  we shall make something of him  If you will take my advice  let him go and reap his first harvest with us to  morrow on the king s highway  We will lead him on in the path of honour  The robbers applauded the sentiments of the captain with a thunder of acclamation  and to show me how much I was considered as one of the gang  from that moment they dispensed with my attendance at the side board  Dame Leonarda was reinstated in the office from which she had been discharged to make room for me  They made me change my dress  which consisted in a plain short cassock a good deal the worse for wear  and tricked me out in the spoils of a gentleman lately robbed  After this inauguration  I made my arrangements for my first campaign       CH  VIII     Gil Blas goes out with the gang  and performs an exploit on the highway   IT was past midnight in the month of September  when I issued from the subterraneous abode as one of the fraternity  I was armed  like them  with a carabine  two pistols  a sword  and a bayonet  and was mounted on a very good horse  the property of the gentleman in whose costume I appeared  I had lived so long like a mole under ground  that the daybreak could not fail of dazzling me  but my eyes got reconciled to it by degrees   We passed close by Pontferrada  and were determined to lie in ambush behind a small wood skirting the road to Leon  There we were waiting for whatever fortune might please to throw in our way  when we espied a Dominican friar  mounted  contrary to the rubric of those pious fathers  on a shabby mule  God be praised  exclaimed the captain with a sneer  this is a noble beginning for Gil Blas  Let him go and trounce that monk  we
