whose appearance seemed most promising  but it was impossible to make ourselves mutually understood  It was not till this very moment I recollected  that in order to teach Dutchmen English  it was necessary that they should first teach me Dutch  How I came to overlook so obvious an objection  is to me amazing  but certain it is I overlooked it      This scheme thus blown up  I had some thoughts of fairly shipping back to England again  but happening into company with an Irish student  who was returning from Louvain  our conversation turning upon topics of literature   for by the way it may be observed  that I always forgot the meanness of my circumstances when I could converse upon  Page  23  such subjects  from him I learned that there were not two men in his whole university who understood Greek  This amazed me  I instangly resolved to travel to Louvain  and there live by teaching Greek  and in this design I was heartened by my brother student  who threw out some hints that a fortune might be got by it      I set boldly forward the next morning  Every day lessened the burthen of my moveables  like Aesop and his basket of bread  for I paid them for my lodgings to the Dutch as I travelled on  When I came to Louvain  I was resolved not to go sneaking to the lower professors  but openly tendered my talents to the principal himself  I went  had admittance  and offered him my service as a master of the Greek language  which I had been told was a desideratum in his university  The principal seemed at first to doubt of my abilities  but of these I offered to  Page  24  convince him  by turning a part of any Greek author he should fix upon into Latin  Finding me perfectly earnest in my proposal  he addressed me thus  You see me  young man  continued he  I never learned Greek  and I don t find that I ever missed it  I have had a doctor s cap and gown without Greek  I have ten thousand florins a year without Greek  and I eat heartily without Greek  In short  continued he  I don t know Greek  and I do not believe there is any use in it      I was now too far from home to think of returning  so I resolved to go forward  I had some knowledge of music  with a tolerable voice  and now turned what was once my amusement into a present means of bare subsistence  I passed among the harmless peasants of Flanders  and among such of the French as were poor enough to be very merry  for I  Page  25  ever found them sprightly in proportion to their wants  Whenever I approached a peasant s house towards night fall  I played one of my most merry tunes  and that procured me not only a lodging  but subsistence for the next day  I once or twice attempted to play for people of fashion  but they still thought my performance odious  and never rewarded me even with a trifle  This was to me the more extraordinary  as whenever I used formerly to play for company  when playing was my amusement  my music never failed to throw them into raptures  and the ladies especially  but as it was now my only means  it was received with contempt  a proof how ready the world is to under rate those talents which a man lives by      In this manner I proceeded to Paris  with no design but just to look about me  and then to go forward  The people of  Page  26  Paris are much fonder of strangers that have money  than of those that have wit  You may imagine then  as I could not boast much of either  that I was no great favourite  After I had walked about the town four or five days  and seen the outsides of the best houses  I was preparing to leave this retreat of venal hospitality  when passing through one of the principal streets  whom should I meet but our cousin  to whom you first recommended me  This meeting was very agreeable to me  and I believe not displeasing to him  He enquired into the nature of my journey to Paris  and informed me of his business there  which was to collect pictures  medals  intaglios  and antiques of all kinds  for a gentleman in London  who had just stept into taste and a large fortune  I was still more surprised at seeing our cousin pitched upon for this office  as himself had often assured me he knew nothing of the  Page  27  matter  Upon my asking how he had been taught the art of a connoscento so very suddenly  he assured me that nothing was more easy  The whole secret consisted in a strict adherence to two rules  the one always to observe  that the picture might have been better if the painter had taken more pains  and the other  to praise the works of Pietro Perugino  But  says he  as I once taught you how to be an author in London  I ll now undertake to instruct you in
