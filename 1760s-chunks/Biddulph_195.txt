gone to bed  Think  Madam  what my poor father must feel  when he saw me on the floor  for I was not able to rise  such a spectacle of horror  my cap was off  and my nose bleeding with the fall   The wretch was endeavouring to lift me up  and I trying to resist him  Good God defend me  said my father  what is this I see  Oh  Sir  said I  clinging round him  carry me out of the house  carry me out directly from this monster  my father looked aghast  You do not mean Mr Ware  my child  said he  it cannot be He who has put you in this condition  Mr Ware quitted the room the minute he saw my father  which was not till I catched hold of him  for he had his back to the door  and  I suppose  was in too much agitation to hear him coming in   My poor father  speechless with astonishment  took me into his arms  and put me sitting on the bed  then stepping into my closet     brought out a bottle of water  some of which he made me drink  and afterwards washed the blood from my face  which he soon found only proceeded from my having hurt my nose a little   When I had recovered breath enough  I told him all that had passed  His despair  Madam  is not to be described  he tore his hair  and was like a madman  Where is the ungrateful villain  said he  I will go this minute and upbraid him with his treachery  he ran to the chamber door  but it was locked on the outside  My father thus prevented from going out  had time to cool a little  he considered it would to be no purpose to reproach a powerful tyrant with the injuries he did us  he resolved to quit the inhospitable house as soon as any one in the family was up to open the door to him  and without ever seeing his face again  commit himself to providence for his future subsistence   It would have been happy for us if he could have executed this design  but the profligate man prevented us  We spent the remainder of the night in lamenting our misery  At day light Mr Ware entered the room in his night gown  for I suppose he had gone to rest after he left us   He told my father he was sorry for what had passed  and imputed it to his having drunk too much  I own  said he  I love your daughter to distraction  and could not bear the thoughts of losing her  as I found you resolved to go out of town so suddenly  My father answered  I will not reproach you as I ought  but my tender care of your youth did not deserve this return  suffer us to depart out of your house  and you shall never more be troubled with us   Mr Ware entreated to speak with my father by himself  and with much difficulty prevailed on him to go into his study with him  They staid together near half an hour  and I heard them talking high  my father then entered my room with tears streaming from his eyes  He threw himself into a chair in an agony of grief  The villain  said he  has finished his work—he has stabbed your father’s heart—I ran to him almost frantic  I thought he had made an attempt upon his life  When I found he was not hurt  I asked him the meaning of his words   He would have me sell you to him  said he  he would have bribed the father to prostitute his child  Oh  Sir  said I  why  do we stay under this detested roof  There is no safety for us here  said he  come  my dear  let us get out of the house  and then we will consider which way we are to turn ourselves   My father laid hold of my hand  and I followed him  just as I was    in my morning gown  We thought if we could once find ourselves in the street  we should be happy  though neither of us knew where to go  having no acquaintance in London  I had never been there before  and my father had been so long absent  that he was forgotten by every body   We got out of my room into a little sort of anti chamber  but found the door of that fast locked   We now gave ourselves up for lost  our despair is not to be expressed  we sat down  and consulted what was best to be done  I saw now that there was nothing that our base persecutor would not attempt  and I told my father I was resolved at all events to make my escape   He said that the shocking wretch had given him till the next day to consider of his proposal  and he hoped  by that time  both father and daughter would come enough to their senses  to think he had made them a very advantageous offer   I told him in that lucky interval I hoped to be able to affect my deliverance
