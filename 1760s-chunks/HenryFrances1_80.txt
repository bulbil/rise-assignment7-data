poetical Flights  which the best Verse  I ever read  might be proud to own  He has a Sense  which I am fond of  more improved by Thought and Reflection  than Study or Learning  an Understanding free from Prejudice  and a Judgment formed from a natural Discernment  and not framed upon the Doctrines or Opinions of others   His Sentiments are every where just and noble  and there is a certain Freedom in his Stile  and Boldness in his Expression  which are strong enough to break even thro  both his Translators  As for what I have heard some small Critics cavil at  that he is always talking of himself  is it improper to speak about what he professedly makes his Subject  He treats of human Nature in general  — then himself ought to be his particular Study  What he says of others  he   278 can only guess at  but what he says of himself  he may be sure of  He speaks often too grossly  it is said  and it is certain he does —but then the Freedom of his Descriptions  and Expressions in those Passages  are only shocking to those to whom the Study of Anatomy would be obscene  In short  I highly esteem his Writings  and greatly honour his Memory   In his short Essay upon monstrous Births  which I read over this Morning  he makes a very fine Observation  which has amused me greatly —that  perhaps  what we look upon as Monsters  may not be really so in the Eye of Providence  for nothing can be contrary to Nature  unless we mistake Custom  as I have said before is often done  for Nature  and these heteroclite Creatures may  perhaps  have Relation to a Species of the same Kind  unknown to Man  I am particularly pleased with his philosophick Turn of Thought  as it takes off greatly from the Offence  which such obscene Sights naturally —I mean  usually give us  This Sentiment I shall extend farther  with relation to those extraordinary Spirits in Virtue  or Science  who seem to excel Mankind  as if they were of a higher Species  and may  perhaps  have Relation to a nobler Rank of Beings  but sent down a Class  or more  lower  for some Offence in their former State  and obliged to earn their Way up again to their lost Dignity  according to a Discipline  I somewhere read of   279 and was pleased with  in an Army  where the greatest Officer  upon any Error  or Breach of his Duty  was degraded to some inferior Station  according to his Fault  and so reduced to fight his Way back again to his forfeited Rank  Or  perhaps  these rare Genii are now and then dropped among us  to raise our Emulation in Virtue or Knowledge  or  it may be  to hint to us Mortals  that the ordinary Race of Man is not the greatest Work of God  which  however  a very little Reflection upon Providence might convince us of  for God  as it has been elsewhere observed  all powerful  may not rest at a Creature so imperfect  as Man   Farewel   my dear Heloise   and believe me Your faithful Abelard   LETTER CXLIII  FRANCES to HENRY   THE Story  I hinted to you in a late Letter  was  in great Measure  the Cause of the excessive Lowness of Spirits  you chide me for  I am mortified at the Insincerity and Ingratitude of some People  on whom I had a strong Dependence  particularly  Lady —  her vehement Professions and contemptible Behaviour have served to illustrate my real Opinion  that Sense and Virtue are the only solid Foundation for Love and Friendship  I am absolutely amazed  and angry at myself  for being duped by such a Woman     280But  in order to set her Behaviour in a much stronger Light  I have  in my Acquaintance with Lady O—  found such a Contrast  as is not to be described  Instead of an Affectation of Sense and Virtue in the one  the Actions of the other speak the full Force of both  Dignity  without Pride  good Humour  without Folly  Wit  without Satire  Charity  without Ostentation  and Philosophy  with the extremest Quickness of Understanding and Tenderness of Heart  are all joined in the amiable Composition of that unaffectedly  good Woman   Just as I had finished the last Line  her Chair came for me  I have been with her three Hours  and would not have quitted her now  for any other Pleasure  but that of returning to my dear Harry   She has indeed calmed my Mind extremely  by that just Method of reasoning  she is perfectly Mistress of  joined to such Praises  as  from any other  would look like Adulation  but  from her Mouth  are high Reward  I hope my dear Harry will excuse my dwelling so long on a Subject  my Heart is so much interested in  as it overflows with Gratitude to one  who will not even suffer an Attempt to express it   My sincerest Thanks are your s  for consenting lately to my so often repeated Request  you may indeed
