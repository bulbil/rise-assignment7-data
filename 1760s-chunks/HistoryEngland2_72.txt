of evasion   In the mean time Mr  Pelham  who chiefly conducted the business of the state  and was esteemed a man of candour and capacity  laid a scheme for lightening the immense load of debt that was laid upon the nation  His plan was to lessen the national incumbrance  by lowering the interest which had been promised upon the first raising the supply  or obliging the lenders to receive the sums originally granted  Those who were proprietors of stocks  and received  for the use of their money  four per cent   were  by royal authority  ordered to subscribe their names  signifying their consent to accept of three pounds ten   194 shillings per cent  a year after  and three per cent  onl about six years after their thus subscribing  and  i case of a refusal  that the government would pay o the principal  This scheme was attended with th desired effect  though it  in some measure  was … force upon the lender  who had originally grante his money upon different terms  yet it was salutar to the nation  and  as Machiavel has it  politic injustice is sometimes allowable  in order to secur national benefits  Besides this salutary measure  other were pursued by the minister at the helm  with equa success  The importation of iron from America wa allowed  and the trade to Africa laid open to th whole nation  but  at the same time  to be super¦intended by the board of trade and plantations   But all the advantages the nation reaped from these salutary measures  were not sufficient to counter balance the stroke which liberty received  as some are of opinion  by an unusual stretch of the privileges of the house of commons  As this is a point which deserves the strictest attention  permit me to trace it up to the source  The city of Westminster had long been represented by members who were nominated  in some measure  by the ministry  Lord Trentham having vacated his seat in the house  by accepting a place under the crown  he again declared himself a candidate  but met with violent opposition  It was objected to him by some  that he had been uncommonly active in introducing some French strollers  who had come over to exhibit plays upon the suppression of our own  This accusation  whether true or false  excited numbers against him  who styled themselves the independent electors of Westminster  and named Sir George Vandeput  a private gentleman  as his competitor  The opposition resolved to support their candidate at their own expence  They accordingly opened houses of entertainment  solicited votes  and propagated abuse as usual  At length    195 the poll being closed  the majority appeared in favour of Lord Trentham  a scrutiny was demanded by the other side  it was protracted by the obstinacy of both parties  but this also turning out in favour of Lord Trentham  the independent electors petitioned the house  complaining of an undue election  and of partiality and injustice in the high bailiff of Westminster  who took the poll  To this petition the house paid little regard  but proceeded to examine the high bailiff as to the causes that had so long protracted the election  who laid the blame upon Mr  Crowle  who had acted as council for the petitioners  on the honourable Alexander Murray  and one Gibson an upholsterer  These three persons were therefore brought to the bar of the house  Crowle and Gibson  after having asked pardon upon their knees  and  being reprimanded by the house  were dismissed  Murray was first admitted to bail  but  after some witnesses had deposed  that he had headed a mob to intimidate the voters  it was voted that he should be committed a close prisoner to Newgate  and  to invigorate their measures  that he should receive this sentence at the bar of the house on his knees  He accordingly appeared  but being directed by the Speaker to kneel  refused to comply  This refusal threw the whole house into a commotion  and it was ordered that he should be committed close prisoner to Newgate  debarred the use of pen  ink  and paper  and that no person should have access to him without permission from the house  This imprisonment he underwent  sensible that it could continue no longer than while they continued to sit  and  at the close of the session  he was conducted from prison to his own house  amidst the acclamations of the people  He now was thought  by many  intirely free from all farther prosecution  but  in this  they were mistaken  for  at the opening of the ensuing sitting of parliament  a motion was made  that Mr    196 Murray should be again committed close prisoner to the Tower  Hitherto it was supposed by several  that the house of commons had acted with a spirit of resentment  Now it was thought  that they made an attempt at extending their privileges  Though the delinquent  a person of no great consequence in himself  had taken the prudent precautions of retiring from their resentment  yet several of the people saw that the house considered itself rather as a body distinct from the people  than the guardians of the people  and  instead of maintaining the liberties
