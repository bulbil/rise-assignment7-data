is too just to condemn a man for maintaining the principles   he was bred in  however they may disagree with his own  but to become   his enemy  to enlist himself in the service of those who aim at the   destruction of his lawful prince  is certainly a treason of the   blackest dye       As they were in this discourse  colonel Poniatosky came in  and hearing   they were speaking of Patkul   I have just now  said he  received a   letter from one of my friends in Saxony concerning that general  which   deeply affects me  not for his own  but for the sake of a lady  to whom    after a long series of disappointments  he was just going to be married    when Augustus  against the law of nations  made him a prisoner  I will   relate the whole adventure to you  continued he  on which the others   assuring him they should think themselves obliged to him  he went on       When he first entered into the service of Augustus  he became   passionately in love with madam d  Ensilden  a young lady  whose beauty    birth  and fortune rendered her worthy the affections of a man of more   honour than he had testified in his public capacity  her friends at   least thought so  and chancellor Flemming making his addresses to her at   the same time  had the advantage in every thing but in her heart  there   Patkul triumphed in spight of all objections  and tho  king Augustus   vouchsafed himself to sollicite in behalf of his favourite  her   constancy remained unshaken as a rock  which so incensed a monarch   haughty and imperious in his nature  before humbled by our glorious   Charles  that he made use of his authority  and forbid her to think of   marrying any other  to which she resolutely answered  that she knew no   right princes had to interfere with the marriages of private persons    but since his majesty commanded it  she would endeavour to obey and live   single  This not satisfying the king  he hated Patkul from that moment    and the rivals soon after meeting in madam d  Ensilden s apartment  some   hot words arose between them  which being by Flemming reported to his   master  he sent  in the moment of his passion  to require Patkul to   resign his office of general  he did so  but with a murmur that was far   from abating the royal resentments  and he had then ordered him into   confinement  but that private intelligence being given him  he made his   escape before the officers  commissioned for that purpose  reached his   house  He then went to the czar  who knowing him an experienced general    of which at that time he stood greatly in need  gladly received him  and   it was there he first merited the hate of all good men  by countenancing   and abetting those ambitious projects his new master was then forming   against the king of Sweden  but see the fate of treason  he persuaded   him to enter into an alliance with  Poland and Saxony against Sweden    which laid the foundation of this unjust war  and for which Augustus has   so dearly paid  and being sent Ambassador  in order to negotiate these   affairs  again renewed those of his love  Augustus  now obliged to the   czar for the preservation of his dominions  durst not openly espouse   chancellor Flemming  but no sooner heard that the marriage was near   being compleated  than he ventured every thing to prevent it  and  under   a pretence of his own forging  confined Patkul in the castle of   Konisting  where he lay a considerable time  the czar being too much   taken up with combating the fortune of our victorious king  to examine   into this affair  and besides  unwilling to break with Augustus  as   things then stood  Madam d  Ensilden did all this time whatever could be   expected from a sincere affection  in order to procure his enlargement    but the interest of her friends  at least of those who would be employed   in this intercession  were infinitely too weak to oppose that of   Flemming and the king s own inclination  so that he remained a prisoner    without being permitted either to write to madam d  Ensilden or see her    till the time of his being delivered into our hands  But on hearing he   was so  my friend informs me her great spirit  which till now had made   her support her misfortune without discovering to the world any part of   the agonies she sustained  in an instant quite forsook her  she   abandoned herself to despair and grief  equally exclaiming against the   Czar  Augustus  and Charles XII  has ever since shut herself
