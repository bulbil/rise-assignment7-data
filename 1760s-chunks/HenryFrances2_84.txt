sometimes met with many insipid moral Novels of that Kind  I conceived a Prejudice against the Book  But I find  from this Author  that  when such a Manner is managed with Wit and Address  it gives a certain Vivacity to this Kind of Writings  and strengthens the Stile  by adding Action to Reason   What incited my Inclination to read this Book  was a Paragraph in the public Papers  that it had given great Offence in France  where it was written  and that there was likely to be Page  318 a Prosecution against the Author  and  as far as I have gone  I find it has a Merit in it very apt to give Offence to Priests and Bigots  The Writer is  I think  a Man of Sense  Learning  Parts  and unprejudiced Reflections  I am  therefore  highly pleased to find he is of the same Opinion with me  of an innate Idea of irrelative Virtue  which is a Sentiment I am so charmed with  that I am fond of laying hold on every Occasion of discoursing about it  So I shall here take a Flight at it again   We have  from the mere Beauty of Nature  a Smell for Flavours  a Taste for Savours  a Sight for Symmetry  an Hearing for Sounds  and a Feeling for more sensual Gratifications  Shall then the Goodness  nay the Justice of God leave us void of as immediate a Sensation of Virtue  which is a Thing of so much higher Consequence both to ourselves and others  and both with regard to this Life and the next  Shall  I say  the Bounty of God be greater than his Justice  Shall our instinct Faculties be governed by a divine Impulse  and shall our moral Powers be left without a Guide  for human Reason is insufficient to form the Rule  tho  it s proper Province is to be exercised  and conversant about it   But the Senses are only the Organs to convey Ideas to the Mind  it is the Soul  which perceives  Brutes then have a Soul  They have Page  319 also a Spirit  if you give me Leave to make a Distinction here  for Matter  of itself  is inactive  There are so many Instances in Brutes of what we partially stile little  mimic Reason  that Mankind has no great Cause to be vain upon the sole Prerogative of this Excellence  since all we can claim is but a higher Degree of this boasted Superiority   But we are taught to believe that God formed Man after his own Image  This Favour surely was not shewn in his human Figure  which Diogenes humourously ridiculed  by plucking a Goose  and leading it through the Streets of Athens  crying   Behold Plato s Man   which that Philosopher had defined to be a two legged Animal without Feathers  Nor can this glorious Characteristic be presumed from any one Quality  which Brutes have in any Degree or Analogy with us  What then is this great Distinction  upon which we do  and ought so justly to value ourselves  but a certain  innate  moral Sense  which  as the Serpent expresses it    makes us as Gods  knowing Good from Evil     Brutes are capable of Virtue  according to the common Sense of it  for many of their Actions demonstrate Love  Gratitude  and Benevolence  And though  when the Spaniel beats the Field for our Sport or Food  he may be considered as acting merely for his own Pleasure  this is no more than some Moralists have charged upon Page  320 human Virtue  which they have resolved into a Self satisfaction  In short  it is an innate  moral Idea  which makes us sensible of Virtue  while Reason and free Will only make us capable of it   As soon as I have read this Book  I will send it up to you   Adieu   my fairest Idea   LETTER CCCXIII   My Dear FANNY   I WOULD not tell you any thing of the Matter   till it was over  but I left Town with a sore Throat  which increased very fast upon me  last Night  but I am this Morning  thank God  as well as ever  and am just setting out for your own Belvidere   I have gone a good Way in Manners  and  upon a farther View in that Author  I begin to find the same Fault with him  which I did at first  His Characters are too frequently introduced  are tedious  and ill drawn  and many of them not at all to the Purpose  However  there are here and there certain Traits of Genius  which  upon the whole  make the Work appear to have been written by two different Persons  or rather  I have taken it into my Head  that Page  321 it was wrote by a Woman  who had  for some Time  conversed freely with sensible Men   The Author  Authors  or Compiler of this Book speaks very rationally against the Doctrine of eternal Misery  which is a Matter  I think  I have in some of my Letters given my Opinion upon  and is a Subject I am so fond of  that I
