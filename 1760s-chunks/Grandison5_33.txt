after  congratulating me on my arrival in the name of her young Lady  She let me know  that in less than a quarter of an hour she would be ready to receive my visit   O Sir  said the good woman  miracles  miracles —We are all joy and hope   Page  82 At going out  she whispered as she passed  I was then at the window  My young Lady is dressing in colours  to receive you  She will no more appear to you  she says  in black—Now  Sir  will you soon reap the reward of all your goodness  for the General has signified to my Lord his entire acquiescence with his sister s choice  and their determination   The Bishop came in  Chevalier  said he  you are welcome  thrice welcome  to Bologna  You have subdued us all  Clementina commands her own destiny  The man whom she chooses to call hers  be he who he will  will have a treasure in her  in every sense of the word  The Marquis  the Count  Father Marescotti  all severally made me the highest compliments  The Count particularly taking my hand  said  From us  Chevalier  nothing will be wanting to make you happy  From you  there can be but one thing wanting to make us so   The Marchioness entering  saved me any other return  than by bowing to each  Before I could speak to her  Welcome  Chevalier  said she  But you are not come before you were wished for  You will find  we have kept a more exact account of the days of your absence  than we did before  I hope her joy to see you will not be too much for her  Clementina ever had a grateful heart   The Chevalier s prudence  said Father Marescotti  may be confided in  He knows how to moderate his own joy on his first address to her  on seeing her so greatly amended  And then Lady Clementina s natural delicacy will not not have an example to carry her joy above her reason   The Chevalier  madam  said the Bishop  smiling  will  at this rate  be too secure  We leave him not room for professions  But he cannot be ungenerous   The Chevalier Grandison  said the kind Jeronymo  speaks by action  It is his way  His head  his heart  his lips  his hands  are governed by one motion  and Page  83 directed by one spring  When he leaves no room for doubt  professions would depreciate his service   He then ascribed an extraordinary merit to me  on my leaving my native country and friends  to attend them in person   We may  perhaps  my reverend friend  be allowed to repeat the commendations given us by grateful and benevolent friends  when we cannot otherwise so well do justice to the generous warmth of such exalted spirits  The noble Jeronymo  I am confident  were he in my place  and I in his  would put a more moderate value on the like services  done by himself  What is friendship  if  on the like calls  and blessed with power  it is not ready to exert itself in action   Grandison  replied the Bishop  were he one of us  might expect canonization  In a better religion  we have but few young men of quality and fortune so good as he  tho  I think none so bad  as many of the pretended REformed  who travel  as if to copy our vices  and not to imitate our virtues   I was overwhelmed with gratitude  on a reception so very generous and unreserved  Camilla came in seasonably with a message from the young Lady  inviting my attendance on her in her dressing room   The Marchioness withdrew just before  I followed Camilla  She told me  as we went  that she thought her not quite so sedate as she had been for some days past  which she supposed owing to her hurrying in dressing  and to her expectation of me   The mother and daughter were together  They were talking  when I entered—Dear fanciful girl  I heard the mother say  disposing otherwise some flowers that she had in her bosom   Clementina  when her mind was sound  used to be all unaffected elegance  I never saw but one woman who equalled her in that respect  Miss Byron seems conscious  that she may trust to her native charms  yet betrays no pride in her consciousness  Page  84 Who ever spoke of her jewels  that beheld her face  For mingled dignity  and freedom of air and manner  these two Ladies excel amongst women   Clementina appeared exceedingly lovely  But her fancifulness in the disposition of her ornaments  and the unusual lustre of her eyes  which every one was wont to admire for their serene brightness  shewed an imagination more disordered than I hoped to see  and gave me pain at my entrance   The Chevalier  my Love   said the Marchioness  turning round to me  Clementina  receive your friend   She stood up  dignity and sweetness in her air  I approached her  She refused not her hand  The General
