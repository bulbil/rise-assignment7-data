greater trials remained for this unhappy lady  Grey  whose mind was  not discomposed by passion  and who thought more coolly than his lord   seriously reflected  on the necessity of forcing the Countess to give her hand to Raymond  in  order to establish his rightful claim to an inheritance  which promised  ample advantages to his creatures  And when the prospect of riches and  rewards were presented to his view  his rapacious soul instantly became  deaf to all the calls of pity  nor was one sentiment of humanity  suffered to intrude upon his mind  The enamoured Raymond grew more and  more impatient  and every hour lamented the inflexible spirit of the  Countess  and her unalterable aversion to his love  His flatterer still  wore a face of friendly anxiety and concern  and  as if he lived only  for his lord  seemed to feel the disappointment as his own misfortune   and expressed that earnestness for conquering this difficulty  with  which men generally pursue their private interests  Raymond was charmed  with this specious shew of zeal and sincere affection  He called him  friend  guardian  and director  he lavishly promised wealth and honours   and entreated him to devise some means of accomplishing his wishes  Grey  seemed for a while immersed in thought  then  as if suddenly  recollecting himself  he assumed a look of confidence and exultation    It cannot be   thus he exclaimed   This imperious Countess cannot for  ever prove insensible to the inviting voice of joy and happiness  She  sees thy passion  and would enflame it by this affected delay  Or if her  haughty soul be really unmoved  something must be thought of— Raymond  must—yes  my ever honoured lord  thou shalt possess her  Let me be  favoured with thy confidence  submit to my direction  For some days shun  her presence  for there thy weakness is discovered  Rely on my  services  and let it be my part to prevail upon her  — Go  said Raymond    to you and to your conduct I implicitly resign my hopes  Prevail  and  be great as thou canst wish  —Thus was the afflicted Countess given up  to the hands of insolence and cruelty  without help or friend  without  counsel or resource       Instead of the man whose arrogance was tempered by that reverence and  love with which her beauty had inspired him  Ela saw now before her an  unrelenting  unfeeling vassal  in condition  such as her soul disdained  to hold converse with  and in temper base and brutal  He approached her  with a rude insensibility to her state  and to her sorrows  Instead of  pleading the passion  or the merits of his master  he proudly demanded  her compliance  He called upon her to consider his power  and her own  condition  that she was no longer mistress in this stately castle   which  with all its wide extended lands  had devolved to Raymond  now  the master even of her and of her son  and that she had only to chuse  whether to appear as his consort  in all the lustre that riches and  royal favour can bestow  or to waste her solitary days in grief and  abject dependance     The Countess  though pierced with sorrow  and sensible of her helpless  condition  surveyed the rude minion in disdainful silence  He repeated  his bold remonstrances  yet nothing more could his importunities  extort  than a stern command to retire from her presence  He obeyed  but  soon returned  and repeated his odious insolence  In that moment her  young son appeared  and flew with eager and fond caresses to his mother   At sight of him  she instantly forgot her greatness  her griefs burst  forth in a sudden and violent stream  She embraced him with trembling  arms  and the boy  though unable to conceive the cause  sympathized  passionately with the Countess  The sight was pitiful and affecting  but  the hardened Grey felt only a short and transient surprise   Is he thus  dear   said he   know then  that his mother s obstinacy may prove fatal  to her son  The charge of him now belongs to Raymond  He best knows how  to defeat all future attempts to dispossess him of his rights  —The  Countess started up in speechless amazement  and Grey turned from her  with a sullen menace  that henceforward her son should be a stranger to  her arms   Stay   replied the Countess  pale and trembling with terror  and virtuous anger          hear me  cruel man—Heavens  is it for this that we are made prisoners  within our own walls  shut up from society and relief  no access for  comfort or friendship  no resource  no support for our helpless  innocence  And did the bloody purpose of a murderer lurk beneath his  courtly smiles  when Lord Raymond first entered our castle  And dreads  he not vengeance  Have the friends of William all perished with him —At  least Heaven is our
