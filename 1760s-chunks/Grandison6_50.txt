not being very well  chose to retire to her devotions in my closet  while we went to church  she having been at her own in the morning   We all received Mr  Greville with civility  He affects to be thought a wit  you know  and a great joker  Some men cannot appear to advantage without making their friend a butt to shoot at  Fenwick and he tried to play upon each other  as usual  Sir Charles lent each his smile  and  whatever he thought of them  shewed not a contempt of their great boy snip snap  But  at last  my grandmamma and aunt engaged Sir Charles in a conversation  which made the gentlemen so silent  and so attentive  that had they not flashed a good deal at each other before  one might have thought them a little discreet   Nobody took the least notice of what had passed between Mr  Greville and Sir Charles  till Mr  Greville touched upon the subject to me  He desired an audience of ten minutes  as he said  and  upon his declaration  that it was the last he would ever ask of me on the subject  and  upon my grandmamma s saying  Oblige Mr  Greville  my dear  I permitted him to draw me to the window   His address was nearly in the following words  not speaking so low  but every one might hear him  tho  he said aloud  Nobody must but me   I must account myself very unhappy  madam  in having never been able to incline you to shew me   125 favour  You may think me vain  I believe I am so  But I may take to myself the advantages and qualities which every body allows me  I have an estate that will warrant my addresses to a woman of the first rank  and it it is free  and unincumbered  I am not an ill natured man  I love my jest   tis true  but I love my friend  You good women generally do not like a man the less for having something to mend in him  I could say a great deal more in my own behalf  but that Sir Charles Grandison  looking at him  quite eclipses me  Devil fetch me  if I can tell how to think myself any  thing before him  I was always afraid of him  But when I heard he was gone abroad  in pursuit of a former Love  I thought I had another chance for it   Yet I was half afraid of Lord D  His mother would manage a Machiavel  He has a great estate  a title  he has good qualities for a nobleman  But when I found that you could so steadily refuse him  as well as me  There must be some man  thought I  who is lord of her heart  Fenwick is as sad a dog as I  it cannot be he  Orme  poor soul  she will not have such a milk sop as that  neither—  Mr  Orme  Sir  interrupted I  and was going to praise him—But he said  I will be heard out now  This is my dying speech  I will not be interrupted   Well then  Sir  smiling  come to your last words  as soon as you can   I have told you  before now  Miss Byron  that I will not bear your smiles  But now smiles or frowns  I care not  I have no hopes left  and I am resolved to abuse you before I have done   Abuse me  I hope not  Sir    Hope not   What signify your hopes  who never gave me any  But hear me out  I shall say some thing that will displease you  but more of another nature  I went on guessing who could be the happy man  That second Orme  Fowler  cannot be he    126 thought I  Is it the newly arrived Beauchamp  He is a pretty fellow enough  I had all your footsteps watched  as I told you I would   No  answered I myself  she refused Lord D  and a whole tribe of us  before Beauchamp came to England—Who the devil can he be —But when I heard that the dangerous man  whom I hadt hought gone abroad to his matrimonial destiny  was returned  unmarried  when I heard that he was actually coming northward  I began to be again afraid of him   Last Thursday night I had intelligence  that he was seen at Dunstable in the morning  in his way towards us  Then did my heart fail me  I had my spies about Selby house  I own it  What will not Love and Jealousy make a man do  I understood  that your uncle and Mr  Deane  and a tribe of servants for train sake  were set out to meet him  How I raved  How I cursed  How I swore —They will not surely  thought I  allow my rival  at his first visit  to take up his residence under the same roof with this charming Witch   Witch  Mr  Greville—  Witch  Yes  Witch  I called you ten thousand names
