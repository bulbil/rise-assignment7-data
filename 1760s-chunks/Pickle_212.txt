the knots by which we are bound together  and  therefore I will guard her as my own property  so that you had better  desist from your fruitless attempt  and thereby consult your own safety   for  by the God that made me  I will discharge my piece upon you  as  soon as you set your nose within the door  and your blood be upon your  own head    These menaces  from a citizen s clerk  would have been sufficient  motives for Pickle to storm the breach  although they had not been  reinforced by that declaration  which informed him of Emilia s having  bestowed herself in marriage upon such a contemptible rival  This sole  consideration added wings to his impetuosity  and he applied his foot to  the door with such irresistible force  as burst it open in an instant   entering at the same time with a pistol ready cocked in his hand  His  antagonist  instead of firing his blunderbuss  when he saw him  approach  started back with evident signs of surprise and consternation   exclaiming   Lord Jesus  Sir  you are not the man  and  without doubt   are under some mistake with regard to us   Before Peregrine had time  to answer this salutation  the lady  hearing it  advanced to him  and   pulling off a mask  discovered a face which he had never seen before   The Gorgon s head  according to the fables of antiquity  never had  a more instantaneous or petrifying effect  than that which this    6 22 15  3 45 PM   countenance produced upon the astonished youth  His eyes were fixed  upon this unknown object  as if they had been attracted by the power of  enchantment  his feet seemed riveted to the ground  and  after having  stood motionless for the space of a few minutes  he dropped down in an  apoplexy of disappointment and despair  The Swiss  who had followed him   seeing his master in this condition  lifted him up  and  laying him upon  a bed in the next room  let him blood immediately  without hesitation   being always provided with a case of lancets  against all accidents on  the road  To this foresight our hero  in all probability  was indebted  for his life  By virtue of a very copious evacuation  he recovered  the use of his senses  but the complication of fatigues and violent  transports  which he had undergone  brewed up a dangerous fever in his  blood  and  a physician being called from the next market town  several  days elapsed before he would answer for his life   CHAPTER LXXIX   Peregrine sends a Message to Mrs  Gauntlet  who rejects his Proposal  He  repairs to the Garrison   At length  however  his constitution overcame his disease  though not  before it had in a great measure tamed the fury of his disposition   and brought him to a serious consideration of his conduct  In this  humiliation of his spirits  he reflected with shame and remorse upon  his treachery to the fair  the innocent Emilia  he remembered his former  sentiments in her favour  as well as the injunctions of his dying uncle   he recollected his intimacy with her brother  against which he had so  basely sinned  and  revolving all the circumstances of her conduct   found it so commendable  spirited  and noble  that he deemed her an  object of sufficient dignity to merit his honourable addresses  even  though his duty had not been concerned in this decision  But  obligated  as he was to make reparation to a worthy family  which he had so grossly  injured  he thought he could not manifest his reformation too soon  and   whenever he found himself able to hold a pen  wrote a letter to Mrs   Gauntlet  wherein he acknowledged  with many expressions of sorrow and  contrition  that he had acted a part altogether unbecoming a man of  honour  and should never enjoy the least tranquility of mind  until he  should have merited her forgiveness  He protested  that  although his  happiness entirely depended upon the determination of Emilia  he would  even renounce all hope of being blessed with her favour  if she could  point out any other method of making reparation to that amiable young  lady  but by laying his heart and fortune at her feet  and submitting  himself to her pleasure during the remaining part of his life  He  conjured her  therefore  in the most pathetic manner  to pardon him   in consideration of his sincere repentance  and to use her maternal  influence with her daughter  so as that he might be permitted to wait  upon her with a wedding ring  as soon as his health would allow him to  undertake the journey   This explanation being despatched by Pipes  who had  by this time  found  his master  the young gentleman inquired about the couple whom he had  so unfortunately pursued  and understood from his valet de chambre     6 22 15  3 45
