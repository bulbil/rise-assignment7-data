raillied him upon them  And by what study  thought I  wilt thou  honest man  supply their place  If thou hast a talent this way  pursue it  since perhaps thou wilt not shine in any other  And the best any thing  you know  Harriet  carries with it the appearance of excellence  Nay  he would also part with his collection of Shells  if I had no objection   To whom  my Lord —He had not resolved —Why then  only as Emily is too little of a child  or you might give them to her     Too little of a child  madam    and a great deal of bustle and importance took possession of his features—Let me tell you  madam—I won t let you  my Lord  and I laughed       232 Well  madam  I hope here is something coming up that you will not disdain to accept of yourself   Up came groaning under the weight  or rather under the care  two servants with baskets  A fine set of old Japan China with brown edges  believe me  They sat down their baskets  and withdrew   Would you not have been delighted  Harriet  to see my Lord busying himself with taking out  and putting in the windows  one at a time  the cups  plates  jars  and saucers  rejoicing and parading over them  and shewing his connoisseurship to his motionless admiring wife  in commending this and the other piece as a beauty  And  when he had done  taking the liberty  as he phrased it  half fearful  half resolute  to salute his bride for his reward  and then pacing backwards several steps with such a strut and a crow—I see him yet —Indulge me  Harriet —I burst into a hearty laugh  I could not help it  And he  reddening  looked round himself  and round himself  to see if any thing was amiss in his garb  The man  the man  honest friend  I could have said  but had too much reverence for my husband  is the oddity  Nothing amiss in the garb   O Harriet  Why did you beseech me to be good  I think in my heart I have the stronger inclination to be bad for it  You call me perverse  if you think me so  bid me be saucy  bid me be bad  and I may then  like other good wives  take the contrary course for the sake of dear contradiction   Shew not  however   I in turn beseech you  to your grandmamma and aunt  such parts of this Letter as would make them despise me  You say  you stand up for me  I have need of your advocateship  Never let me want it  And do I not  after all  do a greater credit to my good man  when I can so heartily laugh in the wedded state  than if I were to sit down with my finger in my eye   I have taken your advice  and presented my sister   233 with my half of the jewels  I desired her to accept them  as they were my mother s  and for her sake  This gave them a value with her  more than equal with their worth  But Lord L  is uneasy  and declares he will not suffer Lady L  long to lie under the obligation  Were every one of family in South Britain and North Britain to be as generous and disinterested as Lord L  and our family  the union of the two parts of the island would be complete   LORD help this poor obliging man  I wish I don t love him at last  He has taken my hint  and has presented his collection of Shells  a very sine one  he says  it is  to Emily  and they two are actually busied  and will be for an hour or two  I doubt not  in admiring them  the one strutting over the beauties  in order to enhance the value of the present  the other courtesying ten times in a minute  to shew her gratitude  Poor man  When his virtuoso friend has got his Butterflies and Moths  I am afraid he must set up a turner s shop for employment  If he loved reading  I could  when our visiting hours are over  set him to read to me the new things that come out  while I knot or work  and  is he loved writing  to copy the Letters which pass between you and me  and those for you which I expect with so much impatience from my brother by means of Dr Bartlett  I think he spells pretty well  for a Lord   I have no more to say  at present  but compliments  without number or measure  to all you so deservedly love and honour  as well those I have not seen  as those I have   One thing  Reveal to me all the secrets of your heart  and how that heart is from time to time affected  that I may know whether you are capable of that greatness of mind in a love case  that you shew in all others  We will all allow you
