that I laid out   the little fortune of this best of women  whom I had married in my   days of better hope  in the purchase of a company  in a marching   regiment  at the head of which I flattered myself that I should meet   some opportunity  in the war just then broke out  of meriting further   promotion  But I found the vanity of such a thought when it   was unhappily too late  After several years careful service  in the   course of which I had sealed some degree of reputation with my   blood in several warm actions  without advantage to myself  or   prospect of any to my family  who now multiplied the cares of lite   ten thousandfold upon my head  I was driven by despair to exchange   my company  which I had bought  and therefore could have sold   again  the price of which would at least have kept us from absolute   starving  for an higher rank in a younger regiment just then ordered   on an expedition  the object of which raised what was thought   rational expectation of such profit as should ease me from the   anxieties that made Ufe a burden  Allured solely by this expec    tation  I went accordingly  The expedition was successful  I did my   duty  I was wounded in the course of It  to the extreme danger   of my life  I entirely ruined my constitution by the severity of the   climate  and  on my return home  was reduced to half pay  without   receiving so much prize money as defrayed the extraordinary ex    penses of the expedition and of the illness which I contracted in it     while those above me accumulated such wealth  as  if divided in   any degree of proportion  would have recompensed the labours of   us  who had literally born the heat and burden of the day  and   were now pining in  content and misery  aggravated by a partiality   so severely injurious  In this situation  I resolved to throw myself   at the feet of my sovereign  and implore relief from the known   goodness of his heart  But his throne was surrounded by those   whose interest it was to keep the cries of his people from coming   to his ears i   and therefore as it was necessary for me to make my   errand known  I never could obtain access to him        The distress of this disappointment was still further heightened   by the delays in the discharge of that half pay  which was now my   only support  and the drawbacks it was subject to from the fees   of office  even when it should come to be paid  which were such      This reflection  notoriously so groundless  is alone suÂ£Scient to   vindicate the author from any allusion to present times          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 469     that when I attempted to mortgage it  the wretch s last resource   to put off starving as long as he can  what I oould get from those   vultures  who fatten upon the sufEerings of a soldier  was scarce   sufficient to satisfy our present wants  How  then  oould I look   forward for a family  dearer to me than life   What oould support   resolution  when hope was gone   Mine was unequal to the trial     and I was beginning to meditate on putting an end to a life of such   misery  without considering that the sufEerings of those for whom   I felt so much more than for myself  must be still made heavier by   such a base desertion of them  when Heaven  in its mercy  visited my   family with a violent fever  which freed me from further fears for   the future welfare of my three eldest sons  and with difficulty spared   the two  whom you see before you  â€” Oh   my poor boys  happy    thrice happier than us  whom you left behind   â€” Excuse this weak    ness  sir   nature will force the involuntary tear  in spite of reason     for were they not the children of my love   During their illness   I lost every other care in my attendance upon them nor omitted   any possible means to preserve lives  for which my fears foreboded   nottung but unhappiness   but  though their deaths freed me from   a part of those fears  they left a melancholy void in my heart  which   was more painful  if possible  than any fear  But I was not long   sensible of that pain  My children were scarce laid in the grave   when the fever seized myself with such violence  that I soon lost   my senses  nor recovered them for above a month  and then only   to feel
