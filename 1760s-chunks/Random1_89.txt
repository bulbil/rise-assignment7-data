improbable as it was  had the desired effect upon the captain  being exactly calculated for the meridian of his intellects  more especially  as doctor Mackshane espoused this opinion  in consequence of his previous declaration that the man was not mad —Morgan finding there was no more damage done  could not help discovering by his countenance  the pleasure he enjoyed on this occasion  and while he bathed the doctor s face with an embrocation  ventured to ask him  Whether he thought there were more fools or madmen on board  But he would have been wiser in containing this sally  which his patient carefully laid up in his memory  to be taken notice of at a more fit season —Mean while we weighed anchor  and on our way to the Downs  the madman  who was treated as a prisoner  took an opportunity  while the centinel attended him at the head  to leap over board  and frustrate the revenge of the captain —We staid not long at the downs  but took the benefit of the first easterly wind to go round to Spithead  where having received on board provisions for six months  we sailed from St  Helens  in the grand fleet bound   254 for the West Indies on the ever memorable expedition of Carthagena   It was not without great mortification  I saw myself on the point of being transported to such a distant and unhealthy climate  destitute of every convenience that could render such a voyage supportable  and under the dominion of an arbitrary tyrant  whose command was almost intolerable  However  as these complaints were common to a great many on board  I resolved to submit patiently to my fate  and contrive to make myself as easy as the nature of the case would allow —We got out of the channel with a prosperous breeze  which died away  leaving us becalmed about fifty leagues to the westward of the Lizard  But this state of inaction did not last long  for next night our main top sail was split by the wind  which in the morning encreased to a hurricane —I was wakened by a most horrible din  occasioned by the play of the gun carriages upon the decks above  the creaking of cabins  the howling of the wind through the shrouds  the confused noise of the ship s crew  the pipes of the boatswain and his mates  the trumpets of the lieutenants  and the clanking of the chainpumps —Morgan  who had never been at sea before  turned out in a great hurry  crying     Got have mercy and compassion upon us  I believe we have got upon the confines of Lucifer and the d—ned  —  while poor Thomson lay quaking in his hammock  putting up petitions to heaven for our safety —I got out of bed and joined the Welchman  with whom  after having fortified ourselves with brandy  I went above  but if my sense of hearing was startled before  how must my sight be appalled in beholding the   255 effects of the storm  The sea was swelled into billows mountain high  on the top of which our ship sometimes hung  as if it was about to be precipitated to the abyss below  Sometimes we sunk between two waves that rose on each side higher than our topmast head  and threatned by dashing together  to overwhelm us in a moment  Of all our fleet  consisting of a hundred and fifty sail  scarce twelve appeared  and these driving under their bare poles  at the mercy of the tempest  At length the masts of one of them gave way  and tumbled over board with a hideous crash  Nor was the prospect in our own ship much more agreeable —a number of officers and sailors run backward and forward with distraction in their looks  hollowing to one another  and unknowing what they should attend to first  Some clung to the yards  endeavouring to unbend the sails that were split into a thousand pieces flapping in the wind  others tried to furl those which were yet whole  while the masts  at every pitch  bent and quivered like twigs  as if they would have shivered into innumerable splinters —While I considered this scene with equal terror and astonishment  one of the main braces broke  by the shock whereof two sailors were flung from the yard s arm into the sea  where they perished  and poor Jack Rattlin thrown down upon the deck  at the expence of a broken leg  Morgan and I ran immediately to his assistance  and found a splinter of the shin bone thrust by the violence of the fall through the skin  As this was a case of too great consequence to be treated without the authority of the doctor  I went down to his cabin  to inform him of the accident  as well as to bring up dressings  which   256 we always kept ready prepared —I entered his apartment without any ceremony  and by the glimmering of a lamp  perceived him on his knees  before something that very much resembled a crucifix  but this I will not insist upon  that I may not seem too much a slave to common report  which indeed assisted my conjecture on this occasion  by representing doctor Mackshane as a member of the church of Rome —Be this as it will  he got up in a sort of confusion  occasioned
