can promise you the pleasure you have in hearing  will not be half so great as my vanity in the recital  and yet in the whole narrative I can scarce promise you one adventure  as my account is not of what I did  but what I saw  The first misfortune of my life  which you all know  was great  but tho  it distrest  it could not sink me  No person ever had a better knack at hoping than I  The less kind I found fortune then  the more I expected from her another time  and being now at the bottom of her wheel  every new revolution might lift  but could not depress me  I proceeded  therefore  towards London in a fine  Page  3  morning  no way uneasy about to morrow  but chearful as the birds that caroll d by the road  I comforted myself with various reflections  that London was the true mart where abilities of every kind were sure of meeting distinction and reward    Upon my arrival in town  Sir  my first care was to deliver your letter of recommendation to our cousin  who was himself in little better circumstances than me  My first scheme  you know  Sir  was to be usher at an academy  and I asked his advice on the affair  Our cousin received the proposal with a true Sardonic grin  Aye  cried he  this is a pretty career  indeed  that has been chalked out for you  I have been once an usher at a boarding school myself  and may I die by an anodyne necklace  but I had rather be an under turnkey in Newgate  I was up early and late  I was brow beat by the master  hated for my ugly face by the mistress   Page  4  worried by the boys within  and never permitted to stir out to meet civility abroad  But are you sure you are fit for a school  Let me examine you a little  Have you been bred apprentice to the business  No  Then you won t do for a school  Can you dress the boys hair  No  Then you won t do for a school  Have you had the small pox  No  Then you won t do for a school  Can you lie three in a bed  No  Then you will never do for a school  Have you got a good stomach  Yes  Then you will by no means do for a school  No  Sir  if you are for a genteel easy profession  bind yourself seven years as an apprentice to turn a cutler s wheel  but avoid a school by any means  But come  continued he  I see you are a lad of spirit and some learning  what do you think of commencing author  like me  You have read in books  no doubt  of men of genius starving at the trade  but at present I ll shew you forty very dull fellows  Page  5  about town that live by it in opulence  All honest jogg trotmen  who go on smoothly and dully  and write history and politics  and are praised  and who  had they been bred coblers  would all their lives have only mended shoes  but never made them      Finding that there was no great degree of gentility affixed to the character of an usher  I resolved to accept his proposal  and having the highest respect for literature  I hailed the antiqua mater of Grub street with reverence  I thought it my glory to pursue a track which Dryden and Otway trod before me  In fact  I considered the goddess of this region as the parent of excellence  and however an intercourse with the world might give us good sense  the poverty she granted was the nurse of genius  Big with these reflections  I sate down  and finding that the best things remained to be said on the wrong side  I resolved to write  Page  6  a book that should be wholly new  I therefore drest up three paradoxes with some ingenuity  They were false  indeed  but they were new  The jewels of truth have been so often imported by others  that nothing was left for me to import but some splendid things that at a distance looked every bit as well  Witness you powers what fancied importance sate perched upon my quill while I was writing  The whole learned world  I made no doubt  would rise to oppose my systems  but then I was prepared to oppose the whole learned world  Like the porcupine I sate self collected  with a quill pointed against every opposer       Well said  my boy    cried I    and what subject did you treat upon  I hope you did not pass over the importance of Hierardical monogamy  But I interrupt  go on  you published your paradoxes  well  and what did the learned world say to your paradoxes    Page  7     Sir    replied my son    the learned world said nothing to my paradoxes  nothing at all  Sir  Every man of them was employed in praising his friends and himself  or condemning
