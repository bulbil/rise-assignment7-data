O my friend  my Jeronymo  have I not too much reason to fear  that guilty attachments have been the cause of your slighting a legal one  That you are studying pretences to justify the way of life into which you have fallen   Let us consider the objects of your pursuit—Alas  there have been more than one  Are they women seduced from the path of virtue by yourself —Who otherwise perhaps would have married  and made useful members of society —Consider  my friend  what a capital crime is a seduction of this kind —Can you glory in the virtue of a sister of your own  and allow yourself in attempts upon the daughter  the sister  of another  And  let me ask  How can that crime be thought pardonable in a man  which renders a woman infamous   A good heart  a delicate mind  cannot associate with a corrupt one  What tie can bind a woman  who has parted with her honour  What  in such a guilty attachment  must be a man s alternative  but either to be the tyrant of a wretch who has given him reason to despise her  or the dupe of one who despises him   It is the important lesson of life  allow me to be serious on a subject so serious  in this union of soul and body  to restrain the unruly appetites of the latter  and to improve the faculties of the former—Can this end be attained by licentious indulgences  and profligate associations   Men  in the pride of their hearts  are apt to suppose  that nature has designed them to be superior to women  The highest proof that can be given  of such superiority  is  in the protection afforded by the   205 stronger to the weaker  What can that man say for himself  or for his proud pretension  who employs all his arts to seduce  betray  and ruin the creature whom he should guide and protect—Sedulous to save her  perhaps  from every soe  but the devil and himself   It is unworthy of a man of spirit to be sollicitous to keep himself within the boundaries of human laws  on no other motive than to avoid the temporal inconveniencies attending the breach of them  The laws were not made so much for the direction of good men  as to circumscribe the bad  Would a man of honour wish to be considered as one of the latter  rather than as one of those who would have distinguished the fit from the unfit  had they not been discriminated by human sanctions  Men are to approve themselves at an higher tribunal than at that of men   Shall not public spirit  virtue  and a sense of duty  have as much influence on a manly heart  as a new face  How contemptibly low is that commerce in which mind has no share   Virtuous love  my dear Jeronymo  looks beyond this temporary scene  while guilty attachments usually find a much earlier period than that of human life  Inconstancy  on one side or the other  seldom fails to put a disgraceful end to them  But were they to endure for life  what can the reflexions upon them do towards softening the agonies of the inevitable hour   Remember  my Jeronymo  that you are a MAN  a rational and immortal agent  and act up to the dignity of your nature  Can sensual pleasure be the great end of an immortal spirit in this life   That pleasure cannot be lasting  and it must be followed by remorse  which is obtained either by doing injustice to  or degrading  a fellow creature  And does not a woman  when she forfeits her honour  degrade herself  not only in the sight of the world  but in the secret thoughts of even a profligate lover  destroying her own consequence with him     226 Build not  my noble friend  upon penances and absolutions  I enter not into those subjects on which we differ as Catholics and Protestants  But if we would be thought men of true greatness of mind  let us endeavour so to act  as not  in essential articles  and with our eyes open  either to want absolution  or incur penances  Surely  my Lord  it is nobler not to offend  than to be obliged to atone   Are there not  let me ask  innocent delights enow to fill with joy every vacant hour  Believe me  Jeronymo  there are  Let you and me seek for such  and make them the cement of our friendship   Religion out of the question  consider  what morals and good policy will oblige you to do  as a man born to act a part in public life  What  were the examples set by you and your acquaintance  to be generally followed  would become of public order and decorum  What of national honours  How will a regular succession in families be kept up  You  my Lord  boast of your descent  both by father s and mother s side  Why will you deprive your children of a distinction in which you glory   Good children  what a blessing to their parents  But what comfort can the parent have in children born into the world heirs of disgrace  and who
