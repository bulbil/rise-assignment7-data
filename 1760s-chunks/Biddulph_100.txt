  Mr F Absolutely   Mrs G You are not serious  sure   Mr F My dear creature  why sure thou canst not be serious in asking me the question   Mrs G Sir  I am serious  and expect a serious answer   Mr F Why then —seriously  I have no more thoughts of marrying    thee  than I have of marrying the first sultana in the grand seignior’s seraglio   Mrs G Very well  Sir  very well  I am answered   and she walked quicker about the room than before    We were both silent  She  I suppose  expected that I should propose other terms  and a settlement  and waited  to try if I would speak  I had a mind to teaze her a little  and hummed a tune   Mrs G  Advancing to me  and making a low curt’sey  with a most scornful and sarcastical air  May I presume to enquire what your mightiness’s pleasure is in regard to me  Do you intend to keep me for your nurse against your next illness  or to send me to the grand seignior’s seraglio to wait upon the first sultana   Mr F Neither  carelessly  and looking another way   I have not yet determined which way I shall dispose of you   Mrs G Dispose of me  dispose of me  why sure the man has lost his senses   Mr F Look you  Mrs Gerrarde  we will no longer play at cross purposes  sit down  and be calm for a few minutes  till you hear what I have to say    She did so  with a kind of impatience in her looks  that informed me I might have made a very free proposal  without any great danger of her resentment    Mr F How long have you and I been acquainted   Mrs G Lord  what is that question to the purpose   Mr F ’Tis only in order to my desiring you would look back  and  upon recollection  ask yourself  if you ever had any reason to look upon me as your lover   Mrs G I made that observation to you when we were travelling together  what is the use of it now   Mr F Did I  in the course of our journey  declare myself to be such  or drop the least hint of devoting myself to you on any condition   Mrs G We did not talk on the subject at all   Mr F Did I ever presume  on the advantage of having you in my power  to venture on the smallest liberty with you  or ever deviate from that respect in my behaviour  that I was used  at all other times  to treat you with   Mrs G I do not say you did  and it was that very behaviour that inclined me to imagine you had other thoughts than those I find you have   Mr F You drew a wrong conclusion  though it is to be confessed    not a very unnatural one  Such a behaviour might have been so construed by a lady otherwise circumstanced than you were  but I think a woman of your sagacity might have concluded  that  with Mrs Gerrarde  a man would first have tried his fortune upon gentler terms than those of matrimony   Mrs G Well  well  peevishly   I do not understand your riddles  to the point   Mr F Why  the point  in short  is this  that  without any particular designs on your person  my whole view  in carrying you out of England  was to break off your intercourse with Mr Arnold    She seemed thunder struck  but recovering herself  And is this what I am to hear calmly  And she flounced off the chair to the other end of the room   I followed her  and  taking her hand  begged she would sit down again  and hear me out  I drew her to a chair  and gently set her down in it    Mr F Now  for your own sake  hear me with patience  violence or perverseness will be of no use to you   Mrs G Very well  Sir  I am your prisoner  your slave at present  say what you please  ’tis your turn now   Mr F Well then  Madam  as I said before  I really never had any designs upon you merely on your own account  I allow you to be a very fine woman  and capable of inspiring love in any man that sees you  but I must tell you plainly  that love has had no share in my conduct   I saw stifled rage in her face  but I proceeded   I have already told you the real motive of my carrying you off  it was  as I said  to dissolve the union between you and Mr Arnold  and my reasons for wishing to do so are these  Mr Arnold is married to one of the best women living  for whom I have the highest respect and esteem  and whom I once adored  That lady has  by your influence over her husband  not only been thrown out from his heart
