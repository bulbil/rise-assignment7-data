one moment to my Rivers       He is formed to charm the soul of woman  his delicacy  his sensibility  the mind that speaks through those eloquent eyes  the thousand graces of his air  the sound of his voice my dear  I never heard him speak without feeling a softness of which it is impossible to convey an idea       But I am wrong to encourage a tenderness which is already too great  I will think less of him  I will not talk of him  do not speak of him to me  my dear Bell  talk to me of Fitzgerald  there is no danger of your passion becoming too violent       I wish you loved more tenderly  my dearest  you would then be more indulgent to my weakness  I am ashamed of owning it even to you       Ashamed  did I say  no  I rather glory in loving the most amiable  the most angelic of mankind       Speak of him to me for ever  I abhor all conversation of which he is not the subject  I am interrupted  Adieu   Your faithful  EMILY       My dearest  I tremble  he is at the door  how shall I meet him without betraying all the weakness of my heart  come to me this moment  I will not go down without you  Your father is come to fetch me  follow me  I entreat  I cannot see him alone  my heart is too much softened at this moment  He must not know to what excess he is beloved     LETTER CIX   109   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Quebec  March 28   I AM at present  my dear Lucy  extremely embarrassed  Madame Des Roches is at Quebec  it is impossible for me not to be more than polite to her  yet my Emily has all my heart  and demands all my attention  there is but one way of seeing them both as often as I wish   tis to bring them as often as possible together  I wish extremely that Emily would visit her  but  tis a point of the utmost delicacy to manage       Will it not on reflection be cruel to Madame Des Roches  I know her generosity of mind  but I also know the weakness of the human heart  can she see with pleasure a beloved rival       My Lucy  I never so much wanted your advice  I will consult Bell Fermor  who knows every thought of my Emily s heart   Eleven o clock       I have visited Madame Des Roches at her relation s  she received me with a pleasure which was too visible not to be observed by all present  she blushed  her voice faltered when she addressed me  her eyes had a softness which seemed to reproach my insensibility  I was shocked at the idea of having inspired her with a tenderness not in my power to return  I was afraid of increasing that tenderness  I scarce dared to meet her looks       I felt a criminal in the presence of this amiable woman  for both our sakes  I must see her seldom  yet what an appearance will my neglect have  after the attention she has shewed me  and the friendship she has expressed for me to all the world       I know not what to determine  I am going to Silleri  Adieu till my return   Eight o clock       I have entreated Emily to admit Madame Des Roches among the number of her friends  and have asked her to visit her to morrow morning  she changed color at my request  but promised to go       I almost repent of what I have done  I am to attend Emily and Bell Fermor to Madame Des Roches in the morning  I am afraid I shall introduce them with a very bad grace  Adieu   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CX   110   To Miss FERMOR   Sunday morning   COULD you have believed he would have expected such a proof of my desire to oblige him  but what can he ask that his Emily will refuse  I will see this friend of his  this Madame Des Roches  I will even love her  if it is in woman to be so disinterested  She loves him  he sees her  they say she is amiable  I could have wished her visit to Quebec had been delayed        But he comes  he looks up  his eyes seem to thank me for this excess of complaisance  what is there I would not do to give him pleasure   Six o clock       Do you think her so very pleasing  my dear Bell  she has fine eyes  but have they not more fire than softness  There was a vivacity in her manner which hurt me extremely  could she have behaved with such unconcern  had she loved as I do       Do you think it possible  Bell  for a Frenchwoman to love  is not vanity the ruling passion of their hearts       May not Rivers be deceived in supposing her so much attached to him  was there not some degree
