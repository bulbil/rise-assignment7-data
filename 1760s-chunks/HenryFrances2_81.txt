very good Kind of People  for seeming to be utter Strangers to the Pleasures of Self society  for I will not call it Solitude to be sometimes alone  However  I hope your contemplative Amusements are  by this Time  heightened into the Joys of a rational Converse  by the Bishop s Return  I am sure he is a sensible Man  from the Friendship that has so long subsisted between you  and the Manner you always speak of him in   I am much obliged to dear Lady — for the Expressions  as well as Proofs of Regard  she has honoured me with  There is really something extraordinary in her Attachment  for indeed I cannot plead the least Merit to her Friendship  yet I hope  and believe  I shall ever retain it  for I am well convinced  I must be highly to blame  whenever I forfeit it   Page  307I am very certain  that you and she are quite right with regard to early Hours  But I would not disgrace the Goodness of her Heart  as well as Understanding  to suppose her chearful Spirits arise merely from Constitution  Believe me  that  in order to support them  she has had Recourse to Religion and Philosophy  nor has her high Station exempted her from wanting their Aid  May both you and she ever retain that sensible Chearfulness  which so well becomes ye  which  tho  you modestly ascribe to Regularity and early Hours  has it s Effect from another Cause  a Consciousness of acting right  and a Mind filled with   that sweet Peace  which Goodness bosoms ever     I will not however pretend to deny  that  in such Constitutions as mine  Irregularity may weaken the Faculties of the Mind  as well as the Body  and diffuse a Lassitude and Heaviness over both  Providence having ordained  for their mutual Preservation  that what injures the one  shall immediately or remotely affect the other  This Sentiment may be carried a great Way  even to the mental Vices of Envy  Avarice   c  and every Person  who has ever felt Sickness or Pain  must know    we are not ourselves  when Nature  being oppressed  commands the Mind to suffer with the Body   Adieu     Frances   Page  308  LETTER CCCVIII   My Dear FANNY   ALL alone still  in my own Kingdom  where  though I have no very extensive Sway  I have those Subjects to govern  that should be the first Essay of a Monarch s Politics  namely  my own Passions and Foibles  I might have answered your Letter last Post  but declined it  as I had not Time to do it Justice  to speak still in the kingly Stile   I am extremely pleased  when you answer my Letters properly  by entering into the Spirit and Subject of them  which indeed you can do so well  not with   I received your s  and for Answer say     A Correspondence should be properly a Conversation  not mere Question and Answer  I often just hint at Subjects  and leave them imperfect  to give you Occasion to complete them  and I am vexed and disappointed  when you neglect it  out of Laziness or Diffidence  for it must be owing to either of these  whenever I am disappointed  You have sometimes told me  that I over awe you  from an Apprehension of my superior Understanding  so that  in writing or speaking to me  you have not always the full Exercise of your own Powers  Page  309 Now  for Argument s sake  we will let this pass  but then believe me  Fanny  if I remember right  I had not so refined and speculative Sense  as you have now  when I was at your Age  All the Improvement  I have ever made to it  has been almost since that Time  and a practised Wrestler may be able to overcome an inexperienced Man of greater natural Abilities  You are now in a State and Stage of Life proper to improve yourself  and may have this Advantage over me  that you can have the Help of one  who has lately travelled through the Road  you are to go  so that I hope  in Return  to have your Assistance  as your Understanding will be at the Height  when mine  from the Course of Nature  will be on the Decline  This I should look upon as a Sort of Triumph  of the most flattering Kind  namely  a Conquest over myself  that is  my better Part overcoming my worse  Besides  you have the Advantage of a chaste and religious Education  which will the sooner enable you to reach the only End I have ever proposed from my Studies  to make me rather a better  than a wiser Man  Moral Philosophy may reform our Manners  and subdue our Passions  but slowly the one  and with a constant Struggle the other  while Religion effects the first at once  and the latter with Ease  by substituting more charming Pleasures in their stead   Page  310This is the most romantic Place I ever saw  There are not two hundred Yards of level Ground in the whole
