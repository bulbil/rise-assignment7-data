because then the Mantchoux Tartars were obliged to retire to their own country  at a vast distance from the seat of the war —As for Bron xitic  who commanded the Japonese army on that continent  he continued to play booty with the Chinese general  over whom he was allowed to obtain some petty advantages  which  with the trophies won by Brut antiffi  were swelled up into mighty victories  to increase the infatuation of the blatant beast —On the other hand  Bron xi tic obliged the generals of China with the like indulgences  by now and then sacrificing a detachment of his Japonese troops  to keep up the spirits of that nation   Taycho had levied upon the people   85 of Japan an immense sum of money for the equipment of a naval armament  the destination of which was kept a profound secret  Some politicians imagined it was designed for the conquest of Thin quo  and all the other settlements which the Chinese possessed in the Indian ocean  others conjectured the intention was to attack the king of Corea  who had  since the beginning of this war  acted with a shameful partiality in favour of the emperor of China  his kinsman and ally  But the truth of the matter was this  Taycho kept the armament in the harbours of Japan ready for a descent upon the coast of China  in order to make a diversion in favour of his friend Brut an tiffi  in case he had run any risque of being oppressed by his enemies  However  the beast of many heads having growled and grumbled during the best part of the   86 summer  at the inactivity of this expensive armament  it was now thought proper to send it to sea in the beginning of winter  but it was soon driven back in great distress  by contrary winds and storms —and this was all the monster had for its ten millions of Obans   While Taycho amused the Mobile with this winter expedition  Yak strot resolved to plan the scheme of oeconomy which he had projected  He dismissed from the Dairo s service about a dozen of cooks andscullions  shut up one of the kitchens  after having sold the grates  hand irons  spits and saucepans  deprived the servants and officers of the houshold of their breakfast  took away their usual allowance of oil and candles  retrenched their tables  reduced their proportion of drink  and persuaded his pupil the Dairo to put himself upon a diet of soupmeagre thickened with oat meal  In   87 a few days there was no smoke seen to ascend from the kitchens of the palace  nor did any fuel  torch  or taper blaze in the chimnies  courts  and apartments thereof  which now became the habitation of cold  darkness  and hunger  Gio gio himself  who turned peripatetic philosopher merely to keep himself in heat  fell into a wash tub as he groped his way in the dark through one of the lower galleries  Two of his body guard had their whiskers gnawed off by the rats  as they slept in his antichamber  and their captain presented a petition declaring  that neither he nor his men could undertake the defence of his imperial majesty s person  unless their former allowance of provision should be restored  They and all the individuals of the household were not only punished in their bellies  but likewise curtailed in their clothing  and abridged in their stipends    88 The palace of Meaco  which used to be the temple of mirth  jollity  and good cheer  was now so dreary and deserted  that a certain wag fixed up a ticket on the outward gate with this inscription     This tenement to be lett  the proprietor having left off house keeping      Yak strot  however  was resolved to shew  that if the new Dairo retrenched the superfluities of his domestic expence  he did not act from avarice or poorness of spirit  inasmuch as he should now display his liberality in patronizing genius and the arts  A general jubilee was now promised to all those who had distinguished themselves by their talents or erudition  The emissaries of Yakstrot declared that Maecenas was but a type of this Ximian mountaineer  and that he was determined to search for merit  even in the thickest shades of obscurity  All these researches    89 however  proved so unsuccessful  that not above four or five men of genius could be found in the whole empire of Japan  and these were gratified with pensions of about one hundred Obans each  One was a secularized Bonza from Ximo  another a malcontent poet of Niphon  a third  a reformed comedian of Xicoco  a fourth  an empiric  who had outlived his practice  and a fifth  a decayed apothecary  who was bard  quack  author  chymist  philosopher  and simpler by profession  The whole of the expence arising from the favour and protection granted by the Dairo to these men of genius  did not exceed seven or eight hundred Obans per annum  amounting to about fifteen hundred pounds sterling  whereas many a private Quo in Japan expended more money on a kennel of hounds  I do not mention those men of singular merit  whom   90 Yak strot fixed in established places under the government  such as architects  astronomers  painters  physicians
