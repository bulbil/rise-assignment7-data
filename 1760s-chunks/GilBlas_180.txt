word without loss of time  No pains were spared to get into Mascarini s good graces  and the design was not difficult to accomplish  Delighted to find his friendship sought by a man possessing the affections of the prince  he advanced half way to meet my overtures  His house was always open to me  my intercourse with his lady was unrestrained  and I have no hesitation in affirming my measures to have been taken so well  as to have precluded the slightest suspicion of the embassy intrusted to my management  It is true  he had but a small share of the Italian jealousy  relying as he did on the virtue of his Lucretia  so that he often shut himself up in his closet  and left me alone with her  I entered at once into the pith and marrow of my subject  The grand duke s passion was my topic with the lady  and I told her that the motive of my visits was only to plead for that prince  She did not seem to be over head and ears in love with him  and yet  methought  vanity forbade her to frown decisively on his addresses  She took a pleasure in listening to his sighs  without sighing in concert  A certain propriety of heart she had  but then she was a woman  and it was obvious that her rigour was giving way insensibly to the triumphant image of a sovereign  bound in the fetters of her resistless charms  In short  the prince had good reason to flatter himself that he might dispense with the ill breeding of a Tarquin  and yet bend Lucretia to a compliance with his longings  An incident  however  the most unexpected in the annals of romance  blasted his flattering prospects  in what manner you shall hear   I am naturally free and easy with the women  This constitutional assurance  whether a blessing or a curse  was ripened into inveterate habit among the Turks  Lucretia was a pretty woman  I forgot that I was courting by proxy  and assumed the tone of a principal  Nothing could exceed the warmth and gallantry with which I offered my services to the lady  Far from appearing offended at my boldness  or silencing me by a resentful answer  she only said with a sarcastic smile  Own the truth  Don Raphael  the grand duke has pitched upon a very faithful and zealous agent  You serve him with an integrity not sufficiently to be commended  Madam  said I in the same strain  let us not examine things with too much nicety  A truce  I beseech you  with moral discussions  they are not of my element  good honest passion tallies better with our natures  I do not believe myself  after all  the first prince s confidant who has ousted his master in an affair of gallantry  your great lords have often dangerous rivals  in more humble messengers than myself  That may be  replied Lucretia  but a haughty temper stands with me in the place of virtue  and no one under the degree of a prince shall ever sully these charms  Regulate your behaviour accordingly  added she in a tone of serious severity  and let us change the subject  I willingly bury your presumption in oblivion  provided you never hold similar discourse to me again  if you do  you may repent of it   Though this was a comment of some importance on my text  and ought to have been heedfully conned over  it was no bar to my still entertaining Mascarini s wife with my passion  I even pressed her with more importunity than heretofore  for a kind consent to my tender entreaties  and was rash enough to feel my ground  by some little personal freedoms  The lady then  offended at my words  and still more at my Mahometan quips and cranks  gave a complete set down to my assurance  She threatened to acquaint the grand duke with my impertinence  and declared she would make a point of his punishing me as I deserved  These menaces bristled up my spirit in return  My love turned at once into hatred  and determined me to revenge myself for the contempt with which Lucretia had treated me  I went in quest of her husband  and after having bound him by oath not to betray me  I informed him of his wile s correspondence with the prince  and failed not to represent her as distractedly enamoured of him  by way of heightening the interest of the scene  The minister  lest the plot should become too intricately entangled  shut his wife up  without any law but his own will  in a secret apartment  whore he placed her under the strict guard of confidential persons  While she was thus kept at bay by the watch dogs of jealousy  who prevented her from acquainting the grand duke with her situation  I announced to that prince  with a melancholy air  that he must think no longer of Lucretia  I told him that Mascarini had doubtless discovered all  since he had taken it into his head to keep a guard over his wife  that I could not conceive what had induced him to suspect me  as I flattered myself with having always behaved according to the most approved rules of discretion in such cases  The lady might  I suggested  have been beforehand
