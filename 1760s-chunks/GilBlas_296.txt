course aware that I intended to take my father thither also  but since heaven has ordained it otherwise  let me at least have the satisfaction of affording an asylum to my mother  and making amends by all the attentions in my power for the fallow seasons in the former harvest of my filial duty   I accept your kind intentions in very good part  said my mother  and would take the journey without hesitation  if I saw no obstacles in the way  But to desert your uncle in his present condition would be unpardonable  and I am too much accustomed to this part of the country  to like living elsewhere  nevertheless  as the proposal deserves to be maturely weighed  I will consider further of it at my leisure  At present  your father s funeral requires to be ordered and arranged  As for that  said I  we will leave it to the care of the young man whom you saw with me  he is my secretary  with as clever a head and as good a heart as you have often been acquainted with  let the business rest with him  it cannot be in better hands   Hardly had I pronounced these words  when Scipio came back  for it was already broad day  He inquired whether he could be of any service in our present distresses  I answered that he was come just in time to receive some very important directions  As soon as he was made acquainted with the business in hand  A word to the wise  said he  the whole procession with its appropriate heraldry is already marshalled in this head of mine  you may trust me for a very pretty funeral  Have a care  said my mother  to make it plain and decent without anything like pomp or parade  It can scarcely be too humble for my husband  whom all the town knows to have been low in rank  and indigent in circumstances  Madam  replied Scipio  though he had been the meanest and most destitute of the human race  I would not bate one button in the array of his posthumous honours  My master s credit is at stake in the proper conduct of the ceremony  he has been in an ostensible situation under the Duke of Lerma  and his father ought to be buried with all the forms of state and nobility   I thought exactly as my secretary did upon the subject  and even went so far as to bid him spare no expense on the occasion  A little leaven of vanity still fermented in the mass of my philosophy  and rose in my bosom with all the effervescence of its original lightness  I flattered myself that by lavishing posthumous honours on a father who had blessed the day of his decease by no lucrative bequest  I should instil into the conceptions of the bystanders a high sense of my generous nature  My mother  on her part  whatever airs of humility she might put on  had no dislike to seeing her husband carried out with due observance of funeral pomp and ceremony  We therefore left Scipio to do just as he pleased  and he  without a moment s delay  adopted all the necessary measures for the display of the undertaker s liveliest fancy   The genius of that artist was called forth but too successfully  His emblems  devices  and draperies  were so ostentatious  as to disgust instead of cajoling the natives  every individual  whether of the town or the suburbs  whether high or low  rich or poor  felt shocked and insulted by this after thought parade  This ministerial beggar on horseback  said one  can put his hand into his pocket for his father s funeral baked meats  but never found in his heart wherewithal to furnish his living table with common necessaries  It would have been much more to the purpose  said another  to have made the old gentleman s latter days comfortable  than to have wasted such thriftless sums on a post obit act of filial munificence  In short  quips of the brain and peltings of the tongue pattered round our execrated heads  It would have been well had the storm been only a whirlwind of passion  or hurricane of words  but we were all  Scipio  Bertrand  and myself  corporally admonished of our misdeeds  on our coming out of church  they abused us like pickpockets  made mouths and odious noises as we passed  and followed Bertrand at his heels to the inn with a copious volley of stones and mud  To disperse the mob which had collected before my uncle s house  my mother was obliged to shew herself at the window  and to declare publicly  that she was thoroughly satisfied with my proceedings  Another detachment had filed off to the stable yard where my carriage stood  in the full determination of breaking it to pieces  and this they would inevitably have done  if the landlord and lady had not found some means of quieting their perturbed spirits  and turning them aside from their outrageous purpose   All these affronts  so revolting to my dignity  the effect of the tales which the young grocer had been spreading about town  inspired me with such a thorough hatred for my native place  that I determined on quitting Oviedo almost immediately  though but for this bustle I might have made it my residence
