in your absence       Come as soon as possible  my dear friend  and leave us nothing to wish for        Adieu    Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXCVI   196   To Colonel RIVERS  Bellfield  Rutland    London  Oct  8   YOU are very cruel  my dear Rivers  to tantalize me with your pictures of happiness       Notwithstanding this spite  I am sorry I must break in on your groupe of friends  but it is absolutely necessary for Bell and my father to return immediately to town  in order to settle some family business  previous to my purchase of the majority        Indeed  I am not very fond of letting Bell stay long amongst you  for she gives me such an account of your attention and complaisance to Mrs  Rivers  that I am afraid she will think me a careless fellow when we meet again       You seem in the high road  not only to spoil your own wife  but mine too  which it is certainly my affair to prevent       Say every thing for me to the ladies of your family       Adieu  Your affectionate  J  FITZGERALD     LETTER CXCVII   197   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Sept  10   YOU are a malicious fellow  Fitzgerald  and I am half inclined to keep the sweet Bell by force  take all the men away if you please  but I cannot bear the loss of a woman  especially of such a woman        If I was not more a lover than a husband  I am not sure I should not wish to take my revenge       To make me happy  you must place me in a circle of females  all as pleasing as those now with me  and turn every male creature out of the house       I am a most intolerable monopolizer of the sex  in short  I have very little relish for any conversation but theirs  I love their sweet prattle beyond all the sense and learning in the world       Not that I would insinuate they have less understanding than we  or are less capable of learning  or even that it less becomes them        On the contrary  all such knowledge as tends to adorn and soften human life and manners  is  in my opinion  peculiarly becoming in women        You don t deserve a longer letter       Adieu  Yours    ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXCVIII   198   To Mrs  FITZGERALD    Bellfield  Oct  12   I AM very conscious  my dear Bell  of not meriting the praises my Rivers lavishes on me  yet the pleasure I receive from them is not the less lively for that consideration  on the contrary  the less I deserve these praises  the more flattering they are to me  as the stronger proofs of his love  of that love which gives ideal charms  which adorns  which embellishes its object       I had rather be lovely in his eyes  than in those of all mankind  or  to speak more exactly  if I continue to please him  the admiration of all the world is indifferent to me  it is for his sake alone I wish for beauty  to justify the dear preference he has given me        How pleasing are these sweet shades  were they less so  my Rivers s presence would give them every charm  every object has appeared to me more lovely since the dear moment when I first saw him  I seem to have acquired a new existence from his tenderness       You say true  my dear Bell  heaven doubtless formed us to be happy  even in this world  and we obey its dictates in being so  when we can without encroaching on the happiness of others       This lesson is  I think  plain from the book providence has spread before us  the whole universe smiles  the earth is clothed in lively colors  the animals are playful  the birds sing  in being chearful with innocence  we seem to conform to the order of nature  and the will of that beneficent Power to whom we owe our being       If the Supreme Creator had meant us to be gloomy  he would  it seems to me  have clothed the earth in black  not in that lively green  which is the livery of chearfulness and joy        I am called away       Adieu  my dearest Bell   Your faithful  EMILY RIVERS     LETTER CXCIX   199   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Oct  14   YOU flatter me most agreably  my dear Fitzgerald  by praising Emily  I want you to see her again  she is every hour more charming  I am astonished any man can behold her without love       Yet  lovely as she is  her beauty is her least merit  the finest understanding  the most pleasing kind of knowledge  tenderness  sensibility  modesty  and truth  adorn her almost with
