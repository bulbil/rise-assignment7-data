 dry your tears  my prince  that jewel shall detect his theft  and light us to revenge     159 It shall become a rock to crush him in his retreat —a net of iron to entangle his steps  a fallen trunk over which his feet shall stumble  It shall hang like a weight about his neck  and sink him to the lowest gulph of perdition —Be comforted  then  my liege  your farm is rooted to the center  it can neither be concealed nor removed  Nay  should he hide it at the bottom of the ocean  or place it among the constellations in the heavens  your faithful Taycho would fish it up intire  or tear it headlong from the starry firmament —We will retrieve the farm of Yesso—   But  how  how  how  dear orator Taycho     The empire of Japan shall be mortgaged for the sake of that precious—that sacred spot  which produced the patriarch apostle Bupo  and resounded under the hoofs of the holy steed —Your people of Japan shall    160 chant the litany of Fakkubasi —They shall institute crusades for the recovery of the farm  they shall pour their treasury at your imperial feet —they shall clamour for imposition —they shall load themselves with tenfold burthens  desolate their country  and beggar their posterity in behalf of Yesso  With these funds I could undertake even to overturn the councils of Pekin —While the Tartar princes deal in the trade of blood  there will be no want of hands to cut away those noxious weeds which have taken root in the farm of Yesso  those vermin that have preyed upon her delightful blossoms  Amidst such a variety of remedies  there can be no difficulty in choosing —Like a weary traveller  I will break a bough from the first pine that presents  and brush away those troublesome insects that gnaw the fruits of Yesso —Should not the mercenary    161 bands of Tartary suffice to repal those insolent invaders  I will engage to chain this island to the continent  to build a bridge from shore to shore  that shall afford a passage more free and ample than the road to Hell  Through this avenue I will ride the mighty beast whose name is Legion —I have studied the art of war  my Liege —I had once the honour to serve my country as Lance presado in the militia of Niphon —I will unpeople these realms  and overspread the land of Yesso with the forces of Japan      Got hama baba could no longer resist the energy of such expressions  He flew to the door of his cabinet  and embraced the orator in a transport of joy  while Fika kaka fell upon his neck and wept aloud  and Mura clami kissed the hem of his garment      162 You must know  Peacock  I had by this time changed my situation  I was discharged in the perspiratory vapour from the perinaeum of the Cuboy  and sucked into the lungs of Mura clami  through which I pervaded into the course of the circulation  and visited every part of his composition  I found the brain so full and compact  that there was not room for another particle of matter  But instead of a heart  he had a membranous sac  or hollow viscus  cold and callous  the habitation of sneaking caution  servile flattery  griping avarice  creeping malice  and treacherous deceit  Among these tenants it was my fate to dwell  and there I discovered the motives by which the lawyer s conduct was influenced  He now secretly rejoiced at the presumption of Taycho  which he hoped had already prompted him to undertake    163 more than he could perform  in which case he would infallibly incur disgrace either with the Dairo or the people  It is not impossible but this hope might have been realized  had not fortune unexpectedly interposed  and operated as an auxilliary to the orator s presumption  Success began to dawn upon the arms of Japan in the island of Fatsisio  and towards the end of the campaign  Brut an tiffi obtained two petty advantages in Tartary against one body of Chinese  and another of the Ostrog  All these were magnified into astonishing victories  and ascribed to the wisdom and courage of Taycho  because during his ministry they were obtained  though he neither knew why  nor wherefore  and was in this respect as innocent as his master Got hama baba  and his colleague Fika kaka  He had penetration enough to perceive     164 however  that these events had intoxicated the rabble  and began to pervert their ideas  Success of any kind is apt to perturb the weak brain of a Japonese  but the acquisition of any military trophy  produces an actual delirium —The streets of Meaco were filled with the multitudes who shouted  whooped  and hollowed  They made processions with flags and banners  they illuminated their houses  they extolled Ian on i  a provincial captain of Fatsisio  who had by accident repulsed a body of the enemy  and reduced an old barn which they had fortified  They magnified Brut an tiffi  they deified orator Taycho  they drank  they damned  they squabbled  and acted a thousand extravagancies which I shall not pretend to enumerate or particularize  Taycho  who knew their trim  seized this opportunity to strike
