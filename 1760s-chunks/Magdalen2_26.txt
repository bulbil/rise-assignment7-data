 if your addresses were repulsed when I thought you infinitely less atrocious  there is a possibility of succeeding   153 now  when you are covered with aggravated crimes  No  Hastings  no—The very supposition of such a circumstance is a fresh argument of your unworthiness  and only serves to render you additionally odious to my imagination—Free me  therefore  from this infamous house  I desire you—Free me instantly from this house—for  by the mighty God of heaven  the hour that makes me your s puts an end to my life  and may possibly endanger the safety of your own      Upon my word  madam   replied the insulting wretch—   this tone of voice is perfectly tragical  you really talk this admirably—and  if your favourite Harold was not to the full as great a profligate as myself  I should think it impossible for you to overlook the smallest deviation from the paths of virtue—But I appeal to the   154 rectitude of your judgment against the preposession of your heart—and  since you force me to put the question  let me ask you  which is most entitled to your regard  the man who has not only ruined  but forsaken you  or the man  who  with all the obloquy of that ruin upon your head  is willing to take you to his arms  and is ready even to think himself happy in a participation with your disgrace     O  Harriot  don t you pity me  don t you bleed for me here —Stained and polluted as I was  how could I reply to the equity of this reproach —I felt it  as Hamlet says  in my heart s core—in my heart of heart s—and the propriety of it struck me instantly dumb—O  how mean  how despicable is guilt  when it is even incapable to retort an insult from the unworthy  and shrinks before the judgement seat of vice with as great a   155 degree of timidity as if it was immediately arraigned before the awful tribunal of virtue —That Harold too—but save me  Harriot—I must not suffer myself to think—of that—I cannot find an epithet to distinguish him by—my reason is impatient to brand him with the most detestable—but this infatuated bosom eternally beats in his behalf  and  though I strive to despise and abhor him  yet I feel I passionately love   As I continued in a state of silent confusion at this unanswerable retort of Sir Harry s  the wretch rang the bell with a determined air  and  the housekeeper entering to know his commands— Mrs  Lawson   says he    desire the gentlemen in the parlour to walk up   The woman withdrew  and  before I could recollect myself sufficiently to ask him for what purpose they were to walk up  three of the fellows   156 who had been concerned in carrying me off the night before  attended by a most bold looking man  in a clergyman s habit  were in the room  This was a sight which I was utterly unable to withstand  my brain was instantly on fire  I screamed with a wildness of distraction  and  just as the clergyman was coming up to me  I sunk down lifeless on the floor  What became of me for six whole weeks I know not—Mrs  Lawson tells me  that I was in such strong hysterics  after the presence of the men had terrified me into a swoon  that they were under a necessity of giving over their purpose for that time  and that it was with the greatest difficulty she  her daughter  and two of the housemaids  could remove me to my room  Here it seems the violent agitation of mind  and the excessive fatigue which I had undergone  threw me into a fortunate fever  which deprived me of my   157 senses  and  though the monster Hastings omitted nothing which could possibly tend to my recovery  yet it was full six weeks before I was brought to my recollection  About this time  the natural goodness of my constitution triumphing over the fury of my disorder  I became somewhat sensible  and was called back to the pungent reflections of a sensibility  which made me look with an inconceivable envy upon madness     During the dangerous part of my illness  Mrs  Lawson informed me  that her wretch of a master was absolutely frantic  that he frequently tore his hair  and stamped upon the ground with all the agitation of a bedlamite  swearing he would not survive me if I happened to die  and raving that the grave should at least unite him to me  should there be no possibility of a union with me by any other means  Though nothing was   158 ever more odious to me than the thoughts of this fellow s passion  yet it was very fortunate that he loved me to so preposterous an excess—for his brutal companions  before I fell dangerous ill  being no strangers to the crime of your unhappy friend  were continually ridiculing his intention of marrying a creature who had already parted with her honour  and were as often advising him to profit by the opportunity which Mrs  Darnel had put so luckily in his hands—They assured him  that a woman who had been familiar with one man  would make no mighty scruple to be familiar with a second—they
