the  present to better advantage     6 22 15  3 45 PM   CHAPTER XXV    He receives a Letter from his Aunt  breaks with the Commodore  and  disobliges the Lieutenant  who  nevertheless  undertakes his Cause   Meanwhile he quitted the youth in high dudgeon  and that same evening  despatched a letter for Mrs  Trunnion  which was dictated by the  first transports of his passion  and of course replete with severe  animadversions on the misconduct of his pupil  In consequence of this  complaint  it was not long before Peregrine received an epistle from his  aunt  wherein she commemorated all the circumstances of the commodore s  benevolence towards him  when he was helpless and forlorn  deserted and  abandoned by his own parents  upbraided him for his misbehaviour  and  neglect of his tutor s advice  and insisted upon his breaking off an  intercourse with that girl who had seduced his youth  as he valued the  continuance of her affection and her husband s regard   As our lover s own ideas of generosity were extremely refined  he was  shocked at the indelicate insinuations of Mrs  Trunnion  and felt all  the pangs of an ingenuous mind that labours under obligations to a  person whom it contemns  Far from obeying her injunction  or humbling  himself by a submissive answer to her reprehension  his resentment  buoyed him up above every selfish consideration  he resolved to attach  himself to Emilia  if possible  more than ever  and although he was  tempted to punish the officiousness of Jolter  by recriminating upon  his life and conversation  he generously withstood the impulse of his  passion  because he knew that his governor had no other dependence than  the good opinion of the commodore  He could not  however  digest in  silence the severe expostulations of his aunt  to which he replied by  the following letter  addressed to her husband          Sir   Though my temper could never stoop to offer nor  I      believe  your disposition deign to receive  that gross incense      which the illiberal only expect  and none but the base minded      condescend to pay  my sentiments have always done justice to      your generosity  and my intention scrupulously adhered to the      dictates of my duty  Conscious of this integrity of heart  I      cannot but severely feel your lady s unkind  I will not call      it ungenerous  recapitulation of the favours I have received       and  as I take it for granted that you knew and approved of her      letter  I must beg leave to assure you  that  far from being      swayed by menaces and reproach  I am determined to embrace the      most abject extremity of fortune  rather than submit to such      dishonourable compulsion  When I am treated in a more delicate      and respectful manner  I hope I shall behave as becomes   Sir       your obliged   P  Pickle     The commodore  who did not understand those nice distinctions of  behaviour  and dreaded the consequence of Peregrine s amour  against  which he was strangely prepossessed  seemed exasperated at the insolence    6 22 15  3 45 PM   and obstinacy of this adopted son  to whose epistle he wrote the  following answer  which was transmitted by the hands of Hatchway  who  had orders to bring the delinquent along with him to the garrison          Hark ye  child   You need not bring your fine speeches to bear      upon me  you only expend your ammunition to no purpose  Your      aunt told you nothing but truth  for it is always fair and      honest to be above board  d ye see  I am informed as how you      are in chase of a painted galley  which will decoy you upon the      flats of destruction  unless you keep a better look out and a      surer reckoning than you have hitherto done  and I have sent      Jack Hatchway to see how the land lies  and warn you of your      danger  if so be as you will put about ship  and let him steer      you into this harbour  you shall meet with a safe berth and      friendly reception  but if you refuse to alter your course you      cannot expect any farther assistance from yours as you behave                                       Hawser Trunnion    Peregrine was equally piqued
