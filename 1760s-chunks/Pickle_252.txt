in a new world of bliss in consequence of this  reconciliation  the rapture of which continued unimpaired for the space  of four months  during which time he was fonder of me  if possible  than  before  repeated his promise of marriage  if we should ever have it in  our power  assured me he had never been happy since he left me  that  he believed no woman loved like me  And indeed  to have a notion of my  passion for that man  you must first have loved as I did  But  through  a strange caprice  I broke off the correspondence  out of apprehension  that he would forsake me again  From his past conduct I dreaded what  might happen  and the remembrance of what I had undergone by his  inconstancy  filled my imagination with such horror  that I could not  endure the shocking prospect  and prematurely plunged myself into the  danger  rather than endure the terrors of expectation  I remembered  that his former attachment began in the season of my prosperity  when  my fortune was in the zenith  and my youth in its prime  and that he had    6 22 15  3 45 PM   forsaken me in the day of trouble when my life became embarrassed  and  my circumstances were on the decline  I foresaw nothing but continual  persecution from my husband  and feared  that  once the keener  transports of our reconciliation should be over  his affection would  sink under the severity of its trial  In consequence of this desertion   I received a letter from him  acknowledging that he was rightly served   but that my retreat gave him inexpressible concern    Meanwhile Lord    continued to act in the character of a fiend   tormenting me with his nauseous importunities  He prevailed upon the  duke of L   to employ his influence in persuading me to live with him   assuring his grace  that I had actually promised to give him that proof  of my obedience  and that I would come home the sooner for being pressed  to compliance by a person of his rank and character  Induced by these  representations  the duke honoured me with a visit  and  in the course  of his exhortations  I understood how he had been thus misinformed  Upon  which I sent for Lord     and  in his presence  convicted him of the  falsehood  by communicating to his grace the articles of our last  agreement  which he did not think proper to deny  and the duke  being  undeceived  declared  that he would not have given me the trouble of  vindicating myself  had he not been misled by the insincerity of my  lord    Baffled in this attempt  he engaged Mr  H   V    and afterwards my  own father  in the same task  and though I still adhered to my first  resolution  persisted with such obstinacy in his endeavours to make me  unhappy  that I determined to leave the kingdom  Accordingly  after  I had spent the evening with him at Ranelagh  I went away about two  o clock in the morning  leaving my companion  with directions to restore  to my lord his house  furniture  plate  and everything he had given me  since our last accommodation  so far was I  upon this occasion  or at  any other time of my life  from embezzling any part of his fortune  My  friend followed my instructions most punctually  and his lordship knows  and will acknowledge the truth of this assertion    Thus have I explained the true cause of my first expedition to  Flanders  whither the world was good natured enough to say  I followed  Mr  B   and the whole army  which happened to be sent abroad that  summer  Before my departure  I likewise transmitted to Lord B   the  dressing plate  china  and a very considerable settlement  of which he  had been generous enough to make me a present  This was an instance of  my integrity  which I thought due to a man who had laid me under great  obligations  and though I lived to be refused a small sum both by him  and S    I do not repent of my disinterested behaviour  all the revenge  I harbour against the last of these lovers  is the desire of having it  in my power to do him good    I now found myself adrift in the world again  and very richly deserved  the hardships of my condition  for my indiscretion in leaving Lord B     and in trusting to the word of Lord    without some further security   but I have dearly paid for my imprudence  The more I saw into the  character of this man  whom destiny hath appointed my scourge  the more  was I determined to avoid his fellowship and communication  for he and  I are  in point of disposition  as opposite as any two principles in  nature  In the first place  he is one of the most unsocial
