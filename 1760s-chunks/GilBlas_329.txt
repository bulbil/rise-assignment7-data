with my old master  and being closeted with him  Sir  said I  allow me to throw myself at your feet  and to implore your pity  In pathetic accord with my moving accents  I prostrated myself before him  with my face all bathed in tears  The merchant  surprised at what he saw and heard  asked the cause of my distress  Remorse of conscience and repentance  answered I  but neither repentance nor remorse can ever wash out my guilt  I have been weak enough to give ear to your son  and to be his accomplice in robbing you  To this confession I added a sincere acknowledgment of all that had happened  with the particulars of my late conversation with Gaspard  whose design I laid open without the least reserve   Bad as was the opinion which old Velasquez entertained of his son  he could scarcely believe his ears  Nevertheless  finding no good reason to distrust the truth of my account  Scipio  said he  raising me from the ground  where I had till now been prostrate at his feet  I forgive you in consideration of the important notice you have communicated  Gaspard  pursued he  raising his voice up to the loudness of anguish  does Gaspard aim a blow at my life  Ah l ungrateful son  unnatural monster  better thou hadst never been born  or stifled at thy birth  than to have been reared for the destruction of thy father  What plea  what object  what palliation of the atrocious deed  I furnished thee annually with a reasonable allowance for thy pleasures  and what wouldst thou have more  Must I have drained my fortune to the dregs to support thee in thy extravagance  Having vented his feelings in this bitter apostrophe  he enjoined secrecy on me  and told me to leave him alone  while be considered how to act in so delicate a conjuncture   I was very anxious to know what resolution this unhappy father would take  when on that very day he sent for Gaspard  and addressed hint thus without betraying the inward emotions of his heart  My so  I have received a letter from Merida  purporting that if you are disposed to marry  you may make a match with a very fine girl of fifteen  with a handsome fortune in her pocket  If you have not forsworn that happy and holy estate  we will set out to morrow morning by daybreak for Merida  you will see the lady in question  and if she hits your fancy  the business may soon be settled  Gaspard  pricking up his ears at a handsome fortune  and already fingering the cash by anticipation  answered unhesitatingly that he was ready to undertake the journey  and accordingly they departed the following day at sun rise  without attendants  mounted on good mules   Having reached the mountains of Fesira  in a delightful spot for the operations of banditti  but terror stirring to the timid souls of travellers  Balthasar dismounted  and desired his son to do likewise  The young man obeyed  but expressed his surprise at such a requisition  in so lonely a place  I will tell you the reason presently  answered the old man  darting at him a look of mingled grief and anger  We are not going to Merida  and the alleged courtship was only an invention of mine  for the purpose of drawing you hither  I am not ignorant  ungrateful and unnatural son  I am not uninformed of your meditated crime  I am aware that a poison  prepared by your hands  was to have been administered to me  but  mad as you are  could it enter into your contemplation that my life could have been invaded with impunity by such means  How fatally mistaken  Your crime would soon have been detected  and you would have perished under the hands of the executioner  There is a safer way of glutting your fell malice  without exposing yourself to an ignominious death  we are here without witnesses  and in a place where daily murders are perpetrated  since you are so thirsty after my blood  plunge your dagger into my bosom  the assassination will naturally be laid at the door of some banditti  After these words  Balthasar  laying his breast bare  and pointing to his heart  ended with this challenge  Here  Gaspard  strike deep enough  strike home  make me pay that forfeit for having engendered such a disgrace to human nature  and no more than what is due to so monstrous a production   Young Velasquez  struck by this reproach as by a thunderbolt  far from pleading in his own justification  fell instantly lifeless at his father s feet  The good old man  hailing the germ of repentance in this unfeigned testimony of shame  could not help yielding to paternal weakness  he made all possible haste to give his assistance  but Gaspard had no sooner recovered the use of his senses  than unable to stand in the presence of a father so justly offended  he made an effort to raise himself from the ground  then sprang upon his mule  and galloped out of sight without saying one word  Balthasar suffered him to take his own course  and returned to Cordova  little doubting but conscience would play its part in revenging his wrongs  Six months
