of the Chinese language  which was sometimes used at court  In his youth  he freely conversed with women  but  as he advanced in age  he placed his chief felicity in the delights of the table  He hired cooks from China at an enormous expence  and drank huge quantities of the strong liquor distilled from rice  which  by producing repeated intoxication  had an unlucky effect upon his brain  that was naturally of a loose flimsy texture  The immoderate use of this potation was likewise said to have greatly impaired his retentive faculty  inasmuch as he was subject upon every    27 extraordinary emotion of spirit  to an involuntary discharge from the last of the intestines   Such was the character of Fika kaka  entitled by his birth to a prodigious estate  as well as to the honours of Quanbuku  the first hereditary dignity in the empire  In consequence of his high station  he was connected with all the great men in Japan  and used to the court from his infancy  Here it was he became acquainted with young Got hama baba  his future sovereign  and their souls being congenial  they soon contracted an intimacy  which endured for life  They were like twin particles of matter  which having been divorced from one another by a most violent shock  had floated many thousand years in the ocean of the universe  till at length meeting by accident  and approaching within the spheres of each other s attraction  they rush together with an    28 eager embrace  and continue united ever after   The favour of the sovereign  added to the natural influence arising from a vast fortune and great alliances  did not fail to elevate Fika kaka to the most eminent offices of the state  until  at length  he attained to the dignity of Cuboy  or chief minister  which virtually comprehends all the rest  Here then was the strangest phaenomenon that ever appeared in the political world  A statesman without capacity  or the smallest tincture of human learning  a secretary who could not write  a financier who did not understand the multiplication table  and the treasurer of a vast empire  who never could balance accounts with his own butler   He was no sooner  for the diversion of the Gods  promoted to the Cuboyship  than his vanity was pampered with all sorts of adulation  He was    29 in magnificence extolled above the first Meckaddo  or line of emperors  to whom divine honours had been paid  equal in wisdom to Tensio dai sin  the first founder of the Japanese monarchy  braver than Whey vang  of the dynasty of Chew  more learned than Jacko  the chief pontiff of Japan  more liberal than Shi wang ti  who was possessed of the universal medicine  and more religious than Bupo  alias Kobot  who  from a foreign country  brought with him  on a white horse  a book called Kio  containing the mysteries of his religion   But  by none was he more cultivated than by the Bonzas or clergy  especially those of the university Frenoxena   so renowned for their learning  sermons  and oratory  who actually chose him their supreme director  and every morning adored him with a very singular rite of worship  This attachment was the more remarkable  as    30 Fika kaha was known to favour the sect of Nem buds ju  who distinguished themselves by the ceremony of circumcision  Some malicious people did not scruple to whisper about  that he himself had privately undergone the operation  but these  to my certain knowledge  were the suggestions of falshood and slander  A slight scarification  indeed  it was once necessary to make  on account of his health  but this was no ceremony of any religious worship  The truth was this  The Nem buds ju  being few in number  and generally hated by the whole nation  had recourse to the protection of Fika kaka  which they obtained for a valuable consideration  Then a law was promulgated in their favour  a step which was so far from exciting the jealousy of the Bonzas  that there was not above three  out of one hundred and fifty nine thousand  that opened their lips in disapprobation of the measure  Such were the virtue    31 and moderation of the Bonzas  and so loth were they to disoblige their great director Fika kaka   What rendered the knot of connection between the Dairo Got hama baba  and this Cuboy altogether indissoluble  was a singular circumstance  which I shall now explain  Fika kika not only devoted himself intirely to the gratification of his master s prejudices and rapacity  even when they interfered the most with the interest and reputation of Japan  but he also submitted personally to his capricious humours with the most placid resignation  He presented his posteriors to be kicked as regularly as the day revolved  and presented them not barely with submission  but with all the appearance of fond desire  and truly this diurnal exposure was attended with such delectation as he never enjoyed in any other attitude      32 To explain this matter  I must tell thee  Peacock  that Fika kaka was from his infancy afflicted with an itching of the podex  which the learned Dr  Woodward would have termed immanis〈 in
