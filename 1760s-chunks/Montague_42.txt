mistress  and who is therefore determined to think for herself       She has refused going to Montreal at all this winter  and has hinted  though not impolitely  that she wants no guardian of her conduct but herself  adding a compliment to my ladyship s discretion so very civil  it is impossible for me to repeat it with decency       O Heavens  your brother and Fitzgerald  I fly  The dear creatures  my life has been absolute vegetation since they absented themselves       Adieu  my dear   Your faithful  A  FERMOR     LETTER LVI   56   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Jan  24   WE have the same parties and amusements we used to have  my dear  but there is by no means the same spirit in them  constraint and dullness seem to have taken the place of that sweet vivacity and confidence which made our little society so pleasing  this odious man has infected us all  he seems rather a spy on our pleasures than a partaker of them  he is more an antidote to joy than a tall maiden aunt       I wish he would go  I say spontaneously every time I see him  without considering I am impolite   La  Sir George  when do you go to Montreal   He reddens  and gives me a peevish answer  and I then  and not before  recollect how very impertinent the question is       But pray  my dear  because he has no taste for social companionable life  has he therefore a right to damp the spirit of it in those that have  I intend to consult some learned casuist on this head       He takes amazing pains to please in his way  is curled  powdered  perfumed  and exhibits every day in a new suit of embroidery  but with all this  has the mortification to see your brother please more in a plain coat  I am lazy  Adieu   Yours  ever and ever   A  FERMOR     LETTER LVII   57   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Jan  25   SO you intend  my dear Jack  to marry when you are quite tired of a life of gallantry  the lady will be much obliged to you for a heart  the refuse of half the prostitutes in town  a heart  the best feelings of which will be entirely obliterated  a heart hardened by a long commerce with the most unworthy of the sex  and which will bring disgust  suspicion  coldness  and depravity of taste  to the bosom of sensibility and innocence       For my own part  though fond of women to the greatest degree  I have had  considering my profession and complexion  very few intrigues  I have always had an idea I should some time or other marry  and have been unwilling to bring to a state in which I hoped for happiness from mutual affection  a heart worn out by a course of gallantries  to a contrary conduct is owing most of our unhappy marriages  the woman brings with her all her stock of tenderness  truth  and affection  the man s is exhausted before they meet  she finds the generous delicate tenderness of her soul  not only unreturned  but unobserved  she fancies some other woman the object of his affection  she is unhappy  she pines in secret  he observes her discontent  accuses her of caprice  and her portion is wretchedness for life       If I did not ardently wish your happiness  I should not thus repeatedly combat a prejudice  which  as you have sensibility  will infallibly make the greater part of your life a scene of insipidity and regret       You are right  Jack  as to the savages  the only way to civilize them is to feminize their women  but the task is rather difficult  at present their manners differ in nothing from those of the men  they even add to the ferocity of the latter       You desire to know the state of my heart  excuse me  Jack  you know nothing of love  and we who do  never disclose it s mysteries to the prophane  besides  I always chuse a female for the confidante of my sentiments  I hate even to speak of love to one of my own sex       Adieu  I am going a party with half a dozen ladies  and have not another minute to spare   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER LVIII   58   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Jan  28   I EVERY hour  my dear  grow more in love with French manners  there is something charming in being young and sprightly all one s life  it would appear absurd in England to hear  what I have just heard  a fat virtuous lady of seventy toast Love and Opportunity to a young fellow  but  tis nothing here  they dance too to the last gasp  I have seen the daughter  mother  and grand daughter  in the same French country dance       They are perfectly right  and I honor them for their
