not an Instance of a particular Attachment  Men get their Pictures drawn  bequeath Fortunes to Strangers  nay  raise Obelisks to bear their Names  but this is natural Vanity  not natural Affection   If either Parent was affected with this Impulse  let us naturally suspect the Mother most  as the Child is more immediately Part of herself  her Affections softer  and her Understanding weaker  and yet how little does Providence seem inclined to trust to this natural Instinct  by furnishing her with proper Nourishment for the Child  and making it turn to Pain and Distemper  if not that Way applied  or otherwise carried off  by Methods of like Operation   Adeiu   LETTER CXXXIII  HENRY to FRANCES   Thursday Evening   I HAD a fine Day hither  and am now stretching my Limbs before a good Fire  drinking your Health  and all your Healths  I find there is no Place  I enjoy myself so much in  as an Inn  I am there so intirely my own Master  so detached from the World  and disengaged both from Business  or the vain Pursuit of Pleasure  that I feel a certain contemplative Calmness in my Mind  which gives me a higher Satisfaction   257 than any of the active Spheres of Life can do  However I must interrupt this Soliloquy  to go and take Care of poor George  who fell with his Horse  within a Mile of this Town  and is much bruised  he had a very narrow Escape of his Life   My sincere Regards to Kitty  I am  my dearest Fanny   Your s as before   LETTER CXXXIV   Dear FANNY   I HAD the Satisfaction  when I came home  of finding every Thing here safe from the Storm  tho  the whole Country round me has suffered infinite Damage of House tops  Ricks of Hay and Stacks of Corn carried off  and Trees torn up by the Roots —while I have forfeited but a few Slates  and some of the Branches of my Elms dishevelled  There is one Piece of Damage  I just heard of  which will give you some Concern  that above 200 of the fine Trees in Windsor Forest are snapped short to the Stumps   As I have no Letter from you to answer  and have not been long enough in the Country to meet with any entertaining Circumstances to send you  the only Amusement I can give you  is from what I read  and as I am in Montaigne  which is also your Study  at present  I shall occasionally   258 give you Hints of what I find remarkable in that vague  diffuse  witty  and sensible Author   In his Chapter stiled Pedantry  I was pleased to find him speak a great deal upon a Subject  you may remember  I am very fond of  which is  the Distinction between Learning and Wisdom  What I have to say on that Head you have heard  what he says upon it I refer you to  and shall only quote one Passage  because it is whimsical  and somewhat in your Manner   He one Day was at a Loss for accounting how several Men  of the greatest Learning among his Acquaintance  were very silly  weak Persons  Upon which  a lively Woman in Company said    That in order to make Room for other Men s Sense  their own must be squeezed up into so narrow a Compass  as will not leave it a Power of exerting itself   To which I shall only add this Remark of my own  by Way of Illustration  That the Understanding  like a Nation  should always depend upon its own proper Force  for Auxiliaries too often make Slaves of those they were called upon to assist  In short  it is owing to this servile Obedience  and blind Deference we pay to the Antients  joined to an indolent Despair of excelling such great Patterns  which has almost put a Period to the Advancement of Science  or Wisdom  so that all the Knowledge of the Moderns is but the Learning of the Antients  Insomuch that    259 if you propose a Subject in natural or moral Philosophy  to be discussed by any of the present Adepts in Art or Science  instead of pressing forward into a Disquisition of the yet inexhausted Fund of human Reason  they will poorly recur to what Archimedes  Plato  or Seneca  said upon such Matters  Here take a Quotation  by way of Parody   Men should press forward in Truth s glorious Chace   They who look backward surely lose the Race     It has been Matter of Astonishment to these latter Ages of the World  how the great Genii of Antiquity  at Times when Learning and Science were in their Infancy  in general  nay some of them arose in Nations confessedly barbarous  could shine forth with such amazing Lustre  which  far from attributing to their own natural Force  they have poorly called in the Aid of Inspiration  to account for  What a mean and stupid Exposition is this of such extraordinary Phaenomena  when the true Reasons lie hid in the very Causes of their Admiration  The Mind of Man  naturally active and inquisitous after Truth  not finding wherewithal to satisfy its
