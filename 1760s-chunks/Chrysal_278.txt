master  as he shook them by the hand    Here is a   good conclusion to the campaign to us  I was impatient for your   coming  to know how I should go on  Here have been several   officers with me already  for credit on the score of their prize money   for the length of the siege  and the dearness of everything  has not   left them a penny  nor anything to pawn for one  I have got as   many clothes and things of all kinds  as would serve to set up a   Monmouth Street merchant  If the place had held out but a few   days longer  the poor devils must have done duty in their buff    H i   ha   ha           And the properest dress for them    retm ned the admiral      Who wants any clothes in such a climate as this   I am sure I   go naked half my time  though I keep under cover  and have nothing   to do to heat me          Very true    answered my master    But naked and hungry   both are not quite so well   and when their moveables were all   gone after their money  I don t know who would have supplied   them          Then let them live on their allowance    said the general    They   who can t afford to pay for better should be content with that          To die upon it  you should say    iaterrupted my master    I   am sure the stores laid in are such as no one can live upon  that has   ever luiown what living was  For my part  I wonder the contractors   were not ashamed to supply such wretched stuff of all kinds  They   must have no conscience at all who can do such things          Conscience 7 Ha   ha   ha   Who ever heard a sutler speak   of conscience before     said the admiral    And pray  my con    scientious friend  what do you charge a bottle for this most excellent   wine of yours             ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 325       For this wine     answered my master  palating it two or three   times    I charge for this wine only a pistole   and  let me tell   you that it is not so much  considering everything  This Burgundy   cost me five shillings a bottle  prime cost  and  when you compute   every expense  you ll find that my profit is nothing at all in com    parison of what others get          No  to be sure    replied the general    Your conscience won t   suffer you to do as they do   you are too good a man          Too good a Christian  you should say    interrupted the admiral      as appears by your baptising your wine so piously  Ha   ha   ha     Pray  what did the water cost that is mixed with this same Bur    gundy   I hope that did not stand you in five shillings a bottle   too  Ha   ha   ha           It is very well  gentlemen    returned my master  with a sneer      You are pleased to be merry  But if I had not some way to make   out matters  I could never pay the exorbitant taxes which are   squeezed from me by some people whom I shan t name  And so    here s my service to you both once more  When you lower your   composition  I ll lessen the quantity of water  and mend mine    Ha   ha   ha           And so you had need    said the general    to make it drinkable     as it is  I wonder it does not poison every one that tastes it  When   I lived at the Shakespeare  we did not give worse than this to our   company after they were dead drunk          Worse than this     added the admiral    If you had given me   half so bad  I should have broken your head with the bottle          Broken my head     returned the general    fine words  truly    When you were a
