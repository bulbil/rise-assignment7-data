my inward emotion deprived   me of sensation  and I swooned away      When I revived  I cast a look about me  and perceived that their   grief had been as extreme as their joy was at my arrival  Ah    my Peggy   I cried  how have I undone you   By you I got all   my possessions  and  in return  I have deprived you of all that you   possessed  You were every blessing to me  and I have repaid you   with nothing but misery and ruin      Do not be concerned  my love  said she  nor repine at the conse    quences of your own goodness and honesty  You are not as God   to see into all hearts   the wisest may be deceived   and the best    as I believe  are the most subject to be imposed upon  Common   charity must have supposed that there could not be such a soul as   Sir Freestone upon earth  But be of good courage  my husband    I have good news for you  I dreamed that our dear father   appeared to me last night  Do not be disheartened  my child  says   he   bear the cross that is laid upon you with a cheerful and free   will  and all shall be restored to you sevenfold upon earth  and   seventy seven fold in the life that has no ending      When I found that my Peggy  instead of distaste and upbraiding    had nothing but love in her looks  and consolation in her ex    pressions  I folded her to my bosom  and to my soul that went to   meet her  and I would willingly have made her one with my own   being      My neighbours were not as birds of the season   they neither   despised nor forsook me because of my poverty  They came   crowding to condole with me   they advised me to apply to the   law against Sir Freestone and attorney Snack   and they offered to   contribute towards my journey  They also joined in this written   testimony of my character  and prosperous circumstances  before   Snack made his seizure   and two of them have witnessed  in this   bit of paper  that when the alarm came of Mr  Kindly s death  and   of a strange agent being put in his room  they heard me say that I   did not matter the worst he could do  and saw me count down   twenty pieces over and above my year s rent      The late frights and fatigues which Peggy underwent during   Snack s operations  together with her extremes of joy on my   return  and of grief at the fit into which I had fallen  hastened   on her labour  and she was delivered before her time of that   weakly little babe whom I buried this morning      Within six weeks after her childbirth we prepared for our   journey  Our neighbours  like the good Samaritan  had com    passion upon him who fell among the thieves  They made me up   a purse of thirty five pounds  and promised to contribute further   toward the carrying on of my suit          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  295     We travelled happily  by easy journeys of a few miles a day  till    nine days ago  we reached a small village the other side of St    Alban s   there we took up our rest for the night at a house that   had no sign  but let occasional lodgings  and sold bread and small   beer      As I desired a separate apartment for ourselves  we were put   into a kind of waste room  that had no fastening to the door except   a latch  After a slender supper we lay down to sleep  and I stuffed   my breeches close under my head with all possible caution  We   had made an extraordinary journey that day  and I was par    ticularly fatigued by carrying several of my tired children succes    sively in my arms  so that we all slept but too soundly   and  when   I awoke in the morning  neither money nor breeches were to be   found      Such a loss  at another time  would have been as nothing to me     but  in our present circumstances  it was a repetition and doubling   of all that we had lost before  I instantly summoned the people   of the house  and in a good deal of warmth charged our landlord   with the felony  telling him that I had been robbed of above thirty    three pounds   Why  master  says he  I know nothing to the con
