sensible how much the farm lay at his mercy  then proposed  that Got hama baba should renounce his subsidiary treaty with the Mantchoux  pay a yearly tribute to him Brut an tiffi  in consideration of his forbearing to seize the farm  and maintain    113 an army to protect it on the other side from the irruptions of the Chinese   Got hama baba  alarmed at this declaration  began by his emissaries to sound the inclinations of his Japonese subjects touching a continental war  for the preservation of the farm  but he found them totally averse to this wise system of politicks  Taycho  in particular  began to bawl and bellow among the mob  upon the absurdity of attempting to defend a remote cabin  which was not defensible  upon the iniquity of ruining a mighty empire  for the sake of preserving a few barren acres  a naked common  a poor  pitiful  pelting farm  the interest of which  like Aaron s rod  had already  on many occasions  swallowed up all regard and consideration for the advantage of Japan  He inveighed against the shameful and senseless partiality of Got hama baba  he mingled menaces with his    114 representations  He expatiated on the folly and pernicious tendency of a continental war  he enlarged upon the independence of Japan  secure in her insular situation  He declared  that not a man should be sent to the continent  nor a subsidy granted to any greedy  mercenary  freebooting Tartar  and threatened  that if any corrupt minister should dare to form such a connexion  he would hang it about his neck  like a millstone  to sink him to perdition  The bellows of Taycho s oratory blew up such a flame in the nation  that the Cuboy and all his partizans were afraid to whisper one syllable about the farm   Mean while Brut an tiffi  in order to quicken their determinations  withdrew the garrison he had in a town on the frontiers of China  and it was immediately occupied by the Chinese  an army of whom poured in like a deluge through this opening upon the lands adjoining to the farm     115 Got hama baba was now seized with a sit of temporary distraction  He foamed and raved  and cursed and swore in the Tartarian language  he declared he would challenge Brut an tiffi to single combat  He not only kicked  but also cuffed the whole council of Twenty Eight  and played at foot ball with his imperial tiara  Fika kaka was dumb founded  Sti phi rum poo muttered something about a commission of lunacy  Nin kom poo po pronounced the words flat bottomed junks  but his teeth chattered so much  that his meaning could not be understood  The Fatzman offered to cross the sea and put himself at the head of a body of light horse  to observe the motions of the enemy  and Gotto mio prayed fervently within himself  that God Almighty would be pleased to annihilate that accursed farm  which had been productive of such mischief to Japan  Nay  he even ventured to    116 exclaim     Would to God  the farm was sunk in the middle of the Tartarian ocean     Heaven forbid   cried the president Soo san sin o  for in that case  Japan must be at the expence of weighing it up again      In the midst of this perplexity  they were suddenly surprised at the apparition of Taycho s head nodding from a window that overlooked their deliberations  At sight of this horrid spectacle the council broke up  The Dairo fled to the inmost recesses of the palace  and all his counsellors vanished  except the unfortunate Fi ka kaka  whose fear had rendered him incapable of any sort of motion but one  and that he instantly had to a very efficacious degree  Taycho bolting in at the window  advanced to the Cuboy without ceremony  and accosted him in these words     It depends upon the Cuboy  whether Taycho continues to oppose his measures  or becomes his    117 most obsequious servant  Arise  illustrious Quanbuku  and cast your eyes upon the steps by which I ascended    Accordingly Fika kaka looked  and saw a multitude of people who had accompanied their orator into the court of the palace  and raised for him an occasional stair of various implements  The first step was made by an old fig box  the second by a nightman s bucket  the third by a cask of hempseed  the fourth by a tar barrel  the fifth by an empty kilderkin  the sixth by a keg  the seventh by a bag of soot  the eighth by a fishwoman s basket  the ninth by a rotten pack saddle  and the tenth by a block of hard wood from the island of Fatsissio  It was supported on one side by a varnished lettered post  and on the other by a crazy hogshead  The artificers who erected this climax  and now exulted over it with hideous clamour  consisted of grocers  scavengers  halter makers     118 carpenters  draymen  distillers  chimney sweepers  oyster women  ass drivers  aldermen  and dealers in waste paper —To make myself understood  I am obliged  Peacock  to make use of those
