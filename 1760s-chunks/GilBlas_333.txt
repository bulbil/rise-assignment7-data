would doubtless have laid me under the necessity of drawing bills of accommodation on the family bank  but happily love stepped in  and saved the credit both of the bank and of my principles  One day  passing along near the church of the Epiphany  I espied through a lattice with the drapery drawn up  a young girl who might well be called a thing divine  for nothing natural was ever seen so lovely  I would lay on my compliment still thicker  if words were not wanting to express the effect of her first appearance upon my mind  I set my wits to work  and by dint of diligent inquiry  learned that her name was Beatrice  and that she was waiting maid to Donna Julia  younger daughter of the Count de Polan   Beatrice broke in upon the thread of Scipio s story by laughing immoderately  then  directing her speech to my wife  Charming Antonia  said she  do but just look at me  I beseech you  and then say truly  whether I could be likened to a thing divine  You might at that time  to my enamoured sight  said Scipio  and  since your conjugal faith is no longer under a cloud  my visual appetite increases by what it feeds on  It was a pretty compliment  and my secretary  having fired it off  pursued his narrative as follows   This intelligence kindled the flame of passion within me  but not  it must be confessed  a flame which could be acknowledged without a blush  I took it for granted that my triumph over her scruples would be easy if my biddings were high enough to command the ordinary market of female chastity  but Beatrice was a pearl beyond price  In vain did I solicit her  through the channel of some intriguing gossips  with the offer of my purse and of my most tender attentions  she rejected all my proposals with disdain  I had recourse to the lover s last remedy  and offered her my hand  which she deigned to accept on the strength of my being secretary and treasurer to Don Manriquez  As it seemed expedient to keep our marriage secret for some time  the ceremony was performed privately  in presence of Dame Lorenza Sephora  Seraphina s governess  and before some others of the Count de Polan s household  After our happy union  Beatrice contrived the means of our meeting by day  and passing some part of every night together in the garden  whither I repaired through a little gate of which she gave me a key  Never were man and wife better pleased with each other than Beatrice and myself  with equal impatience did we watch for the hour of our appointment  with congenial emotions of eager sensibility did we hasten to the spot  and the moments which we passed together  though countless from their number in the calendar of cold indifference  to us were few and fleeting  in comparison with that eternity of mutual bliss for which we panted   One night  a night which should be expunged from the almanac  a night of darkness and despair  contrasted with the brightness of all our former nights  I was surprised on approaching the garden  to find the little gate open  This unusual circumstance alarmed me  for it seemed to augur something inauspicious to my happiness  I turned pale and trembled  as if with a foreknowledge of what was going to happen  Advancing in the dark towards a bower  where our private meetings had usually taken place  I heard a man s voice  I stopped on the instant to listen  when the following words struck like the sound of death upon my ear  Do not keep me languishing in suspense  my dear Beatrice  make my happiness complete  and consider that your own fortunes are closely connected with mine  Instead of having patience to hear further  it seemed as if more had been said than blood could expiate  that devil  jealousy  took possession of my soul  I drew my sword  and breathing only vengeance  rushed into the bower  Ah  base seducer  cried I  whoever you are  you shall tear this heart from out my breast  rather than touch my honour on its tenderest point  With these words on my lips  I attacked the gentleman who was talking with Beatrice  He stood upon his guard without more ado  like a man much better acquainted with the science of arms than myself  who had only received a few lessons from a fencing master at Cordova  And yet  strong as his sword  arm was  I made a thrust which he could not parry  or what is more likely  his foot slipped  I saw him fall  and fancying that I had wounded him mortally  ran away as hard as my legs could carry me  without deigning to answer Beatrice  who would have called me back   Yes  indeed  said Scipio s wife  resolved to have her share in the development of the story  I called out for the purpose of undeceiving him  The gentleman conversing with me in the arbour was Don Ferdinand de Leyva  This nobleman  who was in love with my mistress Julia  had laid a plan for running away with her  from despair of being able to obtain her hand by any other means
