characterized the first as old rooks  and the last as bubbles  and advised me to try my fortune at the silver table by betting a crown at a time —Before I would venture any thing  I considered the company more particularly  and there appeared such a groupe of villainous faces  that I was struck with horror and astonishment at the sight  I signified my surprize to Banter  who whispered in my ear  that the bulk of those present were composed of sharpers  highwaymen  and apprentices  who having embezzled their master s cash  made a desperate push in this place  to make up their deficiencies —This account did not encourage me to hazard any part of my small pittance  but at length being teized by the importunities of my friend  who assured me there was no danger of being ill used  people being hired by the owner to see justice done to every body  I began by risquing one shilling  and in less than an hour  my winning amounted to thirty —Convinced by this time of the fairness of the game  and animated with success  there was no need of further persuasion to continue the play  I lent Banter  who seldom had any money in his pocket  a guinea  which he carried to the gold table and lost in a moment —He would have borrowed another  but finding me deaf to his arguments  went away in a pet —Mean while my gain advanced to six pieces  and my desire of more increased   175 in proportion  so that I moved to the higher table  where I laid half a guinea on every throw  and fortune still favouring me  I became a sitter  in which capacity I remained until it was broad day  when I found myself  after many vicissitudes  one hundred and fifty guineas in pocket     Thinking it now high time to retire with my booty  I asked if any body would take my place  and made a motion to rise  upon which an old gascon  who sat opposite to me  and of whom I had won a little money  started up with fury in his looks  crying     Restez foutre  restez  il faut donner moi mon ravanchio    At the same time  a Jew who sat near the other  insinuated that I was more beholden to art than fortune  for what I had got  that he had observed me wipe the table very often  and that some of the divisions seemed to be greasy  This intimation produced a great deal of clamour against me  especially among the losers  who threatned with many oaths and imprecations to take me up by a warrant as a a sharper  unless I would compromise the affair by refunding the greatest part of my winning —Though I was far from being easy under this accusation  I relied upon my innocence  threatned in my turn to prosecute the Jew for defamation  and boldly offered to submit my cause to the examination of any justice in Westminster  but they knew themselves too well to put their characters on that issue  and finding I was not to be intimidated into any concession  dropt their plea  and made way for me to withdraw —I would not however  stir from the table until the Israelite had retracted what he said to my disadvantage  and asked pardon before the whole assembly       176 As I marched out with my prize  I happened to tread upon the toes of a tall raw boned fellow  with a hooked nose  fierce eyes  black thick eyebrows  a pig tail wig of the same colour  and a formidable hat pulled over his forehead  who stood gnawing his fingers in the crowd  and no sooner felt the application of my shoe heel  than he roared out in a tremendous voice     Blood and wounds  you son of a whore  what s that for  —  I asked pardon with a great deal of submission  and protested I had no intention of hurting him  but the more I humbled myself the more he stormed  and insisted upon gentlemany satisfaction  at the same time provoking me with scandalous names that I could not put up with  so that I gave a loose to my passion  returned his Billingsgate  and challenged him to follow me down to the piazzas —His indignation cooling as mine warmed  he refused my invitation  saying  he would chuse his own time  and returned towards the table muttering threats  which I neither dreaded nor distinctly heard  but descending with great deliberation  received my sword from the door keeper  whom I gratified with a guinea according to the custom of the place  and went home in a rapture of joy     My faithful valet  who had sat up all night in the utmost uneasiness on my account  let me in with his face beslubbered with tears  and followed me to my chamber  where he stood silent like a condemned criminal  in expectation of hearing that every shilling was spent —I guessed the situation of his thoughts  and assuming a sullen look  bid him fetch me some water to wash —He replied  without lifting his eyes from the ground     In my simple conjecture  you have   177 more occasion for rest  not having
