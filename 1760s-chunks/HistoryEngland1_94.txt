prevented the perpetration of her meditated cruelty  and Elizabeth was taken from a prison to be fixed upon a throne   Elizabeth had made the proper use of her confinement  being debarred the enjoyment of pleasures abroad  she sought for knowledge at home  she cultivated her understanding  learned the languages and sciences  but  of all the arts in which she excelled  her arts of keeping fair with her sister  of not offending the Papists  of being in esteem with the Protestants  of dissembling and learning to reign  were the greatest   This virgin Monarch  whose memory England still reveres with gratitude and respect  was scarce proclaimed Queen  when Philip of Spain  who had been married to Mary  but who ever testified an inclination for Elizabeth  sought her in marriage    276 What political motives Elizabeth might have against this match  is uncertain  but certain it is  she neither liked the person nor the religion of her admirer  she was willing at once to enjoy the pleasure of independance and the vanity of numerous solicitations   She had ever resolved upon reforming the church  even in the restraints of a prison  and  upon coming to the throne  she immediately set about that great design  The people were now almost wholly of the Protestant religion  the ill use the Papists had made of their power  in the last reign  had totally undone their cause  a religion  marked with cruelty  tyranny  and persecution  was not a religion for the people of England  She began  therefore  in imitation of the deceased Queen  to forbid all meddling with controversy in the pulpit  and all innovations of the established rites  except that the service should be performed in the vulgar tongue  till a parliament should determine the proper modes of worship  The parliament soon met  and the reformation was finished  and religion established in the manner we enjoy it at present   The opposition which was made to these religious establishments was but weak  a conference of nine doctors on each side was proposed and agreed to  they were to dispute publicly upon either side of the question  and it was resolved that the people should hold to that which came off with victory  Disputations of this kind are never attended with conviction to either party  so much is to be said on either side  and so wide is the field that both sides have to range in  that each generally loses his strength in vain preparations  and ineffectual prefacing  before he is properly said to begin the engagement  The conference  therefore  came   277 to nothing  the Papists declared  that it was not in their power to dispute a second time upon topics  in which they had gained a former victory under Queen Mary  and the Protestants attributed the caution to their fears  Of nine thousand four hundred beneficed clergymen  which were in the whole kingdom  only fourteen Bishops  twelve Arch deacons  fifteen heads of colleges  and about eighty of the parochial clergy  chose to quit their preferments rather than their religion  Thus England changed its belief in religion four times since Henry VIII  Strange  says a foreign writer  that a people  who are so resolute  should be guilty of so much inconstancy  That the same people  who this day publicly burnt heretics  should the next not only think them guiltless  but conform to their opinions   Elizabeth was now fixed upon a Protestant throne  while all the neighbouring nations were open or secret enemies  France  Scotland  Spain  the Pope  were all combined against her  Her subjects of Ireland were concealed enemies  and the Catholic party in England  though not so numerous as formerly  yet was not entirely suppressed  these were the dangers she had to fear  nor had she one friend to assist her upon an emergency  In this situation  therefore  she could hope for no other resource  but what proceeded from the affection of her own subjects  and the wisdom of her administration  To make herself beloved by the people  and  at the same time  feared by her courtiers  were the governing maxims of her conduct  She was frugal of the public treasury  and still more sparing in her rewards to her favourites  this at once kept the people in spirits  and kept the great too poor to shake off lawful subjection  She distributed   278 both rewards and punishments with impartiality  knew when to flatter and when to upbraid  could dissemble submission  but preserve her prerogative  in short  she seemed to have studied the people she was to govern  and often to have flattered their follies in order to secure their hearts   Her chief minister was Robert Dudley  son to the late Duke of Northumberland  whom the Queen seemed to regard from capricious motives  as he had neither abilities nor virtue  but  to make amends  the two favourites next in power were Bacon and Cecil  men of great capacity and infinite application  They regulated the finances  and directed the political measures that were followed with so much success   Mary Stewart  Queen of France and Scotland  gave the first alarm to this state of tranquility  by taking the title of Queen of England  and her cause was supported by
