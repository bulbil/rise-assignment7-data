rivals were intimidated  and indeed out shone  and after all  I began to fear that the dear creature had not   140 a heart to lose —At last  finding myself unable to support the expence of this amour much longer  I was determined to bring the matter to a crisis  and one evening  while we were tête a tête  complained of her indifference  described the tortures of suspence to a love sick mind  and pressed her to disclose her sentiments of matrimony and me  with such earnestness  that she could not with all her art  shift the subject  but was obliged to come to an eclaircissement —She let me know with a careless air  that she had no objection to my person  and if I could satisfy her mother in other particulars  I should not find her averse to the match  but she was resolved to do nothing in an affair of such moment ous concern  without the advice and consent of her parent —This was not a very agreeable declaration to me  whose aim had been to win her inclination first  and then secure my conquest by a private marriage  to which I flattered myself she would express no reluctance —That I might not  however  desert my cause before it was desperate  I waited on the mother  and with great formality demanded the daughter in marriage  The good lady  who was a very notable woman  behaved with great state and civility  thanked me for the honour I intended her family  and said  she did not doubt that I was in all respects qualified to make a woman happy  but it concerned her as a parent anxious about the welfare of her child  to enquire into the particulars of my fortune  and know what settlement I proposed to make  To this intimation  which would have utterly disconcerted me  if I had not expected it  I replied without hesitation  that though my   141 fortune was very small  I was a gentleman by birth and education  would maintain her daughter in the sphere of a gentlewoman  and settle her own dowry on her and her heirs for ever —This careful matron did not seem to relish my proposal  but observed with a demure countenance  that there was no necessity for settling that upon her child which was her own already  However  if I pleased  her lawyer should confer with mine upon the matter  and in the mean time  she desired I would favour her with the perusal of my rent roll —Notwithstanding the vexation I was under  I could scarce forbear laughing in her face  at the mention of my rentroll  which was  indeed  a severe piece of satire upon my pretensions  I frankly owned I had no landed estate  and told her  that I could not exactly specify the sum I was master of  until I had regulated my affairs  which were at present in some disorder  but that I would take an opportunity of satisfying her on that head very soon   It was not long before I took my leave  and returned to my lodgings in a very melancholy mood  persuaded that I had nothing more to expect from that quarter  I was confirmed in this opinion next day  when I went back with a view of explaining myself more fully to the old gentlewoman  and was told by the footman  that his ladies were not at home  although I had seen Melinda through the blinds of a parlour window  as I went up to the door  Incensed at this affront I quitted the door  without saying one word  and as I repassed the parlour  bowed to Miss  who still remained in the same situation    142 securely screened  as she thought  from my view   This disappointment gave me more uneasiness on Strap s account  than my own  for I was in no danger of dying for love of Melinda  on the contrary  the remembrance of my charming Narcissa  was a continual check upon my conscience  during the whole course of my addresses  and perhaps contributed to the bad success of my scheme  by controuling my raptures  and condemning my design   There was a necessity for acquainting my companion with every thing that happened to me  and I performed this piece of duty in an affected passion  swearing I would be his pack horse no longer  and desiring him to take the management of his affairs into his own hand  This finesse had the desired effect  for instead of grumbling over my miscarriage  Strap was frightened at the passion I feigned  and begged me for the love of God to be appeased  observing  that although we had suffered a great loss  it was not irreparable  and if fortune frowned to day  she might perhaps smile to morrow —I pretended to acquiesce in his remarks  praise his equanimity  and promise to improve by misfortune —He  on the other hand  pretended to be perfectly well satisfied with my conduct  and conjured me to follow the dictates of my own reflection  but in spite of all his affectation  I could perceive his inward affliction  and his visage sensibly increased in longitude from that day     143  CHAP  L    I long to be revenged on Melinda—apply to Banter for his assistance—he contrives a scheme
