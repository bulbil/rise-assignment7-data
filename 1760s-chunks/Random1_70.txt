abhorrence  that in the morning  perceiving my aversion  he insinuated there was still a possibility of Lothario s recovery  it was true  be left him wounded on the ground  but not quite dead  and perhaps his hurts might not be mortal —At these words I started up  bid him fly for intelligence  and if he could not bring me tidings of Lothario s safety  at least consult his own and never return  for I was resolved to surrender myself to justice  and declare all that I knew of the affair  that  if possible  I might expiate my own guilt  by incurring the rigours of a sincere repentance and ignominious death —He very coolly represented the unreasonableness of my prejudice against him  who had done nothing but what his love of me inspired  and honour justified —that now he had at the risk of his life  been subservient to my revenge  I was about to discard him as an infamous agent occasionally necessary  and that even if he should be so lucky as to bring news of Lothario s safety  it was probable my former resentment might revive  and I would upbraid him with having failed in his undertaking —I assured him that  on the contrary  he would be dearer to me than ever  as I should be convinced he acted more on the principles of a man of honour  than on those of a mercenary assassin  and scorned to take away the life of an adversary  how inveterate soever  which fortune had put in his power —   Well then  madam   said he  whatever may have happened  I shall find it no difficult matter   197 to satisfy you in that  —  And took his leave  in order to enquire into the consequences of his duel —I was now more sensible than ever of the degrees of guilt and misery  all the affliction I had suffered hitherto was owing to my own credulity and weakness  and my conscience could only accuse me of venal crimes  but now that I looked upon myself as a murderer  it is impossible to express the terrors of my imagination  which was incessantly haunted by the image of the deceased  and my bosom stung with the most exquisite agonies  of which I saw no end —At length  Horatio  for so I shall call my keeper  returned  and telling me I had nothing to fear  delivered into my hands a billet containing these words     MADAM   AS I understand it is of consequence to your peace  I take this liberty to inform you  that the wounds I received from Horatio are not mortal  This satisfaction my humanity could not deny even to a person who has endeavoured to disturb the repose  as well destroy the life of  Lothario   Being well acquainted with his hand  I had no reason to suspect an imposition in this letter  which I read over and over with a transport of joy  and caressed Horatio so much  that he appeared the happiest men alive  Thus was I won from despair by the menaces of a greater misfortune   198 than that which depressed me —Griefs are like usurpers  the most powerful deposes all the rest—But my raptures were not lasting—that very letter which in a manner re established my tranquility  in a little time banished my peace —His unjust reproaches  while they waked my resentment  recalled my former happiness  and filled my soul with rage and sorrow —Horatio  perceiving the situation of my mind  endeavoured to divert my chagrin  by treating me with all the amusements and entertainments of the town  I was gratified with every indulgence I could desire  introduced into the company of other keptmistresles  by whom an uncommon deference was paid me  and I began to lose all remembrance of my former condition  when an accident brought it back to my view with all its interesting circumstances —Diverting myself one day with some news papers  which I had not before perused  the following advertisement attracted my attention      WHEREAS a young gentlewoman disappeared from her father s house  in the county of—  about the end of September  on account  as is supposed  of some uneasiness of mind  and has not been as yet heard of  whoever will give an information about her  to Mr —of Gray s Inn  shall be handsomely rewarded  or if she will return to the arms of her disconsolate parent  she will be received with the utmost tenderness  whatever reasons she may have to think otherwise  and may be the means of prolonging the life of a father  already weighed down almost to the grave with age and sorrow        199 This pathetic remonstrance had such an effect on me  that I was fully resolved to return like the prodigal son  and implore the forgiveness of him who gave me life  but alas  upon inquiry  I found he had paid his debt to nature a month before  lamenting my absence to his last hour  having left his fortune to a stranger as a mark of his resentment of my unkind and undutiful behaviour —Penetrated with remorse on this occasion  I sunk into the most profound melancholy  and considered myself as the immediate cause of his death —I lost all relish for company  and indeed most of my acquaintances no
