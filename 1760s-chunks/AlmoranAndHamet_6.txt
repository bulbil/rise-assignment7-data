an acknowledgement of superiority    he then thought of sending for HAMET to come to him  but this he feared   might provoke him  as implying a denial of his equality  at length he   determined to propose a meeting in the chamber of council  and was just   dispatching an officer with the message  when HAMET entered the   apartment       The countenance of HAMET was flushed with joy  and his heart was warmed   with the pleasing sensations of affection and confidence  by the same   letter  from which ALMORAN had extracted the bitterness of jealousy and   resentment  and as he had no idea that an act of courtesy to his brother   could derogate from his own dignity or importance  he indulged the   honest impatience of his heart to communicate the pleasure with which it   overflowed  he was  indeed  somewhat disappointed  to find no traces of   satisfaction in the countenance of ALMORAN  when he saw the same paper   in his hand  which had impressed so much upon his own       He waited some time after the first salutations  without mentioning the   scheme of government he was come to concert  because having observed   that ALMORAN was embarrassed and displeased  he expected that he would   communicate the cause  and pleased himself with the hope that he might   remove it  finding  however  that this expectation was disappointed  he   addressed him to this effect        How happy are we  my dear brother  in the wisdom and fidelity  of OMAR    how excellent is the system of government that he has proposed  how easy   and honourable will it be to us that govern  and how advantageous to the   people that obey         The advantages   said ALMORAN   which you seem to have discovered  are   not evident to me  tell me  then  what you imagine they are  and I will   afterwards give you my opinion         By establishing a system of laws as the rule of government   said   HAMET   many evils will be avoided  and many benefits procured  If the   law is the will only of the sovereign  it can never certainly be known   to the people  many  therefore  may violate that rule of right  which   the hand of the Almighty has written upon the living tablets of the   heart  in the presumptuous hope  that it will not subject them to   punishment  and those  by whom that rule is fulfilled  will not enjoy   that consciousness of security  which they would derive from the   protection of a prescribed law  which they have never broken  Neither   will those who are inclined to do evil  be equally restrained by the   fear of punishment  if neither the offence is ascertained  nor the   punishment prescribed  One motive to probity  therefore  will be   wanting  which ought to be supplied  as well for the sake of those who   may be tempted to offend  as of those who may suffer by the offence    Besides  he who governs not by a written and a public law  must either   administer that government in person  or by others  if in person  he   will sink under a labour which no man is able to sustain  and if by   others  the inferiority of their rank must subject them to temptations   which it cannot be hoped they will always resist  and to prejudices   which it will perhaps be impossible for them to surmount  But to   administer government by a law which ascertains the offence  and directs   the punishment  integrity alone will be sufficient  and as the   perversion of justice will in this case be notorious  and depend not   upon opinion but fact  it will seldom be practised  because it will be   easily punished        ALMORAN  who had heard the opinions of HAMET with impatience and scorn    now started from his feat with a proud and contemptuous aspect  he first   glanced his eyes upon his brother  and then looking disdainfully   downward  he threw back his robe  and stretching out his hand from him     Shall the son of Solyman   said he   upon whose will the fate of   nations was suspended  whose smiles and frowns were alone the criterions   of right and wrong  before whom the voice of wisdom itself was silent    and the pride even of virtue humbled in the dust  shall the son of   Solyman be harnessed  like a mule  in the trammels of law  shall he   become a mere instrument to execute what others have devised  shall he   only declare the determinations of a statute  and shall his ear be   affronted by claims of right  It is the glory
