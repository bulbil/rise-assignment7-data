their house   He was  in the first place  as well you know  the preserver of a beloved brother s life  and that brother afterwards owned  that had he followed his friendly advice  he never would have fallen into the danger from which he rescued him   My father and mother presented him to me  and bid me regard him as a fourth brother  and it was not immediately that I found out that I could have but three brothers   My brother s deliverer proved to be the most amiable and humane  and yet bravest of men     248 All my friends caressed him  Neither family forms  nor national forms  were stood upon  He had free access to us all  as one of us   My younger brother was continually hinting to me his wishes that I were his  Mr  Grandison was above all other reward  and my brother considered me in a kind light  as able to reward him   My confessor  by his fears and invectives  rather confirmed than lessened my esteem for a man whom I thought injured by them   His own respectful and disinterested behaviour to me contributed to my attachment  He always addressed me as his sister  when he put on the familiar friend  in the guise of a tutor  I could not therefore arm against a man I had no reason to suspect   But still I knew not the strength of my passion for him  till the Count of Belvedere was proposed to me with an earnestness that alarmed me  Then I considered the Count as the interrupter of my hopes  and yet I could not give the reason why I rejected him  How could I  when I had none to give but my prepossession in favour of another man  A prepossession entirely hidden in my own heart   But still I thought I would sooner die  than be the wife of a man of a religion contrary to my own  I am a zealous Catholic myself  All my relations are zealous Catholics  How angry have I been at this obstinate Heretic  as I have often called him  the first heretic  my dear Mrs  Beaumont  for once I did not love you  that my soul detested not  For he is as tenacious a Protestant as ever came out of England  What had he to do in Italy  Why did he not stay at home  Or why  if he must come abroad  did he stay so long among us  yet hold his obstinacy  as if in defiance of the people he was so well received by   These were the reproaches that my heart in silence often cast upon him   I was at first concerned only for his soul s sake    249 But afterwards  finding him essential to my earthly happiness  and yet resolving never to think of him if he became not a Catholic  I was earnest for his conversion for my own sake  hoping that my friends indulgence to me would make my wishes practicable  for on his part  I doubted not  if that point were got over  he would think an alliance with our family an honour to him   But when I found him invincible on this article  I was resolved either to conquer my passion  or die  What did I not undergo in my endeavours to gain this victory over myself  My confessor hurt me  by terrors  my woman teazed me  my parents  and two elder brothers  and all my more distant relations  urged me to determine in favour of the Count of Belvedere  The Count was importunate  The Chevalier was importunate in the Count s behalf—Good heaven  What could I do —I was hurried  as I may say  I had not time given me to weigh  ponder  recollect  How could I make my mother  how could I make any body my confident  My judgment was at war with my passion  and I hoped it would overcome  I struggled  yet every day the object appearing more worthy  the struggle was too hard for me  O that I had had a Mrs  Beaumont to consult—Well might melancholy seize me—Silent melancholy   At last the Chevalier was resolved to leave us  What pain  yet what pleasure  did this his resolution give me  Most sincerely I hoped  that his absence would restore my tranquillity   What a secret triumph did I gave myself  on my behaviour to him  before all my friends  on the parting evening —My whole deportment was uniform  I was chearful  serene  happy in myself  and I made all my friends so  I wished him happy where ever he set his foot  and whatsoever he engaged in  I thanked him  with the rest of my friends  for the benefits we had received from him▪ and the pleasure he had given   250 us  in the time he had bestowed upon us  and I wished that he might never want a friend so agree and entertaining as he had been to us all   I was the more pleased with myself  as I was not under a necessity of putting on stiffness or reserve to hide a heart too much affected  I thought myself secure  and stood out forwarder than he seemed to hope for
