called on me again  and told me  that to make me easy  he was willing to come into my proposal  that he would have the proper instruments drawn  by which I would relinquish half my jointure  and he in consequence to give up all claim on my father’s estate   I was much better pleased  at this losing agreement  than if I had acquired a large accession of fortune   Mr Vere soon got the proper deeds ready  and they were executed in form   I now relapsed into an illness  from which I was supposed to have been quite recovered  and my life was thought in great danger  I have since been told  that Mr Vere repented his agreement at that juncture  and told some of his friends  that if he had not been so hasty  he should have had a chance for my jointure and my fortune too   I begged of the dean to go to my mother  and use his last efforts on her  to prevail with her to see me and forgive me before I died  at the same time  I sent her the release I had procured from Mr Vere  which I knew was the most acceptable present I could make her  The dean urged the danger I was in  without its seeming to make much impression on her  I am willing to believe  that she thought the dean exaggerated in his account of my illness  He owned to me himself  that he was shocked to find her so obdurate  At length  he took the paper out of his pocket  and presenting it to her  I am sorry  madam  said he  I cannot prevail with you to act like a parent or a christian  your daughter I fear will not survive her present malady  but she will have the comfort to consider  that she has left nothing unattempted to obtain that forgiveness  which you so cruelly deny her  I hope  lady Grimston  your last hours may be as peaceful  as hers I trust will be from this reflection  There  madam—she has by that instrument left    you disengaged from a troublesome and vexatious law suit  that would  if pursued  infallibly turn out to your disadvantage  it was all she could do  and what few children  used like her  would have done   My mother  a great deal alarmed at the dean’s manner of speaking  now examined the contents of the paper  She seemed affected  and called him back  as he was just leaving the room  She told him  she was not lost to the feelings of nature  and that if he thought her presence would contribute to ease my mind of the remorse it must needs labour under  she was not against seeing me   The good man  glad to find her in this yielding disposition  told her she could not too soon execute her intention  and pressed her to come to his house directly  She suffered him to put her into his coach  and he carried her home with him  The interview  on my side  was attended with tears of joy  tenderness  and contrition  My mother did not depart from her usual austerity  she gave me but her hand to kiss  and pronounced her forgiveness and her blessing in so languid a manner  as greatly damped the fervor of my joy   She staid with me not more than a quarter of an hour  and having talked of indifferent things  without once so much as mentioning what I had done  she took a cold and formal leave   This interview  as little cordial as my mother’s behaviour was to me  had so good an effect on me  that I began perceptibly to mend from that hour  She sent indeed constantly to enquire how I did  but avoided coming  lest  as she said  she should meet with Mr Vere  whom she could never forgive  As soon as I was in a condition to go abroad  I went to pay my duty to her  She received me with civility  but no tenderness  nor has she ever from that time made me the least recompence for what I have lost  her permitting me to see her  she thinks sufficient amends   I did not chuse to return to Mr Vere’s house  as I had only a polite  not a kind invitation  One of his daughters  she who had been present at my marriage  and who always had shewn most affection towards me  was about this time married to a gentleman  whose estate lay in another country  When the bride went home  she pressed me to go with her so warmly  that I could not refuse her  and during the time I staid with her  I received so many marks of tenderness from her  that I resolved to settle in her neighbourhood  and have now a little house near her  where I have resided constantly ever since  I come once or twice a year to pay a visit to my mother  but my reception  as you may see  is always cold  and I seldom stay more than a few days     Old Mr Vere is dead  and his daughters  who were coheiresses to his estate  are all
