the sex joining as one  take your Harriet  person and mind—May I be found worthy  on proof  of all this goodness   LADY Betty has just left us  I read to her what I have written since my visit to Colnebrooke  She shall not  she says  recover her eyes for a week to come   The women  Mr  Selby  are ever looking forward on certain occasions  Lady Betty and my wife extended their wishes so far  as that they might be able to call Miss Grandison and our Miss Byron sisters  but by a claim that should exclude Sir Charles as a brother to one of them     203 Should Sir Charles—But no more on this subject—Yet one word more  When the ladies had mention d it  I could not help thinking that this graceful and truly fine gentleman seems to be the only man  whom our cousin has yet seen  that would meet with no great difficulty from her on such an application   But Sir Charles has a great estate  and still greater expectations from my Lord W  His sister says  he would break half a score hearts  were he to marry—So for that matter would our Miss Byron  But once more—Not another word however on this subject   I stayed to dine with this amiable brother and sister  My cousin exerted herself  to go down  and sat at table for one half hour  But changing countenance  once or twice  as she sat  Miss Grandison would attend her up  and make her lie down  I took leave of her  at her quitting the table   On Monday I hope to see her once more among us   If our dear Miss Byron cannot write  you will per haps have one letter more  my dear Mr  Selby  from  Your ever affectionate ARCHIBALD REEVES   My servant is this moment returned with your letter  Indeed  my dear Mr  Selby  there are two or three passages in it  that would have cut me to the heart a  had not the dear creature been so happily restored to our hopes   LETTER XXVIII  Mr  REEVES  In Continuation   Monday Night  Feb  20   I WILL write one more letter  my dear cousin Selby  and then I will give up my pen to our beloved cousin     204 I got to Colnebrooke by nine this morning  I had the pleasure to find our Miss Byron recovered beyond my hopes  She had a very good night on Saturday  and all Sunday  she said  was a cordial day to her from morning till night  and her night was quiet and happy   Miss Grandison staid at home yesterday to keep my cousin company  Sir Charles passed the greatest part of the day in the library  The two ladies were hardly ever separated  My cousin expresses herself in raptures whenever she speaks of this brother and sister  Miss Grandison  she says  and indeed every one must see it  is one of the frankest and most communicative of women  Sir Charles appears to be one of the most unreserved of men  as well as one of the most polite  He makes not his guests uneasy with his civilities  But you see freedom and ease in his whole deportment  and the stranger cannot doubt but Sir Charles will be equally pleased with freedom and ease  in return  I had an encouraging proof of the justness of this observation this morning from him  as we sat at breakfast  I had expressed myself  occasionally  in such a manner  as shewed more respect than freedom  My dear Mr  Reeves  said he  kindred minds will be intimate at first sight  Receive me early into the list of your friends  I have already numbered you among mine  I should think amiss of myself  if so good a man as I am assured Mr  Reeves is  should by his distance shew a diffidence of me  that would not permit his mind to mingle with mine   Miss Grandison  my cousin says  put her on relateing to her  her whole history  and the histories of the several persons and families to whom she is related   Miss Byron concluding as well as I  that Sir Charles would rather take his place in the coach  than go on horseback to town  and being so happily recovered  as not to give us apprehension about her bearing tolerably the little journey  I kept my horse in our return    205 and Sir Charles went in the coach  This motion coming from Miss Byron  I raillied her upon it when I got her home  But she won t forgive me  if she knows that I told you  whose the motion was  And yet the dear creature s eyes sparkled with pleasure when she had carried her point   I was at home near half an hour before the coach arrived  and was a welcome guest   My dear Mrs  Reeves told me she had expected our arrival before dinner  and hoped Sir Charles and his sister would dine with us  I hoped so too  I told  her   I found there Lady Betty and Miss Clements  a favourite of us all  both impatiently waiting to see my cousin
