him to the yard   where he was put into a carpet  and in a twinkling sent into the air by  the strength and dexterity of five stout operators  whom the lieutenant  had selected from the number of domestics for that singular spell of  duty   In vain did the astonished vaulter beg  for the love of God  that they    6 22 15  3 45 PM   would take pity upon him  and put an end to his involuntary gambols   they were deaf to his prayers and protestations  even when he swore   in the most solemn manner  that if they would cease tormenting him  he  would forget and forgive what was past  and depart in peace to his own  habitation  and continued the game till they were fatigued with the  exercise   Ravine being dismissed in a most melancholy plight  brought an action  of assault and battery against the commodore  and subpoenaed all the  servants as evidences in the cause  but as none of them had seen what  happened  he did not find his account in the prosecution  though he  himself examined all the witnesses  and  among their questions  asked   whether they had not seen him come in like another man  and whether they  had ever seen any other man in such condition as that in which he  had crawled off  But this last interrogation they were not obliged  to answer  because it had reference to the second discipline he bad  undergone  in which they  and they only  were concerned  and no person  is bound to give testimony against himself   In short  the attorney was nonsuited  to the satisfaction of all who  knew him  and found himself under the necessity of proving that he had  received  in course of post  the letter which was declared in court a  scandalous forgery  in order to prevent an indictment with which he was  threatened by the commodore  who little dreamt that the whole affair had  been planned and executed by Peregrine and his associates   The next enterprise in which this triumvirate engaged  was a scheme to  frighten Trunnion with an apparition  which they prepared and exhibited  in this manner  to the hide of a large ox  Pipes fitted a leathern vizor  of a most terrible appearance  stretched on the jaws of a shark  which  he had brought from sea  and accommodated with a couple of broad glasses  instead of eyes  On the inside of these he placed two rushlights  and   with a composition of sulphur and saltpetre  made a pretty large fusee   which he fixed between two rows of the teeth  This equipage being  finished  he  one dark night chosen for the purpose  put it on  and   following the commodore into a long passage  in which he was preceded by  Perry with a light in his hand  kindled his firework with a match  and  began to bellow like a bull  The boy  as it was concerted  looked behind  him  screamed aloud  and dropped the light  which was extinguished  in the fall  when Trunnion  alarmed at his nephew s consternation   exclaimed   Zounds  what s the matter   and turning about to see the  cause of his dismay  beheld a hideous phantom vomiting blue flame  which  aggravated the horrors of its aspect  He was instantly seized with an  agony of fear  which divested him of his reason  nevertheless  he  as it  were mechanically  raised his trusty supporter in his own defence   and  the apparition advancing towards him  aimed it at this dreadful  annoyance with such a convulsive exertion of strength  that had not the  blow chanced to light upon one of the horns Mr  Pipes would have had no  cause to value himself upon his invention  Misapplied as it was  he did  not fail to stagger at the shock  and  dreading another such salutation   closed with the commodore  and having tripped up his heels  retreated  with great expedition   It was then that Peregrine  pretending to recollect himself a little   ran  with all the marks of disturbance and affright  and called up the  servants to the assistance of their master  whom they found in a cold  sweat upon the floor  his features betokening horror and confusion     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Hatchway raised him up  and having comforted him with a cup of Nantz   began to inquire into the cause of his disorder  but he could not  extract one word of answer from his friend  who  after a considerable  pause  during which he seemed to be wrapt in profound contemplation   pronounced aloud   By the Lord  Jack  you may say what you wool  but  I ll be d   if it was not Davy Jones himself  I know him by his saucer  eyes  his three rows of teeth  his horns and tail  and the blue smoke  that came out of his nostrils  What does the blackguard hell s baby  want with me
