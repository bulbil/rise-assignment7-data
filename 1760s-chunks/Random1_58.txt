  Ah traitresse  —  It would have been impossible for me to have preserv d my gravity a minute longer  when I was happily reliev d by a rap at the door  which I open d  and perceiv d my mistress coming out of a coach  she flounc d immediately into the shop  and addressed her husband thus    I suppose you thought I was lost  my dear—Captain Odonnell has been so good as to treat me with a play  —   Play—play  replied he  Oho  yes by gar  I believe ver prettie play  —   Bless me   said she  what s the matter  —   Vat de matter   cried he  forgetting all his former complaisance  by gar  you be one damn dog s wife—ventre bleu  me vill show you vat it is to put one horn upon mine head  Pardieu  le capitaine Odonnell be one  —  Here the captain  who had been all the while at the door discharging the coach  entering  said with a terrible voice    D—mme  what am I  —  Mr  Lavement changing his tone  immediately saluted him with    Oh serviteur monsieur le capitaine  vous etes un galant homme—ma femme est fort obligée  —  Then turning about towards me  pronounc d with a low voice    Et diablement obligeante sans doute  —   Harkee  Mr  Lavement   said the captain  I am a man of honour  and I believe you are too much of a gentleman to be offended at the civility I shew your   161 wife  —  This declaration had such an effect on the apothecary  that he resum d all the politesse of a Frenchman  and with the utmost prostration of compliment  assur d the captain that he was perfectly satisfied with the honour he had done his wife —Matters being thus compos d  every body went to rest —Next day I perceiv d thro  a glass door that open d from the shop into a parlour  the captain talking earnestly to miss  who heard him with a look that expressed anger mingled with scorn  which however he at last found means to mollify  and seal d his reconciliation with a kiss —This soon convinc d me of the occasion of the quarrel  but notwithstanding all my vigilance  I could never discover any other commerce between them —In the mean while  I had reason to believe I had inspir d one of the maids with tender sentiments for me  and one night when I thought every other person in the house asleep  I took the opportunity of the other maid s absence  for she had got leave to go and visit her sick father who liv d at Richmond  to avail myself of my conquest  Accordingly I got up  and  naked as I was  explor d my way in the dark  to the garret where she lay —I was ravish d to find the door open  and moved softly to her bed side  transported with the hope of compleating my wishes —But what horrors of jealousy and disappointment did I feel  when I found her asleep  fast locked in the arms of a man  whom I easily guessed to be no other than the captain s servant  I was upon the point of doing some rash thing  when the noise of a rat scratching behind the wainscoat  put me to flight  and I was fain to get back to my own bed in safety —Whether this alarm had disorder d my mind    162 or that I was led astray by the power of destiny  I know not  but instead of turning to the left when I descended to the second story  I persu d the contrary course  and mistook the young lady s bed chamber for my own  I did not perceive my mistake before I had run against the bed posts  and then it was not in my power to retreat undiscover d  for the nymph being awake  felt my approach  and with a soft voice  bid me make less noise lest the Scotch booby in the next room should over hear us  This hint was sufficient to inform me of the nature of the assignation  and as my passions  at any time high  were then in a state of exaltation  I was resolved to profit by my good fortune —Without any more ceremony therefore  I made bold to slip into bed to this charmer  who gave me as favourable a reception as I could desire —Our conversation was very sparing on my part  but she upbraided the person whom I represented  with his jealousy of me  whom she handled so roughly  that my resentment had well nigh occasion d a discovery more than once  but I was consoled for her hatred of me  by understanding from her own mouth  that it was now high time to salve her reputation by matrimony  for she had reason to fear she could not much longer conceal the effects of their mutual intercourse —While I was meditating an answer to this proposal  I heard a noise in my room  like something heavy falling down upon the floor  Upon which  I started up  and creeping to the door of my chamber  observ d by moon light  the shadow of a
