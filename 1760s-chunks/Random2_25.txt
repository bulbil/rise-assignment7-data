the rhodomontades they uttered on the subject of their generosity and courage  Every man   by his own account  performed feats that would have shamed all the heroes of antiquity —One compared himself to a lion retiring at leisure from his cowardly pursuers  who keep at a wary distance  and gall him with their darts —Another likened himself to a bear that retreats with his face to the   68 enemy  who dare not assail him  and a third as sumed the character of a desperate stag  that turns upon the hounds and keeps them at bay —There was not a private soldier engaged  who had not by the prowess of his single arm  demolished a whole platoon  or put a squadron of horse to flight  and among others  the meagte gascon extoled his exploits above those of Hercules or Charlemagne —As I still retained my resentment for the disgrace I suffered in my last recontre with him  and now that I thought myself qualified  longed for an opportunity to retrieve my honour  I magnified the valour of the English with all the hyperboles I could imagine  and decried the pusilanimity of the French in the same stile  comparing them to hares flying before grey hounds  or mice pursued by cats  and passed an ironical compliment on the speed he exerted in his flight  which  considering his age and infirmities  I said was surprising —He was stung to the quick by this sarcasm  and with an air of threatning disdain  bid me know myself better  and remember the correction I had already received from him for my insolence  for he might not be always in the humour of sparing a wretch who abused his goodness  To this inuendo I made no reply but by a kick on the breech  which overturned him in an instant —He started up with wonderful agility  and drawing his sword  attacked me with great fury  Several people interposed  but when he informed them of its being an affair of honour  they retired and left us to decide the battle by ourselves  I sustained his onset with little damage  having only received a small scratch on my right shoulder    69 and seeing his breath and vigour almost exhausted  assaulted him in my turn  closed with him  and wrested his sword out of his hand in the struggle —Having thus acquired the victory  I desired him to beg his life  to which he made no answer  but shrugged up his shoulders to his ears  expanded his hands  elevated the skin of his forehead and eye brows  and depressed the corners of his mouth  in such a manner  that I could scarce refrain from laughing aloud at his grotesque appearance —That I might  however  mortify his vanity  which had triumphed without bounds over my misfortune  I thrust his sword up to the hilt in something  it was not a tansy  that lay smoaking on the plain  and joined the rest of the soldiers with an air of tranquility and indifference   There was nothing more of moment attempted by either of the armies during the remaining part of the campaign  which being ended  the English marched back to the Netherlands  part of our army was detached to French Flanders  and our regiment ordered to winter quarters in Champagne —It was the fate of the grenadier company  to which I now belonged  to lie at Rheims  where I found myself in the utmost want of every thing  My pay  which amounted to five sols a day  so far from supplying me with necessaries  being scarce sufficient to procure a wretched subsistance  to keep soul and body together  so that I was by hunger and hard duty  brought down to the meagre condition of my fellow soldiers  and my linen reduced from three tolerable shirts  to two pair of sleeves and necks  the bodies having been long ago converted into spatterdashes  and after all  I was better provided than   70 any private man in the regiment —In this urgency of my affairs  I wrote to my uncle in England  though my hopes from that quarter were not at all sanguine  for the reasons I have already explained  and in the mean time had recourse to my old remedy patience  consoling myself with the flattering suggestions of a lively imagination that never abandoned me in my distress   One day  while I stood centinel at the gate of a general officer  a certain nobleman came to the door  followed by a gentleman in mourning  to whom  at parting  I heard him say     You may depend upon my good offices  —  This assurance was answered by a low bow of the person in black  who turning to go away  discovered to me the individual countenance of my old friend and adherent Strap —I was so much astonished at the sight  that I lost the power of utterance  and before I could recollect myself  he was gone  without taking any notice of me —Indeed  had he staid  I scarce would have ventured to accost him  because  though I was perfectly well acquainted with the features of his face  I could not be positively certain as to the rest of his person  which was very much altered for the better  since he lest me at London  neither could I conjecture by what means he was
