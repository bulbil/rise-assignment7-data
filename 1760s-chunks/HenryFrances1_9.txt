just after your dear Letter     Henry   LETTER VI   Dear HARRY   THE Account of your Adventures diverted me extremely  for I am always pleased when you seem so  I wish you were not too wise  and too lazy to write a Novel  for I fancy you could do it admirably  and it would be an easier Task for you than almost any Man  for I think your whole Life and Character have a great deal of that Stile in them  I wish I had   10 any Thing equally entertaining to amuse you with  but my Set of Acquaintance may be properly called a Set  for there is such a Sameness runs through them all  that they are hardly to be distinguished  but by their Voice and Features  and are liable to such a Censure as somebody blundered out when he wanted to compliment a Collection of Portraits   All alike  all alike   When I am confined to such machine Society  which is too often my Fate  I fancy I am got into Powell s Commonwealth  and am looking about for the Wires to give them some Variety of Motion   Oh  my dear Harry  how cruel is it in you to torture me thus  to raise my Taste for higher Joys  yet leave me condemned to such mean Society  for  while I correspond with thee  I fancy myself somewhat like Dives in the Parable  condemned to Torments and conversing with Abraham   Adieu  Adieu   LETTER VII   Dear HARRY   London   THOUGH you unkindly denied me the Liberty of enquiring about your Health last Night  yet  in a Matter where my Happiness is so much at Stake  you must excuse my disobeying   11 your Commands  by intreating you to let me know how my dear Harry does this Morning  I will not be answered by the common Return to impertinent How d ye s  but insist on having  what I shall always give Credit to  nay  what I esteem as an Oracle  I hope you will not refuse me a Line  to give me an Assurance of your Health  and allow me to taste of Ease  which I have not done since we parted  though it is all I hope for   till we meet again    For  in thy Absence  Joy is seen no more   I know not what I write  my Head is quite giddy with my Fears for you  which have not suffered me to sleep an Hour all Night  You know  though I do not  the Greek Name for— Self Tormentor—then save me from myself  and tell me  telling me Truth  that you are well     F   Tuesday Morning—Eight o Clock  When was I up so early   LETTER VIII   My Dear FANNY   I AM much recovered since last Night  tho  Mrs  — s Devil of a Caustick has made my Throat as sore on the Outside  as it was before within  I felt all Night as Hercules did  after he had put on Dejanira s Gift  not that   12 she is any more to my Dejanira  than I to Hercules  who resemble him in nothing  but that I am   To a Distaff chained     This Day would perhaps discourage a Man in better Health and Senses  from stirring out  But I have ordered my Horses immediately  to shew the steddy Purpose of my Life  which tho  your Commands diverted me from last Night  neither the Severity of the Weather or acute Disorder shall be able to alter on any other Occasion  You have here a Paraphrase Translation of the first Ode of Anacreon  which I wrote last Night after you left me  to amuse my Pain    My Fiddle I would fain employ   To sing the Chiefs who ruin d Troy   To Cadmus too my Fingers move   But my Cremona answers Love   I change the Strings  rosin my Bow   Praise on Alcides to bestow   I raise them high and strike them round   But Love alone they still resound   Adieu ye Heros and ye Kings   Of Love alone my Fiddle sings       13  LETTER IX  FRANCES to HENRY   IT has been a Fortnight since I heard from you  till this Day  during which Time my Life has been so perfect a Vacuum  that I do not recollect Circumstances enough to know whether I existed  during that Interval  I am apt to think with the Pythagoreans  that my Spirit  grown weary of it s Confinement in so small a Prison  had a Mind to animate some nobler Animal  which it was in search of for so many Days  but like the gadding Dove  finding no Place of Rest  has return d again  I cannot say  it has brought the Olive Branch in it s Mouth  tho   like Mahomet s Pigeon  it has returned with a Letter  more calculated for War than Peace  as it seems to denounce the Loss of your Friendship  as well as your Love  but I shall not so easily renounce the Former  as my Prudence inspires me to resign
