and better was impossible  I gave up my all for both   fortune and my father s favour for the one  reputation  friends  and  fortune for the other  Yet  notwithstanding this intimate connection   I did not relinquish the world all at once  on the contrary  I still  appeared at court  and attracted the notice and approbation of my royal  patroness  I danced with the P   of W    a circumstance which so nearly  affected Mr  S    who was present  that  in order to manifest his  resentment  he chose the ugliest woman in the ball for his partner  and  I no sooner perceived his uneasiness  than I gave over  with a view of  appeasing his displeasure    Without repeating particular circumstances  let it suffice to say  our  mutual passion was a perfect copy of that which had subsisted between  me and my dear Lord W    It was jealous  melting and delicate  and  chequered with little accident  which serve to animate and maintain  the flame  in its first ardency of rapture  When my lover was sick   I attended and nursed him with indefatigable tenderness and care  and  during an indisposition  which I caught in the performance of this  agreeable office  he discharged the obligation with all the warmth of  sympathy and love    It was  however  judged necessary by the physicians  that I should use  the Bath waters for the recovery of my health  and I set out for that  place  glad of a pretence to be absent from Lord       with whom I lived  on very unhappy terms  He had  about nine months after our marriage   desired that we might sleep in separate beds  and gave a very whimsical  reason for this proposal  He said  the immensity of his love deprived  him of the power of gratification  and that some commerce with an  object  to which his heart was not attached  might  by diminishing the  transports of his spirits  recompose his nerves  and enable him to enjoy  the fruits of his good fortune     6 22 15  3 45 PM    You may be sure I made no objection to this plan  which was immediately  put into execution  He made his addresses to a nymph of Drury Lane   whose name  as he told me  was Mrs  Rock  She made shift to extract some  money from her patient  but his infirmity was beyond the power of her  art  though she made some mischief between us  and I communicated my  suspicion to the duke of H    who intended to have expostulated with her  upon the subject  but she got intimation of his design  and saved him  the trouble by a precipitate retreat    After my return from Bath  where Mr  S   and I had lived happily  until  we were interrupted by the arrival of my husband  his lordship expressed  an inclination to be my bedfellow again  In this particular I desired to  be excused  I would not be the first to propose the separation  which   though usual in other countries  is contrary to the custom of England   being unwilling to furnish the least handle for censure  as my character  was still unblemished  yet  when the proposal came from him  I thought  myself entitled to refuse a reunion  to which I accordingly objected    This opposition produced a quarrel  which rose to a state of perpetual  animosity  so that we began to talk of parting  My lord relished the  expedient  agreeing to add three hundred pounds a year to my pin money   which  by the bye  was never paid  and I renounced all state and  grandeur  to live in a small house that I hired at Carshalton  where I  passed my time for two months  in the most agreeable retirement  with my  dear lover  At length I was disturbed by the intrusion of my lord  who  molested me with visits and solicitations to return  pretending that he  had changed his mind  and insisting upon my compliance with his desire    I exhausted my invention in endeavours to evade his request  but he  persecuted me without ceasing  So that I was fain to capitulate  on  condition that he should immediately set out for France  and that he  should not presume to approach my bed till our arrival at Calais  We  accordingly departed for that kingdom  and  far from infringing the  least article of our treaty  his lordship did not insist upon his  privilege before we reached the capital of France    Meanwhile  I began to feel the effect of my passion in a very  interesting manner  and communicated my discovery to the dear author of  it  who would not leave me in such an affecting situation  but took the  first opportunity of following us to France    In our road to Paris  we stopped to visit Chantilly  a magnificent  chateau belonging to the prince
