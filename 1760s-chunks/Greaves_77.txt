Squire Sycamore  who  having received advice that Miss Aurelia Darnel had eloped from the place of her retreat  immediately took the field in quest of that lovely fugitive  hoping that  should he have the good fortune to find her in present distress  his good offices would not be rejected  He had followed the chase so close  that  immediately after our adventurer s departure  he alighted at the inn  from whence Aurelia had been conveyed  and there he learned the particulars which we have related above   Mr  Sycamore had a great deal of the childish romantic in his disposition  and  in the course of his amours  is said to have always taken more pleasure in the pursuit than in the final possession  He had heard of Sir Launcelot s extravagance  by which he was in some measure infected  and he dropped an insinuation  that he could eclipse his rival  even in his own lunatic sphere  This hint was not lost upon his companion  counsellor  and buffoon  the facetious Davy Dawdle  who had some humour  and a great deal of mischief  in his composition  He looked upon his patron as a fool  and his patron knew him to be both knave and fool  yet  the two characters suited each other so well  that they could hardly exist asunder  Davy was an artful sycophant  but he did not flatter in the usual way  on the contrary  he behaved en cavalier  and treated Sycamore  on whose bounty he subsisted  with the most sarcastic familiarity  Nevertheless  he seasoned his freedom with certain qualifying ingredients  that subdued the bitterness of it  and was now become so necessary to the squire  that he had no idea of enjoyment with which Dawdle was not somehow or other connected   There had been a warm dispute betwixt them about the scheme of contesting the prize with Sir Launcelot in the lists of chivalry  Sycamore had insinuated  that if he had a mind to play the fool  he could wear armour  wield a lance  and manage a charger  as well as Sir Launcelot Greaves  Dawdle  snatching the hint   I had  some time ago   said he   contrived a scheme for you  which I was afraid you had not address enough to execute  It would be no difficult matter  in imitation of the bachelor  Sampson Carrasco  to go in quest of Greaves  as a knight errant  defy him as a rival  and establish a compact  by which the vanquished should obey the injunctions of the victor  — That is my very idea   cried Sycamore   —Your idea   replied the other   had you ever an idea of your own conception   Thus the dispute began  and was maintained with great vehemence  until other arguments failing  the squire offered to lay a wager of twenty guineas  To this proposal  Dawdle answered by the interjection pish  which inflamed Sycamore to a repetition of the defiance   You are in the right   said Dawdle   to use such an argument as you know is by me unanswerable  A wager of twenty guineas will at any time overthrow and confute all the logic of the most able syllogist  who has not got a shilling in his pocket    Sycamore looked very grave at this declaration  and  after a short pause  said   I wonder  Dawdle  what you do with all your money  — I am surprised you should give yourself that trouble—I never ask what you do with yours  — You have no occasion to ask  you know pretty well how it goes  — What  do you upbraid me with your favours — t is mighty well  Sycamore  — Nay  Dawdle  I did not intend to affront  — Z——s  affront  what d ye mean    I ll assure you  Davy  you don t know me  if you think I could be so ungenerous as to—a—to—— — I always thought  whatever faults or foibles you might have  Sycamore  that you was not deficient in generosity —though to be sure it is often very absurdly displayed  — Ay  that s one of my greatest foibles  I can t refuse even a scoundrel  when I think he is in want —Here  Dawdle  take that note   — Not I  sir —what d ye mean —what right have I to your notes   — Nay  but Dawdle —come  — By no means  it looks like the abuse of good nature —all the world knows you re good natured to a fault   — Come  dear Davy  you shall—you must oblige me  —Thus urged  Dawdle accepted the bank note with great reluctance  and restored the idea to the right owner   A suit of armour being brought from the garret or armoury of his ancestors  he gave orders for having the pieces scoured and furbished up  and his heart dilated with joy  when he reflected upon the superb figure he should make when cased in complete steel  and armed at all points for the combat   When he was fitted with the other parts  Dawdle insisted on buckling on his helmet  which weighed fifteen pounds  and  the headpiece being adjusted  made such
