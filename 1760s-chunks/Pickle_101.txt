frequently hurried him out of the plan of  conduct which in his cooler moments he had laid down  They halted for  refreshment at Montreuil  and about seven in the evening arrived at a  village called Bernay  where  while they waited for fresh horses  they  were informed by the landlord that the gates of Abbeville were shut  every night punctually at eight o clock  so that it would be impossible  for them to get admittance  He said there was not another place  of entertainment on the road where they could pass the night  and  therefore  as a friend  he advised them to stay at his house  where they  would find the best of accommodation  and proceed upon their journey  betimes in the morning   Mr  Jolter  though he had travelled on that road before  could not  recollect whether or not mine host spoke truth  but his remonstrance  being very plausible  our hero determined to follow his advice  and  being conducted into an apartment  asked what they could have for  supper  The landlord mentioned everything that was eatable in the house   and the whole being engrossed for the use of him and his attendants   he amused himself  till such time as it should be dressed  in strolling  about the house  which stands in a very rural situation  While he thus  loitered away the time that hung heavy on his hands  another chaise  arrived at the inn  and upon inquiry he found that the new comers were  Mr  Hornbeck and his lady  The landlord  conscious of his inability to  entertain this second company  came and begged with great humiliation  that Mr  Pickle would spare them some part of the victuals he had  bespoken  but he refused to part with so much as the wing of a  partridge  though at the same time he sent his compliments to the  strangers  and giving them to understand how ill the house was provided  for their reception  invited them to partake of his supper  Mr   Hornbeck  who was not deficient in point of politeness  and extremely  well disposed for a relishing meal  which he had reason to expect from    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the savoury steam that issued from the kitchen  could not resist this  second instance of our young gentleman s civility  which he acknowledged  in a message  importing that he and his wife would do themselves the  pleasure of profiting by his courteous offer  Peregrine s cheeks glowed  when he found himself on the eve of being acquainted with Mrs  Hornbeck   of whose heart he had already made a conquest in imagination  and he  forthwith set his invention at work  to contrive some means of defeating  her husband s vigilance   When supper was ready  he in person gave notice to his guests  and   leading the lady into his apartment  seated her in an elbow chair at the  upper end of the table  squeezing her hand  and darting a most insidious  glance at the same time  This abrupt behaviour he practised on the  presumption that a lady of her breeding was not to be addressed with  the tedious forms that must be observed in one s advances to a person  of birth and genteel education  In all probability his calculation was  just  for Mrs  Hornbeck gave no signs of discontent at this sort of  treatment  but  on the contrary  seemed to consider it as a proof of  the young gentleman s regard  and though she did not venture to open  her mouth three times during the whole repast  she showed herself  particularly well satisfied with her entertainer  by sundry sly and  significant looks  while her husband s eyes were directed another way   and divers loud peals of laughter  signifying her approbation of the  sallies which he uttered in the course of their conversation   Her spouse began to be very uneasy at the frank demeanour of his  yoke fellow  whom he endeavoured to check in her vivacity  by assuming  a severity of aspect  but whether she obeyed the dictates of her own  disposition  which  perhaps  was merry and unreserved  or wanted to  punish Mr  Hornbeck for his jealousy of temper  certain it is  her  gaiety increased to such a degree  that her husband was grievously  alarmed and  incensed at her conduct  and resolved to make her sensible  of his displeasure  by treading in secret upon her toes  He was   however  so disconcerted by his indignation  that he mistook his mark   and applied the sharp heel of his shoe to the side of Mr  Jolter s foot   comprehending his little toe that was studded with an angry corn  which  he invaded with such a sudden jerk  that the governor  unable to endure  the torture in silence started up  and  dancing on the floor  roared  hideously with repeated bellowings  to the enjoyment of Peregrine and  the lady  who laughed themselves almost into convulsions at the joke   Hornbeck  confounded at the mistake he had committed  begged pardon of  the injured tutor
