whole country round was one scene of slaughter  desolation  and plunder  justice seemed forgotten  and vengeance assumed the name   In the mean time  the unhappy fugitive adventurer wandered from mountain to mountain  a wretched spectator of all these horrors  the result of his ill guided ambition  He now underwent a similiarity of adventures with Charles II  after the defeat at Worcester  He sometimes found refuge in caves and cottages  without attendants  and exposed to the mercy of peasants  who could pity but not support him  Sometimes he lay in forests  with one or two companions of his distress  continually purfued by the troops of the conquerors  as there was thirty thousand pounds bid for his head  Sheridan  an Irish adventurer  was he who kept most faithfully by him  and inspired him with courage to support such incredible hardships  He was obliged to trust his life to the fidelity of about fifty individuals  One day  having   183 walked from morning till night  pressed by hunger  and worn with fatigue  he ventured to enter an house  the owner of which he well knew was attached to the opposite party    The son of your King  said he  entering  comes to beg a bit of bread and cloaths  I know your present attachment to my adversaries  but I believe you to have sufficient honour not to abuse my confidence  or to take the advantage of my misfortunes  Take these rags that have for some time been my only covering  and keep them  You may  probably  restore them to me one day  when seated on the throne of the Kings of Great Britain    His host was touched with his distress  assisted him as far as he was able  and never divulged his secret  In this manner he wandered among the frightful wilds of Glengarry  for near six months  often hemmed round by his pursuers  but still finding some expedient to save him from captivity and death  At length a privateer of St  Malo  hired by his adherents  arrived in Lochnanach  on which he embarked  and arrived at France in safety     Many were the conjectures then  and they still subsist  as to the possibility of the young adventurer s escape  Some were of opinion that the government gave secret orders to the Generals to connive at it  while others still firmly assert  that he was put to death in an out house  in which a number of the rebels were inclosed and burnt  Which ever report be most true  certain it is  that the place of his retreat has ever since been concealed from all the world   While the Prince thus led a wandering and solitary life  the scaffolds and the gibbets were bathed with the blood of his adherents  seventeen officers of the rebel army were executed at Kennington Common  in the neighbourhood of London  whose constancy in death gained more proselytes to their cause than perhaps their victories could have done  Nine were executed in the same manner at Carlisle  six at   184 Brumpton  seven at Penrith  and eleven at York A few obtained pardons  and a considerable numbe were transported to the Plantations  The Earls o Kilmarnock and Cromartie  with the Lord Balmerino were tried by their Peers  and found guilty  Cro¦martie was pardoned  the other two were beheaded on Tower Hill  Kilmarnock  either from conviction  or from the hope of a pardon  owned his crime  and declared his repentance of it  On the other hand  Balmerino  who had from his youth up  been bred to arms  died in a more daring manner  When his fellow sufferer  as commanded  bid God bless King George  Balmerino still held fast to his principles  and cried out  God bless King James  and suffered with the utmost intrepidity  Lord Lovat  and Mr  Radcliff the titular Earl of Derwentwater  suffered the same fate with equal resolution  Thus ended a rebellion  dictated by youth and presumption  and conducted without art or resolution  The family of Stewart found fortune become more averse at every new solicitation of her favours  Let private men  who complain of the miseries of this life  only turn to the vicissitudes in that family  and learn to bless God  and be happy   I am   c   LETTER XXIII   A Rebellion quelled  and mercy shewn to the delinquents  ever strengthens the reigning cause  How it might have been in the present instance I will not pretend to determine  whether too much rigour might have been exerted upon the conquered  posterity must determine  actions of this kind are too near our own times to be either judged of  or talked of with freedom  Immediately after the rebellion   185 was suppressed  the legislature undertook to establish several regulations in Scotland  which were equally conducive to the happiness of the people there  and the tranquility of the united kingdom  The Highlanders  who had  till this time  continued to wear the old military dress of the Romans  and who always went armed  were now reformed  Their habits were  by act of parliament  reduced to the modern modes  the obedience they were under to their chiefs was abolished  and the lowest
