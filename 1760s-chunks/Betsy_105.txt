      Miss Betsy also answered her brother s letter at the same time  but the   purport of it being much the same with that she wrote to Lady Trusty    there is no occasion for inserting it                CHAPTER VI       Seems to bring things pretty near a conclusion          Miss Betsy was now in as happy a disposition as any of her friends  or   even Mr  Trueworth himself  could desire  she listened to the   confirmations he was every day giving her of his passion  with the   greatest affability  and much more seriousness and attention than she   had been accustomed  The quarrel she had with Miss Flora making her   willing to avoid her as much as possible  he was frequently alone with   her whole hours together  and had all the opportunities he could wish of   cultivating the esteem she made no scruple of confessing she had for   him  As Mr  Staple was now gone out of town  pursuant to the resolution   he had taken  and no other rival  at least none encouraged by Miss   Betsy  had as yet seconded him  he had all the reason in the world to   flatter himself  that the accomplishment of his wishes were not far   distant       Plays  operas  and masquerades  were now beginning to come into vogue    and he had the satisfaction to see his mistress refuse whatever tickets   were offered her for those diversions  by any of the gentlemen who   visited Lady Mellasin  and at the same time readily agreed to accompany   him to those  or any other publick entertainments  whenever he requested   that favour of her       Miss Betsy s behaviour in this point  however  had more the air than the   reality of kindness to Mr  Trueworth  for  in effect  it was not because   she would not accept of tickets from any other person than himself  but   because they were offered by gentlemen of Lady Mellasin s acquaintance    and  consequently  in respect to her  Miss Flora had the same   invitation  with whom she was determined never more to be seen abroad       This required some sort of contrivance  to be managed in such a fashion   as to give no umbrage to Mr  Goodman or Lady Mellasin  for the former of   which she had always a very great esteem  and did not chuse to afford   the latter any cause of complaint against her  while she continued to   live in the same house  The method she took  therefore  to avoid a thing   so disagreeable to her  and at the same time to give no occasion of   offence  was always to make choice of one diversion when she knew Miss   Flora was pre engaged to another       To partake of these pleasures  which Mr  Trueworth  seeing into her   temper  was almost every day presenting  she invited sometimes one lady    sometimes another  of those she conversed with  but the person who most   frequently accompanied her  was Miss Mabel  a young lady  who lived in   the next street  and whom she had been acquainted with ever since her   coming to London  but had not been altogether so agreeable to her as she   really deserved  and otherwise would have been  if Lady Mellasin and   Miss Flora had not represented her as a prying  censorious  ill natured   creature  and  in fine  given her all the epithets which compose the   character of a prude       She was  indeed  both in principles and behaviour  the very reverse of   Miss Flora  she was modest  without affectation  reserved  without   austerity  chearful  without levity  compassionate and benevolent in her   nature  and  to crown all  was perfectly sincere  Miss Betsy had never   wanted penetration enough to see  and to admire the amiable qualities of   this young lady  nor had been at all influenced by the character given   of her by Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora  but being herself of too gay and   volatile a temper  the more serious deportment of the other gave   somewhat of a check to hers  and for that reason rendered her society   less coveted by her  The letter of Lady Trusty  however  joined to the   late accidents which had happened  having now given her a turn of mind   vastly different from what it had been a very little time before  made   her now prefer the conversation of Miss Mabel to most others of her   acquaintance       This young lady having been often in Mr  Trueworth s company  with Miss   Betsy  saw enough into him to be
