His minority gave an opportunity to me  and his other Trustees  to put him in possession  when he came of age  of a very noble and clear estate  which he has not impaired  His person is not to be found fault with  He has learning  and is allowed to have good sense  which every learned man has not  His conduct  his discretion  in his travels  procured him respect and reputation abroad  You may make enquiry privately of all these matters   We are  you must believe  very sollicitous to have him happily married  He is far from being an undutiful son  Indeed he was always dutiful  A dutiful son gives very promising hopes of making a good husband  He assures me that his affections are disengaged  and that he will pay the most particular regard to my recommendation   I have cast about for a suitable wife for him  I look farther than to the person of a woman  tho  my Lord will by no means have Beauty left out in the qualifications of a wife  I look to the family to whom a Lady owes her education and training up  Quality  however  I stand not upon  A man of quality  you know  confers quality on his wife  An antient and good gentleman s family is all I am sollicitous about in this respect  In this light  yours  madam  on all sides  and for many descents  is unexceptionable  I have a desire  if all things shall be found to be mutually agreeable  to be related to it  And your character  as the young Lady has been brought up under your eye  is a great inducement with me     303 Your niece Byron s beauty  and merits  as well as sweetness of temper  are talked of by every body  Not a Day passes  but we hear of her to her great advantage  Now  madam  will you be pleased to answer me one qustion  with that explicitness which the importance of the case  and my own intended explicitness to you  may require from woman to woman  Especially  as I ask it of you in confidence   Are then Miss Byron s affections absolutely disengaged  We are very nice  and must not doubt in this matter   This is the only question I will ask at present  If this can be answered as I wish  others  in a treaty of this important nature  will come into consideration on both sides   The favour of a line  as soon as it will suit your convenience  will oblige  madam   Your most faithful and obedient Servant  M  D   LETTER XLII  Mrs  SELBY  To the Countess Dowager of D    Jan  27   Madam   I AM greatly obliged to your Ladyship for your good opinion of me  and for the honour you do me  and all our family  in the proposed alliance   I will answer your Ladyship s question with the requisite explicitness   Mr  Greville  Mr  Orme  and Mr  Fenwick  all of this county  have respectively made application to us for our interest  and to Miss Byron for her favour  But hitherto without effect  tho  the terms each proposes might entitle him to consideration   Miss Byron professes to honour the married state  and one day proposes to make some man happy in it  if it be not his own fault  But declares  that she has   304 not yet seen the man to whom with her hand she can give her heart   In truth  madam  we are all neutrals on this occasion  We have the highest opinion of her discretion  She has read  she has conversed  and yet there is not in the county a better housewife  or one who would make a more prudent manager in a family  We are all fond of her  even to doting  Were she not our child  we should love her for her good qualities  and sweetness of manners  and a frankness that has few examples among young women   Permit me  madam  to add one thing  about which Miss Byron  in her turn  will be very nice  Your Ladyship is pleased to say  that my Lord s affections are disengaged  Were his Lordship a prince  and hoped to succeed with her  they must not be so  after he had seen and conversed with her  Yet the future happiness  and not pride  would be the consideration with her  for she has that diffidence in her own merits  from which the worthy of both Sexes cannot be totally free  This diffidence would increase too much for her happiness  were she to be thought of with indifference by any man on earth  who hoped to be more than indifferent to her   As to other questions  which  as this is answered  your Ladyship thinks may come to be asked  I choose un asked  having no reserves  to acquaint your Ladyship that Miss Byron has not  in her own power  quite 15 000l  She has   tis true  reversionary expectations  But we none of us wish that they should for many years take place
