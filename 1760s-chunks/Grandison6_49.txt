told  there would be a crouded church this morning  in expectation of seeing the new humble servant of Miss Byron attending her thither  For it is every where known  that Sir Charles Grandison is come down to make his addresses to the young creature who is happy in every one s love and good   122 wishes  and all is now said to have been settled between him and us  by his noble sister  and Lord G  and Dr  Bartlett  when they were with us —And we are to be married—O my dear Lady G  you cannot imagine how soon  You see what credit you did us by your kind visit  my dear   Many of the neighbourhood seemed disappointed  when they saw me led in by my uncle  as Mr  Deane led my aunt  and Nancy and Lucy only attended by their brother  But it was not long before Mr  Greville  Mr  Fenwick  and Sir Charles  entered and went into the pew of the former  which is over against ours  Mr  Greville and Mr  Fenwick bowed low to us  severally  the moment they went into the pew  and to several others of the gentry   Sir Charles had first other devoirs to pay  To false shame  you have said  he was always superior  I was delighted to see the example he set  He paid us his second compliments with a grace peculiar to himself  I felt my face glow  on the whispering that went round  I thought I read in every eye  admiration of him  even through the sticks of some of the Ladies fans   What a difference was there between the two men and him  in their behaviour  throughout both the service  and sermon  Yet who ever beheld two of the three so decent  so atttentive  so reverent  I may say  before  Were all who call themselves gentlemen  thought I  more than once  like this  the world would yet be a good world   Mr  Greville had his arm in a sling  He seemed highly delighted with his guest  so did Mr  Fenwick  When the sermon was ended  Mr  Greville held the pew door ready opened  to attend our movements  and when we were in motion to go  he  taking officiously Sir Charles s hand  bent towards us Sir Charles met us at our pew door  He approached us with that easy grace peculiar to himself  and offered  with a profound respect his hand to me     123 This was equal to a public declaration  It took every body s attention  He is not ashamed to avow in public  what he thinks fit to own in private   I was humbled more than exalted by the general notice  Mr  Greville  bold  yet low man  made a motion  as if he gave the hand that Sir Charles took  Mr  Fenwick offered his hand to Lucy  Mr  Greville led my aunt  and not speaking low  subtle as a serpent   My plaguy horse  said he  looking at his sling  knew not his master  I invite myself to tea with you  madam  in the afternoon  You will supply my lame arm  I hope  yourself   There is no such thing as keeping private one s movements in a country town  if one would  One of our servants reported the general approbation  It is a pleasure  surely  my dear Ladies  to be addressed to by a man of whom every one approves  What a poor figure must she make  who gives way to a courtship from a man whom every body blames her for encouraging  Such women indeed generally confess indirectly the solly  by carrying on the affair clandestinely   Sunday Evening   O MY dear  I have been strangely disconcerted by means of Mr  Greville  He is a strange man  But I will lead to it in course   We all went to church again in the afternoon  Every body who knew Mr  Greville  took it for a high pie•e of politeness in him to his guest  that he came twice the same day to church  Sir Charles edified every body by his chearful piety  Are you not of opinion  my dear Lady G  that wickedness may be always put out of countenance by a person who has an established character for goodness  and who is not ashamed of doing his duty in the public eye  Methinks I could wish that all the prosligates in the parish had their seats around that of a man who has fortitude enough to dare to be good  The text was a happy   124 one to this purpose  The words of our Saviour     Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words  in this adulterous and sinful generation  of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed  when he cometh in the glory of his Father  with the holy Angels      Sir Charles conducted my aunt to her coach  as Mr  Greville officiously  but properly for hi views  did me  We found Mr  Fenwick at Selby house talking to my grandmamma on the new subject  She dined with us  but
