the human heart could not devise anything more delicious  I only wish we may go on as we have begun  I have no wish of the kind  re plied I  it is contrary to my principles to allow that my benefactors should put themselves to so much expense on my account  it would be a downright fraud upon their benevolence  Besides  I could never feel myself at home with servants in the pay of other people  it is just like living in a lodging or an inn  Then it is to be remembered  that I did not come hither to live upon so expensive a scale  What occasion have we for so large an establishment of servants  Our utmost want  with Bertrand  is a cook  a scullion  and a footman  Though my secretary would not have been at all sorry to table for a continuance at the governor of Valencia s expense  he did not oppose his own luxurious taste to my moral delicacy  but conformed at once to my sentiments  and approved the reduction I was meditating to introduce  That point being decided  he left my chamber  and betook himself to his pillow in his own       CH  IV     A journey to Valencia  and a visit to the lords of Leyva  The conversation of the gentlemen  and Seraphina s demeanour   I GOT my clothes off as soon as possible  and went to bed  where  finding no great inclination to sleep  I communed with my own thoughts  The mutual attachment between the lords of Leyva and myself was uppermost in the various topics of my contemplation  With my heart full of their late kindness  I determined on setting out for their residence the next day  and quenching my impatience to thank them for their favours  Neither was it a slender gratification to anticipate another interview with Seraphina  though there was somewhat of alloy in that pleasure  it was impossible to reflect without shuddering  that I should at the same time have to encounter the glances of Dame Lorenza Sephora  who might not be greatly delighted at the renewal of our acquaintance  should her memory happen to stumble upon the circumstances connected with a certain box on the ear  With my mind exhausted by all these different suggestions  my eyelids at length closed  and the sun had peeped in at my window long before they turned upon their hinges   I was soon out of bed  and dressed myself with all possible expedition  in the earnest desire of prosecuting my intended journey  Just as I had finished my hasty operations  my secretary came into the room  Scipio  said I  you behold a man on the point of setting out for Valencia  I ought to lose no time in paying my respects to those noblemen to whom I am indebted for my little independence  Every moment of delay in the performance of this duty throws a new weight of ingratitude on my conscience  As for you  my friend  there is no necessity for your attendance  stay here during my absence  I shall come back to you within the space of a week  Heaven speed you  sir  answered he    be sure you do not slight Don Alphonso and his father    they seem to me to thrill with the kindly vibrations of friendship  and to be unbounded in their acknowledgment of obligation  gratitude and benevolence are so uncommon in people of rank  that they deserve to be made the most of where found  I sent a message to Bertrand  to hold himself in readiness for setting out  and took my chocolate while he was harnessing the mules  When all was prepared  I got into my carriage  after having directed my people to consider my secretary as master of the house in my absence  and to obey his orders as if they were my own   I got to Valencia in less than four hours  and drove at once to the governor s stables  where I alighted and left my equipage  On going to the house  I was informed that Don Caesar and his son were together  I did not wait for an introduction  but went in without ceremony  and addressing myself to both of them  Servants  said I  never send in their names to their masters  here is an old piece of family furniture  not ornamental indeed  but of a fashion when gratitude was neither out of date nor out of countenance  These words were accompanied with an effort to throw myself on my knees  but they anticipated my purpose  and embraced me one after the other with all possible evidence of sincere affection  Well  then  my dear Santillane  said Don Alphonso  you have been at Lirias to take possession of your little property  Yes  my lord  answered I  and my next request is  that you would be pleased to take it back again  What is your reason for that  replied he  Is there anything about it at all offensive to your taste  Not in the place itself  rejoined I  on the contrary  that is everything that my heart can wish  the only fault I have to find with it is  that the kitchen smells too strongly of the hierarchy  a lay Christian should not live like an
