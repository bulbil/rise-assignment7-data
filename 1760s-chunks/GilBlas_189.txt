get upon the road again without loss of time  reach Requena to night  and enter upon the territory of Valencia to morrow  where we will go to work full tilt at our old trade  I have some prognosticating twitches  which tell me that we shall strike some good strokes in that quarter  His colleague  from ample experience of his infallibility in such prophecies  voted on his side of the question  As for Don Alphonso and myself  having nothing to do but to follow the lead of these two worthy gentlemen  we waited  in silent acquiescence  the issue of this momentous debate   Thus it was determined that we should take the direction of Requena  and all hands were piped to make the necessary arrangements  We made our meal after the same fashion as in the morning  and the horse was laden with the bottle  and with the remnant of our provisions  After a time  the approach of night seemed to promise us that darkness so friendly  and even so necessary  to the safety of our retreat  and we were beginning our march through the wood  but before we had gone a hundred paces  a light among the trees gave us a subject of anxious speculation  What can be the meaning of that  said Don Raphael  these surely must be blood hounds of the police from Cuen√ßa  uncoupled and eager for the sport  with a fresh scent of us in this forest  and in full cry after their game  I am of a very different opinion  said Ambrose  they are more likely to be benighted travellers taking shelter in the thicket till daybreak  But there is no trusting to conjecture  I will examine into the real truth  Stay you here all three of you  I will be back again instantly  No sooner said than done  he stole  just as if he had been used to it  towards the light  which was not far off  no brute or human thief of forest or city could have done it better  With a gentle removal of the leaves and branches which obstructed his passage  the whole scene was laid open to his silent contemplation  and it afforded sufficient food  On the grass  round about a lighted candle with a clod for its candlestick  were seated four men  just finishing a meat pie  and hugging a pretty large bottle  which was at its last gasp  after having sustained their alternate embraces for successive rounds  At some paces from these gentry  he espied a lady and gentleman tied to the trees  and a little further off  a carriage with two mules richly caparisoned  He determined at once in his own mind that the fellows carousing on the ground were banditti  and the tenor of their talk assured him that he had not belied their trade by his conjecture  The four cut throats all avowed a like desire of possessing the female who had fallen into their hands  and they were proposing to draw lots for her  Lamela  having made himself master of the business  came back to us  and gave an exact account of all he had seen and heard   My friends  said Don Alphonso on his recital  that lady and gentleman whom the robbers have tied to trees  are probably persons of the first condition  Shall we suffer scoundrels like these to triumph over their honour and take away their lives  Put yourselves under my direction  let us assail the desperate outlaws  and they will perish under our attack  With all my heart  said Don Raphael  It is all one to me  I had just as soon engage on the right side as on the wrong  Ambrose  for his part  protested that he wished for nothing better than to lend a hand in so moral an enterprise  as it promised to combine much profit with some share of honour  And indeed  if a man may speak a good word for himself  danger stood better recommended than usual to my comprehension  all the boiling courage of knighthood  pledged up to the knuckles of the chin on the behalf of female innocence  was oozing out at every pore of this chivalrous person  But  if we are to state facts in the spirit of history rather than of romance  the danger was more in imagination than in reality  Lamela having brought us word that the arms of the robbers were all piled up at the distance of ten or twelve paces out of their reach  there was no difficulty in securing the mastery of the field  We tied our horses to a tree  and drew near  as softly as possible  to the spot where the robbers were seated  They were debating with some impetuosity  and their vociferous argument was all in favour of our covert attack  We got possession of their arms before they had any suspicion of us  But the enemy was nearer than they imagined  too near to miss aim  and they were all stretched lifeless on the ground   During the conflict the candle went out  so that we proceeded in our business by guess work  We were not remiss  however  in unbinding the prisoners  of whom fear had got such complete possession  that they had not their wits enough about them to thank us for what we had done for them  It
