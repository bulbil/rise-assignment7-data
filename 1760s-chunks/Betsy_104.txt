a fop  was both dangerous   and silly  and to flatter with vain hopes the sincere passion of a man   of honour  was equally ungenerous and cruel       These considerations were very favourable to Mr  Trueworth  she ran   through every particular of that gentleman s character and behaviour    and could find nothing which could make her stand excused  even to   herself  for continuing to treat him with the little seriousness she had   hitherto done        What  then  shall I do with him   said she to herself   Must I at once   discard him  desire him to desist his visits  and tell him I am   determined never to be his  or must I resolve to think of marrying him    and henceforward entertain him as the man who is really ordained to be   one day my husband  I have  at present  rather an aversion  than an   inclination to a wedded state  yet if my mind should alter on this   point  where shall I find a partner so qualified to make me happy in it    But yet   continued she   to become a matron at my years is what I   cannot brook the thoughts of  if he loves me  he must wait  it will be   sufficient to receive the addresses of no other  but  then  how shall I   refuse those who shall make an offer of them  without giving the world   room to believe I am pre engaged        Thus did she argue with herself  the dilemma appeared hard to her  but   what was the result of her reasoning  will best appear in the answer she   sent to Lady Trusty s letter  which was in the following terms             To Lady Trusty            Madam            I received the honour of yours  and sincerely thank you for the        good wishes and advice contained in it  be assured  Madam  I have a        just sense of the value I ought to set upon them  and shall        henceforth do the utmost in my power to deserve  I have  indeed  no        parent to direct  and but few faithful friends to guide me through        the perplexing labyrinth of life  I confess I have been too often        misled by the prevalence of example  and my own idle caprice  it        is  therefore  the highest charity to shew me to myself  I now see         and am ashamed of  the many inadvertencies I have been guilty of         The dangers which a young woman  like me  must necessarily be        continually exposed to  appear to me  from what you say of them  in        their proper colours  and convince me  that no person of        understanding would condemn me  if  to avoid so many threatened        ills  I flew to that asylum your ladyship has mentioned  I will own        to you yet farther  Madam  that I am not insensible of the merits        of Mr  Trueworth  nor of the advantages which would attend my        acceptance of his proposals  but  I know not how it is  I cannot        all at once bring myself into a liking of the marriage state  Be        assured of this  that I never yet have seen any man whom my heart        has been more inclined to favour  and that  at present  I neither        receive  nor desire the addresses of any other  There is no        answering for events  but  in the way of thinking I now am  it        seems not improbable  that I shall one day comply with what my        friends take so much pains in persuading me to  In the mean time  I        beseech you to believe I shall regulate my conduct so as to ease        you of all those apprehensions you are so good to entertain on my        account  I am  with a profound respect  Madam  your ladyship s most        obliged and most devoted servant            E  THOUGHTLESS
