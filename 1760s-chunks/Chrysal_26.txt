SUCCESS IN IT     My name is Traffic   I was the only son of a wealthy merchant in   London  who bred me to his own business  There was nothing   remarkable in my youth except that the characteristic passion of   my heart showed itself  in the very dawn of reason  in my eager    ness to engross and hoard up the baubles of my playmates  and   the far fetched schemes I laid to overreach them in all our little   bargains        Locke         6 ADVENTUBES OF A GUINEA     My father was at first delighted with this cunning  which his   foniiess took for the first essay of a great genius   but when he saw   me persist in it after I grew up  and attempt to practise the same   arts in the course of my business  it gave him serious alarms for my   future conduct   for he had ever been averse to these artifices    which are called the mysteries of commerce  and owed his success   solely to close application in the plain way of a fair trader      But this caution I looked upon with contempt  as timidity and   want of genius  and  undiscouraged by his constant repulses to all   Iny bold strokes and deep schemes which I was continually suggesting   to him  I resolved  when I should be at liberty  to indulge my own   inclinations  to strike out new ways that should afford me oppor    tunities of exerting my abilities in their fuU strength  and showing   them in their proper lustre      The vanity which prompted avarice to form these designs would   so often break out in boasting  that my father was fully acquainted   with them   and a sensible decHne in his health quickening his   apprehensions for me  his tenderness would omit nothing which   might show me my error in its proper light  and prevent my falling   into so destructive ways      Calling me therefore into his closet one morning  he addressed   me in these words â€” words which dear experience has now printed   deeply on my heart  though then they had no weight with me   â€”       My son    said he    the day approaches fast when you will be   in possession of the fruits of my honest industry  I leave you a   good fortune   and have the happiness to be able to tell you  in this   trying moment  that no wilful private wrong or public fraud makes   me wish it were by one peimy less  As  therefore  it was acquired   in the fear of God  if not abused  it will wear with His blessing    Habit had so wedded me to my business that I could not leave it   ofi myself   and I bred you to it  to indulge  as I thought  the bent   of your genius  and to prevent idleness from tempting youth to foUy    But now that dangerous season is past with you   and the labour   of my life has taken away all necessity of labour from yours  Be   wise  then  my son  and enjoy that happiness which Heaven offers   you without tempting a reverse  You will have riches  more than   enough for every natural want  for every rational wish   and it will   sweeten your enjoyment of them  and draw down the blessings of   Heaven on your head  to employ the superplus in acts of private   benevolence and pubhc spirit   in which best of emplojrments the   abilities with which you are so liberally blessed will find ample   room for their exertion  and your pious endeavours be rewarded   with a success that will be a happiness to your life and an honour   to your name        As for the profession of a merchant  to which you have been   bred  Heaven points it out to the inhabitants of this country by   our situation  nor can any other be more advantageous to it   but   stiU  even that advantage may be pursued too far  and the extreme   of industry may sink into avarice  and so disappoint its own end        For I must tell you  my son  that  though trade adds to the   wealth  yet too eager a pursuit of it  even with the greatest success   diminishes the strength of a nation  I am sensible that this is         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 7     against received opinion   but truth  when properly displayed  will   force conviction        The real strength of a nation consists in the prevalence of dis    interested spirit which  regardless of self  throws its weight
