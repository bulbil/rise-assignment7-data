rings  which she put within the grasp of this incorruptible minister  Though he was much such a judge of jewellery as myself  he had no doubt of the drops being real  as well as the pearls  These trinkets  said he  after having looked at them minutely  seem to be of good quality and fashion  and if the silver candlestick is thrown into the bargain  I would not answer for my own honesty  You had better not  said I in my turn to Camilla  for a trifle  reject so moderate and fair a composition  While uttering these words  I returned the taper to the old woman  and handed the candlestick over to Fabricio  who  stopping there because perhaps he espied nothing else that was portable in the room  said to the two women  Farewell  my dainty misses  set your hearts at rest  I will report you to his worship the corregidor  as purer than unsmutched snow  We can turn him round our finger  and never tell him the truth  but when we are not paid for our lies       CH  V     Sequel of the foregoing adventure  Gil Blas retires from practice  and from the neighbourhood of Valladolid   AFTER having thus carried Fabricio s plan into effect  we took our leave of Camilla s lodging  hugging ourselves on a success beyond our expectation  for we had only reckoned on the ring  We carried off without ceremony all we could get besides  Far from making it a point of conscience not to steal from a description of ladies whose names are commonly associated with rogues  we thought to cover some scores of other sins by so meritorious an action  Gentle men  said Fabricio  when we were in the street  my counsel is for returning to our tavern  and devoting the night to a regale  To morrow we will sell the candlestick  the necklace  the drop ear rings  and then share the prize money like brother adventurers  after which every man shall tramp home again  and make the best excuse he can to his master  His worship the alguazil s idea seemed equally bright and judicious  We returned rank and file to the tavern  some in the pious hope of finding a plausible excuse for having slept abroad  others in a desperate indifference about being turned out of doors without a character   We ordered a good supper to be got ready  and sat down to table with our physical and mental powers in full vigour  The relish was heightened by a thousand pleasant anecdotes  Fabricio  of all men in the world  having the happy knack of a chairman in a company of jovial spirits  kept the table in a roar  There escaped from him I know not how many charges of true Castilian wit  worth more either in the schools of philosophy or the exchange of commerce than the drug of Attic salt  While we were in a full peal of laughter  we were made to laugh on the other side of our mouths by an unforeseen occurrence  There appeared at table a man of no contemptible prowess  followed by two other as ill looking dogs as ever existed  After this specimen we had three others  and reckoned up to a dozen  marching in by triplets  They were armed with carbines  swords  and bayonets  We could not mistake their office  and were at no loss to guess their business  At first we had a mind to be refractory  but they beset us in an instant  and kept us under  as much by their numbers as by their weapons  Gentlemen  said the captain commandant in a jeering strain  I have been informed by what ingenious artifice you have recovered a ring from the custody of a lady no better than she should be  Undoubtedly  the device was admirable  and well deserves a civic crown  the patriotism of our police will not be found wanting  Justice  with her lodgings to let for gentry of your description  will not be deficient in her acknowledgments for so brilliant a display of genius  The company to whom this introductory address was directed  looked a little sheepish on the occasion  Our countenances fell  and Camilla had her full revenge  Fabricio  however  though pale and puzzled  made an attempt at a defence  Sir  said he  we did it in the innocence of our hearts  and  of course we shall be forgiven this not immoral fraud  What the devil  replied the commandant in a rage  do you call this a not immoral fraud  Moral or immoral  it may bring you to the gallows  Besides that the power of restitution is too sacred to be assumed by the individual  you have made away with a candlestick  a necklace  and a pair of drop ear rings  and what is worse  you have committed your rascalities in the livery of the law  Scoundrels dressing them selves up like the pillars of morality to undermine its very foundation  I shall wish you much joy if you are condemned to nothing worse than mowing the salt marsh  When he had impressed it on our convictions that the affair was even more serious than our first fears  we threw ourselves on his mercy  and implored him to have pity on
