every thing   relating to the behaviour of his beloved Edella   The other gentlemen   had also their fetters taken off  and the prince asked pardon of them   severally for the injury he had done them  then made them sit down and   partake of a handsome collation at that table  before which they had so   lately stood as delinquents at a bar       The Russians are excessive in their carouses  and prince Menzikoff being   now in an admirable good humour  made them drink very freely   to be the   more obliging to his guests  he began the king of Sweden s health in a   bumper of brandy  protesting at the same time  that tho  an enemy to his   master  he loved and venerated the hero  Horatio on this ventured to   enquire in what condition his majesty was  to which the prince replied    that being greatly wounded  he was obliged to leave the field  and  it   was believed  had took the load toward the dominions of the grand   signior  some of the Russian troops having pursued him as far as the   Borysthenes where  by the incredible valour of a few that attended him    they had been beat back       The Swedish officers knew it must be bad indeed when their king was   compelled to fly  and this renewed in them a melancholy  which it was   not in the power of liquor  or the present civilities of the prince to   dissipate  they also learned that the generals Renchild  Slipenbock    Hamilton  Hoorn  Leuenhaup  and Stackelburg  with the prince of   Wirtemburg  count Piper  and the flower of the whole army  were   prisoners at Muscow       The misfortune of these great men would have been very afflicting to   those who heard it  could any thing have given addition to what they   knew before   Prince Menzikoff was sensible of what they felt  and to   alleviate their grief  assured them that he would take upon him to give   them all their liberty  without even exacting a promise from them never   more to draw their swords against the czar  in case the king of Sweden   should ever be able to take the field again       So generous a proceeding both merited and received their utmost   acknowledgments  but he put an end to the serious demonstrations they   were about to make him of their gratitude  by saying   I pay you no more   than I owe you   I have wronged you   this is but part of the   retaliation I ought to make   besides  added he laughing  Mattakesa   promised Mullern his freedom  and as she has done me the good office    tho  undesignedly  of revealing to me her own treachery  I can do no   less than assist her in fulfilling  her covenant       To prove how much he was in earnest  he called his secretary  and   ordered him to make out their passports with all expedition  that they   might be ready to depart next morning  after which he made them repose   themselves in his palace the remainder of the night  which being in a   manner vastly different from what they had been accustomed to of a long   time  indeed ever since their quitting Alranstadt  they did not fail to   do  notwithstanding the discontent of their minds       Prince Menzikoff  being now convinced of the fidelity of Edella  passed   into her apartment  where the reconciliation between them took up so   much time  that it was near noon next day before he appeared  his new   guests had not quitted their chambers much sooner  but after reproaching   themselves for having been so tardy  went altogether to take leave of   the prince  and accept the passports he had been so good to order  As   they were got ready  he gave them immediately into their hands  and told   them  they were at liberty to quit Petersburg that moment  if they   pleased  or if they had any curiosity to take a view of that city  they   might gratify it  and begin their journey next morning  As it was now so   late in the day  they accepted his highness s offer  and walked out to   see a place which had excited so much admiration in the world  since   from a wild waste  in ten years time  a spacious and most beautiful city   had arose in the midst of war  and proved the genius of the founder   greater in civil than in military arts  tho  it must be owned he was   indefatigable in the study of both       The officers of the king of Sweden were entertained with the same   elegance and good humour they had been the night before
