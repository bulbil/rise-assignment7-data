of the offer made by Lady Betty  when we were in dreadful uncertainty  that her steward should make further enquiries about the   208 people at Paddington  Nothing worth mentioning has occurred from those enquiries  except confirming that the widow and her daughters are not people of bad characters  In all likelihood they thought they should intitle themselves to the thanks of all Miss Byron s friends  when the marriage was completed with a man of Sir Hargrave s fortune   The messenger that I sent to enquire after that Bagenhall s character  has informed us  that it is a very profligate one  and that he is an intimate of Sir Hargrave  But no more is necessary now  God be praised  to be said of him   The vile wretch himself  I hear  keeps his room  and it is whispered that he is more than half crazed  insomuch that his very attendants are afraid to go near him  We know not the nature of his hurt  but hurt he is  tho  in a fair way of recovery  He threatens  it seems  destruction to Sir Charles the moment he is able to go abroad  God preserve one of the worthiest and best of men   Sir Hargrave has turned off all the servants  we are told  that attended him on his shocking but happilydisappointed enterprize   Miss Byron intends to write to her Lucy by tomorrow s post  if she continue mending   an ample account of all that she suffered from the date of her last letter  to the hour of her happy deliverance  I am to give her minutes to the best of my recollection of what I have written to you  that so the account may be as complete as possible  and that she may write no more than is consistent with the series  which she is required to preserve  She begins this evening  she bids me tell you  that you may be as little a while in suppense about her as possible  But if she cannot finish by to morrow night  she will have an opportunity to dispatch her letter on Wednesday by a servant of Mr  Greville s  whom he left in town with some commissions  and who promises to call for any thing we may have to send to Selby house     209 Sir Rowland—But let my cousin write to you upon that and other matters  She knows what to say on that subject better than I do   Mean time I heartily congratulate every one of the dear family upon the return and safety of the darling of so many hearts  and remain  dear Mr  Selby   Your most faithful and obedient Servant  ARCHIBALD REEVES   LETTER XXIX  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Monday  Feb  20   IS it again given me to write to you  my Lucy  and in you  to all my revered friends  To write with chearfulness  To call upon you all to rejoice with me —God be praised   What dangers have I escaped  How have my head and my heart been affected  I dare not  as yet  think of the anguish you all endured for me   With what wretched levity did I conclude my last Letter  Giddy creature  that I was  vain and foolish   But let me begin my sad story  Your impatience all this while must be too painful  Only let me premise  that gaily as I boasted  when I wrote to you so conceitedly  as it might seem  of my dress  and of conquests  and I know not what nonsense  I took no pleasure at the place  in the shoals of fools that swam after me  I despised myself and them  Despised  I was shocked at both   Two Lucisers were among them  But the worst  the very worst Lucifer of all  appeared in a Harlequin dress  He hopped and skipt  and played the fool about me  and at last told me  He knew Miss Byron  and that he was  as he called himself  the despised  the rejected  Sir Hargrave Pollexfen     210 He behaved  however  with complaisance  and I had no apprehension of what I was to suffer from his villainy   Mr  Reeves has told you  that he saw me into the chair provided for me by my vile new servant  O my Lucy  One branch of my vanity is intirely lopt off  I must pretend to some sort of skill in physiognomy  Never more will I  for this fellow s sake  presume to depend on my judgment of peoples hearts framed from their countenances   Mr  Reeves has told you every thing about the chair  and the chairmen  How can I describe the misgivings of my heart when I first began to suspect treachery  But when I undrew the curtains  and found myself further deluded by another false heart  whose help I implored  and in the midst of fields  and soon after the lights put out  I pierced the night air with my screams  till I could scream no more  I was taken out in fits  And when I came a little to my senses  I found myself on a bed  three women about me  one at my
