out a box furnished with every variety of perfumes  She burned sweet smelling drugs  and perfumed my clothes with them  after which she drenched me in a deluge of essences  The fumigation and aspersion ended  this bountiful lady went herself and fetched from the kitchen bread  wine  and some good slices of roast mutton  set by on purpose for me  She forced me to eat  and taking a pleasure in waiting on me  sometimes carved for me  and some times filled my glass  in spite of all that Marcos and myself could do to anticipate her condescension  When I had done supper  the gentlemen of the orchestra struck the key note  and tuned their sweet voices to the pitch of their guitars  We played and sung to the heart s delight of Mergelina  To be sure we took care to carol none but amorous ditties  and as we sung  I every now and then leered at her with such a roguish meaning  as to throw oil upon the fire  for the game began to be interesting  The concert  though the acts were long  was not tedious  As for the lady  to whom hours seemed to fly like seconds  she could have been content to exhaust the night in listening  if the old squire  with whom the seconds seemed to lag like hours  had not hinted how late it was  She gave him the trouble of enforcing his moral on the lapse of time by at least ten repetitions  But she was in the hands of a man not to be turned aside from his purpose  he let her have no rest till I was gone  Sensible and provident as he was  seeing his mistress given up to a mad passion  he dreaded lest our harmony should be resolved by some discord  His fears were ominous  the physician  whether his mind misgave him of foul play  or the spirit of jealousy  hitherto on its good behaviour  had a mind to harass him gratuitously  bethought himself of quarrelling with our concerts  He did more  he put a broad negative upon them  and  without assigning his reasons for acting in this violent way  declared that he would suffer no more strangers to come about his premises   Marcos acquainted me with this mortifying declaration  particularly levelled against my rising hopes  I had begun bobbing at this dainty cherry  and did not like to lose my game  Nevertheless  to act the part of a faithful reporter and true historian  I must own my impatience did not affect my health or spirits  Not so with Mergelina  her feelings were more alive than ever  My dear Marcos  said she to her usher  it is only from you that I look for succour  Contrive  I beseech you  that I may see Diego in private  What do you require  asked the old man with a reproachful accent  I have been but too indulgent to you  I am not a person to crown your wanton wishes at the expense of my master s honour  your good fame  and my own eternal infamy  the infamy of a man whose past life has been one continued series of faithful service and exemplary conduct  I had rather leave the family than stay in it on such scandalous conditions  Alas  Marcos  interrupted the lady  frightened out of her wits at these last words  you wring my heart by talking in this manner  Obdurate man  Can you bear the thought of sacrificing her who lays all her present agony to your account  Give me back my former pride  and that savage soul you have taken from me  Why am I no longer happy in my very imperfections  I might now have been at peace  but your rash counsels have robbed me of the repose I then enjoyed  You  the corrector of my manners  have tampered with my morals    But why do I rave  unhappy wretch as I am  why upbraid you thus wrongfully  No  my guardian angel  you are not the fatal source of my miseries  my evil destiny had decreed these tortures to await me  Lay not to heart  I conjure you on my knees  these transports of a disordered imagination  Oh mercy  my passion drives me mad  have compassion on my weakness  you are my sole support and stay  if then my life is not indifferent to you  deny me not your aid   At these words her tears flowed in fresh torrents  and stifled her lugubrious accents  She took out her handkerchief  and throwing it over her face  fell into a chair  like a person overcome by her affliction  Old Marcos  who was perhaps one of the most tractable go betweens in the world  could no longer steel his heart against so touching a spectacle  Pierced to the quick  he even mingled his tears with those of his mistress  and spoke to her in a softened tone    Ah  madam  why are you thus bewitching  I cannot hold out against your sorrowful complaints  my virtue yields under the pressure of my pity  I promise you all the relief in my power  No longer do I marvel at the oblivious influence of passion over duty  since mere sympathy can mislead my footsteps from its thorny paths
