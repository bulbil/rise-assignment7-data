 19   I DIE to come to Bellfield again  my dear Rivers  I have a passion for your little wood  it is a mighty pretty wood for an English wood  but nothing to your Montmorencis  the dear little Silleri too       But to return to the shades of Bellfield  your little wood is charming indeed  not to particularize detached pieces of your scenery  the tout ensemble is very inviting  observe  however  I have no notion of paradise without an Adam  and therefore shall bring Fitzgerald with me next time        What could induce you  with this sweet little retreat  to cross that vile ocean to Canada  I am astonished at the madness of mankind  who can expose themselves to pain  misery  and danger  and range the world from motives of avarice and ambition  when the rural cot  the fanning gale  the clear stream  and flowery bank  offer such delicious enjoyments at home       You men are horrid  rapacious animals  with your spirit of enterprize  and your nonsense  ever wanting more land than you can cultivate  and more money than you can spend       That eternal pursuit of gain  that rage of accumulation  in which you are educated  corrupts your hearts  and robs you of half the pleasures of life       I should not  however  make so free with the sex  if you and my caro sposo were not exceptions       You two have really something of the sensibility and generosity of women       Do you know  Rivers  I have a fancy you and Fitzgerald will always be happy husbands  this is something owing to yourselves  and something to us  you have both that manly tenderness  and true generosity  which inclines you to love creatures who have paid you the compliment of making their happiness or misery depend entirely on you  and partly to the little circumstance of your being married to two of the most agreable women breathing        To speak en philosophe  my dear Rivers  you are not to be told  that the fire of love  like any other fire  is equally put out by too much or too little fuel       Now Emily and I  without vanity  besides our being handsome and amazingly sensible  to say nothing of our pleasing kind of sensibility  have a certain just idea of causes and effects  with a natural blushing reserve  and bridal delicacy  which I am apt to flatter myself       Do you understand me  Rivers  I am not quite clear I understand myself       All that I would insinuate is  that Emily and I are  take us for all in all  the two most charming women in the world  and that  whoever leaves us  must change immensely for the worse       I believe Lucy equally pleasing  but I think her charms have not so good a subject to work upon        Temple is a handsome fellow  and loves her  but he has not the tenderness of heart that I so much admire in two certain youths of my acquaintance       He is rich indeed  but who cares       Certainly  my dear Rivers  nothing can be more absurd  or more destructive to happiness  than the very wrong turn we give our childrens imaginations about marriage       If miss and master are good  she is promised a rich husband  and a coach and six  and he a wife with a monstrous great fortune       Most of these fine promises must fail  and where they do not  the poor things have only the consolation of finding  when too late to retreat  that the objects to which all their wishes were pointed have really nothing to do with happiness       Is there a nabobess on earth half as happy as the two foolish little girls about whom I have been writing  though married to such poor devils as you and Fitzgerald  Certainement no        And so ends my sermon        Adieu   Your most obedient    A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CCIII   203   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Temple house  Rutland   Bellfield  Oct  21   YOU ridicule my enthusiasm  my dear Temple  without considering there is no exertion of the human mind  no effort of the understanding  imagination  or heart  without a spark of this divine fire       Without enthusiasm  genius  virtue  pleasure  even love itself  languishes  all that refines  adorns  softens  exalts  ennobles life  has its source in this animating principle       I glory in being an enthusiast in every thing  but in nothing so much as in my tenderness for this charming woman       I am a perfect Quixote in love  and would storm enchanted castles  and fight giants  for my Emily       Coldness of temper damps every spring that moves the human heart  it is equally an enemy to pleasure  riches  fame  to all which is worth living for       I thank you for your wishes that I was rich  but am by no means anxious myself on the subject
