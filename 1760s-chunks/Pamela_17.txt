 and her hard fate   Your honour knows you went too far for a   master to a servant  or even to his equal  and I cannot bear it  So I   fell a crying most sadly       Mrs  Jervis began to excuse me  and to beg he would pity a poor maiden    that had such a value for her reputation  He said  I speak it to her   face  I think her very pretty  and I thought her humble  and one that   would not grow upon my favours  or the notice I took of her  but I abhor   the thoughts of forcing her to any thing  I know myself better  said he    and what belongs to me  And to be sure I have enough demeaned myself to   take notice of such a one as she  but I was bewitched by her  I think    to be freer than became me  though I had no intention to carry the jest   farther       What poor stuff was all this  my dear mother  from a man of his sense    But see how a bad cause and bad actions confound the greatest wits   It   gave me a little more courage then  for innocence  I find  in a low   fortune  and weak mind  has many advantages over guilt  with all its   riches and wisdom       So I said  Your honour may call this jest or sport  or what you please    but indeed  sir  it is not a jest that becomes the distance between a   master and a servant  Do you hear  Mrs  Jervis  said he  do you hear the   pertness of the creature  I had a good deal of this sort before in the   summer house  and yesterday too  which made me rougher with her than   perhaps I had otherwise been       Says Mrs  Jervis  Pamela  don t be so pert to his honour  you should   know your distance  you see his honour was only in jest   O dear Mrs    Jervis  said I  don t you blame me too  It is very difficult to   keep one s distance to the greatest of men  when they won t keep it   themselves to their meanest servants       See again  said he  could you believe this of the young baggage  if you   had not heard it  Good your honour  said the well meaning gentlewoman    pity and forgive the poor girl  she is but a girl  and her virtue is   very dear to her  and I will pawn my life for her  she will never be   pert to your honour  if you ll be so good as to molest her no more  nor   frighten her again  You saw  sir  by her fit  she was in terror  she   could not help it  and though your honour intended her no harm  yet the   apprehension was almost death to her  and I had much ado to bring her to   herself again  O the little hypocrite  said he  she has all the arts of   her sex  they were born with her  and I told you awhile ago you did   not know her  But this was not the reason principally of my calling you   before me together  I find I am likely to suffer in my reputation by the   perverseness and folly of this girl  She has told you all  and perhaps   more than all  nay  I make no doubt of it  and she has written letters    for I find she is a mighty letter writer   to her father and mother    and others  as far as I know  in which representing herself as an   angel of light  she makes her kind master and benefactor  a devil   incarnate   O how people will sometimes  thought I  call themselves by   their right names    And all this  added he  I won t hear  and so I am   resolved she shall return to the distresses and poverty she was taken   from  and let her be careful how she uses my name with freedom  when she   is gone from me       I was brightened up at once with these welcome words  and I threw myself   upon my knees at his feet  with a most sincere glad heart  and I said    May your honour be for ever blessed for your resolution  Now I shall   be happy  And permit me  on my bended knees  to thank you for all the   benefits and favours you have heaped upon me  for the opportunities I   have had of improvement and learning  through my good lady s means  and   yours  I will now forget all your
