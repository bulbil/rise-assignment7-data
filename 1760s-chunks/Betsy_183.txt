with a wife  yet I must tell you a   fortune is a very pretty thing  children may come  and a younger brood   must be provided for         You argue very reasonably indeed   replied Mr  Trueworth   but  pray     pursued he   as you are so sensible of this lady s perfections  how   happened it that you never made your addresses to her yourself     I was   not sure she would like me so well as she does you   said he   besides    to let you into the secret  my heart was engaged before I ever saw her   face  and my person had been so too by this time  but for an unlucky rub   in my way         What  Sir Bazil  honourably in love   cried Mr  Trueworth   Aye    Charles  There is no resisting destiny   answered he   I that have   ranged through half the sex in search of pleasure  doated on the beauty   of one  the wit of another  admired by turn their different charms  have   at last found one in whom all I could wish in woman is comprized  and to   whom I an unalterably fixed  beyond  even  I think  a possibility of   change         May I be trusted with the name of this admirable person   said Mr    Trueworth   and what impedes your happiness     You shall know all     replied Sir Bazil   in the first place  she is called Miss   Mable     What  Miss Mable of Bury Street   cried Mr  Trueworth hastily     The same   replied Sir Bazil   you know her  then     I have seen her     said Mr  Trueworth   in company with a lady I visited some time ago  and   believe she is  in reality  the original of that amiable picture you   have been drawing         It rejoices me  however  that you approve my choice   said Sir Bazil     but her father is  without exception  the most sordid  avaricious   wretch  breathing  he takes more pleasure in counting over his bags than   in the happiness of an only child  he seems glad of an alliance with   me  encourages my pretensions to his daughter  is ready to give her to   me to morrow  if I please  yet refuses to part with a single shilling of   her portion till he can no longer keep it  that is  he will secure to me   ten thousand pounds after his decease  and adds  by way of cajole  that    perhaps  he will then throw in a better penny  but is positively   determined to make no diminution of his substance while he lives    These   continued he   are the only terms on which he will give his   consent  and this it is which has so long delayed my marriage        Mr  Trueworth could not here forbear making some reflections on the   cruelty and injustice of those parents who  rather than divide any part   of their treasures with their children  suffer them to let slip the only   crisis that could make their happiness  After which  Sir Bazil went on   in his discourse        It is not   said he   that I would not gladly accept my charming girl   on the conditions the old miser offers  or even without any farther   hopes of what he promises to do for her  but I am so unhappily   circumstanced as to be under a necessity of having ready money with a   wife  old Sir Bazil  my father  gave my elder sister six thousand pounds   on her marriage with Mr  Wellair  and  I suppose  to shew his affection   to both his daughters was equal  bequeathed at his death the same sum to   Harriot  and this to be charged on the estate  notwithstanding it was   then under some other incumbrances  She can make her demand  either on   coming of age  or on the day of marriage  which ever happens first  the   one  indeed  is three years distant  she being but eighteen  but who   knows how soon the other may happen  It is true  she seems at present   quite averse to changing her condition  but that is not to be depended   upon  all young women are apt to talk in that strain  but when once the   favourite man comes into view  away at once with resolution and   virginity        Mr  Trueworth now ceased to wonder at the little satisfaction Sir Bazil
