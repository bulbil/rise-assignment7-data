 does it  my good Dr  Bartlett  especially as so many considerable families have seats there  I would not seem guilty of a false modesty  which  breaking out into singularity  would give the suspicion of a wrong direction  in cases where it may be of use to suppose a right one   What can I do in relation to my Emily  She is of the stature of woman  She ought  according to the present taste  to be introduced into public life  I am not fond of that life  And what knowlege she will gain by the introduction  she had better be without  Yet I think we should conform something to the tas e of the times in which we live  Women s minds have generally a lighter turn than those of men  They should be innocently indulged  And on this principle it was  that last winter I attended her  and my sisters  very often to the places of public entertainment  that she  having seen every thing that was the general subject of polite conversation  might judge of such entertainments as they deserve  and not add expectation  which runs very high in young minds  and is seldom answered  to the ideal seenes  This indulgence answered as I wish  Emily can now hear talk of the emulation of actors and managers  and of the other public diversions  with tranquillity  and be satisfied  as she reads  with representing over again to herself the parts in which the particular actors excelled  And thus a boundary is set to her imagination  and   12 that by her own choice  for she thinks lightly of them  when she can be obliged by the company of my two sisters and Lord L   But new scenes will arise  in an age so studious as this  to gratify the eye and the ear  From these a young woman of fortune must not be totally excluded  I am a young man  and as Emily is so well grown for her years  I think I cannot so properly be her introducer to them  as I might  were I fifteen or twenty years older   I live to my own heart  and I know  I think I do  that it is not a bad one  But as I cannot intend anything with regard to my Emily  I must  for her sake  be more observant of the world s opinion  than I hope I need to be for my own  You have taught me  that it is not good manners to despise the world s opinion  tho  we should regard it only in the second place   Emily has too large a fortune  I have an high opinion of her discretion  But she is but a girl  Womens eyes are wanderers  And too often bring home guests that are very troublesome to them  and whom once introduced  they cannot get out of the house   I wish she had only ten thousand pounds  She would then stand a better chance for happiness  than she can do  I doubt  with five times ten  and would have five persons  to one that she has now  to choose out of  For how few are there who can make proposals to the father or guardian of a girl who has 50  000 l    Indeed there are not wanting in our sex forward spirits  who will think that sum not too much for their merits  tho  they may not deserve 5000 l  nor even one  And hence arises the danger of a woman of great fortune from those who will not dare to make proposals to a guardian  After an introduction  and how easy is that now made  at public places   a woman of the greatest fortune is but a woman  and is to be attacked  and prevailed upon  by the same methods   13 which succeed with a person of the slenderest  and perhaps is won with equal  if not with greater ease  since  if the lady has a little romance in her head  and her Lover a great deal of art and flattery  she will call that romantic turn generosity  and  thinking she can lay the man who has obtained her attention  under obligation  she will meet him her full halfway   Emily is desirous to be constantly with us  My sister is very obliging  I know she will comply with whatever I shall request of her  in relation to Emily  But where the reputation of a lady is concerned  a man should not depend too much upon his own character  especially a young man  be it ever so unexceptionable  Her mother has already given out foolish hints  She demands her daughter  The unhappy woman has no regard to truth  Her own character lost  and so deservedly  will she have any tenderness for that of Emily  Who will scruple to believe  what a mother  tho  ever so wicked  will report of her daughter under twenty  and her guardian under thirty  if they live constantly together  Her guardian  at the same time  carrying his heart in his countenance  and loving the girl  though with as much innocence as if she were his sister  Once I had thoughts of craving the assistance of the
