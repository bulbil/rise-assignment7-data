 with the approbation of her charge  assented to his proposal of having  something for supper   This was a great point which our adventurer had gained  and yet he  plainly perceived that the governante mistook his meaning  by giving  herself credit for all the passion he had professed  As this error could  be rectified by no other means than those of plying her with the bottle   until her distinguishing faculties should be overpowered  he promoted  a quick circulation  She did him justice  without any manifest signs of  inebriation  so long  that his own eyes began to reel in the sockets   and he found that before his scheme could be accomplished  he should  be effectually unfitted for all the purposes of love  He therefore had  recourse to his valet de chambre  who understood the hint as soon as it  was given  and readily undertook to perform the part of which his master  had played the prelude  This affair being settled to his satisfaction   and the night at odds with morning  he took an opportunity of imparting  to the ear of this aged dulcinea a kind whisper  importing a promise of  visiting her when his sister should be retired to her own chamber  and  an earnest desire of leaving her door unlocked   This agreeable intimation being communicated  he conveyed a caution of  the same nature to Mrs  Hornbeck  as he led her to her apartment  and  darkness and silence no sooner prevailed in the house  than he and his  trusted squire set out on their different voyages  Everything would have  succeeded according to their wish  had not the valet de chambre suffered  himself to fall asleep at the side of his inamorata  and  in the  agitation of a violent dream  exclaimed in a voice so unlike that of her  supposed adorer  that she distinguished the difference at once  Waking  him with a pinch and a loud shriek  she threatened to prosecute him  for a rape  and reviled him with all the epithets her rage and  disappointment could suggest   The Frenchman  finding himself detected  behaved with great temper and  address  he begged she would compose herself  on account of her own  reputation  which was extremely dear to him  protesting that he had a  most inviolable esteem for her person  His representations had weight  with the duenna  who  upon recollection  comprehended the whole  affair  and thought it would be her interest to bring matters to an    6 22 15  3 45 PM   accommodation  She therefore admitted the apologies of her bed fellow   provided he would promise to atone by marriage for the injury she had  sustained  and in this particular he set her heart at ease by repeated  vows  which he uttered with surprising volubility  though without any  intention to perform the least title of their contents   Peregrine  who had been alarmed by her exclamation  and ran to the  door with a view of interposing according to the emergency of the case   overhearing the affair thus compromised  returned to his mistress  who  was highly entertained with an account of what had passed  foreseeing  that for the future she should be under no difficulty or restriction  from the severity of her guard   CHAPTER LX    Hornbeck is informed of his Wife s Adventure with Peregrine  for whom he  prepares a Stratagem  which is rendered ineffectual by the Information  of Pipes  The Husband is ducked for his Intention  and our Hero  apprehended by the Patrol   There was another person  however  still ungained  and that was no other  than her footman  whose secrecy our hero attempted to secure in the  morning by a handsome present  which he received with many professions  of gratitude and devotion to his service  yet this complaisance was  nothing but a cloak used to disguise the design he harboured of making  his master acquainted with the whole transaction  Indeed this lacquey  had been hired  not only as a spy upon his mistress  but also as a check  on the conduct of the governante  with promise of ample reward if ever  he should discover any sinister or suspicious practices in the course of  her behaviour  As for the footman whom they had brought from England   he was retained in attendance upon the person of his master  whose  confidence he had lost by advising him to gentle methods of reclaiming  his lady  when her irregularities had subjected her to his wrath   The Flemish valet  in consequence of the office he had undertaken  wrote  to Hornbeck by the first post  giving an exact detail of the adventure  at Versailles  with such a description of the pretended brother as left  the husband no room to think he could be any other person than his first  dishonourer  and exasperated him to such a degree  that he resolved  to lay an ambush for this invader  and at once disqualify him from  disturbing his repose  by maintaining further correspondence with his  wife   Meanwhile the lovers enjoyed themselves without restraint  and  Peregrine s plan of inquiry after his dear unknown was
