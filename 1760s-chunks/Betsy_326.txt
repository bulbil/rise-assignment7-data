  commiseration on the insensible dead  but will reserve some part        for the living  who stand most in need of it  I dare add no more as        yet  than that I am  with an esteem perfect and inviolable  Madam         your most obedient  most devoted  and most faithful servant            C  TRUEWORTH        These few lines  perhaps  served more to raise the spirits of Mrs    Munden than all she could receive from any other quarter  she   nevertheless persevered in maintaining the decorum of her condition  and   as she had resolved to retire into L    e in case of a separation from   her husband  she thought it most proper to fix her residence in that   place in her state of widowhood  at least for the first year of it       Accordingly  she wrote to Lady Trusty to acquaint her with her   intentions  and received an answer such as she expected  full of praises   for her conduct in this point  and the most pressing invitations to come   down with all the speed she could       What little business she had in London was soon dispatched  and all was   ready for her quitting it within a month after the death of Mr  Munden    places for herself and her maid were taken in the stagecoach  all her   things were packed up  and sent to the inn  she thought nothing now   remained but to take leave of Lady Loveit  whom she expected that same   evening  being the last she was to stay in town  but  near as her   departure was  fortune in the mean time had contrived an accident  which   put all her fortitude  and presence of mind  to as great a trial as she   had ever yet sustained       Lady Loveit  having got a cold  had complained of some little disorder   the day before  and though nothing could be more slight than her   indisposition  yet  as she was pretty far advanced in her pregnancy  the   care of her physician  and the tenderness of Sir Bazil  would not permit   her by any means to expose herself to the open air       Mrs  Munden being informed by a messenger from her of what had happened    found herself under an absolute necessity of waiting on her  as it would   have been ridiculous and preposterous  as well as unkind  to have   quitted the town for so long a time without taking leave of a friend   such as Lady Loveit       She could not think of going there without reflecting at the same time   how strong a probability there was of meeting Mr  Trueworth  she knew    indeed  that he did not live at Sir Bazil s  having heard he had lately   taken a house for himself  but she knew also  that his close connection   with that family made him seldom let slip a day without seeing them  she   therefore prepared herself as well as she was able for such an   interview  in case it should so happen       That gentleman had dined there  and on finding Lady Loveit was forbid   going abroad  and Sir Bazil unwilling to leave her alone  had consented   to stay with them the whole day  they were at ombre when Mrs  Munden   came  but on her entrance threw aside the cards  Lady Loveit received   her according to the familiarity between them  and Sir Bazil with little   less freedom  but Mr  Trueworth saluted her with a more distant air   I   had not the honour  Madam   said he   to make you any compliments on   either of the great changes you have undergone  but you have always had   my best wishes for your prosperity        Mrs  Munden  who had pretty well armed herself for this encounter    replied with a voice and countenance tolerably well composed   Great   changes indeed  Sir  have happened to us both in a short space of   time     There have so  Madam   resumed he   but may the next you meet   with bring with it lasting happiness   She easily comprehended the   meaning of these words  but made no answer  being at loss what to say    which might neither too much embolden  nor wholly discourage  the motive   which dictated them       After this  the conversation turned on various subjects  but chiefly on   that of Mrs  Munden s going out of town  Mr  Trueworth said little  Lady   Loveit  though she expressed an infinite deal of sorrow for the loss
