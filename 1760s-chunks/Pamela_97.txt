Well    said she  I see thou art quite unfathomable       I don t like all this  O my foolish fears of bulls and robbers   For now   all my uneasiness begins to double upon me  O what has this incautious   man said  That  no doubt  is the subject of her long letter       I will close this day s writing  with just saying  that she is mighty   silent and reserved  to what she was  and says nothing but No  or Yes    to what I ask  Something must be hatching  I doubt   I the rather think   so  because I find she does not keep her word with me  about lying   by myself  and my money  to both which points she returned suspicious   answers  saying  as to the one  Why  you are mighty earnest for your   money  I shan t run away with it  And to the other  Good lack  you need   not be so willing  as I know of  to part with me for a bed fellow  till   you are sure of one you like better  This cut me to the heart  and  at   the same time  stopped my mouth          Tuesday  Wednesday       Mr  Williams has been here  but we have had no opportunity to talk   together  He seemed confounded at Mrs  Jewkes s change of temper  and   reservedness  after her kind visit  and their freedom with one another    and much more at what I am going to tell you  He asked  If I would take   a turn in the garden with Mrs  Jewkes and him  No  said she  I can t go    Said he  May not Mrs  Pamela take a walk   No  said she  I desire she   won t  Why  Mrs  Jewkes  said he  I am afraid I have somehow disobliged   you  Not at all  replied she  but I suppose you will soon be at liberty   to walk together as much as you please  and I have sent a messenger for   my last instructions  about this and more weighty matters  and when they   come I shall leave you to do as you both will  but  till then  it is no   matter how little you are together  This alarmed us both  and he seemed   quite struck of a heap  and put on  as I thought  a self accusing   countenance  So I went behind her back  and held my two hands together    flat  with a bit of paper  I had  between them  and looked at him    and he seemed to take me as I intended  intimating the renewing of the   correspondence by the tiles       I left them both together  and retired to my closet to write a letter   for the tiles  but having no time for a copy  I will give you the   substance only       I expostulated with him on his too great openness and easiness to fall   into Mrs  Jewkes s snares  told him my apprehensions of foul play  and   gave briefly the reasons which moved me  begged to know what he had   said  and intimated  that I thought there was the highest reason to   resume our prospect of the escape by the back door  I put this in the   usual place in the evening  and now wait with impatience for an answer          Thursday       I have the following answer           DEAREST MADAM        I am utterly confounded  and must plead guilty to all your just   reproaches  I wish I were master of all but half your caution and   discretion  I hope  after all  this is only a touch of this ill woman s   temper  to shew her power and importance  For I think Mr  B     neither   can nor dare deceive me in so black a manner  I would expose him all the   world over if he did  But it is not  cannot be in him  I have received   a letter from John Arnold  in which he tells me  that his master is   preparing for his London journey  and believes  afterwards  he will come   into these parts  But he says  Lady Davers is at their house  and is to   accompany her brother to London  or meet him there  he knows not which    He professes great zeal and affection to your service  and I find he   refers to a letter he sent me before  but which is not come to my hand    I think there
