my anger  Yet sir  I am descended from a family that would not have borne this  And so  thou vile thing  to gratify a momentary passion  thou hast made one poor creature wretched for life  and polluted a family that had nothing but honour for their portion     If she or you    returned he    are resolved to be miserable  I cannot help it  But you may still be happy  and whatever opinion you may have formed of me  you shall ever find me ready to contribute to it  We can readily marry her to another  and what is more  she may keep her lover beside  for I protest I shall ever continue to have a true regard for her    Page  81  I found all my passions awakened at this new degrading proposal  for though the mind may often be calm under great injuries  little villainy can at any time get within the soul  and sting it into rage —     Avoid my sight  thou reptile    cried I    nor continue to insult me with thy presence  Were my brave son at home  he would not suffer this  but I am old  and disabled  and every way undone     I find    cried he    you are bent upon obliging me to talk in an harsher manner than I intended  But as I have shewn you what may be hoped from my friendship  it may not be improper to represent what may be the consequences of my resentment  My attorney  to whom your late bond has heen transferred  threatens hard  nor do I know how to prevent the course of justice  except by paying the money myself  which  as I have been at some expences lately  previous  Page  82  to my intended marriage  it is not so easy to be done  And then my steward talks of driving for the rent  it is certain he knows his duty  for I never trouble myself with affairs of that nature  Yet still I could wish to serve you  and even to have you and your daughter present at my marriage  which is shortly to be solemnized with Miss Wilmot  it is even the request of my charming Arabella herself  whom I hope you will not refuse     Mr  Thornhill    replied I    hear me once for all  as to your marriage with any but my daughter  that I never will consent to  and though your friendship could raise me to a throne  or your resentment sink me to the grave  yet would I despise both  Thou hast once wofully  irreparably  deceived me  I reposed my heart upon thine honour  and have found its baseness  Never  Page  83  more  therefore  expect friendship from me  Go  and possess what fortune has given thee  beauty  riches  health  and pleasure  Go  and leave me to want  infamy  disease  and sorrow  Yet humbled as I am  shall my heart still vindicate its dignity  and though thou hast my forgiveness  thou shalt ever have my contempt     If so    returned he    depend upon it you shall feel the effects of this insolence  and we shall shortly see which is the fittest object of scorn  you or me    —Upon which he departed abruptly   My wife and son  who were present at this interview  seemed terrified with the apprehension  My daughters also  finding that he was gone  came out to be informed of the result of our conference  which  when known  alarmed them not less than the rest  But as to myself  I disregarded  Page  84  the utmost stretch of his malevolence  he had already struck the blow  and now I stood prepared to repel every new effort  Like one of those instruments used in the art of war  which  however thrown  still presents a point to receive the enemy     We soon  however  found that he had not threatened in vain  for the very next day his steward came to demand my annual rent  which  by the train of accidents already related  I was unable to pay  The consequence of my incapacity was his driving my cattle that evening  and their being appraised and sold the next day for less than half their value  My wife and children now therefore entreated me to comply upon any terms  rather than incur certain destruction  They even begged of me to admit his visits once more  and used all their little eloquence to paint the calamities I was going to endure  The terrors of  Page  85  a prison  in so rigorous a season as the present  with the danger that threatened my health from the late accident that happened by the fire  But I continued inflexible      Why  my treasures    cried I    why will you thus attempt to persuade me to the thing that is not right  My duty has taught me to forgive him  but my conscience will not permit me to approve  Would you have
