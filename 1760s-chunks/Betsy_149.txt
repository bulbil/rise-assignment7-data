this subject with a very grave air  pretended   business  and took his leave somewhat abruptly for a man of that   politeness I had till now always observed in him         He carries it off with a high hand  indeed   cried Miss Betsy   but it   is no matter  I shall give myself no trouble whether he stays in town    or whether he goes into the country  or whether I ever see him more    What  does the man think to triumph over me         I do not believe that is the case with Mr  Trueworth   said the   discreet Miss Mabel   but I know it is the way of many men to   recriminate in this manner  and pray  when they do  who can we blame for   it but ourselves  in giving them the occasion  For my part  I should   think it an affront to myself to encourage the addresses of a person I   did not look upon worthy of being treated with respect        She urged many arguments to convince Miss Betsy of the vanity and ill   consequences of trifling with an honourable and sincere passion  which    though no more than what that young lady had already made use of to   herself  and was fully persuaded in the truth of  she was not very well   pleased to hear from the mouth of another       Though these two ladies perfectly agreed in their sentiments of virtue   and reputation  yet their dispositions and behaviour in the affairs of   love were as widely different as any two persons possibly could be  and   this it was  which  during the course of their acquaintance  gave   frequent interruptions to that harmony between them  which the mutual   esteem they had for each other s good qualities  would otherwise have   rendered perpetual                CHAPTER XIX       Is multum in parvo          There is an unaccountable pride in human nature  which often gets the   better of our justice  and makes us espouse what we know within   ourselves is wrong  rather than appear to be set right by any reason    except our own       Miss Betsy had too much of this unhappy propensity in her composition  a   very little reflection enabled her to see clearly enough the mistakes   she sometimes fell into  but she could not bear they should be seen by   others  Miss Mabel was not only in effect the most valuable of all the   ladies she conversed with  but was also the most esteemed and loved by   her  yet was she less happy and delighted in her company  than in that   of several others  for whom her good sense would not suffer her to have   the least real regard  The truth is  that though she was very well   convinced of her errors  in relation to those men who professed   themselves her admirers  yet she loved those errors in herself  thought   they were pretty  and became her  and therefore  as she could not as yet   resolve to alter her mode of behaviour  was never quite easy in the   presence of any one who acted with a prudence she would not be at the   pains to imitate       There were two young ladies  who had an apartment at the palace of St    James s   their father having an office there  who exactly suited with   her in the most volatile of her moments  they had wit  spirit  and were   gay almost to wildness  without the least mixture of libertinism or   indecency  How perfectly innocent they were  is not the business of this   history to discuss  but they preserved as good a reputation as their   neighbours  and were well respected in all publick places       There it was Miss Betsy chiefly found an asylum from those perplexing   thoughts which  in spite of her pride  and the indifference she had for   mankind  would sometimes intrude upon her mind on Mr  Trueworth s   account  here she was certain of meeting a great variety of company    here was all the news and scandal the town could furnish  here was   musick  dancing  feasting  flattery  in fine  here was every thing that   was an enemy to care and contemplation       Among the number of those who filled the circle of those two court   belles  there was a gentleman named Munden  he appeared extremely   charmed with Miss Betsy at first sight  and after having informed   himself of the particulars of her family and fortune  took an   opportunity  as he was conducting her home one night  to entreat she
