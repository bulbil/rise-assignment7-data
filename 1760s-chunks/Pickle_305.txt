such an abrupt account of your having done violence upon yourself    Peregrine  confounded at this imputation  stood silent  with a most  savage aspect of surprise  eager to know the circumstance to which  his accuser alluded  and incensed to find it beyond the sphere of his  comprehension   While these two irritated friends stood fronting each other with mutual  indignation in their eyes and attitudes  they were joined by Pipes  who   without taking the least notice of the situation in which he found them   told his master  that he might up with the top gallant masts of his  heart  and out with his rejoicing pendants  for as to Miss Emily  he  had clapped her helm aweather  the vessel wore  and now she was upon the  other tack  standing right into the harbour of his good will  Peregrine   who was not yet a connoisseur in the terms of his lacquey  commanded  him  upon pain of his displeasure  to be more explicit in his  intelligence  and by dint of divers questions  obtained a perfect  knowledge of the scheme which he had put in execution for his service   This information perplexed him not a little  he would have chastised  his servant upon the spot for his temerity  had he not plainly perceived    6 22 15  3 45 PM   that the fellow s intention was to promote his case and satisfaction   and  on the other hand  he knew not how to acquit himself of the  suspicion which he saw Godfrey entertain of his being the projector of  the plan  without condescending to an explanation  which his present  disposition could not brook  After some pause  however  turning to Pipes  with a severe frown   Rascal   said he   this is the second time I have  suffered in the opinion of that lady  by your ignorance and presumption   if ever you intermeddle in my affairs for the future  without express  order and direction  by all that s sacred  I will put you to death  without mercy  Away  and let my horse be saddled this instant    Pipes having withdrawn  in order to perform this piece of duty  our  young gentleman  addressing himself again to the soldier  and laying  his hand upon his breast  said  with a solemnity of regard   Captain  Gauntlet  upon my honour  I am altogether innocent of that shallow  device which you impute to my invention  and I don t think you do  justice either to my intellect or honour  in supposing me capable of  such insolent absurdity  As for your sister  I have once in my life  affronted her in the madness and impetuosity of desire  but I have made  such acknowledgments  and offered such atonement  as few women of her  sphere would have refused  and before God I am determined to endure  every torment of disappointment and despair  rather than prostrate  myself again to the cruelty of her unjustifiable pride   So saying  he  stalked suddenly down stairs  and took horse immediately  his spirits  being supported by resentment  which prompted him to vow within himself   that he would seek consolation for the disdain of Emilia  in the  possession of the first willing wench he should meet upon the road   While he set out for the garrison with these sentiments  Gauntlet  in a  suspense between anger  shame  and concern  returned to the house of his  father in law  where he found his sister still violently agitated  from the news of Peregrine s death  the mystery of which he forthwith  unravelled  recounting at the same time the particulars of the  conversation which had happened at the inn  and describing the demeanour  of Pickle with some expressions of asperity  which were neither  agreeable to Emilia  nor approved by the gentle Sophy  who tenderly chid  him  for allowing Peregrine to depart in terms of misunderstanding   CHAPTER LXXXVII   Peregrine sets out for the Garrison  and meets with a Nymph of the Road   whom he takes into Keeping  and metamorphoses into a fine Lady   In the meantime  our hero jogged along in a profound reverie  which  was disturbed by a beggar woman and her daughter  who solicited him  for alms  as he passed them on the road  The girl was about the age  of sixteen  and  notwithstanding the wretched equipage in which she  appeared  exhibited to his view a set of agreeable features  enlivened  with the complexion of health and cheerfulness  The resolution I have  already mentioned was still warm in his imagination  and he looked upon  this young mendicant as a very proper object for the performance of his  vow  He  therefore  entered into a conference with the mother  and for    6 22 15  3 45 PM   a small sum of money purchased her property in the wench  who did not  require much courtship and entreaty  before she consented to accompany  him to any place that he should appoint for her habitation   This contract being settled to his
