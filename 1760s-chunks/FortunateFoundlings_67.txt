 but   would have been swayed by this consideration  and chose rather to see   another become the prey of perfidy and deceit  than fall the victim of   jealousy herself  but the generosity of her nature would not suffer it   to have any weight with her  and she thought she could be more easy   under any misfortunes the discovery might involve her in  than in the   consciousness of not having discharged the obligations of duty and   gratitude in revealing what seemed so necessary to be known       With this resolution  finding Melanthe was not come home  she went into   her chamber in order to wait her return  and relate the whole history to   her as she should undress for bed  But hour after hour elapsing without   any appearance of the person she expected  she thought to beguile the   tedious time by reading  and remembering that Melanthe had a very   agreeable book in her hand that morning  she opened a drawer  where she   knew that lady was accustomed to throw any thing in  which she had no   occasion to conceal  but how great was her surprise when  instead of   what she sought  she found the letter from count de Bellfleur which   Melanthe  in the hurry of spirits  had forgot to lock up  As it lay open   and was from him  she thought it no breach of honour to examine the   contents  but in doing so was ready to faint away between grief and   astonishment       She was not insensible that Melanthe was charmed with this new lover    and had always feared her liking him would sway her to some   imprudencies  but could not have imagined it would have carried her  at   least so soon  to such a guilty length as she now found it did       Convinced by the hour in which she went out  and alone  that she had   complied with the appointment  and that all she would have endeavoured   to prevent was already come to pass  she now considered that the   discovery she had to make would only render this indiscreet lady more   unhappy  and therefore no longer thought herself obliged to run any   risque of incuring her ill will on the occasion  but in her soul   extremely lamented this second fall from virtue  which it was impossible   should not bring on consequences equally  if not more shameful than   the first       Good God  cried she  how is it possible for a woman of any share of   sense  and who has been blessed with a suitable education  to run thus   counter to all the principles of religion  honour  virtue  modesty  and   all that is valuable in our sex  and yet that many do  I have been a   melancholy witness   and then again  what is there in this love  resumed   she  that so infatuates the understanding  that we doat on our   dishonour  and think ruin pleasing   Can any personal perfections in a   man attone for the contempt he treats us with in courting us to   infamy   the mean opinion he testifies to have of us sure ought rather   to excite hate than love  our very pride  methinks  should be a   sufficient guard  and turn whatever favourable thoughts we might have of   such a one  unknowing his design  into aversion  when once convinced he   presumed upon our weakness       In these kind of reasonings did she continue some time  but reflecting   that the trouble she was in might put Melanthe on asking the cause  it   seemed best to her to avoid seeing her that night  so retired to her own   room and went to bed  ordering the servants to tell their lady  in case   she enquired for her  that she was a little indisposed       While Louisa was thus deploring a misfortune she wanted power to remedy    the person for whom she was concerned past her time in a far different   manner  the count omitted nothing that might convince her of his   gallantry  and give her a pretence for flattering herself with his   sincerity   he swore ten thousand oaths of constancy  and she easily   gave credit to what she wished and had vanity enough to think she   merited   he had prepared every thing that could delight the senses for   her reception at the house to which he carried her  and she found in   herself so little inclination to quit the pleasures she enjoyed  that it   was as much as the little remains of decency and care of reputation   could do  to make her tear herself away before midnight       In the fullness of her heart she had doubtless concealed no part of this   adventure from Louisa  but on hearing she was gone to
