wound was got in one of the traverses  about thirty toises from the returning angle of the trench  opposite to the salient angle of the demi bastion of St  Roch —so that he was pretty confident    he could stick a pin upon the identical spot of ground where he was standing in when the stone struck him   All this succeeded to his wishes  and not only freed him from a world of sad explanations  but  in the end  it prov d the happy means  as you will read  of procuring my uncle Toby his HOBBY HORSE   CHAP  II   THERE is nothing so foolish  when you are at the expence of making an entertainment of this kind  as to order things so badly  as to let your criticks and gentry of refined taste run it down  Nor is there any thing so likely    to make them do it  as that of leaving them out of the party  or  what is full as offensive  of bestowing your attention upon the rest of your guests in so particular a way  as if there was no such thing as a critick  by occupation  at table   —I guard against both  for  in the first place  I have left half a dozen places purposely open for them —and  in the next place  I pay them all court —Gentlemen  I kiss your hands —I protest no company could give me half the pleasure —by my soul I am glad to see you —I beg only you will make no strangers of yourselves  but sit down without any ceremony  and fall on heartily     I said I had left six places  and I was upon the point of carrying my complaisance so far  as to have left a seventh open for them —and in this very spot I stand on —but being told by a critick   tho  not by occupation —but by nature  that I had acquitted myself well enough  I shall fill it up directly  hoping  in the mean time  that I shall be able to make a great deal of more room next year   —How  in the name of wonder  could your uncle Toby  who  it seems  was a military man  and whom you have represented as no fool —be at the same time such a confused  pudding headed  muddle headed fellow  as—Go look   So  Sir Critick  I could have replied  but I scorn it — Tis language unurbane —and only befitting the man    who cannot give clear and satisfactory accounts of things  or dive deep enough into the first causes of human ignorance and confusion  It is moreover the reply valiant —and therefore I reject it  for tho  it might have suited my uncle Toby s character as a soldier excellently well —and had he not accustomed himself  in such attacks  to whistle the Lillabullero —as he wanted no courage   tis the very answer he would have given  yet it would by no means have done for me  You see as plain as can be  that I write as a man of erudition —that even my similies  my allusions  my illustrations  my metaphors  are erudite —and that I must sustain my character properly  and contrast it properly too —else what would become of me  Why  Sir  I should be undone —at this very moment that I am going here to fill up one    place against a critick —I should have made an opening for a couple   —Therefore I answer thus   Pray  Sir  in all the reading which you have ever read  did you ever read such a book as Locke s Essay upon the Human Understanding —Don t answer me rashly —because many  I know  quote the book  who have not read it —and many have read it who understand it not —If either of these is your case  as I write to instruct  I will tell you in three words what the book is —It is a history —A history  of who  what  where  when  Don t hurry yourself —It is a history book  Sir   which may possibly recommend it to the world  of what passes in a man s own mind  and if you will say so much of the book  and no more  believe    me  you will cut no contemptible figure in a metaphysic circle   But this by the way   Now if you will venture to go along with me  and look down into the bottom of this matter  it will be found that the cause of obscurity and confusion  in the mind of man  is threefold   Dull organs  dear Sir  in the first place  Secondly  slight and transient impressions made by objects when the said organs are not dull  And  thirdly  a memory like unto a sieve  not able to retain what it has received —Call down Dolly your chamber maid  and I will give you my cap and bell along with it  if I make not this matter so plain that Dolly herself shall understand it as well as Malbranch —    When Dolly has indited her epistle to Robin  and has thrust her arm into the bottom of her pocket hanging
