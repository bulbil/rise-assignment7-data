 Miss Betsy and Miss Flora were also surprized  and doubtless had their   own conjectures upon this sudden turn  It is not likely  however  that   either of them  especially Miss Betsy  could hit upon the right  but    whatever their thoughts were  they communicated them not to each other    and seemed only intent on considering in what manner they should dispose   of themselves that evening  it not being proper they should make the   visit above mentioned without her ladyship  As they were discoursing on   this head  Mrs  Prinks came down  and  having ordered the coach to be   put up  and sent a footman to call a hack  ran up stairs again in a   great hurry to her lady       In less time than could almost be imagined  they both came down  Lady   Mellasin had pulled off her rich apparel  and mobbed herself up in a   cloak and hood  that little of her face  and nothing of her air  could   be distinguished  the two young ladies stared  and were confounded at   the metamorphosis   Is your ladyship going out in that dress   cried   Miss Flora  but Miss Betsy said nothing   Aye  child   replied the lady    somewhat faltering in her speech   a poor relation  who they say is   dying  has sent to beg to see me   She said no more  the hackney coach   was come  her ladyship and Mrs  Prinks stepped hastily into it  the   latter  in doing so  telling the coachman in so low a voice as nobody   but himself could hear  to what place he was to drive       After they were gone  Miss Flora proposed walking in the Park  but Miss   Betsy did not happen to be in a humour to go either there or any where   else at that time  on which the other told her she had got the spleen     But   said she   I am resolved not to be infected with it  so you must   not take it ill  if I leave you alone for a few hours  for I should   think it a sin against common sense to sit moping at home without   shewing myself to any one soul in the world  after having taken all   this pains in dressing   Miss Betsy assured her  as she might do with a   great deal of sincerity  that she should not at all be displeased to be   entirely free from any company whatsoever  for the whole evening  and to   prove the truth of what she said  gave orders that instant to be denied   to whoever should come to visit her   Well   cried Miss Flora  laughing     I shall give your compliments  however  where I am going   and then   mentioned the names of some persons she had just then taken into her   head to visit   As you please for that   replied Miss Betsy  with the   same gay air   but don t tell them it is because I am eaten up with the   vapours  that I chuse to stay at home rather than carry my compliments   in person  for if ever I find out   continued she   that you are so   mischievous  I shall contrive some way or other to be revenged on you        They talked to each other in this pleasant manner  till a chair Miss   Flora had sent for was brought into the hall  in which she seated   herself for her intended ramble  and Miss Betsy went into her chamber    where how she was amused will presently be shewn                CHAPTER XII       Is little more than a continuance of the former          Miss Betsy had no sooner disengaged herself from the incumbrance of a   formal dress  and put on one more light and easy   al fresco   as the   Spaniards phrase it  than she began to give her brother s letter a more   serious and attentive perusal  than she had the opportunity of doing   before       She was charmed and elated with the description Mr  Francis had told   her  she had inspired in the breast of his friend  she called to her   mind the idea of those persons who were present at the entertainments he   mentioned  and easily recalled which was most likely to be the lover    though she remembered not the name  she very well now remembered there   was one that seemed both times to regard her with glances  which had   somewhat peculiar in them  and which then she had interpreted as the   certain indications of feeling something in his heart of the nature her
