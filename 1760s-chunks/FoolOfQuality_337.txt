   Having travelled through several parts of France and Italy    I took Germany in my tour  I stayed some time at Spa  where   I drank the waters  and within the year arrived in perfect health   at Rotterdam      On a visit to Mr  De Wit  at his villa near the city  he told me    over our bottle  that he had at that time in his house  and in his   guardianship  one of the most extraordinary women in the universe    Though she is now  says he  advancing toward the decline of life    she is by far the most finished female I ever beheld  while all she   says and all she does give a grace to her person that is quite   indescribable  She hath a youth too  her son  with her  who is   nearly as great a rarity as herself   and were it not that his com    plexion is sallow  and that he is something short of a leg and blind   of one eye  he would positively be the most lovely of all the human   species      You put me in mind  said I laughing  of the Baratarian wench   who was commended to governor Sancho as the most accomplished   beauty within a league   with this exception only  that one eye was   blind  and that the other ran with brimstone and vermilion  But   pray who are these wonders      That  said he  I either cannot or must not declare  They are   evidently people of the first fashion   and must have some uncom    mon reasons for their present conduct  as they live quite retired    and admit of no company      I protest  said I  you have raised my curiosity in earnest   is         372 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      there no managing so as to procure me a short tete a tete with   them  I wish there was  says he  for I long to know how far   your sentiments agree with mine in this matter  Yesterday the   lady told me that she intended to go and reside some time in   England  and that I would oblige her by getting a person duly   qualified to initiate her and her son in the language of the country    And now  if such a fine gentleman could condescend to undress   himself  you might come to morrow as a person who wanted hire    and I might introduce you to an interview by way of treating    provided you are upon honour not to reveal any thing concerning   them or their place of abode      The next morning I waited on Mr  De Wit under the appearance   of a reduced gentleman  a character that excites a mixture of   contempt and compassion      The lady received and spoke to me with that dignified com    placence which awes while it engages  and while it attracts  forbids   an irreverent familiarity  She was indeed every thing that my   friend had boasted of her   for though her person was all majesty    her manner was all grace  Will you answer for the discretion of   this young man  Mr  De Wit  I will  madam  said he  I bowed   to them both      On turning  I perceived that her son eyed me with much atten    tion  and I  on my part  surveyed him with the utmost astonishment    He laboured  indeed  apparently under all the disadvantages that   my friend described   but enchantment lurked in his accents and in   the dimpling of his lips   and when he smiled  heaven itself was   infused through the fine roundings of his olive coloured coun    tenance      In short  I felt such a sudden attachment to these extraordinary   personages  that I resolved to keep on the deception  at least   for a few days  and accordingly engaged with them at a stated   salaiy      I entered on my province  My young pupil especially began to   improve apace   and  as I was particularly cautious in observing   the distant respect that suited my station  I grew into great favour   both with mother and son      How long  Mr  De Wit would say  do you propose to carry on   this farce   Till I can prevail upon them  I answered  to accom    pany me to England   for I feel my affection so tied to them  that   I cannot think of parting      On a day as I sat with my pupil in his apartment  he happened   to let his book fall   and as I stooped to take it
