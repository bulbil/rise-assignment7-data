part     I can think of nothing   answered he  groaning bitterly   of my   own happiness till I have fixed that of Miss Betsy     Lord  Madam     cried Mrs  Modely  softly   you would not be so mad to refuse  what  two   thousand pounds a year  and a ladyship  with liberty to marry who you   will         This is the most generous offer I ever heard of   said the parson   But   I wish the lady would resolve soon  for it is high time Sir Frederick   should prepare for another world     He cannot live above an hour     rejoined the surgeon   even if the sword is not withdrawn  therefore    good Madam  think what you have to do        While they were speaking  Sir Frederick redoubled his groans  and they   went on pressing her to accept the terms he offered   Do not plunge a   man into a sad eternity  merely for his love to you   said the parson     All the world would condemn you  should you refuse   cried the surgeon     A virgin widow with two thousand pounds a year   added Mrs  Modely       In this manner did they urge her  and the parson getting on the one side   of her  and the surgeon on the other  plied her so close with arguments    both on the advantages accruing to herself  and the compassion owing   from her to a gentleman who had committed this act of desperation on   himself  merely through his love for her  that she neither could nor   knew how to make any answer  when Sir Frederick  giving two or three   great groans  which seemed more deep than before  and the surgeon    pretending to take Miss Betsy s silence for consent  cried out   Madam    he is just going  we must be speedy   And then turning to the parson     Doctor   said he   proceed to the ceremony  pass over the prelude  and   begin at the most essential part  else my patient won t live to the   conclusion        The parson knew very well what he had to do  having his book ready    began at   Sir Frederick Fineer  Baronet  wilt thou have this woman to   be thy wedded wife   and so on  To which Sir Frederick answered in the   same dismal accents he had hitherto spoken   I will   Then the parson    turning to Miss Betsy  said   Betsy Thoughtless  wilt thou have this man   to be thy wedded husband   and so forth  Miss Betsy  in the confusion of   her mind  not well knowing what she said or did  replied in the   affirmative  on which he was hurrying over the rest of the ceremony  but   she  recollecting herself  cried out   Hold  doctor  I cannot be married   in this manner   But he seemed not to regard her words  but read on  and   the surgeon taking hold of her hand  and joining it with Sir   Frederick s  held it  in spite of her resistance  till the ring was   forced upon her finger       This action so incensed her  that the instant she got her hand at   liberty  she plucked off the ring  and threw it on the ground   What do   you mean   said she   Do you think to compel me to a marriage   Modely    you have not used me well   With these words she was turning to go out   of the room  but perceived  not till then  that Mrs  Modely had slipped   out  and that the door was locked  she then began to call   Mrs  Modely    Mrs  Modely   To which no answer was made        Come  come  Madam   said the surgeon   this passion will avail you   nothing  you are effectually married  whatever you may imagine to the   contrary     Yes  yes   rejoined the parson   the ceremony is good and   firm  I will stand to what I have done before any bishop in   England     There wants only consummation   cried the surgeon   and that   we must leave the bridegroom to compleat before he dies   With these   words they both went out  making the door fast after them       Miss Betsy made use of her utmost efforts to pass at the same time they   did  but they pushed her back with so much violence as almost threw her
