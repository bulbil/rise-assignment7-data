half way down the ladder  Mr  Morgan  before he saw us  having intelligence by his nose  of the approach of something extraordinary  cried     Cot have mercy upon my senses  I pelieve the enemy has poarded us in a stink pot    Then directing his discourse to the steward  from whom he imagined the odour proceeded  he reprimanded him severely for the freedoms he took among gentlemen of birth  threatned to smoak him like a padger with sulphur  if ever he should presume to offend his neighbours with such smells  for the future  The steward  conscious of his own innocence  replied with some warmth    I know of no smells but those of your own making  —  This repartee introduced a smart dialogue  in which the Welchman undertook to prove  that though the stench he complained of  did not flow from the steward s own body  he was nevertheless the author of it  by serving out damaged provisions to the ship s company  and in particular  putrified cheese  from the use of which only  he affirmed  such unsavoury steams could arise —Then he launched cut into praises of good cheese  of which he gave the analysis  explained the different kinds of that commodity  with the methods practised to make and preserve it  and concluded with observing  that in yielding good cheese  the county of Glamorgan might vie with Cheshire itself  and was much superior to it in the produce of goats and   239 putter —I gathered from this conversation  that if I went into the birth in my present pickle  I should be no welcome guest  and therefore desired Mr  Thomson to go before  and represent my calamity  at which the first mate expressing some concern  went upon deck immediately  taking his way through the cable tire  and by the main hatchway  to avoid encountering with me  desiring me to clean myself as soon as possible  for he intended to regale himself with a dish of salmagundy and a pipe —Accordingly  I set about this disagreeable business  and soon found I had more causes of complaint than I at first imagined  For I perceived some guests had honoured me with their company  whose visit I did not at all think seasonable  neither did they seem inclined to leave me in a hurry  being in possession of my chief quarters  where they fed without reserve at the expence of my blood —But considering it would be much easier to extirpate this ferocious colony in the infancy of their settlement  than after they should be multiplied and naturalized to the soil  I took the advice of my friend  who  to prevent such misfortunes  went always closs shaved  and made the boy of our mess cut off my hair  which had been growing since I lest the service of Lavement  The second mate lent me an old bob wig to supply the loss of that covering  This affair being ended  and every thing adjusted in the best manner my circumstances would permit  the descendant of Caractacus returned  and ordering the boy to bring a piece of salt beef from the brine  cut off a slice and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions  which seasoning with a moderate proportion of pepper and salt  he brought it into a consistence   240 with oil and vinegar —Then tasting the dish  assured us  it was the best salmagundie  that ever he made  and recommended it to our palate with such heartiness  that I could not help doing honour to his preparation  But I had no sooner swallowed a mouthful  than I thought my entrails were scorched  and endeavoured with a deluge of small beer  to allay the heat it occasioned —Supper being over  Mr  Morgan having smoaked a couple of pipes  and supplied the moisture he had expended with as many cans of flip  of which we all partook  a certain yawning began to admonish me  that it was high time to repair by sleep the injury I had suffered from want of rest the preceeding night  which being perceived by my companions  whose time of repose was by this time arrived  they proposed we should turn in  or in other words  go to bed  Our hammocks  which hung parallel to one another  on the outside of our birth  were immediately unlashed  and I beheld each of my mess mates spring with great agility into his respective nest  where they seemed to lie concealed  very much at their ease —But it was some time before I could prevail upon myself to trust my carcase at such a distance from the ground  in a narrow bag  out of which  I imagined  I should be apt  on the least motion in my sleep  to tumble down at the hazard of breaking my bones  I suffered myself  however  to be persuaded  and taking a leap to get in  threw myself quite over  with such violence  that had I not luckily got hold of Thomson s hammock  I should have pitched upon my head on the other side  and in all likelihood fractured my scull —After some fruitless efforts  I succeeded at last  but the apprehension of the   241 jeopardy in which I believed myself  withstood all the attacks of sleep  till towards the morningwatch
