fertile soil and the soft climate  continued to invite greater numbers from the continent  and now turned their arms upon the Britons  who vainly attempted to oppose them  This contention was still more inflamed by the difference of their opinion in matters of religion  the Saxons being all Pagans  and the Britons professing Christianity  At such a time as this a Christian hero was wanted to vindicate the rights of Christianity  and probably    34 merely for this reason  fiction has supplied us with a Christian hero King Arthur  the British champion  is said to have worsted the Saxons in twelve different engagements  yet  notwithstanding all his victories  and whatever his prowess might have performed  it did not serve to rescue his country from its new possessors  The Saxons pursued their designs with courage and fierceness  new swarms of their countrymen came continually over  till  at length  in about a century and an half  they had subdued the whole body of the province  and established in it seven different kingdoms  which were  by the writers of those times  styled the Saxon Heptarchy   The Britons  driven from their ancient possessions  to escape the fury of the conquerors  retired to the mountainous parts of Wales and Cornwal  countries barren and desolate  but  in some measure  surrounded by the sea  and  towards the land  difficult of access  Some great colonies of them  wholly abandoning their native country  sailed over to the neighbouring shores of France  where  possessing new seats  they gave a new denomination to that peninsula which still preserves the name and memory of Britain there  a name no longer continued at home   All the possessions of the Britons now fell into the power of the conquerors  who began to lose their natural fierceness  and soften into the luxuries of those they had invaded  Though conquerors ever bring their own customs among the people they subdue  they  at the same time  assume some customs from those they have conquered  The Saxons now lost all that spirit of freedom their nation had been long famous for  and  in imitation of the Britons themselves  among   35 whom slavery was permitted since the times of the Romans  they ma  e the people of Britain slaves  These wretches were used in tilling the ground  feeding cattle  and other servile works  farming out lands at a certain yearly stipend  but always held at the will and pleasure of the landlord  The children of this miserable people belonged to the soil  like the rest of the stock or cattle upon it  and thus began villenage in England  an horrid custom  borrowed from the Romans originally  and derived now to the Saxon  by vicious imitation   The Saxons  now no longer fearing domestic foes  relaxed into luxury and vice  and  finding no other enemies to subdue  began to fight with each other  The Princes of the seven kingdoms they had erected  began mutually to emulate each other s power  and  for the space of above two hundred years  all the misery that ambition  treachery  or war  could bring upon a kingdom  was the consequence of their animosity  The dissensions of petty Princes are ever more distressful to a people  than the wars of extensive empires  The historians of this period are as barbarous as the transactions they describe  but it is sufficient to know  that  after many various events and revolutions between the several races of the heptarchy  Ecbert  descended from the West Saxon Kings  partly by conquest  and partly by inheritance  became the first sole Monarch of England  This was the name which the country now assumed  to distinguish it from the principality of Wales  possessed by the ancient Britons  and from that part of the island north of the Tweed  possessed by the Picts and Scots  called Scotland   No customs  truly British or Roman  were now to be seen  the language of the country  which had been either Latin or Celtic  was discontinued  and   36 the Saxon or English only was spoken  The land  before divided into colonies or governments  was now cantoned into shires  with Saxon appellations to distinguish them  Their habits in peace  and arms in war  their titles of honour  laws  and methods of trial  were all continued as originally practised by the Suevi  but their commonwealths were now no more  these were changed for despotic and hereditary monarchies  and their exemplary chastity  and their abhorrence of slavery  were quite forgotten  The conquerors were corrupted by prosperity  they became Christians  indeed  by the preaching of Austin the Monk  but this little improved their manners  twelve hundred British Monks  who would not acknowledge Austin for a saint  are said to have been slaughtered by order of these new converted Christians  in a field near Caerleon   Christianity  when erroneously taught  is even more injurious to society than Paganism  In all the sacrifices made to the British idols  or the Saxon god Woden  I have not read of such a multitude of victims offered together  The devotion of this people  however  was equal to their ignorance  Their Kings frequently abdicated the crown for the cowl  their Queens thought
