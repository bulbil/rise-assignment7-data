articulate  whether we had any painters in England  My mother  who by chance heard him  and by greater chance understood him  answered  before Sir George had time  Painters  Sir  yes  sure  and some very good ones too  why  you cannot have forgot that  it is not much above a year since you went abroad   for you must know he had been recalled upon the death of an uncle  who had left him his estate   I observed Mr Faulkland constrained a    very fly laugh  on account both of the manner of my mother’s taking his question  and her innocently undesigned reprimand  Sayers pretended not to hear her  but looking through his fingers  as if to throw the picture into perspective  that is a pretty good piece  said he  for a copy  Oh  cry’d his mother  there is no pleasing you—people who have been abroad are such connoisseurs in painting—No body making any immediate answer  Mr Faulkland stepped up to Mr Sayers  with such a roguish humility in his countenance  that you would have sworn he was a very ignoramus  said  ‘Are you of opinion  Sir  that that picture is nothing but a copy ’ Nothing more  take my word for it  Sir  When I was at Rome  there was a Dutchman there who made it his business to take copies of copies  which he dispersed  and had people to sell for him in different parts  as pretty good prices  and they did mighty well  for very few people know a picture  and I’ll answer for it there are not many masters of eminence  but what have a hundred originals palmed upon them  more than ever they painted in their lives   Mr Faulkland then proceeded to ask him abundance of questions  which any one  who did not know him well  would have thought he proposed for no other end but a desire of information  and the poor coxcomb Sayers plumed himself upon displaying so much travelled knowlege  to a wondering ignorant Englishman  who had never been out of his own country  The company were divided into little chattering parties  as is usual when people are whiling away an half hour before dinner  Mrs  Sayers  my mother  and I  were sitting together on a couch  near enough to hear the conversation that passed between the two gentlemen  at least as much as was not sunk in the affected  half pronounced sentences of Mr Sayers  His mother  to whom he was the principal object of attention in the company  seemed mightily pleased at the opportunity her son had  from the inquisitiveness of Mr Faulkland  whom she did not know  of shewing his taste in the polite arts  and often looked about to observe if any body else attended to them  My mother  dear literal woman   as I often call her to you  took every thing seriously  and whispered to me  how pretty that is  Sidney  how condescending in Mr Faulkland  you see he does not make a parade of his own knowledge in these matters  but is pleased to reap the benefit of other people’s  I  who saw the latent roguery  could hardly contain myself  Indeed I was amazed at Mr Faulkland’s grave inquisitive face  and was very glad my mother did not find him out     Sayers  elated with having shone so conspicuously  for he observed that both my mother and I attended to his discourse  proceeded to shew away with an immensity of vanity and frothy chat  beginning every new piece of history with  ‘When I was at Rome  or  when I was at Paris’—At last  unluckily for him  speaking of an incident  which made a good deal of noise  and happened at the first mentioned place  in which two English gentlemen had been concerned  he said it was about eleven months ago  just before he left Rome  My mother  who had heard Mr Faulkland relate the same story  but with some very different circumstances  immediately said  Mr Faulkland  have I not heard you speak of that  you were at Rome yourself when the affair happened  and if I be not mistaken  it was through your interest with the cardinal of —— that the business was made up   If a spectre had appeared to poor Sayers  he could not have looked more aghast  He dropped his visage half way down his breast  and for the first time speaking very plain  and very loud too  with a share of astonishment  Have you been at Rome  Sir  I was there for a little time  Sir  answered Mr Faulkland  with real modesty  for he pitied the mortified buzzard  and I know the story was represented as you have told it  the circumstances differed in a few particulars  but the facts were nearly as you have related them   How obligingly did he reconcile the out of countenance Sayers to himself and to the company  Were you long abroad  pray Sir  said the coxcomb  About five years  Sir  answered Mr Faulkland  but I perceive  by the conversation I have had the honour of holding with you to day  that many accurate and curious observations escaped me  which you made
