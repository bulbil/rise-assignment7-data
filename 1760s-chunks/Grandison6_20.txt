 Sir  yours is great  But as your spirit is princely  you ought to have something worthy of your own fortune with a wife  But here  alas  we must fail  I doubt  at least  in hand   Mr  Byron was one of the best of men  his Lady a most excellent woman  There never was a happier pair  Both had reason to boast of their ancestry  His estate was upwards of Four thousand pounds a year  but it was entailed  and  in failure of male heirs  was to descend to a second branch of the family which had made itself the more unworthy of it  by settling in a foreign country  renouncing  as I may say  its own Mr  Byron died a young man  and left his Lady ensient  but grief for losing him  occasioned first her miscarriage  and then her death  and the estate followed the name  Hence  be pleased to know  that Miss Byron s fortune  in her own right is no more than between Thirteen and Fourteen thousand pounds  It is chiefly in the funds  It has been called 15 000l  but it is not much more than thirteen  Her grandmother s jointure is between 4 and 500l  a year  We none of us wish to see my god daughter in possession of it  She herself least of all  Mrs  Shirley is called  by every one that knows her  or speaks of her  The ornament of old age  Her husband  an   50 excellent man  desired her to live always in the mansion house  and in the hospitable way he had ever kept up  if what he left her would support her in it  She has been longer spared to the prayers of her friends  and to those of the poor  than was apprehended  for she is but infirm in health  She therefore can do but little towards the increase of her child s fortune  But Shirley manor is a fine old seat  Sir —And there is timber upon the estate  which wants but ten years growth  and will be felled to good account  Mr  Selby is well in the world  He proposes  as a token of his love  to add 3000l  in hand to his niece s fortune  and by his will  something very considerable  farther expectant on his Lady s death  who being Miss Byron s aunt  by the father s side  intends by her will to do very handsomely for her —By the way  my dear Sir  be assured  that what I write is absolutely unknown to Miss Byron   There is a man who loves her as he loves himself  This man has laid by a sum of money every year for the advancing her in marriage  beginning with the fifth year of her life  when it was seen what a hopeful child she was  This has been putout at accumulated interest  and it amounts  in sixteen years  or thereabouts  to very near 8000l  This man  Sir will make up the eight thousand  ten  to be paid on the day of marriage  And I hope  without promising for what this man will do further at his death  that you will accept of this Five or Six and twenty thousand Pounds  as the chearfullest given and best bestowed money that ever was laid out   Let not these particulars pain you  Sir  They should not  The subject is a necessary one  You  who ought to give way to the increase of that power which you so nobly use  must not be pained at this mention  once for all  Princes  Sir  are not above asking money of their people as free gifts  on the marriage of their children  He that would be greater than a prince   51 may  before he is aware  be less than a gentleman  Of this ten thousand pounds  Eight is Miss Byron s due  as she is likely to be so happy with all our consents  else it would not  For that was the man s reserved condition  and the sum  or the designation of it  was till this day only known to himself   As to settlements in return  I would have acted the lawyer  but the honest lawyer  with you  Sir  and made demands of you  but Mr  and Mrs Selby  and Mrs  Shirley  unanimously declare  that you shall not be prescribed to in this case  Were you not Sir Charles Grandison  was the question  I was against leaving it to you  for that very reason  It will be  said I  to provoke such a man as Sir Charles to do too much  Most other men ought to be spurred  but this must be held in  But  however  I acquiesced  and the more easily  because I expect that the deeds shall pass through my hands  and I will take care that you shall not  in order to give a proof of Love where it is not wanted  exert an inadequate generosity   These matters I thought it was absolutely necessary to apprize you of  You will have the goodness to excuse any imperfections in my manner of writing  There are none in
