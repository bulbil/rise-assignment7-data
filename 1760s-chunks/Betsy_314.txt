 for  admitting she should be wanting in such proofs as the   strictness of the law requires in these cases  the very attempt must   necessarily involve you in an infinity of disquiet  Consider  Sir     pursued he   when the affairs of a family are laid open  and every   dispute between the husband and the wife exposed before a court of   judicature  or even in a petition to a Lord Chancellor  the whole   becomes a publick talk  and furnishes a matter of ridicule for the   unthinking scoffers of the age         I can easily prevent all this   cried Mr  Munden hastily   by procuring   a warrant from the Lord Chief Justice to force her immediately   home     You may certainly do so   cried Mr  Markland  with a half   smile   but  Sir  are you sure of keeping her at home when you have got   her there  Is it not in her power to leave you again the same day  nay    even the same hour  in which you compelled her to return  so that your   whole time may be spent in an unavailing chase  somewhat of a piece with   the fable of the Sisyph√¶an stone  which  as often as the driver forced   to the height he aimed at  rolled back to it s beloved descent  In   short  Sir  as Mrs  Munden is determined to live apart  you have no way   to preserve her but by confinement  and I appeal to your own judgment   how that would look in the eyes of the world  and what occasion for   complaint it would afford to all her friends  who would  doubtless  have   a strict watch on your behaviour        These words threw Mr  Munden into a deep reverie  which the other would   not interrupt  being willing to see how far this last remonstrance had   worked upon him  till  coming out of it  and vexed that he had shewn any   discomposure   Well  Sir   said he   if she resolves to persist in this   obstinacy  let her enjoy her humour  I shall give myself no pain about   it  but she must not expect I shall allow one penny towards her   maintenance        It was on this head that Mr  Markland found he had occasion to employ   all the rhetorick he was master of  he urged the unreasonableness  the   injustice  the cruelty  of denying the means of subsistence to a lady   whose whole fortune he enjoyed  said such a thing was altogether   unprecedented among persons of condition  and  to prove what he   alledged  produced many instances of wives who  on parting from their   husbands  were allowed a provision proportionable to the sums they had   brought in marriage       All these arguments were enforced in terms so strong and so pathetick    that Mr  Munden could make no other answer than  that he did not desire   to part  that it was her own fault  and that if she would not return to   her duty  she ought to be starved into a more just sense of it  and that   he was very sure the law would not compel him to do any thing for her    on which Mr  Markland again reminded him of the vexation  the fatigue    the disgrace  with which a suit commenced by either party must be   attended  in whose favour soever the decision should be made       He talked so long on the subject  that Mr  Munden  either to get rid of   him  or because he was really uncertain what to do  at last told him   that he would consider on what he had been saying  and let him know his   resolution in a week s time  Mr  Markland then replied  that he would   trouble him no farther for the present  and after having prefixed a day   for waiting on him again  took his leave       The mind of Mr  Munden was  indeed  in the utmost confusion amidst that   variety of vexatious incidents which he had now to struggle with  the   little probability he found there was of re establishing himself in the   favour of his patron  the loss of all his hopes that way  the sudden   departure of a wife whom  though he had no affection for  he looked upon   as a necessary appendix to his house  the noise her having taken such a   step would make in the town  the apprehensions of being obliged to grant   her a separate maintenance  all these things put together  it is   certain  were sufficient to overwhelm a man of less impatient temper       He cursed his amour with
