 till the conquests he was in pursuit of   should be accomplished       This was some matter of affliction to Dorilaus  tho  in his heart he   could not but approve those principles of honour which detained   him   Neither the baron de Palfoy  nor Charlotta herself  could say he   could well have acted otherwise  and used their utmost endeavours to   comfort a father in his anxieties for the safety of so valuable a son       Louisa was also very much troubled at being disappointed in her hope of   embracing a brother  whom she had ever dearly loved  and was now more   precious to her than ever  by the proofs she had heard he had given of   his courage and his virtue  but she had another secret and more poignant   grief that preyed upon her soul  and could scarce receive any addition   from ought beside   she had been now near two months in Paris  yet could   hear nothing of monsieur du Plessis  but that  by the death of his   father  a large estate had devolved upon him  which he had never come to   claim  or had been at Paris for about eighteen months  so that she had   all the reason in the world to believe he was no more  This threw her   into a melancholy  which was so much the more severe as she endeavoured   to conceal it   she made use of all her efforts to support the loss of a   person she so much loved  and who proved himself so deserving of that   love   she represented to herself that being relieved from all the   snares and miseries of an indigent life  raised from an obscurity which   had given her many bitter pangs  to a station equal to her wishes  and   under the care of the most indulgent and best of fathers  she ought not   to repine  but bless the bounty of heaven  who had bestowed on her so   many blessings  and with held only one she could have asked   These  I   say  were the dictates of reason and religion  but the tender passion   was not always to be silenced by them  and whenever she was alone  the   tears  in spight of herself  would flow  and she  without even knowing   she did so  cry out  Oh du Plessis  wherefore do I live since thou   art dead       Among the many acquaintance she soon contracted at Paris  there was none   she so much esteemed  both on the account of her own merit  and the   regard she had for Horatio  as mademoiselle de Palfoy  In this young   lady s society did she find more charms for her grief than in that of   any other  and the other truly loving her  not only because she found   nothing more worthy of being loved  but because she was the sister of   Horatio  they were very seldom asunder       Louisa was one day at the baron s  enjoying that satisfaction which the   conversation of his beautiful daughter never failed to afford  when word   was brought that madam  the countess d Espargnes  was come to visit   her   Mademoiselle Charlotta ran to receive her with a great deal of   joy  she being a lady she very much regarded  and who she had not seen   of a long time       She immediately returned  leading a lady in deep mourning  who seemed   not to be above five and twenty  was extremely handsome  and had beside   something in her air that attached Louisa at first sight  Mademoiselle   Charlotta presented her to the countess  saying at the same time  see    madam  the only rival you have in my esteem       You do well to give me one  replied the countess  who looks as if she   would make me love her as well as you  and so I should be even with you    With these words she opened her arms to embrace Louisa  who returned the   compliment with equal politeness       When they were seated  mademoiselle Charlotta began to express the   pleasure she had in seeing her in Paris  on which the countess told her    that the affair she came upon was so disagreeable  that nothing but the   happiness of enjoying her company  while she stayed  could attone for   it  You know  my dear  continued madam d Espargnes  I was always an   enemy to any thing that had the face of business  yet am I now  against   my will  involved in it by as odd an adventure as perhaps you   ever heard       Charlotta testifying some desire to be informed of what nature  the   other immediately satisfied her curiosity in this manner
