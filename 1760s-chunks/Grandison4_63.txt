favour of a Lady who has acted  in the most arduous trials  in a greater manner than I fear either Olivia or I could have acted  in the same circumstances  We see that her reason  but not her piety  deserted her in the noble struggle between her Love and her Religion  In the most affecting absences of her reason the Soul of the man she loved was the object of her passion  However hard it is to prefer another to one s self  in such a case as this  yet if my judgment is convinced  my acknowlegement shall follow it  Heaven will enable me to be reconciled to the event  because I pursue the dictates of that judgment  against the biasses of my more partial heart  Let that Heaven  which only can  restore Clementina  and dispose as it pleases of Olivia and Harriet  We cannot either of us  I humbly hope  be so unhappy as the Lady has been whom I rank among the first of women  and whose whole family deserves almost equal compassion   Lady Olivia ask Lady L  If her brother had not a very tender regard for me  He had  Lady L  answered  and told her  that he had rescued me from a very great distress  and that mine was the most grateful of human hearts   She called me sweet young creature  supposing me  I doubt not  youger than I am   but said  that the graces of my person and mind alarmed her not  as they would have done  had not his attachment to Clementina   158 mentina been what now she saw  but never could have believed it was  having supposed  that compassion only was the tie that bound him to her   But compassion  Lucy  from such a heart as his  the merit so great in the Lady  must be Love  a Love of the nobler kind—And if it were not  it would be unworthy of Clementina s   Lady Maffei called upon her dignity  her birth  to carry her above a passion that met not with a grateful return  She advised her to dispose herself to stay in England some months  now she was here  And as her friends in Italy would suppose what her view was in coming to England  their censures would be obviated by here continuing here for some time  while Sir Charles was abroad  and in Italy  And that she should divert herself with visiting the court  the public places  and in seeing the principal curiosities of this kingdom as she had done those of others  in order to give credit to an excursion that might otherwise be freely spoken of  in her own country   She seemed to listen to this advice  She bespoke  and was promised  the friendship of the two sisters  and included in her request  through their interests  mine  and Lady G  was called in  by her sister  to join in the promise   She desired that Sir Charles might be requested to walk in  but would not suffer the sisters to withdraw as they would have done  when he returned  He could not but be polite  but  it seems  looked still disturbed  I beg you to excuse  Sir  said she  my behaviour to you  It was passionate  it was unbecoming  But  in compliment to your own consequence  you ought to excuse it  I have only to request one favour of you  That you will suspend for one week  in regard to me  your proposed journey  but for one week  and I will  now I am in England  stay some months  perhaps till your return   Excuse me  madam     159 I will not excuse you—But one week  Sir  Give me so much importance with myself  as for one week s suspension  You will  You must   Indeed I cannot  My Soul  I own to you  is in the distrestes of the family of Porretta  Why should I repeat what I said to you before   I have bespoken  Sir  the civilities of your sisters  of your family  You forbid them not   You expect not an answer  madam  to that question  My sisters will be glad  and so will their Lords  to attend you where ever you please  with a hope to make England agreeable to you   How long do you propose to stay in Italy  Sir   It is not possible for me to determine   Are you not apprehensive of danger to your person   I am not   You ought to be   No danger shall deter me from doing what I think to be right  If my motives justify me  I cannot fear   Do you wish me  Sir  to stay in England till your return   A question so home put  disturbed him  Was it a prudent one in the Lady  It must either subject her to a repulse  or him  by a polite answer  to give her hope  that her stay in England might not be fruitless  as to the view she had in coming  He reddened  It is fit  answered he  that your own pleasure
