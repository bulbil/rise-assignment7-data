in here  that you may know what to expect▪ and how to act and comport yourself  to morrow evening   Your reception will be  I am afraid  cold  but civil   You will be looked upon by the Urbino family  who have heard more of you than they have seen  as a curiosity  but with more wonder than affection     326 Of them will be present  the Count my father s brother  and his sons Sebastiano and Juliano  my aunt Signora Juliana de Storza  a widow Lady  as you know  and her daughter Signora Laurana  a young woman of my sister s age  between whom and my sister used to be  as you have heard  the strictest friendship and correspondence  and who insisted on being present on this occasion  They are all good natured people  but love not either your country or religion   Father Marescotti will be present  He is become your very great admirer   My father thinks to make you his compliments  but if he withdraws the moment he has made them  you must not be surprised   My mother says  that as it is the last time that she may ever see you  and as she really greatly respects you  she shall not be able to leave you while you stay   The General  I hope  will behave with politeness   The Bishop loves you  but will not however  perhaps  be in high good humour with you   Your Jeronymo will be wheeled into the same room  If he be more silent than usual on the solemn occasion  you will not do him injustice  perhaps  if you attribute it to his prudence  but much more to his grief   And now let me tell you  as briefly as I can  the situation of the dear creature who must not appear  but who is more interested in the occasion of the congress than any person who will be present at it   What passed between you and her at the last interview  has greatly impressed her in your favour  The Bishop  the General  and my Father  soon after their return from Urbino  made her a visit in her dressingroom  They talked to her of the excellency of her own Religion  and of the errors of the pretended Reformed  which they called  and I suppose are  damnable  They found her steady in her abhorrence of   327 the one  and adherence to the other  They were delighted with her rational answers  and composed behaviour  They all three retired in raptures  to congratulate each other upon it  and returned with pleasure  to enter into farther talk with her  But when they mentioned you to her  she  led by their affectionate behaviour to her on their return  said  It had given her great pleasure  and ease of mind  to find that she was not despised by a man whom every one of the family regarded for his merit and great qualities  The General had hardly patience  he walked to the farther end of the room  My Father was in tears  The Bishop soothed her  in order to induce her to speak her whole mind   He praised you  She seemed pleased  He led her to believe  that the whole family were willing to oblige her  if she would declare herself  and asked her questions  the answers to which must either be an avowal or a denial of her Love  and then she owned  That she preferred the Chevalier Grandison to all the men in the world  she would not  against the opinion of her friends  wish to be his  but never would be the wife of any other man   What  said the General  tho  he continue an Heretic   He might be converted  she said  And he was a sweet tempered and compassionate man  And a man of sense  as he was▪ must see his errors   Would she run the risque of her own salvation   She was sure she should never give up her faith   It was tempting God to abandon her to her own perverseness   Her reliance on his goodness to enable her to be stedfast  was humble  and not presumptuous  and with a pious view to gain a proselyte  and God would not forsake a person so well intending  Was she not to be allowed her confessor  Her confessor should be appointed by themselves  She did not doubt but the Chevalier would consent to that     328 The Bishop  you know  can he cool when he pleases  He bore to talk farther with her   My father was still in tears   The General had no farther patience  He withdrew  and came to me  and vented on me his displeasure  It is true Grandison  when it was proposed to send for you from Vienna  I  sanguine in my hopes  had expressed myself as void of all doubt but you would become a Catholic—Your love  your compassion  your honour as I thought  engaged by such a step taken on our side—I had no notion that on such a surprize  with such motives to urge your compliance  a young man like myself  and with a heart so sensible
