long since broken down  and imminent dangers might attend his refusal  While he continued in this agitation of mind  not knowing how to behave  he received a letter from the unfortunate Nobleman himself  desiring that his life might be made the sacrifice of a mutual agreement between the King and the people  adding  that to a willing mind there could be no injury  This noble instance of generosity was but ill repaid  the King was persuaded to give his consent  he signed the fatal bill  Strafford was beheaded  and this taught his subjects soon after to spill blood that was still more precious     The whole kingdom now seemed to be in a ferment  all the petitions of parliament  which were in reality calculated to abase the King  were notwithstanding drawn up with the most seeming affection and obedience  they were constantly complaining in each of these of their fears for the church  at the very time that they were themselves labouring its overthrow  Faction ran high  In the King s party   19 there was an ill projected and worse conducted design of keeping the prerogative as much untouched as ever it had been in the reigns of the most fortunate and formidable Monarchs  in the opposite party a fixed resolution of turning the state into a republic  and changing the government  of the church into that of presbytery   In the midst of these troubles  the Papists of Ireland fancied they found a convenient opportunity of throwing off the English yoke  Religion and liberty often inspire the most attrocious actions  and they did so now  The Papists took a resolution  of which we find many horrid examples in history  They attempted to cut off all the Protestants in that kingdom at one blow  Not less than forty thousand persons fell a sacrifice upon this occasion  In such a number of murders cruelty put on a thousand different shapes  rapes  burnings  and tortures were practised in every part of that miserable island  and all the Protestants perished who had not the good fortune to make early provision for their safety  Such was the state of Ireland then  and such was England shortly to be  The parliament took this opportunity to blacken the King  as if he had given sanction to the Papists  and encouraged their barbarous design  he vindicated himself with a zeal that nothing but innocence could inspire  and tried every method of assisting his Protestant subjects of Ireland  He even demanded succours from the parliament of Scotland to relieve the Irish Protestants  but they remitted him to the parliament of England  as Ireland lay more immediately under their protection  The English house of commons sent but feeble succours to a people they pretended to deplore  and gave it as a pretext  that the government at home was in danger   They now proceeded to what they long laboured at  to establish a republic  and destroy the rites of the   20 church of England  They signified to the King  that it was fit to have a privy council only of their appointing  Three members of the house of commons presented this request on their knees  The King was pleased to grant all  Oliver Cromwell  who was then in the house of commons  was heard to declare  that  if this request was rejected  he would sell his estate  which was then but small  and retire out of the kingdom   Hitherto  it is probable  both sides were actuated rather by principle than ambition  The Bishops had hitherto adhered closely to the King  they were not only expelled the house of Lords  but  upon remonstrating against this unconstitutional measure  were accused by the house of commons of high treason  and ten of them sent to the Tower  This spirit of epidemic rage was not confined to both houses of parliament alone  the populace daily surrounded the place of sitting  and  with tumultuous cries  demanded justice  The apprentices  the common council  and the citizens of London were foremost in this struggle for liberty  as they thought it  their principles were sincere  for the motives of a mob  though often wrong  are always honest  In this contest the Presbyterians  and Cardinal Richelieu of France  were ever intriguing  both desired a civil war  the one willing to depress the great  the other to humble the kingdom   In this decline of the royal authority  the King was persuaded to take a step which was fatal to his interests  By the advice of Lord Digby  one of his ministers  he went himself to the house of commons  and accused five of its members of high treason  These were the leading members of the house  whom he thus ventured to call in question  namely  Lord Kimbolton  Mr  Hollis  Sir Arthur Haslerig  Mr  Pym  Mr  Hampden  and Mr  Strode  He sat  for some time  in the speaker s chair  to see if the accused   21 were present  but they had escaped a few minutes before his entry  and the house of commons was resolved to support the cause  Disappointed  perplexed  unknowing whom to rely on  the King went next to the common council of the city  and made his complaint to them  the common council only answered by aggravating
