nature and circumstances of his misfortune  His thoughts were all thrown into inextricable confusion  To ask any questions of Blanche was in vain  for she had too deep an interest in perplexing the truth  to furnish any clue whatever to its discovery  He therefore adopted the measure of unbosoming his griefs to Leontio  but previously sent away his attendants with the excuse that he thought he had heard some noise in the room  but was mistaken  His father in law having left his chamber in consequence of this strange disturbance  met him  and heard from his lips the particulars of this unaccountable adventure  The narrative was accompanied with every indication of extreme agony  produced by deep and tender feeling  as well as by a sense of insulted honour   Siffredi was surprised at the occurrence  Though it did not appear to him at all probable  that was no reason for being easy about its reality  The king s passion might accomplish anything  and that idea alone justified the most cruel apprehensions  But it could do no good to foster either the natural jealousy of his son in law  or his particular suspicions arising out of circumstances  He therefore endeavoured to persuade him  with an air of confidence  that this imaginary voice  and airy sword opposed to his substantial one  were  and could possibly be  but the gratuitous creations of a fancy  under the influence of amorous distrust  It was morally impossible that any person should have made his way into his daughter s chamber  With regard to the melancholy  so visible in his wile s deportment  it might very naturally be attributed to precarious health and delicacy of constitution  The honour of a husband need not be so tremblingly alive to all the qualms of maiden fear and inexperience  Change of condition  in the case of a girl habituated to live almost without human society  and abruptly consigned to the embraces of a man in whom love and previous acquaintance had not inspired confidence  might innocently be the cause of these tears  of these sighs  and of this lively affliction so irksome to his feelings  But it was to be considered that tenderness  especially in the hearts of young ladies  fortified by the pride of blood against the excesses of love sick abandonment  was only to be cherished into a flame by time and assiduity  He therefore exhorted him to tranquillize his disturbed mind  to be ardently officious in redoubling every instance of affection  to create a soft and seducing interest in the sensibility of Blanche  In short  he besought him earnestly to return to her apartment  and laboured to persuade him that his distrust and confusion would only set her on an unconjugal and litigious defence of her insulted virtue   The constable returned no answer to the arguments of his father  in law  whether because he began to think in good earnest that his senses were imposed on by the disorder of his mind  or because he thought it more to the purpose to dissemble  than to undertake ineffectually to convince the old man of an event so devoid of all likelihood  He returned to his wife s chamber  laid himself down by her side  and endeavoured to obtain from sleep some relief from his extreme uneasiness  Blanche  on her part  the unhappy Blanche  was not a whit more at her ease  Her ears had been but too open to the same alarming sounds  which had assailed her husband s peace  nor could she construe into illusion an adventure of which she well knew the secret and the motives  She was surprised that Enriquez should attempt to find his way into her apartment  after having pledged his faith so solemnly to the Princess Constance  Instead of feeding her soul with vanity  or deriving any flattering omens from a proceeding fraught with personal tenderness  but destructive to self  approbation  she considered it as a new insult  and her heart was only so much the more exasperated with resentment against the author   While Siffredi s daughter  with all her prejudices excited against the young king  believed him the most guilty of men  that unhappy prince  more than ever ensnared by Blanche  was anxious for an interview  to satisfy her mind on a subject which seemed to make so much against him  For that purpose he would have visited Belmonte sooner  but for a press of business too urgent to be neglected  nor could he withdraw himself from the court before that night  He was perfectly at home in all the turnings of a place where he had been brought up  and therefore was at no loss to slip into the castle of Siffredi  Nay  he was still in possession of the key to a secret door communicating with the gardens  By this inlet did he gain his former apartment  and thence found his way into Blanche s chamber  Only conceive what must have been the astonishment of that prince to find a man in possession  and to feel a sword opposed to his guard  He was just on the point of betraying all  and of punishing the rebel on the very spot  whose sacrilegious hand had dared to lift itself against the person of its lawful sovereign  But then the delicacy due to the daughter of Leontio held his indignation in check  He retreated in the same direction as he had advanced  and
