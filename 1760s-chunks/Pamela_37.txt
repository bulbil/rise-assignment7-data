                               Your distressed DAUGHTER                LETTER XXVI         MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I did not rise till ten o clock  and I had all the concerns and wishes   of the family  and multitudes of inquiries about me  My wicked master   went out early to hunt  but left word he would be in to breakfast  And   so he was       He came up to our chamber about eleven  and had nothing to do to be   sorry  for he was our master  and so put on sharp anger at first       I had great emotions at his entering the room  and threw my apron over   my head  and fell a crying  as if my heart would break       Mrs  Jervis  said he  since I know you  and you me so well  I don t know   how we shall live together for the future  Sir  said she  I will take   the liberty to say  what I think is best for both  I have so much   grief  that you should attempt to do any injury to this poor girl  and   especially in my chamber  that I should think myself accessary to the   mischief  if I was not to take notice of it  Though my ruin  therefore    may depend upon it  I desire not to stay  but pray let poor Pamela and   me go together  With all my heart  said he  and the sooner the better    She fell a crying  I find  says he  this girl has made a party of the   whole house in her favour against me  Her innocence deserves it of us   all  said she very kindly  and I never could have thought that the son   of my dear good lady departed  could have so forfeited his honour  as to   endeavour to destroy a virtue he ought to protect  No more of this    Mrs  Jervis  said he  I will not hear it  As for Pamela  she has a lucky   knack of falling into fits  when she pleases  But the cursed yellings   of you both made me not myself  I intended no harm to her  as I told you   both  if you d have left your squallings  And I did no harm neither  but   to myself  for I raised a hornet s nest about my ears  that  as far as I   know  may have stung to death my reputation  Sir  said Mrs  Jervis  then   I beg Mr  Longman may take my accounts  and I will go away as soon as   I can  As for Pamela  she is at her liberty  I hope  to go away next   Thursday  as she intends       I sat still  for I could not speak nor look up  and his presence   discomposed me extremely  but I was sorry to hear myself the unhappy   occasion of Mrs  Jervis s losing her place  and hope that may be still   made up       Well  said he  let Mr  Longman make up your accounts  as soon as you   will  and Mrs  Jewkes  who is his housekeeper in Lincolnshire  shall   come hither in your place  and won t be less obliging  I dare say  than   you have been  Said she  I have never disobliged you till now  and let   me tell you  sir  if you knew what belonged to your own reputation or   honour  No more  no more  said he  of these antiquated topics  I have   been no bad friend to you  and I shall always esteem you  though you   have not been so faithful to my secrets as I could have wished  and have   laid me open to this girl  which has made her more afraid of me than she   had occasion  Well  sir  said she  after what passed yesterday  and last   night  I think I went rather too far in favour of your injunctions   than otherwise  and I should have deserved every body s censure  as the   basest of creatures  had I been capable of contributing to your lawless   attempts  Still  Mrs  Jervis  still reflecting upon me  and all for   imaginary faults  for what harm have I done the girl   I won t bear it    I ll assure you  But yet  in respect to my mother  I am willing to part   friendly with you though you ought both of you to reflect on the freedom
