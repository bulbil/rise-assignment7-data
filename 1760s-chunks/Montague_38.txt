us almost to our shoulders  so that  upon the whole  we are pretty well guarded from the weather as well as the men       Our covered carrioles too have not only canvas windows  we dare not have glass  because we often overturn   but cloth curtains to draw all round us  the extreme swiftness of these carriages also  which dart along like lightening  helps to keep one warm  by promoting the circulation of the blood       I pity the Fitz  no tiger was ever so hard hearted as I am this weather  the little god has taken his flight  like the swallows  I say nothing  but cruelty is no virtue in Canada  at least at this season       I suppose Pygmalion s statue was some frozen Canadian gentlewoman  and a sudden warm day thawed her  I love to expound ancient fables  and I think no exposition can be more natural than this        Would you know what makes me chatter so this morning  Papa has made me take some excellent liqueur   tis the mode here  all the Canadian ladies take a little  which makes them so coquet and agreable  Certainly brandy makes a woman talk like an angel  Adieu   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER L   50   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Jan  4   I DON T quite agree with you  my dear  your brother does not appear to me to have the least scruple of that foolish false modesty which stands in a man s way       He is extremely what the French call awakened  he is modest  certainly  that is  he is not a coxcomb  but he has all that proper self confidence which is necessary to set his agreable qualities in full light  nothing can be a stronger proof of this  than that  wherever he is  he always takes your attention in a moment  and this without seeming to solicit it        I am very fond of him  though he never makes love to me  in which circumstance he is very singular  our friendship is quite platonic  at least on his side  for I am not quite so sure on the other  I remember one day in summer we were walking tête à tête in the road to Cape Rouge  when he wanted me to strike into a very beautiful thicket   Positively  Rivers   said I   I will not venture with you into that wood    Are you afraid of me  Bell    No  but extremely of myself        I have loved him ever since a little scene that passed here three or four months ago  a very affecting story  of a distressed family in our neighbourhood  was told him and Sir George  the latter preserved all the philosophic dignity and manly composure of his countenance  very coldly expressed his concern  and called another subject  your brother changed color  his eyes glistened  he took the first opportunity to leave the room  he sought these poor people  he found  he relieved them  which we discovered by accident a month after       The weather  tho  cold beyond all that you in England can form an idea of  is yet mild to what it has been the last five or six days  we are going to Quebec  to church   Two o clock       Emily and I have been talking religion all the way home  we are both mighty good girls  as girls go in these degenerate days  our grandmothers to be sure but it s folly to look back       We have been saying  Lucy  that  tis the strangest thing in the world people should quarrel about religion  since we undoubtedly all mean the same thing  all good minds in every religion aim at pleasing the Supreme Being  the means we take differ according to the country where we are born  and the prejudices we imbibe from education  a consideration which ought to inspire us with kindness and indulgence to each other       If we examine each other s sentiments with candor  we shall find much less difference in essentials than we imagine     Since all agree to own  at least to mean    One great  one good  one general Lord of all     There is  I think  a very pretty Sunday reflexion for you  Lucy         You must know  I am extremely religious  and for this amongst other reasons  that I think infidelity a vice peculiarly contrary to the native softness of woman  it is bold  daring  masculine  and I should almost doubt the sex of an unbeliever in petticoats       Women are religious as they are virtuous  less from principles founded on reasoning and argument  than from elegance of mind  delicacy of moral taste  and a certain quick perception of the beautiful and becoming in every thing       This instinct  however  for such it is  is worth all the tedious reasonings of the men  which is a point I flatter myself you will not dispute with me   Monday  Jan  5       This is
