of me  I am persuaded that my chance would be a sorry one  and for that reason  I shall serve him as he would serve me  And I may tell you in the first place  that he is a fly by night whose proceedings it is no easy matter to take measure of  a man who puts on all the starch formalities of an inveterate religionist  but at bottom has not a spark of principle in his composition  He goes every evening dangling after a little girl no better than she should be        I am vastly glad indeed to find that  interrupted Ambrose  because I plainly perceive  by all you have been telling me  that he is a man of corrupt morals and licentious practices  But answer point by point to the questions I shall put to you  It is above all on the subject of religion that I am commissioned to inquire into his sentiments and conduct  Pray tell me  do you eat much pork at your house  I do not think  answered Gaspard  that we have seen it at table twice in the year that I have lived with him  Better and better  replied the paragon of inquisitors write down in legible characters that they never eat pork in Samuel Simon s family  But as a set off against that  doubtless a joint of lamb is served up every now and then  Yes  every now and then  rejoined the apprentice  we killed one for our own consumption about last Easter  The season is pat and to the purpose  cried the ecclesiastical commissioner  Come  write down  that Simon keeps the passover  This goes on merrily to a complete conviction  and it seems  we have got a good serviceable information here   Tell me again  my friend  pursued Lamela  whether you have not often seen your master fondle young children  A thousand times  answered Gaspard  When he sees the little urchins playing about before the shop  if they happen to be pretty  he calls them in and makes much of them  Write that down  be sure you write that down  interrupted the inquisitor  Samuel Simon is very grievously suspected of lying in wait for Christian children  and enticing them into his den to circumcise them  Vastly well  vastly well  indeed  Master Simon  you will have an account to settle with the society for the suppression of Judaism  take my word for it  Do not take it into your savage head that such bloody sacrifices are to be perpetrated with impunity  A pretty use you make of baptism and shaving  Cheer up  religious Gaspard  thou foremost of elect apprentices  Make a full confession of all thy master s sins  complete thine honest testimony by telling us how this simular of a Catholic is more than ever wedded to his Jewish customs and ceremonies  Is it not a fact  that one day in the week he sits with his hands before him  and will not even perform the most necessary offices for himself  No  answered Gaspard  I have not exactly observed that  What comes nearest to it is that on some days he shuts himself up in his closet  and stays there a long time  Ay  now we have it  exclaimed the commissary  He keeps the sabbath  or I am not an inquisitor  Note that particularly  officer  note that he observes the fast of the sabbath most superstitiously  Out upon him  What a shocking fellow  One question more  and his business is done  Is not he always parleying about Jerusalem  Pretty often indeed  replied our informer  He knows the Old Testament by heart  and tells us how the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed  The very thing  resumed Ambrose  Secretary  be sure you do not neglect that feature of the case  Write  in letters of an inch long  that Samuel Simon has contracted with the devil for the rebuilding of the temple  and that he is plotting day and night for the re establishment of his nation  That is all I want to know  and it is labour in vain to pursue the examination any further  What Gaspard  in the spirit of truth and charity  has deposed  would be sufficient to make a bonfire of all Jewry   When the august mouth piece of the holy tribunal had sifted the little scoundrelly apprentice after this manner  he told him he might go about his business  at the same time commanding him  under the severest penalties of the inquisition  not to say a word to his master about what was going forward  Gaspard promised implicit obedience  and marched off  We were not long in coming after him  our procession from the inn was as grave and solemn as our pilgrimage thereunto  till we knocked at Samuel Simon s door  He opened it in person  Three figures such as ours might have dumbfounded a better man  but his face was as long as a lawsuit  when Lamela  our spokesman  said to him in a tone of authority  Master Samuel  I command you in the name of the holy inquisition  whose delegate I have the honour to be  to give me the key of your closet without murmur or delay  I want to see if I cannot
