of the subject in general  attempted to increase their own  Some thought they saw  in this measure  the seeds of future aristocracy  that the house of commons constituted themselves judges of their own privileges  and that the liberty of every individual in society was at the disposal of a body who professed acting chiefly for their own honour   However this may be  another measure was soon after taken  which  in reality  made distinctions among the people  and laid an unpassable line between the rich and poor  This was an act for the better preventing clandestine marriages  and for the more public solemnization of that ceremony  The grievance complained of  and which this law was to redress  was  that the sons and daughters of opulent families were often seduced into marriage  before they had acquired sufficient experience in life to be sensible of the disparity of fortune in the match  This statute therefore enacted  that the bans of marriage should be regularly published three successive Sundays in the church of the parish where both parties had resided for one month at least  before the ceremony  That a marriage which was solemnized without this previous publication  or a license obtained from the Bishop s Court  should be void  and the person who solemnized it should be transported for seven years  This act was  at that time  thought   197 replete with consequences injurious to society  and experience has manifested some of them  villains have gone about deceiving ignorant women  under a pretence of marriage  and then have left them without redress  The poor were thus rendered utterly incapable of making alliances with the rich  and the wealth of the nation has thus been more liable to accumulation in opulent families  It has been thought to impede that ardour which impels many to marry  and to clog a ceremony of the most infinite advantage to society  with procrastination and delay  Some have affirmed  that debaucheries and lewdness have become more frequent since the enacting this law  and it is believed  that the numbers of the people are upon the decline   This session of parliament was also distinguished by another act equally unpopular  and  perhaps  equally injurious to the religion of the community  This was a law for naturalizing the Jews  The ministers boldly affirmed  that such a law would greatly contribute to the advantage of the nation  that it would increase the credit and commerce of the kingdom  and set a laudable example of political toleration  Many others  however  were of very different sentiments  they saw that greater favour was shewn  by this bill  to Jews  than to some other sects professing the Christian religion  that an introduction of this people into the kingdom would disgrace the character of the nation  and cool the zeal of the natives already too lukewarm  However  notwithstanding all opposition  this bill was passed into a law  nor was it till the ensuing session of parliament  that it was thought necessary to be repealed   An act  equally unpopular with the two former  was now also passed  which contained regulations for the better preserving the game  By this none but men already possessed of a stated fortune  had a privilege of carrying a gun  or destroying game  though   198 even upon the grounds which he himself rented  This totally damped all that martial spirit among the lower orders of mankind  by preventing their handling those arms which might one day be necessary to defend their country  and gave the rich the sole injoyment of a pleasure  which  before  had been considered as the common privilege of humanity  Such were the laws passed this session  through all which a spirit of aristocracy was discerned by some  The body of the rich no longer fearing oppression from the throne  or an infringement of their own liberties  now began to lean heavy upon the poor  and to consider the interests of that useful part of society  as intirely distinct from their own  They never omitted  however  the usual addresses to the throne  and this session was remarkable for an address of thanks to his Majesty for maintaining  and rendering permanent  the general tranquility of Europe  at a time when war was kindling in almost every quarter of the world   I am   c   LETTER XXV   IF we seek for the origin of that war which now threatened universal devastation  we shall find it kindling up in several countries  both of Europe  America  and Asia  at one and the same time  Most other national contests have arisen from some one principal cause  but this war seems to have been produced by the concurrence of several  or it may be considered as the continuance of the late war  which had not been effectually extinguished by the defective treaty of Aix la Chapelle   In Asia  upon the coast of Malabar  the English and French had never ceased hostilities  The claim   199 of Prussia and Austria  upon the territories of Silesia  had never been thoroughly adjusted  The limits of Nova Scotia  inhabited by the English  and bordered upon by the French  were never precisely determined  and  southward  the boundaries of Acadia  an extended country belonging to the French  and bordering upon Virginia  were equally left
