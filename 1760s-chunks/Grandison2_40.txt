 They gave a smiling assent   My Lord and Lady both expressed themselves overjoy d   This Canterbury ran in my head  It was brought in naturally enough  and Mrs  Reeves wonder d  that Sir Charles kept secret the motive of his journeying thither backward and forward  The godlike man  said Mr  Reeves  in the words of a great poet  has nothing to conceal  For my part  replied my Lord  I conclude   99 the motive is rather a painful than a pleasurable one  Charlotte accuses her brother of reserves  I never found him reserved  But he loves to play with her curiosity  and amuse her  For she is very curious  yet has her secret —Has she not  Lady L    Indeed she has  replied my Lady—Perhaps you  my dear  will be intrusted with it  when you are at Colnebrooke together   Pray  madam  said I to Lady L  may I ask —Does Sir Charles give Lord G  his interest in his addresses to Miss Grandison   Lady L  My brother wishes Charlotte married  He is a great friend to the married state  especially with regard to our sex   Mr  Reeves could not miss this opportunity  It is a wonder  said he  that Sir Charles himself does not think of marriage   Lady L  That is a string that we but just touch sometimes  and away  There is a Lady—  There she stopt  Had she looked with earnestness at me  I had been undone  I believe    ☞ Let me ask you  Lucy  You have passed the fiery ordeal—Did you ever find in yourself a kind of impatience  next to petulance  and in your heart  only for fear of exposing yourself  that you were ready to quarrel  or to be short with any body that came upon you of a sudden  yet have no business of consequence to engage either your fingers or your thoughts —Of late  my dear  I have been very often troubled with this odd sensation  But my whole temper is altering  I believe  I shall grow peevish  perverse  and gloomy  I doubt  O this wicked Sir Hargrave ☜   Pray  my dear  attend for the future to those indexes or hands  and forbear to read out the passages inclosed by them  if you can—But if you come upon them before you are aware  why then read on—with all my heart     100 But to return to Lady L  s alarming hint—   There is a Lady   —    Mrs  Reeves  That Sir Charles loves  I suppose   Lady L  That loves Sir Charles  and she has—But for the Lady s sake—Yet if it be allowable for any woman to be in love with any man  upon an uncertainty of return  it is for one that is in love with my brother   Harriet  And cannot Sir Charles make a return —Poor Lady   My cousin afterwards told me  that my upper lip then quiver d like an aspen leaf  I did not know that it did  I felt not a trembling at my heart  and when the lip trembles  the heart  I think  should be affected  There used to be a close connexion between mine   Mr  Reeves  Miss Grandison told me  that  if her brother married  half a score women would break their hearts   Lady L  The words half a score run as glibly off the tongue as half a dozen  But I believe  let the envious  the censorious  malign our sex  and charge us with the love of rakes and libertines  as they will  if all men were like my brother  there would not be a single woman  and hardly a bad one  in the kingdom  What say you  my Lord   Lord L  My dear life  you know I am all attention  whenever you  or my sister Charlotte  make our brother the subject of your panegyric  If Miss Byron  you do not choose to hear so much said of this best of men  you will  I doubt  have an ill time of it in the favour you will do us at Colnebrooke   Harriet  My Lord  I should be very ungrateful  if I did not hear with pleasure every thing that shall be said in praise of Sir Charles Grandison   Lord L  When I am out of conceit with men  as too often they give me cause to be  I think of my brother  and forgive them   I wonder  Lucy  what every body means by praising   101 Sir Charles Grandison so much in my hearing—Shall I fly from town  to avoid hearing his praises —Yes  say you —But whither  It must not be to Selbyhouse  Well then  I may as well go to Colnebrooke  I shall there be informed of the reasons for all those general applauses  for hitherto I know nothing of his history  to what they tell me I am to know   These general praises carried us away from a subject that I thought we should once have made more of—That one Lady—And I wanted to know  but had no
