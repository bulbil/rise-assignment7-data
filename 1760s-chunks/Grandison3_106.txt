 briefly  the event of the conference between the Bishop and him  and I hasten to obey you in your next article     263  LETTER XXVI  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Thursday Morn  Mar  30   I Send you now inclosed the doctor s fourth Letter  I believe I must desire my grandmamma and my aunt Selby to send for me down   We shall all be in London this evening   Would to heaven I had never come to it —What of pleasure have I had in it —This abominable Sir Hargrave Pollexfen —But for him  I had been easy and happy  since but for him  I had never wanted the relief of Sir Charles Grandison  never had known him  Fame might perhaps have brought to my ears  in general conversation  as other persons of distinction are talked of  some of his benevolent actions  and he would have attracted my admiration without costing me one sigh  And yet  had it been so  I should then have known none of those lively sensibilities that have mingled pleasure with my pain  on the pride I have had in being distinguished as a sister to the sisters of so extraordinary a man  O that I had kept my foolish heart free  I should then have had enough to boast of for my whole life  enough to talk of to every one  And when I had been asked by my companions and intimates  What diversions  what entertainments  I had been at  I should have said     I have been in company and conversed with SIR CHARLES GRANDISON  and been favoured and distinguished by all his family    And I should have passed many a happy winter evening  when my companions came to work and read with me at Selby house  in answering their questions about all these  and Sir Charles would have been known among us principally by the name of The fine Gentleman  and my young friends would have come about me  and asked me to tell them something more of The Excellent man       264 But now my ambition has overthrown me  Aiming  wishing to be every thing  I am nothing  If I am asked about him  or his sisters  I shall seek to evade the subject  and yet  what other subject can I talk of  For what have I seen  what have I known  since I left Northamptonshire  but Him and Them  and what must lead to Him and Them  And what indeed but Him and Them  since I have known this family  have I wished to see  and to know   On reviewing the above  how have I  as I see  suffered my childish fancies to delude me into a short forgetfulness of his  of every  body s distresses —But  O my Lucy  my heart is torn in pieces  and  I verily think  more for the unhappy Clementina s sake  than for my own  How severely do I pay for my curiosity  Yet it was necessary that I should know the worst  So Sir Charles seems to have thought  by the permission he has given to Dr  Bartlett  to oblige me  and through me  his sisters  and all you my own friends   Your pity will be more raised on reading the Letter I inclose  not only for Clementina and Sir Charles  but for the whole family  none of whom  tho  all unhappy  are to be blamed  You will dearly love the noble Jeronymo  and be pleased with the young Lady s faithful Camilla  But  my dear  there is so much tenderness in Sir Charles s woe—It must be Love—But he ought to love Clementina  She is a glorious  tho unhappy  young creature  I must not have one spark of generosity left in my heart  I must be lost wholly in Self  if I did not equally admire and love her   Dr  Bartlett s fourth Letter   AS I remember  madam  Sir Charles mentions to you  in a very pathetic manner  the distress he was in when the terms and conditions  on which he was to be allowed to call the noble Clementina his    265 were proposed to him  as they were by the Bishop  He has briefly told you the terms  and his grief to be obliged to disappoint the expectation of persons so deservedly dear to him  But you will not  I believe  be displeased  if I dwell a little more on these particulars  tho  they are not commanded from me   The Bishop  when he had acquainted Mr  Grandison with the terms  said  You are silent  my dear Grandison  You hesitate  What  Sir  Is a proposal of a daughter of one of the noblest families in I•aly  that daughter a Clementina  to be slighted by a •an of a private family  a foreigner  of dependent fortunes  her dowry not unworthy of a Prince s acceptance  Do you hesitate upon such a proposal as this  Sir   My Lord  I am grieved  rather than surprised  at the proposal  I was apprehensive it would be made  My joy at receiving the condescending invitation  and at the
