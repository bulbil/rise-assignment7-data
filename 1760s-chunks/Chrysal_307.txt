there having sailed a few days   before  But her vexation at this disappointment was considerably   lightened by the conversation of several companions in it  particu    larly that of a chaplain of a regiment  who had taken such offence   at the immorality of the army  and the uncomfortable way of living   in those savage countries  that he had hired a substitute  at a cheap   rate  to do his duty  and was returning home to enjoy a life more   agreeable to the delicacy of his character and inclinations  and   exert his talents to more advantage in paying court to his patrons    than in reforming soldiers or converting savages  Extremes are   never lasting  The violence of my mistress s grief had been too   much for nature to support  and was beginning to abate of itself    vrhen my late master awoke another passion  that would soon have   supplanted it   and though he did not pursue his advantage as   far as he might have done  he had opened her heart  and inspired a   warmth ready to receive any other impression  As the chaplain s   function and her rank  not to omit the accomplishments of both          362 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     seemed to point them to each other as the most proper companions    it was not strange that they should soon grow intimate  nor that   their intimacy should be insensibly improved into a tenderer passion    They made tHe d t e parties at games which no one else ia the place   knew how to play with them  They talked of all the places of   pleasurable resort in England  and of the amusements pursued at   them  and they raised their own consequence in the eyes of each other    by boasting of acquaintances with persons they knew only by name      Such uncommon accomplishments were not without effect  Each   took the tales of the other upon credit  because their own met the   same complaisance  and found a pleasure in being deceived by   one whom it was an equal pleasure to deceive  But this was not   the only thing that advanced their mutual influence upon each   other  All human excellence is but comparative  Though far   from being beautiful  they were the nearest to being so   though   far from being well bred  they knew most of the common ceremonies   in which good breeding is by many thought to consist  but which   really are the enciimbrances of it  of any persons there  and conse    quently appeared to enjoy those advantages in the highest degree    They regulated the assemblies  they laid down the rules of play    they made fashions   in a word  their opinion was the law in every   matter of polite amusement and concern      Thus cut out for each other  it was impossible for this accom    plished pair not to come together  They were accordingly married    not more to the grief of their respective admirers than the joy of   their rivals  the bride forgetting her grief for a dead  in the arms of   a living husband  and the happy bridegroom pleasing himself with   the thought that the high accomplishments of his lady would in    crease his interest with his noble patrons  To crown their happi    ness  a few days after they were married  an English man of war   put in there  on its way home  the captain of which politely offered   them their passage  Such an opportunity was not to be missed     they accepted his offer with the greatest joy  and in return  made   a party and entertainment for him  when he won me from my   mistress at a game of brag  the only game  indeed  at which he   thought himself a match for her      Though I had no reason to regret leaving her service  my present   change gave me no great pleasure  as it wanted even the recom    mendation of novelty  my new master being the captain with   whom I had the last time left the Spanish coast  and who had at   length been made so happy as to be ordered home          CHAPTER X     OHEYSAL AGAIN ARRIVES IN ENGLAND â€” HIS MASTER IS SALUTED   BY A SIGHT NOT VERY PLEASING â€” THE HISTORY OF THE tTNFOR      TUNATB HEBO OF THE DAY OPENS SOME MYSTERIOTTS SCENES     THE OBVTOtrS tT SE GIT COUNCILS OF WAR     The arrival of my master in  England presented him with a scene   that made him wish he had not been in such hastÂ« to return  On         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 363     his entering the harbour  he found the boats of all the
