be accounted for   I beg to hear from you —and tell me of your Health   I am   my dearest Fanny   Your s without Doubt   LETTER CXIX  FRANCES to HENRY   I RECEIVED your last Adieu  and am in Reality more obliged to you  than I should have been  for a much kinder  for by convincing me  you felt no Concern from our Separaration  you lessened mine extremely   I sincerely hope that the Freshness and Purity of the Country Air will  in a few Days  restore you to perfect Health  and I make not the least Doubt  but its contemplative Pleasures will quickly recover your Spirits to that calm  uniform  philosophick Chearfulness  which the interposing Impertinence of disagreeable  or   222  at best  insipid Objects may  for some Time past  have ruffled   You compliment me extremely  when you suppose me capable of distinguishing the Effects of Joy from those of Pleasure  I have been but little conversant with either of them  therefore my Ignorance is excusable  should I tell you  I always looked on them as twin Sisters  and so very like  that it was difficult to know  one from t other  I think too  they are the joint Offspring of Love and Reason  who  disputing to whom they should pay most Obedience  quarrelled  and have never since been reconciled   But  to speak in a more natural Way  I look upon Joy and Pleasure to be synonymous Terms  they arise from one Faculty  or Affection of the Mind  and Joy is nothing more or less than the first and strongest Emotion  which breaks out  on our being really pleased  I will not pretend to say  that my Definition is right  I have only given my Opinion —But this I know  that  if I am not capable of abstracting Joy from Pleasure  I can  at least  distinguish Pleasure from Indifference —For this Reason you may justly suppose the Party at an End  from the Moment it was mentioned  and I here give you my Word  it is the last of the Kind  I shall ever propose with you  I hope you will pardon what is past  on this very sincere Promise of Amendment   I am far from being displeased  at finding   223 your Prudence superior to mine  It has indeed been so  thro  the whole Course of our Acquaintance  but as  I believe  there are few People  who have more Quickness and Vivacity in their Dispositions  so there is no Person breathing  whose Spirits are more easily damped  than mine  for Want of Resolution has hitherto been my greatest Fault  as well as Misfortune —As I have been often led by Persuasion to many Things  contrary to my Inclinations  while  from Want of Resolution  I have left undone those Things  which Reason  Virtue  Prudence  and Pride dictated —In both these Cases  I consider myself  as very blameable  by acting in direct Opposition to the little Understanding  that Providence has blessed me with  In this Light  I think my supporting any Kind of Correspondence with you an Offence against myself more unpardonable  than any I ever yet had Will  or Power to commit  to the Prejudice of any other Creature  But  tho  this  like all other Acts of Folly  carries its Punishment in the Commission  I am determined not to leave it in your Power  to make that an Act of Necessity  which I design a Sacrifice —And as I am not capable of affording you any Kind of Happiness  without injuring myself  I think it is high Time to put an End to our mutual Uneasiness  and remain satisfied with the pleasing Belief  that we would each do much  to make the other happy     224You know this Resolution has taken up my Thoughts for some Time  and I solemnly declare  I mention it now from no other Motive  but a Design of reducing it to Practice  I have not one Doubt with Regard to your Affection for me  I do indeed believe you love me  but I am certain  that Love can only be productive of Misery to me  and as you are  and ever have been  a thousand Times dearer to me  than myself  I can better bear a voluntary Punishment  than any inflicted by you  for  there  the Means would double the Misfortune   I thank you for your kind Construction of my Words and Actions  may they ever appear to you  in their native  genuine Light  you will then think of me    as one  that loved not wisely  but too well   I have not been out of Doors  since I saw you  nor well one Moment  I had a violent Return of the Cholick  about three Hours after you left me  I could not rest in Bed  but walked about the Room all Night  by this Means I increased my Cold  and have now got a very comfortable Cough  I flatter myself  your s has left you  if so  I shall bear mine with greater Patience  for  tho  I wish we should  both utter the
