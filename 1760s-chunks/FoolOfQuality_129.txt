  life  they made off in haste      I rose as well as I was able  and  holding by the rails and wall    got with difficulty home  where  crawling up stairs  my wife helped   to undress me  and I went to bed      She then sent for our old physician  who ordered me some   potions  with outward fomentations to assuage the contusions  I   was however seized that night with a violent fever  which continued   upwards of three weeks  but without any delirium   and within   another week I was able to sit up  though still very weak and   greatly emaciated      The last of our stock  with the fruits of my late employment    were now nearly expended on doctor  drugs  and so forth  Where    fore I found it necessary to abridge our domestic charge as close   as possible   and having sent our girl with a token for my porter s     12         116 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      habiliments  I gave them to her in lieu of what remained of her   wages  and with the help of an additional shilling discharged her      I was now able to bear the light  and the windows were half   opened   but how was I shocked on observing that my Arabella   and my little Tommy were as pale and as much fallen away as   myself  For Arabella had half starved her infant  and almost   wholly starved herself  in order to save sufficient for my sustenance   during my illness   yet she bore up with a sweet and smiling sem    blance  and in her alone was realized all that ever I have seen of the   boasted patience of stoicism  or of the power of Christianity in   effecting a new nature      Within a little time I was once more able to walk about the   room   when  on the day preceding that wherein our quarter s rent   was to become due  Mrs  Jennett entered w r ith a face wherein was   prefaced whatever insolence  hardness of heart  or contempt of our   wretched situation could dictate  Mr  Clement  says she  if so be   your name be Clement  I suppose I am not to tell you that to    morrow is quarter day  And yet  if some people  Mr  Clement    can t afford to eat  I can t see how they can afford to pay rent  Mr    Clement   and so  you know   tis every bit as comfortable to starve   in jail as in lodgings  But this is nothing to the purpose  I am   myself but a poor woman  and no better than richer folks  Yet    poor as I am  comparisons may be odious between some people and   some people   and then I don t come for charity  I come for nothing   but my own  and that  you know  is the least that will satisfy any   body  If you had any one else to befriend you but myself  you   might a  been put up on the parish before this  But  as I was   saying  I can t be an only friend and all friends at once  And I must   tell you that I hate objects   for I have so much pity in my nature   that it pains me to look at  em   and  above all  I can t abide  em   in my own house  And so  as I told you  Mr  Constable will be   here in the morning  and he will show you to lodgings that will fit   you much better   and so  Mr  Clement and Mrs  Clement  if so be   that your names be Clement  I wish you both a mighty good    morning  And so away she went without waiting an answer      As soon as she was gone Hammy  says Arabella  our kind land    lady puts me in mind of the wife of honest Socrates  whom he took   for the trial and exercise of his patience  Ah  how cringing was   this woman   how insolent is servility when it attains any power     But what  I wonder  is become of our friends the Miss Hodginses    I would have sent to inquire after them  but I was petted at their   neglect of us during our long illness  I will step there this minute    and borrow as much  at least  as will snatch my Hammy from the   fangs of this fury      So saying  weak as she was  she dressed herself with a cheerful   air  and going  pleasantly repeated Your servant
