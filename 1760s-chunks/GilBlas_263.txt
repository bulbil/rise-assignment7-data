me for giving you an opportunity of carrying your benevolent inclinations into effect This was just as good as telling me that the business was to be done for nothing  Though such doctrine was not quite level to my capacity  I still affected a wish to do as he desired  It gives me infinite pleasure  answered I to Navarro  to have it in my power to evince my lively sense of all your former kindness to me  It is enough for you to take any man living by the hand  from that moment he becomes the object of my unwearied care  Your friend shall have the situation you want for him  nay  he has it already  it is no longer any concern of yours  leave it entirely to me   On this assurance Joseph went away in high glee  nevertheless  the person he recommended had not the post in question  It was given to another man  and my strong box was the stronger by a thousand ducats  This sum was infinitely preferable to all the thanks in the world  so that I looked pitifully blank when next we met  saying    Ah  my dear Navarro  you should have thought of speaking to me sooner  That Calderona got the start of me  he has given away a certain thing that shall be nameless  I am vexed to the soul not to meet you with better tidings   Joseph was fool enough to give me credit  and we parted better friends than ever  but I suspect that he soon found out the truth  for he never came near me again  This was just what I wanted  Besides that the memory of benefits received grated harshly  it would not have been at all the thing for a person in my then sphere to keep company with a certain description of people   The Count de Lemos has been long in the background  let us bring him a little forwarder on the canvas  We met occasionally  I had carried him a thousand pistoles  as the reader will recollect  and I now carried him a thousand more  by order of his uncle the duke  out of his excellency s funds lying in my hands  On this occasion the Count de Lemos honoured me with a long conference  He informed me that at length he had completely gained his end  and was in unrivalled possession of the Prince of Spain s good graces  whose sole confidant he was  His next concern was to invest me with a right honourable commission  of which he had already given me a hint  Friend Santillane  said he  now is the time to strike while the iron is hot  Spare no pains to find out some young beauty  worthy to while away the prince s amorous hours  You have your wits about you  and a word to the wise is sufficient  Go  run about the town  pry into every hole and corner  and when you have pounced upon anything likely to suit  you will come and let me know  I promised the count to leave no stone unturned in the due discharge of my employment  which seemed to require no great force of genius  since the professors of the science are so numerous   I had not hitherto been much practised in such delicate investigations  but it was more than probable that Scipio had  and that his talent lay peculiarly that way  On my return home I called him in  and spoke thus to him in private  My good fellow  I have a very important secret to impart  Do you know that in the midst of fortune s favours  there is something still wanting to crown all my wishes  I can easily guess what that is  interrupted he  without giving me time to finish what I was going to say  you want a little snug bit of contraband amusement  to keep you awake of evenings  and rub off the dust of business  And  in fact  it is a marvellous thing that you should have played the Joseph in the heyday of your blood  when so many greybeards around you are playing the Elder  I admire the quickness of your apprehension  replied I with a smile  Yes  my friend  a mistress is that something still wanting  and you shall choose for me  But I forewarn you that I am nice hungry  and must have a pretty person  with more than passable manners  The sort of thing that you require  returned Scipio  is not always to be met with in the market  Yet  as luck will have it  we are in a town where everything is to be got for money  and I am in hopes that your commission will not hang long on hand   Accordingly within three days he pulled me by the sleeve  I have discovered a treasure  a young lady whose name is Catalina  of good family and matchless beauty  living with her aunt in a small house  where they make both ends meet by clubbing their little matters  and set the slanderous world at defiance  Their waiting  maid  a girl of my acquaintance  has given me to understand that their door  though barred against all impertinent intruders  would turn upon its hinges to a rich and generous suitor  if he would only consent  for fear
