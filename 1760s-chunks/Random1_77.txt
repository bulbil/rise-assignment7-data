unfortunate  not criminal  and attended her with such care and success  that in less than two months  her health  as well as my own  was perfectly re established —As we often conferred upon our mutual affairs  and interchanged advice  a thousand different projects were formed  which upon further canvassing appeared impracticable —We would have gladly gone to service  but who would take us in without recommendation  At length an expedient occurred to her  of which she intended to lay hold  and this was  to procure with the first money she should earn  the homely garb of a country wench  go to some village at a good distance from town  and come up in a waggon  as a fresh girl for service  by which means  she might be provided for in a manner much more suitable to her inclination  than her present way of life       218  CHAP  XXIV   I am reduced to great misery—assaulted on Tower hill by a press gang  who put me on board a tender—my usage there—my arrival on board of the Thunder man of war  where I am put in irons  and afterwards released by the good offices of Mr  Thomson  who recommends me as assistant to the surgeon—he relates his own story  and makes me acquainted with the characters of the captain  surgeon  and first mate   I Applauded the resolution of Miss Williams  who a few days after  was hired in quality of bar keeper  by one of the ladies who had witnessed in her behalf at the Marshalsea  and who since that time had got credit with a wine merchant  whose favourite she was  to set up a convenient house of her own —Thither my fellow lodger repaired  after having taken leave of me  with a torrent of tears  and a thousand protestations of eternal gratitude  assuring me  she would remain in this new situation no longer than till she should pick up money sufficient to put her other design in execution   As for my own part  I saw no resource but the army or navy  between which I hesitated so long  that I found myself reduced to a starving condition —My spirit began to accommodate itself to my beggarly fate  and I became so mean  as to   219 go down towards Wapping  with an intention to enquire for an old school fellow of mine  who  I understood  had got the command of a small coasting vessel  then in the river  and implore his assistance —But my destiny prevented this abject piece of behaviour  for as I crossed Towerwharf  a squat tawny fellow  with a hanger by his side  and a cudgel in his hand  came up to me  calling     Yo  ho  brother  you must come along with me  —  As I did not like his appearance  instead of answering his salutation  I quickened my pace in hopes of ridding myself of his company  which he perceiving  whistled aloud  and immediately another sailor appeared before me  who laid hold of me by the collar and began to drag me along —Not being of a humour to relish such treatment  I disengaged myself of the assailant  and with one blow of my cudgel  laid him motionless on the ground  and perceiving myself surrounded in a trice  by ten or a dozen more  exerted myself with such dexterity and success  that some of my opponents were fain to attack me with drawn cutlasses  and after an obstinate engagement  in which I received a large wound on the head  and another on my left cheek  I was disarmed  taken prisoner  and carried on board a pressing tender  where  after being pinioned like a malefactor  I was thrust down into the hold  among a parcel of miserable wretches  the sight of whom well nigh distracted me —As the commanding officer had not humanity enough to order my wounds to be dressed  and I could not use my own hands  I desired one of my fellow captives who was unsettered  to take a handkerchief out of my pocket and tie it round my head to stop the bleeding  He pulled out my   220 handkerchief   tis true  but instead of applying it to the use for which I designed it  went to the grating of the hatchway  and with astonishing composure  sold it before my face to a bum boatwoman  then on board  for a quart of gin  with which he treated his companions  regardless of my circumstance and intreaties     I complained bitterly of this robbery  to the midshipman on deck  telling him at the same time  that unless my hurts were dressed  I should bleed to death  But compassion was a weakness of which no man could justly accuse this person  who squirting a mouthful of dissolved tobacco upon me  through the gratings  told me     I was a mutinous dog  and that I might die and be damned  —  Finding there was no other remedy  I appealed to patience  and laid up this usage in my memory  to be recalled at a fitter season —In the mean time  loss of blood  vexation and want of food  contributed  with the noisome stench of the place
