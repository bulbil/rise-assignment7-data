 once more  involved in the horrors from whence it had lately been extricated   The Queen had promised to the men of Suffolk  who first declared in her favour  that she would suffer religion to remain in the situation in which she found it  This promise  however  she by no means intended to perform  political cruelty ever precedes religious  she had resolved on a change of religion  but  before she persecuted heretics  who were as yet her friends  it was necessary to get rid of some of the late council  who were  in reality  her enemies  The Duke of Northumberland was the first object of royal vengeance  and not indeed without reason  It is instructive enough to observe the vicissitudes of fortune  the Duke of Norfolk was now taken from his prison in the   267 Tower  to sit as judge upon the Duke of Northumberland  who had kept him there  The accused made a very skilful defence  but what could that avail in a court predetermined to condemn him  He was capitally convicted and soon after executed  Sir John Gates  and Sir Thomas Palmer  who had assisted in his projects  sharing in his punishment   While these were falling as victims to their ambition  the Queen s ministers were  in the mean time  carrying on a negotiation of marriage between her and Philip  King of Spain  The people thought they saw that this would be a fatal blow to their liberties  and therefore loudly murmured against it  but  when they found the treaty actually concluded  they could no longer contain  Sir Thomas Wyat  a Roman Catholic  at the head of four thousand insurgents  marched from Kent to Hyde Park  and entered the city in hopes of securing the Tower  but his rashness undid him  as he passed through the narrow streets  care was taken  by the Earl of Pembroke  to block up the way behind him  by fortifications thrown across the streets  and guards were placed at all the avenues to prevent his return  This unhappy man passed boldly forward  and was now ready to reap the fruits of his undertaking  when  to his astonishment  he found that he could neither proceed nor yet make good a retreat  He now  too late  perceived his own temerity  and  losing all courage in the exigency  he surrendered at discretion  In the mean time the Duke of Suffolk had endeavoured to foment the insurrection  but without success  he was taken prisoner also  and destined for the common slaughter  Accordingly  Wyat  the Duke of Suffolk  Sir John Throgmorton  and fiftyeight   268 more  were executed  but what raised the compassion of the people most of all  was the execution of Lady Jane Grey and her husband Guilford Dudley  who were involved in this calamity   Two days after Wyat was taken  Lady Jane and her husband were ordered to prepare for death  Lady Jane  who had long before seen the threatened blow  was no way surprized at the message  but bore it with heroic resolution  and  being informed that she had three days to prepare for death  she seemed displeased at so long a delay  Guilford Dudley was the first that suffered  as the Lady was conducted to execution  the officers of the Tower met her on the way  bearing the headless body of her husband  streaming with blood  in order to be interred in the chapel in the Tower  she looked on the corpse without trembling  and only  with a sigh  desired to proceed  She testified  to the last moment of her sufferings  great constancy  great piety  and an immoveable adherence to the reformation  This was the second Queen who died by the hands of the executioner in England   The enemies of the state being thus suppressed  the theatre was now opened for the pretended enemies of religion  The Queen was freed from all apprehensions of an insurrection  and therefore began by assembling a corrupt parliament  which was to countenance her future cruelties  The nobility  whose only religion seemed that of the Prince who governed  were easily gained over  and the house of commons seemed passive in all her proceedings  She began by giving orders for the suppression of married Bishops and priests  the mass was directed to be restored  the Pope s authority was re established  with some restrictions  the laws against heretics were renewed  and the   269 church and its privileges put upon the same foundation in which they were before the alterations of Henry VIII   This was kindling up the fires of persecution anew  at the head of these measures were Gardiner  Bishop of Winchester  and Bonner  Bishop of London  Poole  the Pope s Legate  a great part of whose life was spent in Italy  seemed too much civilized in that country  then the most polite in Europe  to be accessory to the measures now pursued  Gardiner began this bloody scene with Hooper and Rogers  Hooper had been Bishop of Gloucester  Rogers was a clergyman  who had shone amongst the most distinguished of the Protestants  He was prebendary of St  Paul s  and refused all submission to the church of Rome  which he looked upon as antichristian  They were condemned
