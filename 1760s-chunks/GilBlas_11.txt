does not accept it in the stoical way  His philosophy is the Christian belief in a Providence upon whom sane mortals may serenely rely  Providence  he knows  can be counted upon to hold the balance true on that Day of Judgment  when all human things will be set right  and when there will be a startling reversal of human verdicts  Convinced  like Bishop Butler  that things will be as they will be  his experience of life has taught him that the best philosophy is to bide one s me  all one s antennae out For Lesage the logical result of having been frequently a fool is to cease being dupe   It would be possible and amusing to draw a parallel in this connection between the philosophy of Lesage and that of an even more successful French playwright of the present day  M  Alfred Capus    who has not yet  however  written a Gil Blas    and to contrast the manner of the two with that of Beyle in his characterisation of Julien Sorel  Gil Blas is too often  if you like  a genial rascal  as are so many of M  Capus s heroes  but he is never an odiously cynical one like his servant Scipion  and like Julien  While Lesage could say with Philinte  discreetly blaming the vices of mankind    Je prends tout doucement les hommes comme ils sont  J accoutume mon âme à soufirir ce qu ils font       Oui  je vois ces défauts dont votre âme murmure Comme vices unis à l humaine nature  Et mon esprit enfin n est pas plus offensé De voir un homme fourbe  injuste  intéressé  Que de voir des vautours affamés de carnage  Des singes malfaisants et des loups pleins de rage    Beyle did not confine himself to  accustoming his soul to suffer  the enormities that men commit  but positively created in Julien Sorel an unscrupulous professor of energy whom he would appear to have regarded as an excellent model  Lesage  on the other hand  must be looked upon as a moralist  a moralist indulgent  no doubt    such indulgence was the finest flower of his inexhaustible knowledge of life   yet a moralist in the same sense in which Shakespeare and Molière are moralists  Moreover  Lesage has no cynical Blas forcing him to confine the subject matter of his novel to such naturalistic notations as were the stock in trade of the Goncourts and  to a large extent  of Zola   He had notably no such bias  either  cynical  or  moral   as has wittingly altered the reports of so many British observers of life  who have regarded the pursuit of literature as a mission  to be accepted with a high and strenuous purpose  for the improvement of their fellows  Thus  even a Thackeray wrote first and foremost for edification  In a recently published letter to his friend Robert Hall  Thackeray refers as follows to Vanity Fair    I want to leave everybody dissatisfied and unhappy at the end of the story    we ought all to be with our own and all other stories  Good God  don t I see  in that maybe cracked and warped looking glass in which I am always looking  my own weaknesses  wickednesses  lusts  follies  shortcomings  in company  let us hope  with better qualities about which we will pretermit discourse  We must lift up our voices about these and howl to a congregation of fools  so much  at least  has been my endeavour    The Times  July 17  1911    The idea of  howling to a congregation of fools  would have struck Lesage as a counsel of impertinent illbreeding  or  at all events  as a grotesque attitude for a self respecting novelist  Of course  Thackeray was in the tradition of a literature which counts among its chief masterpieces the Pilgrim s Progress  but if the Puritan point of view is good sociology and good Tolstoism  it is not necessarily for that reason good art  and it would even seem to make  good art  a more difficult achievement  In the great book just mentioned there is no laugh of Tom Jones to clear the air  Thackeray would have seemed  indeed  in Vanity Fair to have been more of an artist than his pamphleteering preoccupations appeared likely to allow him to become  He himself states his object in that book to have been to indicate in cheerful terms that we are for the most part an abominably foolish and selfish people  Incorrigible misanthropist  he sets out to draw up a savage indictment of the society of his time  He is cheerful  as cheerful as he knows how to be  but  as he has resolved to give no one in his book a chance  his cheerfulness fails to produce all its intended effect  Finally  one and all  even Amelia  are branded because foredoomed  But what is the result  Gibbeted for an example  they inspire more pity than horror  and not only does all our sympathy go out to them against the despotic heartlessness of the author  who so unfairly nailed them to the cross  but we fail even to draw the whole of the useful general moral which Thackeray holds to be essential
