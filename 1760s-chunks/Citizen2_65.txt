serpent  to supply them with luxuries they could have lived without  Though they could grant the Portuguese   202 more riches  they could never allow them to have such a king as their Tottimondelem  who wore a bracelet of shells round his neck  and whose legs were covered with ivory   In this manner  examine a savage in the history of his country and predecessors  you ever find his warriors able to conquer armies  and his sages acquainted with more than possible knowledge  human nature is to him an unknown country  he thinks it capable of great things  because he is ignorant of its boundaries  whatever can be conceived to be done he allows to be possible  and whatever is possible he conjectures must have been done  He never measures the actions and powers of others by what himself is able to perform  nor makes a proper estimate of the greatness of his fellows by bringing it to the standard of his own incapacity  He is satisfied to be one of a country where mighty things have been  and imagines the fancied power of others reflects a lustre on himself  Thus  by degrees  he loses the idea of his own insignificance in a confused notion of the extraordinary powers of humanity  and is willing to grant extraordinary gifts to every pretender  because unacquainted with their claims   This is the reason  why Demi gods and Heroes have ever been erected in times or countries of ignorance and barbarity  they addressed a people who had high opinions of human nature  because they were ignorant how far it could extend  they addressed a people who were willing to allow that men should be gods  because they were yet imperfectly acquainted with God  and with man  These impostors knew  that all men are naturally   203 fond of seeing something very great made from the little materials of humanity  that ignorant nations are not more proud of building a tower to reach heaven  or a pyramid to last for ages  than of raising up a Demi god of their own country and creation  The same pride  that erects a colossus or a pyramid  installs a God or an Hero  but though the adoring savage can raise his colossus to the clouds  he can exalt the Hero not one inch above the standard of humanity  incapable therefore of exalting the idol  he debases himself and falls prostrate before him   When man has thus acquired an erroneous idea of the dignity of his species  he and the Gods become perfectly intimate  men are but angels  angels are but men  nay but servants that stand in waiting to execute human commands  The Persians  for instance  thus address their prophet Haly    I salute thee  glorious Creator  of whom the sun is but the shadow  Masterpiece of the Lord of human creatures  great star of justice and religion  The sea is not rich and liberal but by the gifts of thy munificent hands  The angel treasurer of heaven reaps his harvest in the fertile gardens of the purity of thy nature  The primum mobile would never dart the ball of the sun through the trunk of heaven  were it not to serve the morning out of the extreme love she has for thee  The angel Gabriel  messenger of truth  every day kisses the groundsil of thy gate  Were there a place more exalted than the most high throne of God  I would affirm it to be thy place  O master of the faithful  Gabriel with all his art and knowledge is but a meer scholar to thee   Thus  my   204 friend  men think proper to treat angels  but if indeed there be such an order of beings  with what a degree of satirical contempt must they listen to the songs of little mortals thus flattering each other  Thus to see creatures  wiser indeed than the monkey  and more active than the oyster  claiming to themselves the mastery of heaven  minims  the tenants of an atom  thus arrogating a a partnership in the creation of universal nature  Sure heaven is kind that launches no thunder at those guilty heads  but it is kind  and regards their follies with pity  nor will destroy creatures that it loved into being   But whatever success this practice of making Demi gods might have been attended with in barbarous nations  I don t know that any man became a God in a country  where the inhabitants were refined  Such countries generally have too close an inspection into human weakness  to think it invested with celestial power  They sometimes indeed admit the Gods of strangers  or of their ancestors  which had their existence in times of obscurity  their weakness being forgotten  while nothing but their power and their miracles were remembred  The Chinese  for instance  never had a God of their own country  the idols which the vulgar worship at this day were brought from the barbarous nations around them  The Roman Emperors  who pretended to divinity  were generally ta•ght by a poignard that they were mortal  and Alexander  though he passed among barbarous countries for a real God  could never persuade his polite countrymen into a similitude of thinking  The Lacedemonians shrewdly complied with his commands by the following sarcastic edict   〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉   Adieu
