 in the true taste of old English hospitality  to pull them in   Chocolate was instantly brought for their master  and a dish for each of us  We had made but a poor   264 breakfast  any of us  I could get nothing down before  My aunt put a second dish into my hand  I took her kind meaning  and presented it to Sir Charles  How gratefully did he receive it  Wiil it always be so  Lady G   My love  heightened by my duty  shall not  when the obligation is doubled  make me less deserving of his politeness  if I can help it   But still this dreadful note  and Greville s reported moodiness  made us uneasy  The servant we sent returned  with information that Mr  Greville came home late last night  He was not stirring  it seems  tho  Eleven o Clock  when the servant reached his house  He is said to be not well  and  as one servant of his told ours  so very fretful  and ill tempered  that they none of them know how to speak to him  God grant—But let me keep to myself such of my apprehensions as are founded on conjecture—Why should I not hope the best  Is not your beloved brother at present safe  And is he not the care of Providence —I humbly trust he is   Sir Charles took the note  I think I have seen the hand  said he  If I have  I shall find out the writer  I dare say  it is written with a good intention   My uncle and we all expressed  some in words  some by looks  our apprehensions   There cannot possibly be room for any  said Sir Charles  always present to himself  Mr  Greville loves Miss Byron  It is no wonder  as his apprehensions of losing all hopes of her for ever  grow stronger  that he should be uneasy  He would make but an ill compliment to her merit  and his own sincerity  if he were not  But such a stake as he has in his country  he cannot have desperate intentions  I remember  to his advantage  his last behavour here  I will make him a visit  I must engage Mr  Greville to rank me in the number of his friends   What he said gave us comfort  No wonder if we women love courage in a man  We ought  if it be true   265 courage  like that of your excellent brother  After all  my dear  I think we must allow a natural superiority in the minds of men over women  Do we not want protection  And does not that want imply inferiority —Yet if there be two sorts of courage  an acquired and a natural  why may not the former be obtained by women  as well as by men  were they to have the same education  NATURAL courage  may belong to either  Had Miss Barnevelt  for example  had a boy s education  she would have probably challenged her man  on provocation given  and he might have come off but poorly   But we have more silly antipathies than men  which help to keep us down  Whether those may not sometimes be owing to affectation  do you  Lady G  who  however  have as little affectation as ever woman had  determine  A frog  a toad  a spider  a beetle  an earwig  will give us mighty pretty tender terror  while the heroic men will trample the insect under foot  and look the more brave for their barbarity  and for our delicate screaming  But for an adventure  if a Lover get us into one  we frequently leave him a great way behind us  Don t you think so  Lady G  —Were not this Greville still in my head  methinks I could be as pert as ever   Sir Charles told us  that he should have been with us last night  but for a visit he was obliged to pay to Sir Harry Beauchamp  to make up for which hindrance  he took horse  and ordered his equi to follow him   He is gone to pay his duty  as he is pleased to call it  to my grandmamma  in my uncle s coach  my uncle with him  If they cannot prevail on my grandmamma to come hither to dinner  and if she is desirous Sir Charles should dine with her  he will oblige her—by my aunt s leave  was his address to her  But perhaps she will have the goodness to add her company to his  as she knows that will give us all double pleasure    266 She loves to give pleasure  Often does the dear Lady say     How can palsied age  which is but a terrifying object to youth  expect the indulgence  the love  of the young and gay  if it does not study to promote those pleasures which itself was fond of in youth  Enjoy innocently your season  girls  once said she  setting half a score of us into country dances  I watch for the failure of my memory  and shall never give it over for quite lost  till I forget what
