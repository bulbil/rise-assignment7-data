  occasioned so general a grief among them for the loss of so good a   mistress  that had Mademoiselle de Roquelair remained in the house  and   the same servants also been continued  it is possible she would have   had little either of respect or obedience from them       But fortune spared this mortification  in order to inflict a much   greater one on her ingratitude and treachery  Mr  Munden had not quitted   the presence of his wife many minutes before he began to reflect   seriously on this accident  he found it might prove a very vexatious   one  if the consequences it seemed to threaten were not in time   prevented  he highly blamed Mademoiselle de Roquelair for her behaviour   to Mrs  Munden  not so much because it might give that lady room to   suspect in what manner he had wronged her  as because it plainly shewed   that the other intended to pin herself on him  and oblige him to support   her  a thing which did not at all suit with his humour  he had gratified   his passion almost to a surfeit  a very little longer time would have   made him as heartily wish to get rid of her  as he had ever done to gain   her  and although it could not be said he was as yet altogether cloyed   with the pleasures she so lavishly bestowed  yet a little examination   into the extent of his inclinations  convinced him that he could bear   the loss of her for ever without pain       While the blood runs high  and the fire is rampant for possession    prudence is of little force  but when the one begins to flag  the other   resumes its empire over the mind  and never rests till it finds means to   retrieve what it has lost  he could now consider that the money remitted   to Bologne by Mr  Thoughtless could be received by nobody but   Mademoiselle de Roquelair herself  and that it was probable that   gentleman  if told the usage that had been given to his sister  might be   provoked to recal his order  and prevent the payment of it at all  This   seemed  however  a plausible pretence for persuading her to go away   directly  and also for making a merit to his wife of what he did       Having fully determined within himself how to proceed in this affair  he   shortened his morning s walk  and came home some hours before the usual   time  he was at first a little fretted on being told Mrs  Munden was   gone to her brother s  not doubting but the errand on which she went was   to complain of the treatment she had received  but Jenny carefully   concealing what her mistress had said to her concerning her intentions   of coming back no more  he passed it lightly over  imagining her   accusations and reproaches would cease  the object of them being once   removed       He found no difficulty in prevailing on Mademoiselle de Roquelair to go   to Bologne  Three hundred louis d ors was too tempting a sum to be   forfeited merely for the want of a little jaunt  especially as she   considered that she might accomplish her business there and return to   London within the compass of a very few days  and he told her that he   would hire lodgings for her against her coming back        Well  then  my angel   said he   no time is to be lost  as this is not   post day  if you set out immediately for Dover  you may be at Bologne    and have received the money before any letter can reach that place to   prevent it  for it is very likely that the spite my wife has towards   you  may work upon the resentment of her brother to attempt such a   thing   Everything being concluded upon for this expedition  he went   himself to procure a post chaise  appointing her to meet him at a place   he mentioned to her in an hour at farthest       As he had promised to send all her baggage to the lodgings which he   should provide for her return  she had nothing to do but to pack up some   few necessaries to take with her  This little work being soon over  a   hackney coach carried her to the house that had been agreed upon  where   she saw a post chaise already at the door  and the diligent Mr  Munden   waiting for her coming  as she proposed to reach Canterbury that same   night  and it was then past two o clock  the lovers were obliged to take   a very hasty leave       This double  deceitful man  having a farther view in what he did than   she had any notion of  told her
