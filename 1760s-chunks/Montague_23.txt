part of their land uncultivated  only sowing as much corn of different sorts as will serve themselves  and being too proud and too idle to work for hire  every family gets in its own harvest  which prevents all that jovial spirit which we find when the reapers work together in large parties       Idleness is the reigning passion here  from the peasant to his lord  the gentlemen never either ride on horseback or walk  but are driven about like women  for they never drive themselves  lolling at their ease in a calache  the peasants  I mean the masters of families  are pretty near as useless as their lords       You will scarce believe me  when I tell you  that I have seen  at the farm next us  two children  a very beautiful boy and girl  of about eleven years old  assisted by their grandmother  reaping a field of oats  whilst the lazy father  a strong fellow of thirty two  lay on the grass  smoaking his pipe  about twenty yards from them  the old people and children work here  those in the age of strength and health only take their pleasure       A propos to smoaking   tis common to see here boys of three years old  sitting at their doors  smoaking their pipes  as grave and composed as little old Chinese men on a chimney       You ask me after our fruits  we have  as I am told  an immensity of cranberries all the year  when the snow melts away in spring  they are said to be found under it as fresh and as good as in autumn  strawberries and rasberries grow wild in profusion  you cannot walk a step in the fields without treading on the former  great plenty of currants  plumbs  apples  and pears  a few cherries and grapes  but not in much perfection  excellent musk melons  and water melons in abundance  but not so good in proportion as the musk  Not a peach  nor any thing of the kind  this I am however convinced is less the fault of the climate than of the people  who are too indolent to take pains for any thing more than is absolutely necessary to their existence  They might have any fruit here but gooseberries  for which the summer is too hot  there are bushes in the woods  and some have been brought from England  but the fruit falls off before it is ripe  The wild fruits here  especially those of the bramble kind  are in much greater variety and perfection than in England       When I speak of the natural productions of the country  I should not forget that hemp and hops grow every where in the woods  I should imagine the former might be cultivated here with great success  if the people could be persuaded to cultivate any thing       A little corn of every kind  a little hay  a little tobacco  half a dozen apple trees  a few onions and cabbages  make the whole of a Canadian plantation  There is scarce a flower  except those in the woods  where there is a variety of the most beautiful shrubs I ever saw  the wild cherry  of which the woods are full  is equally charming in flower and in fruit  and  in my opinion  at least equals the arbutus       They sow their wheat in spring  never manure the ground  and plough it in the slightest manner  can it then be wondered at that it is inferior to ours  They fancy the frost would destroy it if sown in autumn  but this is all prejudice  as experience has shewn  I myself saw a field of wheat this year at the governor s farm  which was manured and sown in autumn  as fine as I ever saw in England       I should tell you  they are so indolent as never to manure their lands  or even their gardens  and that  till the English came  all the manure of Quebec was thrown into the river       You will judge how naturally rich the soil must be  to produce good crops without manure  and without ever lying fallow  and almost without ploughing  yet our political writers in England never speak of Canada without the epithet of barren  They tell me this extreme fertility is owing to the snow  which lies five or six months on the ground  Provisions are dear  which is owing to the prodigious number of horses kept here  every family having a carriage  even the poorest peasant  and every son of that peasant keeping a horse for his little excursions of pleasure  besides those necessary for the business of the farm  The war also destroyed the breed of cattle  which I am told however begins to encrease  they have even so far improved in corn  as to export some this year to Italy and Spain       Don t you think I am become an excellent farmeress   Tis intuition  some people are born learned  are you not all astonishment at my knowledge  I never was so vain of a letter in my life       Shall I own the truth  I had most of my intelligence from old John  who lived long with my grandfather in the
