 his has   taken a turn  which perhaps you may think the most remote from   his profession of a soldier  Pictures  painting  is the sole object of   his admiration  the only knowledge he values himself upon  Tell   him of a siege  or a battle  an attack or a retreat  conducted with   the greatest skiU  and he hears yon unmoved  nor will interrupt   your account with a single question   but name Eembrandt or   Tlitian  and he immediately gives you a dissertation on their   excellencies  and the difference of their schools   Tell him but of a   sale of pictures  on the day of a review  and  if he is forced to   feign sickness to excuse his attendance in the field  he will be   at it      Such absurd passions are always the objects of artifice and   imposition  An ingenious painter of this country  not very long   since  whose works would have been a credit to the best of foreign   schools  but were despised at home  bethought himself of a way to   turn this person s foible to some advantage  He made some   designs  landscapes  and other drawings  in the manner of some of   the greatest of the ancient Italian masters  whose names he marked   upon the backs of them  in the characters of their times  and giving   them the cast of age  made them up in an Italian chest  and by the   aasistance of a captain of a ship  had them entered at the custom    house  as directly from Italy  and consigned to a stranger  as from   a friend there  to be disposed of in London      The report soon reached this lover of virtu  who was so ravished   with the thought of gaining such a treasure  that he flew to the   place  and  being convinced by his judgment of the authenticity   of them  bought them all together  for a very large sum  but far   short of their real value  had they been to be disposed of by a person   acquainted with it      Though this success was very pleasing and useful to the painter    he did not stop here  This person had some way taken a dislike   to him  which he indulged by running down his work  This  there    fore  was an opportunity for revenge not to be missed  He let   Mm boast of his acquisiton in all companies  and display his judg    ment in proving them to be the genuine productions of those great   masters  by criticisms which none but a connoisseur could make     but then  as soon as the whole afiair was so public  that there wag   no denying it  what does the incensed artist but produce the counter    parts of them all  which he had kept for the occasion  so like as         46 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     not possibly to be known asunder  and unravelled the whole afiair    taking care only to keep himself clear of the law  by saying that   he had sold those things as of no value  at a very small price  to a   Jew       This was a severe stroke   It overturned the only reputation   which he had even an ambition of  and robbed him of a large sum   of money besides  to recover which loss  and divert the chagrin   of the whole deceit  he has recourse to play  which he follows with   the eagerness you see  But his is not the only absurd passion that   strikes the notice of an accurate observer of mankind  The person on   his right hand was bom in the first rank of the state  but by some   unlucky mistake  the quahfloations which fell to his share belonged to   one of the lowest classes of mechanics  While others of his rank are   marshalling armies  and planning conquest  correcting the abuses    or studying to rise upon the ruins of the state  his utmost ambition   is  to cut out a buckskin to advantage  and be reckoned the best   breeches maker of his time  Harmless as such an humble turn   may seem  it involves the noble artist ia many whimsical distresses      His passion for breeches making is so strong that he never sits   near any person but his hand is immediately and unpremeditatedly   applied to his thigh  which he has no sooner stroked down two or   three times  than he thinks he conceives the size and shape of it   so exactly  that he can completely fit it  without the trouble of   takir   ly other measure   and accordingly never fails to iatroduce   a die   ation on the art  which
