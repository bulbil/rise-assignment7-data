against the French manner of acting  on the strength of having  frequented a Covent Garden club of critics  and been often admitted  by  virtue of an order  into the pit  a comparison immediately ensued   not between the authors  but the actors of both nations  to whom  the chevalier and Peregrine were no strangers  Our hero  like a good  Englishman  made no scruple of giving the preference to the performers  of his own country  who  he alleged  obeyed the genuine impulses of  nature  in exhibiting the passions of the human mind  and entered so  warmly into the spirit of their several parts  that they often fancied  themselves the very heroes they represented  whereas  the action of  the Parisian players  even in their most interesting characters  was  generally such an extravagance in voice and gesture  as is nowhere to  be observed but on the stage  To illustrate this assertion  he availed  himself of his talent  and mimicked the manner and voice of all the  principal performers  male and female  belonging to the French comedy   to the admiration of the chevalier  who  having complimented him upon  this surprising modulation  begged leave to dissent in some particulars  from the opinion he had avowed    That you have good actors in England   said he   it would be unjust  and absurd in me to deny  your theatre is adorned by one woman  whose  sensibility and sweetness of voice is such as I have never observed on  any other stage  she has besides  an elegance of person and expression  of features  that wonderfully adapt her for the most engaging characters  of your best plays  and I must freely own that I have been as highly  delighted and as deeply affected by a Monimia and Belvidera at London   as ever I was by Cornelia and Cleopatra at Paris  Your favourite actor  is a surprising genius  You can  moreover  boast of several comic actors  who are perfect masters of buffoonery and grimace  though  to be free  with you  I think in these qualifications you are excelled by the  players of Amsterdam  Yet one of your graciosos I cannot admire  in all  the characters he assumes  His utterance is a continual sing song   like the chanting of vespers  and his action resembles that of heaving  ballast into the hold of a ship  In his outward deportment he seems to  have confounded the ideas of insolence and the dignity of mien  acts the  crafty cool  designing Crookback  as a loud  shallow  blustering Hector   in the character of the mild patriot Brutus  loses all temper and  decorum  nay  so ridiculous is the behaviour of him and Cassius at their  interview  that  setting foot to foot  and grinning at each other   with the aspect of two cobblers engaged  they thrust their left sides  together  with repeated shoots  that the hilts of their swords may clash  for the entertainment of the audience  as if they were a couple of merry  andrews  endeavouring to raise the laugh of the vulgar  on some scaffold  of Bartholomew Fair  The despair of a great man  who falls a victim to  the infernal practices of a subtle traitor who enjoyed his confidence   this English Aesopus represents  by beating his own forehead  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   beating like a bull  and  indeed  in almost all his most interesting  scenes  performs such strange shakings of the head  and other antic  gesticulations  that when I first saw him act  I imagined the poor man  laboured under the paralytical disorder  which is known by the name  of St  Vitus s dance  In short  he seems to be a stranger to the more  refined sensations of the soul  consequently his expression is of the  vulgar kind  and he must often sink under the idea of the poet  so that  he has recourse to such violence of affected agitation  as imposes upon  the undiscerning spectator  but to the eye of taste  evinces him a mere  player of that class whom your admired Shakespeare justly compares to  Nature s journeyman tearing a passion to rags  Yet this man  in spite of  all these absurdities  is an admirable Falstaff  exhibits the character  of the eighth Henry to the life  is reasonably applauded in the Plain  Dealer  excels in the part of Sir John Brute  and would be equal to many  humorous situations in low comedy  which his pride will not allow him to  undertake  I should not have been so severe upon this actor  had I not  seen him extolled by his partisans with the most ridiculous and fulsome  manifestations of praise  even in those very circumstances wherein  as I  have observed  he chiefly failed    Peregrine  not a little piqued to hear the qualifications of such a  celebrated actor in England treated with such freedom and disrespect   answered  with some asperity  that the chevalier was a true critic   more industrious in observing the blemishes than
