     But  my lady  the people want the good news          The people may hang themselves in despair   I care not  so I   get money          The government  though          What is the government to me   I will get all I can  and then leave   them to themselves to sink or swim as they will   it is all one to me          That is true   your grace says right  A people who do not   know  or  at least  will not follow their own interest  are not worth   any person s care longer than while he can make something of   them  But we must reserve that stroke for another time  This   news has got into the of ces  and nothing there is a secret  you   know  Besides  the panic was too violent to last   it begins to   wear oil already  In another day  they would recover their senses   â€¢of themselves  I think  therefore  with your grace s approbation    to buy in all I can to day  without you had rather lay out your   money in the supplies for the Protestants of Germany          With all my heart  if you can make as much of it that way as   in the funds   but not otherwise  I would not lose one BhiUing for   any people under heaven            Your grace has a just notion of the world  and of the value of   money that governs it  Indeed  I must say that the terms for these   supplies are very unreasonable  considering how such things have   been done for some time past  It is expected that people should   bring ia their money without any premium or other advantage   than what was publicly calculated for at the granting them  But   these economists will find themselves mistaken  The world is   wiser nowadays than to give up advantages which they have once   gotten possession of  As to that affair  therefore  I should think it   better to let it stand a little longer till the necessity becomes more   urgent  and then they will be glad to come into our terms  if it   were not that the poor people may be ruined in the meantime     so that indeed I am at a loss what to advise your grace to do in so   nice an affair          Why  let them be ruined  then   it is not my fault  nor is it my    business to save them  nor will I part with a stalling to do it  Be    sides  if they do suffer by the delay  those who gave them this supply   to prevent their ruin may give them another to repair it          I cannot but admire your grace s judgment in all things  You   are above the foolish weakness of nature  and have the noble resolu     tion to see your own family perish  rather than injure your own   interest to relieve them  I shall obey your grace in all things  I   go now to the alley  where business will soon begin            ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 159       Do  honest Aminadab  and fear not   though I could not pro    cure an establishment for your whole nation  as I would have done    I certainly will for your family  and that is enough for you  Your   son shall be made a baronet  at least   you have riches enough to   support the title          Your grace is very good  Our people are all satisfied of your   kind intentions   but  alas   that was a severe disappointment to   us  after costing us so much money  The children of the Lord weep   over it ia their synagogues  and the daughters of Sion lament it in   their songs   but my household shall rejoice in thy favour  and the   labours of my life prove my gratitude for it        Honest Aminadab was no sooner gone than there entered an   agent  seemingly of another nature  this dealing in honour  as the   other did in money   but the difference between them was only in   appearance  the end of both being ultimately the same        May it please your grace    said he  advancing with due reverence   and ceremony    I come to wait upon you about that place in the       that gentleman
