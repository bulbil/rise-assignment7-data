an allowance with them  as could have been expected from a   father  Indeed he doubtless had passed for being so in the opinion of   every body  had he arrived sooner in the kingdom  but the shortness of   the time not permitting any such suggestion  he was looked upon as a   prodigy of charity and goodness       Having in this handsome manner disposed of his new guests  he began to   examine all his servants  thinking it impossible they should be brought   there without the privity of some one of them  but all his endeavours   could get him no satisfaction in this point  He read the letter over and   over  yet still his curiosity was as far to seek as ever   The hand he   was entirely unacquainted with  but thought there was something in the   style that showed it wrote by no mean person  the hint contained in it    that there was some latent reason for addressing him in particular on   this account  was very puzzling to him  he could not conceive why he    any more than any other gentleman of the county  should have an interest   in the welfare of these children  he had no near relations  and those   distant ones who claimed an almost forgotten kindred were not in a   condition to abandon their progeny   The thing appeared strange to him    but all his endeavours to give him any farther light into it being   unsuccessful  he began to imagine the parents of the children had been   compelled by necessity to expose them  and had had only wrote in this   mysterious manner to engage a better reception  he also accounted in his   mind for their being left with him  as  he being a batchelor  and having   a large estate  it might naturally be supposed there would be fewer   impediments to their being taken care of  than either where a wife was   in the case  or a narrow fortune obliged the owner to preserve a greater   oeconomy in expences       Being at last convinced within himself that he had now explained this   seeming riddle  he took no farther trouble about whose  or what these   children were  but resolved to take care of them during their infancy    and afterwards to put them into such a way as he should find their   genius s rendered them most fit for  in order to provide for themselves       On his leaving the county  he ordered his housekeeper to furnish every   thing needful for them as often as they wanted it  and to take care they   were well used by the women with whom he had placed them  and delivered   these commands not in a cursory or negligent manner  but in such terms   as terrified any failure of obedience in this point would highly incur   his displeasure       Nothing material happening during their infancy  I shall pass over those   years in silence  only saying that as often as Dorilaus went down to his   estate  which was generally two or three times a year  he always sent   for them  and expressed a very great satisfaction in finding in their   looks the charge he had given concerning them so well executed  but when   they arrived at an age capable of entertaining him with their innocent   prattle  what before was charity  improved into affection  and he began   to regard them with a tenderness little inferior to paternal  but which   still increased with their increase of years       Having given them the first rudiments of education in the best schools   those parts afforded  he placed Louisa with a gentlewoman  who   deservedly had the reputation of being an excellent governess of youth    and brought Horatio in his own chariot up to London  where he put him to   Westminster School  under the care of doctor Busby  and agreed for his   board in a family that lived near it  and had several other young   gentlemen on the same terms       What more could have been expected from the best of fathers  what more   could children  born to the highest fortunes  have enjoyed  nor was   their happiness like to be fleeting  Dorilaus was a man steady in his   resolutions  had always declared an aversion to marriage  and by   rejecting every overture made him on that score  had made his friends   cease any farther importunities  he had besides  as has already been   observed  no near relations  so that it was the opinion of most people   that he would make the young Horatio heir to the greatest part of his   estate  and give Louisa a portion answerable to her way of bringing up    What he intended for them  however  is uncertain  he never having   declared his sentiments so far concerning them  and the strange
