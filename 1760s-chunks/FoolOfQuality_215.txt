all must be fools or mad that ever shall take you for   the one or the other      The elder gentry here laid their cards aside  and desired the   young ones to set about some play  Lady Louisa proposed draw    gloves  or questions and commands  and to it they went      Among the females was one Miss Uppish  sole heiress to a vast   fortune  Though her person was deformed  her face was the picture   of confident disdain   and scarce any one could speak to her  or   look at her  without being told of the contempt she had for them    by the side glance of her eye  the writhing of her neck  and tossing   up of her head      In the course of the play  our Harry was commanded to put the   candle into the hand of Miss Uppish  and then to kiss the candle    stick   which command he obeyed literally  by giving her the   candle  and kissing the candlestick which he held in his own hand      Hereupon  a great shout was set up in the young assembly  and   the fool  the senseless creature   the fool  the fool  the fool   was   repeated throughout   while Lord Bottom laughed  and danced about   in the impatience of his joy      I was amazed that Harry s countenance seemed no way discon    certed by all this ridicule  At length Lady Mansfield called him to   her  How  my dear  could you be guilty of such an error   she said     did not you know that  when you gave the candle into the hand of   the young lady  she became the candlestick  and it was her you   should have kissed   Harry then approached to her ladyship s ear    and in a pretty loud whisper said I did not like the metal  madam    that the candlestick was made of  Again Lady Mansfield looked   surprised  and said You are a sly rogue  a very sly rogue  upon   my honour   and have sense enough to dupe the wisest of us all      Jemmy Bottom  cried my lady aloud  come here   I can t but   tell you  Jemmy  that you have behaved yourself extremely ill to   your young friend here  who might have improved you by his   example  as much as he has honoured you by his visit  I must   further tell you  Jemmy Bottom  that whenever you pique yourself   on degrading Mr  Fenton  you only pride in your own abasement    and glory in your shame  Hereupon I got up  and  leaving our   compliments for the earl  I carried off my young charge  for fear   of our falling into any further disgrace      While Harry is abroad  said Mr  Fenton  be pleased to give me a   general sketch of the manner in which you disposed of your money    In the first place  sir  answered Clement  you will find by this   list  that  for little more than the five hundred pounds allotted    we released ninety five prisoners  whose debts amounted from forty   shillings to about twelve pounds per man  These  in the general    had been journeymen tailors or weavers  or professors of other   inferior crafts   and  as they wanted means or encouragement for         222 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      exercising their respective occupations in jail  they subsisted on   the pence which they got by begging at the grates  or on their   dividends of occasional sums which were sent for their relief by   charitable individuals  Nearly all of them were thin in flesh  and   extremely shabby in clothing   and yet they could hardly be said   to excite compassion  as they appeared so cheerful and unfeeling   of their own wretchedness  Neither was there one of them  that   I could learn a single circumstance of  whose story was worth   reciting      Some  however  were of a quality much superior to this class    Among others  there was a French marquis and a German prince     the prince had been put under arrest by his caterer  and the mar    quis by his tailor   so that something less than fifty pounds set   them both at liberty      While the keeper of the Fleet Prison was making out a list   for us of the principal debtors  Harry and I took a turn about the   court  and observed two fellows in liveries bearing several smoking   covers up the stone stairs to a front dining room  This surprised   me  and gave me the curiosity to inquire what prisoners
