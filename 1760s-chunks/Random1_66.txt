of an advertising doctor  who having sleeced her of all the money she had  or could procure  left her three days ago in a worse condition than that in which he found her —that except the   184 cloaths on her back  she had pawned or sold every thing that belonged to her  to satisfy that rapacious quack  and quiet the clamour of her landlady  who still persisted in her threats to turn her out into the street —After having moralized upon these particulars  I proposed that she should lodge in the same room with me  which would save some money  and assured her I would myself undertake her cure as well as my own  during which she should partake of all the conveniencies I could afford to myself —She embraced my offer with unfeigned acknowledgment  and I began to put it in practice immediately —I found to my great satisfaction  in her  not only an agreeable companion  whose conversation greatly alleviated my chagrin  but also a careful nurse  who served me with the utmost fidelity and affection  One day  while I testified my surprise that a woman of her beauty  good sense  and education  for she had a large portion of each  could be reduced to such an infamous and miserable way of life as that of a prostitute  she answered with a sigh    These very advantages were the cause of my undoing  —  This remarkable reply inflamed my curiosity to such a degree  that I begged she would favour me with the particulars of her story  and she complied in these words       185  CHAP  XXII   The history of Miss WILLIAMS   MY father was an eminent merchant in the city  who having  in the course of trade  suffered very considerable losses  retired in his old age with his wife to a small estate in the country  which he had purchased with the remains of his fortune —At that time I being but eight years of age  was left in town for the convenience of education  boarded with an aunt  who was a rigid Presbyterian  and who confined me so closely to what she called the duties of religion  that in time I grew weary of her doctrines  and by degrees conceived an aversion for the good books she daily recommended to my perusal  As I increased in age  and appeared with a person not disagreeable  I contracted a good deal of acquaintance among my own sex  one of whom  after having lamented the restraint I was under from the narrowness of my aunt s sentiments  told me  I must now throw off the prejudices of opinion imbibed under her influence and example  and learn to think for myself —for which purpose she advised me to read Locke  Shaftsbury  Tindal  Hobbs  and all the books that are remarkable for their deviation from the old way of thinking  and by comparing one with another  I would soon be able to form a system of my own —I followed her advice  and whether it was owing to my prepossession against what I had formerly   186 read  or the clearness of argument in these my new instructors  I know not  but I studied them with pleasure  and in a short time became a professed Free thinker  Proud of my new improvement  I argued in all companies  and that with such success  that I soon acquired the reputation of a philosopher  and few people durst undertake me in a dispute —I grew vain upon my good fortune  and at length pretended to make my aunt a proselyte to my opinion  but she no sooner perceived my drift  than taking the alarm  she wrote to my father an account of my heresy  and conjured him  as he tendered the good of my soul  to remove me immediately from the dangerous place where I had contracted such sinful principles  Accordingly  my father ordered me into the country  where I arrived in the fifteenth year of my age  and by his command  gave him a detail of all the articles of my faith  which he did not find so unreasonable as they had been represented —Finding myself suddenly deprived of the company and pleasures of the town  I grew melancholy  and it was some time before I could relish my situation —But solitude became every day more and more familiar to me  and I consoled myself in my retreat with the enjoyment of a good library  at such times as were not employed in the management of the family   for my mother had been dead three years  in visiting  or some other party of rural diversion —Having more imagination than judgment  I addicted myself too much to poetry and romance  and in short was looked upon as a very extraordinary person by every body in the country where I resided —I had one evening strayed with a book in my hand  into a wood that bordered on   187 the high road  at a little distance from my father s house  when a certain drunken  squire  riding by  perceived me  and crying     Z—ds  there s a charming creature    alighted in a moment  catched me in his arms  and treated me so rudely  that I shrieked as loud as I could  and in the mean time opposed his
