with great contrition protesting that the blow he  had so unfortunately received  was intended for an ugly cur  which he  thought had posted himself under the table  It was lucky for him that  there was actually a dog in the room  to justify this excuse  which  Jolter admitted with the tears running over his cheeks  and the economy  of the table was recomposed   As soon  however  as the strangers could with decency withdraw  this  suspicious husband took his leave of the youth  on pretence of being  fatigued with his journey  after having  by way of compliment  proposed  that they should travel together next day  and Peregrine handed the  lady to her chamber  where he wished her good night with another warm  squeeze  which she returned  This favourable hint made his heart bound  with a transport of joy  he lay in wait for an opportunity of declaring  himself  and seeing the husband go down into the yard with a candle   glided softly into his apartment  where he found her almost undressed     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Impelled by the impetuosity of his passion  which was still more  inflamed by her present luscious appearance  and encouraged by  the approbation she had already expressed  he ran towards her with  eagerness  crying   Zounds  madam  your charms are irresistible   and  without further ceremony would have clasped her in his arms  had she not  begged him for the love of God to retire  for should Mr  Hornbeck return  and find him there  she would be undone for ever  He was not so blinded  by his passion  but that he saw the reasonableness of her fear  and as  he could not pretend to crown his wishes at that interview  he avowed  himself her lover  assured her that he would exhaust his whole invention  in finding a proper opportunity for throwing himself at her feet  and in  the mean time he ravished sundry small favours  which she in the hurry  of her fright  could not withhold from his impudence of address  Having  thus settled the preliminaries  he withdrew to his own chamber  and  spent the whole night in contriving stratagems to elude the jealous  caution of his fellow traveller   CHAPTER XXXVIII   They set out in company  breakfast at Abbeville  dine at Amiens and   about eleven o clock  arrive at Chantilly where Peregrine executes a  Plan which he had concerted upon Hornbeck   The whole company by agreement rose and departed before day  and  breakfasted at Abbeville  where they became acquainted with the finesse  of their Bernay landlord  who had imposed upon them  in affirming that  they would not have been admitted after the gates were shut  From thence  they proceeded to Amiens  where they dined  and were pestered by begging  friars  and the roads being deep  it was eleven o clock at night before  they reached Chantilly  where they found supper already dressed  in  consequence of having despatched the valet de chambre before them on  horseback   The constitution of Hornbeck being very much impaired by a life of  irregularity  he found himself so fatigued with his day s journey  which  amounted to upwards of a hundred miles  that when he sat down at table   he could scarce sit upright  and in less than three minutes began to  nod in his chair  Peregrine  who had foreseen and provided for this  occasion  advised him to exhilarate his spirits with a glass of wine   and the proposal being embraced  tipped his valet de chambre the wink   who  according to the instructions he had received  qualified the  Burgundy with thirty drops of laudanum  which this unfortunate  husband swallowed in one glass  The dose  cooperating with his former  drowsiness  lulled him so fast to sleep  as it were instantaneously   that it was found necessary to convey him to his own chamber  where his  footman undressed and put him to bed  nor was Jolter  naturally of a  sluggish disposition  able to resist his propensity to sleep  without  suffering divers dreadful yawns  which encouraged his pupil to  administer the same dose to him  which had operated so successfully upon  the other Argus  This cordial had not such gentle effect upon the rugged  organs of Jolter as upon the more delicate nerves of Hornbeck  but  discovered itself in certain involuntary startings  and convulsive    6 22 15  3 45 PM   motions in the muscles of his face  and when his nature at length  yielded to the power of this medicine  he sounded the trumpet so loud  through his nostrils  that our adventurer was afraid the noise would  wake his other patient  and consequently the accomplishment of his aim   The governor was therefore committed to the care of Pipes  who lugged  him into the next room  and having stripped off his clothes  tumbled him  into his nest  while the two lovers remained at full liberty to indulge  their mutual passion   Peregrine  in the impatience of his inclination  would have
