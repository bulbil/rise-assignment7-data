smock  —  Here  as the devil would have it  the pedlar snored so loud  that the highwayman snatching his pistols  started up  crying    Hell and d—n—n  I am betrayed —who s that in the next room    Mrs  Betty told him  he need not be uneasy  there were only three poor wearied travellers  who  mistaking the road  had taken up their lodging there  and were asleep long ago —   Travellers  says he  spies  you b—ch  but no matter—by G—d  I ll send them all to hell in an instant  —  He accordingly run towards our door  when his sweetheart   54 interposing  assured him  there was only a couple of poor young Scotchmen  who were too raw and ignorant to give him the least cause of suspicion  and the third was a Presbyterian pedlar of the same nation  who had often lodged in the house before —This declaration satisfied the thief  who swore he was glad there was a pedlar there  for he wanted some linen —Then in a jovial manner  he put about the glass  mingling his discourse to Betty  with caresses and familiarities  that spoke him very happy in his amours  During that part of the conversation which regarded us  Strap had crept under the bed  where he lay without sense or motion  so that it was with great difficulty I persuaded him our danger was over  and prevailed on him to wake the pedlar  and inform him of what we had seen and heard—This itinerant merchant no sooner felt somebody shaking him by the shoulder  than he started up  calling as loud as he could —   Thieves  thieves —L—d have mercy on us    Rifle  alarmed at this exclamation  jumped up  cocked one of his pistols  and turned towards the door to kill the first man who should enter  for he verily believed himself beset  when his Dulcinea  after an immoderate fit of laughter  persuaded him  that the poor pedlar dreaming of thieves  had only cried out in his sleep —Meanwhile my comrade had undeceived our fellowlodger  and informed him of his reason for disturbing him  upon which  getting up softly he peeped through the hole  and was so terrified with what he saw  that  falling down on his bare knees  he put up a long petition to heaven  to deliver him from the hands of that ruffian  and promised never to defraud a customer for the future   55 of the value of a half penny  provided he might be rescued from his present distress—Whether or not this disburthening his conscience afforded him any ease  I know not  but he slipt into bed again and lay very quiet until the robber and his mistress were asleep  which he understood by their snoring in concert  then  rising softly  he untied a rope that was round his pack  and making it fast to one end of it  opened the window with as little noise as possible  and lowered his goods into the yard with great dexterity  which having done  he moved gently to our bedside  and bid us farewel  telling us  that as we run no risk  we might take our rest with great confidence  and in the morning assure the landlord that we knew nothing of his escape  then shaking us by the hands  and wishing us all manner of success  he let himself drop from the window without any danger to the ground  which was not above one yard from his feet as he hung on the outside  Although I did not think proper to accompany him in his flight  I was not at all free from apprehension  when I reflected on what might be the effects of the highwayman s disappointment  who certainly intended to make free with the pedlar s ware  Neither was my companion at more ease in his mind  but on the contrary so possessed with the dreadful idea of Rifle  that he solicited me strongly to follow our countryman s example  and so elude the fatal resentment of that terrible adventurer  who would certainly wreak his vengeance on us  as accomplices of the pedlar s elopement —But I represented to him  the danger of giving Rifle cause to think we knew his profession  by putting him in mind  that if ever he should meet us again on the road  which   56 far from being impossible  he would look upon us as dangerous acquaintance  and find it his interest to put us out of the way —I told him withal  the confidence I had in Betty s good nature  in which he acquiesced  and during the remaining part of the night  we concerted a proper method of behaviour  to render us unsuspected in the morning     It was no sooner day  than Betty  entering our chamber  and perceiving the window open  cried out     Ods bobs  Sure you Scotchmen must have hot constitutions  to lie all night with the window open in such cold weather  —  I feigned to start out of sleep  and withdrawing the curtain  called    What s the matter    When she shewed me  I affected surprize  and said    Bless me  the window was shut when
