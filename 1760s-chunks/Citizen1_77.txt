—The very thing  replies he  it will eat best with some smart bottled beer  but be sure to let s have the sauce his Grace was so fond of  I hate your immense loads of meat  that is country all over  extreme disgusting to those who are in the least acquainted with high life     242By this time my curiosity began to abate  and my appetite to encrease  the company of fools may at first make us smile  but at last never fails of rendering us melancholy  I therefore pretended to recollect a prior engagement  and after having shewn my respect to the house  according to the fashion of the English  by giving the old servant a piece of money at the door  I took my leave  Mr  Tibbs assuring me  that dinner  if I staid  would be ready at least in less than two hours   LETTER LIV  From Fum Hoam to Altangi  the discontented wanderer   THE distant sounds of music that catch new sweetness as they vibrate through the long drawn valley  are not more pleasing to the ear than the tidings of a far distant friend   I have just received two hundred of thy letters by the Russian carravan  descriptive of the manners of Europe  You have left it to geographers to determine the site of their mountains  and extent of their lakes  seeming only employed in discovering the genius  the government  and disposition of the people   In those letters I perceive a journal of the operations of your mind upon whatever occurs  rather then a detail of your travels from one building to another  of your taking a draught of this ruin  or that obelisk  of paying so many   243 Tomans for this commodity  or laying up a proper store for the passage of some new wilderness   From your accounts of Russia I learn  that this nation is again relaxing into pristine barbarity  that its great Emperor wanted a life of an hundred years more to bring about his vast design  A savage people may be resembled to their own forests  a few years are sufficient to clear away the obstructions to agriculture  but it requires many ere the ground acquires a proper degree of fertility  the Russians  attached to their ancient prejudices  again renew their hatred to strangers  and indulge every former brutal excess  So true it is  that the revolutions of wisdom are slow and difficult  the revolutions of folly or ambition precipitate and easy  We are not to be astonished  says Confucius   that the wise walk more slowly in their road to virtue  than fools in their passage to vice  since passion drags us along  while wisdom only points out the way   The German Empire  that remnant of the Majesty of ancient Rome  appears from your accounts on the eve of dissolution  The members of its vast body want every tye of government to unite them  and seem feebly held together only by their respect for an ancient institution  The very name of country and countrymen  which in other nations makes one of the strongest bonds of government  has been here for some time laid aside  each of its inhabitants seeming more proud of being called from the petty state which gives him birth  than by the more well known title of German     244This government may be regarded in the light of a severe master  and a feeble opponent  The states which are now subject to the laws of the Empire  are only watching a proper occasion to fling off the yoke  and those which are become too powerful to be compelled to obedience  now begin to think of dictating in their turn  The struggles in this state are therefore not in order to preserve but to destroy the ancient constitution  if one side succeeds  the government must become despotic  if the other  several states will subsist without even nominal subordination  but in either case the Germanic constitution will be no more   Sweden  on the contrary  though now seemingly a strenuous assertor of its liberties  is probably only hastening on to despotism  Their senators  while they pretend to vindicate the freedom of the people  are only establishing their own independence  The deluded people will however at last perceive the miseries of an aristocratical government  they will perceive that the administration of a society of men is ever more painful than that of one only  They will fly from this most oppressive of all forms  where one single member is capable of controlling the whole  to take refuge under the throne which will ever be attentive to their complaints  No people long endure an aristocratical government  when they could apply elsewhere for redress  The lower orders of people may be enslaved for a time by a number of tyrants  but upon the first opportunity they will ever take a refuge in despotism or democracy     245As the Swedes are making concealed approaches to despotism  the French  on the other hand  are imperceptibly vindicating themselves into freedom  When I consider that those parliaments  the members of which are all created by the court  the presidents of which can act only by immediate direction  presume even to mention privileges and freedom  who  till of late  received directions from the throne with implicit humility  when this is considered
