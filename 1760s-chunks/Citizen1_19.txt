men with heads strangely deformed  and with dog s heads  but what would you say if you heard of men without any heads at all  Pomponius Mela  Solinus  and Aulus Gellius  describe them to our hand   The Blemiae have a nose  eyes  and mouth on their breasts  or  as others will have it  placed on their shoulders    One would think that these authors had an antipathy to the human form  and were resolved to make a new figure of their own  but let us do them justice  though they sometimes deprive us of a leg  an arm  an head  or some such trifling part of the body  they often as liberally bestow upon us something that we wanted before  Simon Mayole seems our particular friend in this respect  if he has denied heads to one part of mankind  he has given tails to another  He describes many of the English of his time  which is not more than an hundred years ago  as having tails  His own words are as follow  In England there are some families which have tails  as a punishment for deriding an Augustin Friar sent by St  Gregory  and who preached in Dorsetshire  They sewed the tails of different animals to his cloaths  but soon they found those tails entailed on them and their posterity for ever  It is certain  the author had some ground for this description  many of the English wear tails to their   58 wigs to this very day  as a mark  I suppose  of the antiquity of their families  and perhaps as a symbol of those tails with which they were formerly distinguished by nature   You see  my friend  there is nothing so ridiculous that has not at some time been said by some philosopher  The writers of books in Europe seem to think themselves authorised to say what they please  and an ingenious philosopher among them   has openly asserted  that he would undertake to persuade the whole republic of readers to believe that the sun was neither the cause of light nor heat  if he could only get six philosophers on his side  Farewell   LETTER XVII  From the same   WERE an Asiatic politician to read the treaties of peace and friendship that have been annually making for more than an hundred years among the inhabitants of Europe  he would probably be surpriz d how it should ever happen that christian princes could quarrel among each other  Their compacts for peace are drawn up with the utmost precision  and ratified with the greatest solemnity  to these each party promises a sincere and inviolable obedience  and all wears the appearance of open friendship and unreserved reconciliation   Yet  notwithstanding those treaties  the people of Europe are almost continually at war  There   59 is nothing more easy than to break a treaty ratified in all the usual forms  and yet neither party be the aggressor  One side  for instance  breaks a trifling article by mistake  the opposite party upon this makes a small but premeditated reprisal  this brings on a return of greater from the other  both sides complain of injuries and infractions  war is declar d  they beat  are beaten  some two or three hundred thousand men are killed  they grow tired  leave off just where they began  and so sit cooly down to make new treaties   The English and French seem to place themselves foremost among the champion states of Europe  Though parted by a narrow sea  yet are they entirely of opposite characters  and from their vicinity are taught to fear and admire each other  They are at present engaged in a very destructive war  have already spilled much blood  are excessively irritated  and all upon account of one side s desiring to wear greater quantities of furs than the other   The pretext of the war is about some lands a thousand leagues off  a country cold  desolate  and hideous  a country belonging to a people who were in possession for time immemorial  The savages of Canada claim a property in the country in dispute  they have all the pretensions which long possession can confer  Here they had reigned for ages without rivals in dominion  and knew no enemies but the prowling bear or insidious tyger  their native forests produced all the necessaries of life  and they found ample luxury in the enjoyment  In this manner they might have continued to live to eternity  had not the English been informed   60 that those countries produced furs in great abundance  From that moment the country became an object of desire  it was found that furs were things very much wanted in England  the ladies edged some of their cloaths with furs  and muffs were worn both by gentlemen and ladies  In short  furs were found indispensably necessary for the happiness of the state  and the king was consequently petitioned to grant not only the country of Canada  but all the savages belonging to it to the subjects of England  in order to have the people supplied with proper quantities of this necessary commodity   So very reasonable a request was immediately complied with  and large colonies were sent abroad to procure furs  and take possession  The French who were equally in want of furs  for they were as fond of
