   Z—ds  who have we got here  —  The bailif  alarmed at this interrogation    203 cried with some emotion    Who the devil should it be  but the prisoner Elizabeth Cary    The turnkey replied    That Elizabeth Cary —I ll be damned if that s Elizabeth Cary  more than my grandmother —D—n my blood  I know Bett Cary as well as if I had made her  —  Here the lady thought fit to interpose  and tell the catchpole  if he had taken her word for it at first  he might have saved himself and her a great deal of trouble —   It may be so  answered he  but by G—d  I ll have further evidence that you are not the person before you and I part  —   Yes  yes   said she  you shall have further evidence to your cost  —  Upon this we adjourned into the lodge  and called for a bottle of wine  where my companion wrote a direction to two of her acquaintance  and begged the favour of me to go to their lodgings  and request them to come to her immediately  I found them together at a house in Bridges s street  Drury lane  and as they were luckily unengaged  they set out with me in a hackney coach without hesitation  after I had related the circumstances of the affair  which flattered them with hopes of seeing a bailif trounced  for there is an antipathy as natural between the whores and bailifs  as that subsisting between mice and cats —Accordingly  when they entered the lodge  they embraced the prisoner very affectionately by the name of Nancy Williams  and asked how long she had been nabb d  and for what —On hearing the particulars of her adventure repeated  they offered to swear before a justice of peace that she was not the person mentioned in the writ whom it seems  they all knew  but the bailif  who by this time was convinced of 〈…〉  told them he would not   204 put them to that trouble —   Ladies  said he  there s no harm done—you shall give me leave to treat you with another bottle  and then we ll part friends  —  This proposal was not at all relished by the sisterhood  and miss Williams told him  Sure he did not imagine her such a fool as to be satisfied with a paultry glass of sour wine —Here the turnkey interrupted her  by affirming with an oath  that the wine was as good as ever was tipped over tongue —   Well  continued she  that may be—but was it the best of champaign  it is no recompence for the damage I have suffered both in character and health  by being wrongfully dragged to jail—At this rate no innocent person is safe  since any officer of justice  out of malice  private pique  or mistake  may injure and oppress the subject with impunity—but  thank heaven  I live under the protection of laws that will not suffer such insults to pass unpunished  and I know very well how to procure redress  —  Mr  Vulture  for that was the bailif s name  finding he had to deal with one who would not be imposed upon  began to look very sullen and perplexed  and leaning his fore head on his hand  entered into a deliberation with himself  which lasted a few minutes  and then broke out in a volley of dreadful curses against the old b—ch our landlady  as he called her  for having misinformed him —After much wrangling and swearing  the matter was referred to the decision of the turnkey  who calling for the other bottle  mulcted the bailif in all the liquor that had been drank  coach hire  and a couple of guineas for the use of the plaintif —The money was immediately deposited  miss Williams gratified the two   205 evidences with one half  and putting the other in her pocket drove home with me  leaving the catchpole grumbling over his loss  yet pleased in the main  for having so cheaply got clear of a business that might have cost him ten times the sum  and his place to boot —This guinea was a very seasonable relief to us  who were reduced to great necessity  six of my shirts and almost all my cloaths  except those on my back  being either pawned or sold for our maintenance before this happened —As we resented the behaviour of our landlandy  our first care was to provide ourselves with another lodging  whither we removed next day  with an intention to keep ourselves as retired as possible until our cure should be compleated —When we were fixed in our new habitation  I intreated her to finish the story of her Life  which she pursued in this manner     The success of our experiment on the J—ge  encouraged us to practice the same deceit on others  and my virginity was five times sold to good purpose  but this harvest lasted not long  my character taking air  and my directress deserting me for some new game  Whereupon I took lodgings near Charing cross  at two guineas per week  and began to entertain company in a public manner —But my income being too small to defray my expence  I was obliged
