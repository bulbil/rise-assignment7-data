of doors  without increasing the number of her followers   And then my uncle would have it  that my head would be unable to bear the consequence  which the partiality of my other friends gave me     18 It is true  my Lucy  that we young women are too apt to be pleased with the admiration pretended for us by the other Sex  But I have always endeavour d to keep down any foolish pride of this sort  by such considerations as these  That flattery is the vice of men  That they seek to raise us  in order to lower us  and in the end to exalt themselves on the ruins of the pride they either hope to find or inspire  That humility  as it shines brightest in an high condition  best becomes a flattered woman of all women  That she who is puffed up by the praises of men  on the supposed advantages of person  answers their end upon her  and seems to own  that she thinks it a principal part of hers  to be admired by them  And what can give more importance to them  and less to herself  than this  For have not women souls as well as men  and souls as capable of the noblest attainments  as theirs  Shall they not  therefore  be most solicitous to cultivate the beauties of the mind  and to make those of person but of inferior consideration  The bloom of beauty holds but a very few years  and shall not a woman aim to make herself mistress of those perfections that will dignify her advanced age  And then may she be as wise  as venerable—as my grandmamma  She is an example for us  my dear  Who is so much respected  who is so much beloved  both by old and young  as my grandmamma Shirley   In pursuance of the second injunction  I will now describe some young ladies and gentlemen who paid my cousins their compliments on their arrival in town   Miss Allestree  daughter of Sir John Allestree  was one  She is very pretty  and very genteel  easy  and free  I believe I shall love her   Miss Bramber was the second  Not so pretty as Miss Allestree  but agreeable in her person and air  a little too talkative  I think   It was one of my grandfather s rules to me  Not impertinently to start subjects  as if I would make an   19 ostentation of knowledge  or as if I were fond of indulging a talking humour  But frankness and complaisance required  he used to say  that we women should unlock our bosoms  when we were called upon  and were expected to give our sentiments upon any subject   Miss Bramber was eager to talk  She seemed  even when silent  to look as if she was studying for something to say  altho  she had exhausted two or three subjects  This charge of volubility I am the rather inclined to fix upon her  as neither Mr  nor Mrs  Reeves took notice to me of it  as a thing extraordinary  which  probably  they would have done  if she had exceeded her usual way  And yet  perhaps  the joy of seeing her newly arrived friends might have opened her lips  If so  your pardon  sweet Miss Bramber   Miss Sally  her younger sister  is very amiable and very modest  a little kept down  as it seems  by the vivacity of her elder sister  between whose ages there are about six or seven years  So that Miss Bramber seems to regard her sister as one whom she is willing to remember as the girl she was two or three years ago  for Miss Sally is not above seventeen   What confirmed me in this  was  that the younger Lady was a good deal more free when her sister was withdrawn  than when she was present  and again pursed up her really pretty mouth when she returned  And her sister addressed her always by the word Child  with an air of eldership  while the other called her sister  with a look of observance   These were the Ladies   The two gentlemen who came with them  were Mr  Barnet  a nephew of Lady Allestree  and Mr  Somner   Mr  Somner is a young gentleman lately married  very affected  and very opinionated  I told Mrs  Reeves  after he was gone  that I believed he was a dear Lover of his person  and she owned he was    20 Yet had he no great reason for it  It is far from extraordinary  tho  he was very gaily dressed  His wife  it seems  was a young widow of great fortune  and till she gave him consequence by falling in love with him  he was thought to be a modest good sort of young man  one that had not discovered any more perfections in himself  than other people beheld in him  and this gave her an excuse for liking him  But now he is loquacious  forward  bold  thinks meanly of the Sex  and  what is worse  not the higher of the Lady  for the preference she has given him   This gentleman took great
