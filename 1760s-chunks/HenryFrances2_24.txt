not my Art  these Numbers frame   Oh  more my Inspiration than my Theme   Henry   LETTER CCXIV  HENRY to FRANCES   I RECEIVED the Monody  and am as much charmed with it as you are  but I could not help smiling at your jealous Criticism  I do not look upon the Poem in the Light that you do  for it affected me in a higher Concern  that it was possible for your Death to inspire me with every Sentiment of Grief there expressed  without the Poetry to publish them to the World   To a Person used to read and write Poetry  Figures  Allusions  and Numbers are as familiar  as plain Prose is to other People    —For the Numbers came     Poets have generally pleaded their Incapacity  on Account of Grief  but this was always in Page  90 order to raise the Merit of the Poem  Tickel says    Grief unaffected suits but ill with Art   And flowing Numbers with a broken Heart   However  he has contrived to sigh out as beautiful an Elegy  as ever was written in any Language     Waller said  that Poets excel only in Fiction  but this was rather an ingenious Apology for writing better on Cromwell than on Charles  It had more of Wit than Criticism in it  or  if there was any thing of the latter  it must be true only of Heroic Poetry  because neither the Actions  Virtues  or real Characters of Men are high enough to adorn the Epic Verse   But there is a Mixture of Tenderness and Dignity  which form the Characteristic of Elegy  that agrees perfectly well with Figures  which it naturally inspires  and the more sincere the Grief  the bolder will these be of course   There is one Authority  which puts an End to any further Criticism upon this Subject  Horace says    If you would make me weep  you must first drop Tears yourself   Which shews  that the Beauty of Elegy must rise in Proportion to the Sincerity of the Mourner     I remember the elder Palma  whose Taste in Music I was fond of  sat down  one Day  to compose something for me  perhaps I was in Love at that Time  for I desired he would make Page  91 it expressive of the most melting Tenderness  Upon which he replied   Il faut pleurer donc   and  as the Italians have their Passions at Will  he began to sigh  and actually wrought himself up to a Flow of Tears  while he was writing   But I might have saved you the Trouble of all this Criticism  only by referring you to Mr  Lyttelton s Character  who is far from being so flight a Man  as to play the Poet upon so serious and affecting a Subject  And there is one Particular  which proves to me his Sincerity beyond all Doubt  which is  that  among a great Choice and Variety of his truly classical and poetic Writings  this Poem is  I think  the Chef d Oeuvre   All the Fault I find with Mr  Lyttelton  is  that he did not under write himself upon this Occasion  for there is a certain gallant Pride in an ingenuous Nature  which tempts it to fall short even of the Praise it thinks is due  and is willing to bestow  lest it should be mistaken for Adulation  However  there is  at the same Time  a certain Fondness in the Lover  which inclines him to give Immortality to the Object of his Passion  which is not to be hoped for  without an Exertion of the fullest Powers of Poesy   I pity a Poet s Grief more than any other Man s  for his natural Warmth  Tenderness of Sentiment  and Liveliness of Imagination  give Page  92 Sorrow a Power of sinking deeper in his Heart  than others can possibly be affected with  When a plain Man loses a Mistress  Wife  Child  or Friend  he laments merely for the Loss of so much Property  But  when these dear Connections are torn off from a Person of a delicate Taste  he feels as if he had lost Part of himself  Animae Dimidium — nay worse  for the Remainder is a Burden to him   Your Criterion I will not admit of  for a Man  who is sincere in his Grief for the Loss of a Wife  is the more likely to marry again  When Pleasures are flown  Nature strongly solicits the Recovery of them  The chaste nuptial Joys engross the whole Man  and form his Taste and Sentiments entirely to such social Enjoyments  which  by fond Indulgence  become at last his sole Scheme of Happiness  and when those charming Ties are dissolved  he has the World  as it were  to begin anew  and it is surely then more natural  and more rational too  to endeavour to renew the Pleasures we have been so well acquainted with  and approved of  than to attempt a spiritless Succedaneum to them   So that  if ever your Crisis should come to pass  we ought not to doubt his Sincerity to the last Wife  but rather say  that
