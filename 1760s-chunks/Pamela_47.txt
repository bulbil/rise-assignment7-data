what was his intention in giving them to me  So   they were to be the price of my shame  and if I could make use of them    I should think I should never prosper with them  and  besides  you know    Mrs  Jervis  if I would not do the good gentleman s work  why should   I take his wages  So  in conscience  in honour  in every thing  I have   nothing to say to thee  thou second wicked bundle       But  said I  cone to my arms  my dear third parcel  the companion of   my poverty  and the witness of my honesty  and may I never deserve the   least rag that is contained in thee  when I forfeit a title to that   innocence  that I hope will ever be the pride of my life  and then I am   sure it will be my highest comfort at my death  when all the riches and   pomps of the world will be worse than the vilest rags that can be worn   by beggars  And so I hugged my third bundle       But  said I  Mrs  Jervis   and she wept to hear me   one thing more I   have to trouble you with  and that s all       There are four guineas  you know  that came out of my good lady s   pocket  when she died  that  with some silver  my master gave me  Now   these same four guineas I sent to my poor father and mother  and they   have broken them  but would make them up  if I would  and if you think   it should be so  it shall  But pray tell me honestly your mind  As to   the three years before my lady s death  do you think  as I had no wages    I may be supposed to be quits   By quits  I cannot mean that my poor   services should be equal to my lady s goodness  for that s impossible    But as all her learning and education of me  as matters have turned    will be of little service to me now  for it had been better for me to   have been brought up to hard labour  to be sure  for that I must turn   to at last  if I can t get a place   and you know  in places too  one is   subject to such temptations as are dreadful to think of   so  I say  by   quits I only mean  as I return all the good things she gave me  whether   I may not set my little services against my keeping  because  as I said    my learning is not now in the question  and I am sure my dear good lady   would have thought so  had she lived  but that too is now out of the   question  Well then  if so  I would ask  Whether  in above this year   that I have lived with my master  as I am resolved to leave all his   gifts behind me  I may not have earned  besides my keeping  these four   guineas  and these poor clothes here upon my back  and in my third   bundle  Now tell me your mind freely  without favour or affection       Alas  my dear girl  says she  you make me unable to speak to you at all    To be sure it will be the highest affront that can be offered  for you   to leave any of these things behind you  and you must take all your   bundles with you  or my master will never forgive you       Well  well  Mrs  Jervis  said I  I don t care  I have been too much used   to be snubbed and hardly treated by my master  of late  I have done him   no harm  and I shall always pray for him and wish him happy  But I don t   deserve these things  I know I don t  Then  I can t wear them  if I   should take them  so they can be of no use to me  And I trust I shall   not want the poor pittance  that is all I desire to keep life and soul   together  Bread and water I can live upon  Mrs  Jervis  with content    Water I shall get any where  and if I can t get me bread  I will live   like a bird in winter upon hips and haws  and at other times upon   pig nuts and potatoes  or turnips  or any thing  So what occasion have I   for these things   But all I ask is about these four guineas  and if you   think I need not return them  that is
