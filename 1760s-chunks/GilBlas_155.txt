little what I was about  Young Leganez could not reproach me with my ignorance  his little lordship was not cast in a scientific mould  for he scarcely knew a letter of his alphabet  though he had been under private tuition for fifteen months  None of his masters could make anything of him  patience was never formed to engage in so unequal a match  To be sure  they were expressly forbid to exercise any severity on his noble carcass  their orders were to teach  not to torture him  and this tender precaution  acting on a subject of insufferably untoward dispositions  was the means of throwing to the dogs all the mental physic they poured in  he would none of it   But the verb grinder engendered in his noddle a most ingenious device  by which to keep this troublesome young lordling in awe  without trenching on his foolish father s injunctions  This scheme was no other than to flog me when ever that scape grace Leganez had incurred the penalty of the rod  and this vicarious execution was inflicted with the utmost rigour  My consent to the transfer had never been asked  and there was nothing in the act itself to recommend it  so that my only chance was to run away  and appeal to my mother against so arbitrary a discipline  However her maternal feelings might inwardly revolt  no trace of woman s weakness could be detected in her manner of receiving my complaint  The Leganez connection was too important to be lost for a few whippings  and away went she  dragging her culprit into the presence of his tormentor  who by this act of hers became master of broom field  Experience had convinced him that the success of his invention corresponded with its felicity  He therefore went on improving the mind and manners of the little grandee at the expense of my skin  Remorse for his delinquencies was to be excited only by sympathy  so that whenever it became necessary to make a bloody example  my seat of vengeance was firked most unmercifully  The running account between young Leganez and me was all on one side  and scarcely a day passed but he sinned on tick and suffered by attorney  By the nearest calculation of whole numbers  there went somewhere about a hundred cuts to teach him each single letter of the alphabet  so that if you multiply 100 by 24 for stupidity  and add an 0 to the amount for moral offences  you will have the sum total of the belabouring that his education cost me   This thick and threefold companionship with birch was not the only rub  my path through this family was more beset with thorns than sweetened by flowers  As my birth and connections were no secret  the whole of the establishment  to the very refuse of the household  the stable boys and scullions  twitted me with my shameful origin  This stuck so terribly in my throat that I made my escape once more  but not without borrowing my tutor s ready money  amounting to upwards of a hundred and fifty ducats  for an indefinite period  and without interest  Thus was the account settled between us  since he had made a property of my hide for a scarecrow  it was but fair that I should have a finger in the earnings of his arm  For a first attempt at thieving both the plan and execution were hopeful  A hue and cry was raised for two days  it was hot while it lasted  but I lay snug  and they missed me  Madrid was no longer a fit hiding place  so I took to cover in Toledo  and the hounds were thrown out   I was just then entering into my fifteenth year  What a happy fellow  at such an early age  to shape my own conduct and be in a condition of forming a set of morals for myself  I soon scraped acquaintance with some pleasant youths  who rescued me from the dominion of prejudice  and shared liberally with me in the sin of spending what was not my own  By degrees I rose in society and leagued myself with a set of professional sharpers  who found me so fine a subject to work upon  that a short time  with plenty of practice  put me in possession of all the most desperate jobs  At the expiration of five years  an itch for travelling laid hold of me  I therefore took leave of my comrades and got as far as Alcantara  wishing to commence my peregrinations with the province of Estremadura  In this my first excursion  an opportunity of keeping in my hand occurred  and I was too diligent a practitioner to let it escape  As I was on foot  and loaded moreover with a pretty heavy knapsack  I halted from time to time to avail myself of the shade  and recruit a little under the trees which lined the highway  At one of these baits I picked up two young gentlemen  who were chatting at their ease upon the grass  and inhaling the freshness of the breeze  My mode of accosting them was suited to the occasion  nor did its familiarity seem to be taken in ill part  The eldest could not be more than fifteen    a couple of as practicable greenhorns as ever fell into the hands of a man of genius  Courteous stranger  said the
