the whole of Spain  the Christians  rather than submit to the tyranny of infidels  betook themselves to flight  and lay concealed in this country  in Biscay  and in the Asturias  whither the brave Don Pelagio had withdrawn himself  They lived in a state of exile  on the mountains  or in the woods  dispersed in little knots  Some took up their residences in natural caves  others in artificial dwellings under ground  like this we are in  In process of time  when by the blessing of Providence they had driven their enemies out of Spain  they returned to the towns  From that time forth their retreats have served as a rendezvous for the gentlemen of our profession  It is true that several of them have been discovered and destroyed by the holy brotherhood  but there are some yet remaining  and  by great good luck  I have tenanted this without paying any rent for it almost these fifteen years  Captain Rolando  at your service  I am the leader of the band  and the man you saw with me is one of my troopers       CH  V     The arrival of the banditti in the subterraneous retreat  with an account of their pleasant conversation   JUST as Captain Rolando had finished his speech six new faces made their appearance in the hall  the lieutenant and five privates returning home with their booty  They were hauling in two great baskets full of sugar  cinnamon  pepper  figs  almonds  and raisins  The lieutenant gave an account of their proceedings to the captain  and told him they had taken these articles  as well as the sumpter mule  from a grocer of Benavento  An official report having thus been made to the prime minister  the grocer s contribution was carried to account  and the next step was to regale after their labours  A large table was set out in the hall  They sent me back to the kitchen  where dame Leonarda told me what I had to do  I made the best of a bad bargain  finding the luck ran against me  and  swallowing my grievances  set myself to wait on my noble masters   I cleaned my plate  set out my sideboard  and brought up my wine  As soon as I announced dinner to be on table  consisting of two good black peppery ragouts for the first course  this high and mighty company took their seats  They fell too most voraciously  My place was to wait  and I handed about the glasses with so butler like an air  as to be not a little complimented on my dexterity  The chief entertained them with a short sketch of my story  and praised my parts  But I had recovered from my mania by this time  and could listen to my own panegyric with the humility of an anchorite or the contempt of a philosopher  They all seemed to take a liking to me  and to think I had dropped from the clouds on purpose to be their cup bearer  My predecessor was a fool to me  Since his death  the illustrious Leonarda had the honour of presenting nectar to these gods of the lower regions  But she was now degraded  and I had the felicity of being installed in her office  Thus  old Hebe being a little the worse for wear  young Ganymede tripped up her heels  A substantial joint of meat after the ragouts at length blunted the edge of their appetites  Eating and drinking went together  so that they soon got into a merry pin  and made a roaring noise  Well done  my lads  All talkers and no listeners  One begins a long story  another cuts a joke  here a fellow bawls  there a fellow sings  and they all seem to be at cross purposes  At last Rolando  tired of a concert in which he could hardly hear the sound of his own voice  let them know that he was maestro di capella  and brought them into better tune  Gentlemen  said he  I have a question to put  Instead of stunning one another with this infernal din  had we not better enjoy a little rational conversation  A thought is just come into my head  Since the happy day that united us we have never had the curiosity to inquire into each other s pedigrees  or by what chain of circumstances we were each of us led to embrace our present way of life  There would be no harm in knowing who and who are together  Let us exchange confidence  we may find some amusement in it  The lieutenant and the rest  like true heroes of romance  accepted the challenge with the utmost courtesy  and the captain told the first story to the following effect     Gentlemen  you are to know that I am the only son of a rich citizen in Madrid  The day of my birth was celebrated in the family by rejoicings without end  My father  no chicken  thought it a considerable feat to have got an heir  and my mother was kind enough to suckle me herself  My maternal grandfather was still living  a good old man  who did not trouble himself about other people s concerns  but said his prayers  and fought his campaigns over
