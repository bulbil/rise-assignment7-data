nor care was neglected on these occasions    They dressed themselves in their best blankets  which were covered   all over with patches of various colours  to make them look more   gaudy  Their heads were adorned with plumes of feathers   strings   of glass beads were rolled round their arms and legs  Their toes   were loaded with rings of pewter and brass  and their necks and   faces were carved with figures of birds and flowers  and painted   of various hues  I see your laughter moved at this description     but that proceeds from narrow prejudice and want of rational   reflection  on which it would appear that all useless ornaments are   equally just objects of ridicule  whether made of silfa and laces     or parti coloured rags  whether bits of glass  or pearls and diamonds    Think  I say  but for a moment  and you will see that in reality   there is nothing more absurd in wearing one kind of metal  or    upon one part of the body than another   rings of brass  for in    stance on the toes  than golden on the fingers   in carving the skin    than boring the ears  or in painting the face blue and green  than    white and red  The same vanity is the motive of all  and all pro    duce the same effect of admiration   as  in things equally unsup    ported by reason  custom and caprice bear equal sway  The differ    ence in the means  therefore  makes none in the end  at least  none   to the disadvantage of the persons of whom I speak  as it certainly   is more absurd to lavish treasures  that might be so much better   employed  to a worthless purpose  while cheaper baubles would   answer as well      The amusements in which they were engaged were as whimsical   as their dresses  Some skipped about  describing various figures    in their motions  till want of breath and weariness obliged them   to sit down  Others  and these the greatest number  were employed    in chucldng shells or pebbles from the brook into holes dug in the   sand  for prizes of bits of tin or brass  which game they applied    themselves to with the greatest eagerness and anxiety  and many   were so expert at it as to strip their antagonists of all their hoards    often  indeed  not without the assistance of chicanery and deceit    And a few of the eldest  and those who had nothing to stake at play    gathered up and down into little sets  and entertained themselves    with making remarks upon the rest  not always dictated by good    nature or truth  while the mistress of the cottage busied herself in         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 351     adjuBting Mremonials  settling her company at their several amuse    ments  and serving them with milk  or broth and tobacco  the   tatigue of which office she never repined at  as her consequence   was established by the number of her guests  Though mere amuse    ment was the obvious end of these meetings  other objects were   generally pursued  and other consequences produced by them    intngues were commenced  and often completed  and  triffing as   the prizes were for which they contended  emulation and avarice   agitated the passions  and set the competitors together by the ears    till they almost clawed out each other s eyes      Their sports were at length beginning to take their usual turn    The tempers of the losers became soured  and the detection of some   deep strokes of play gave rise to altercations  which would soon   have been followed by blows   but my master interposed his auth    ority  and put an end to their disputes  when the party broke up    some retiring to keep the assignations they had made in the warmth   of their inclinations  and the rest to calculate their winnings  and   devise schemes for retrieving their losses at their next meeting     and my master  having singled out the happy favourite of that   night  repaired with her to his own habitation  without any of the   rest taking offence or even particular notice of the preference  as   they had it in their power to supply their loss elsewhere      I have observed your astonishment at this whole scene  especially   at my master s hardiness in expecting to be happy among a number   of women  and attempting to keep them in order together  when   one  in your opinion  is more than any man can manage   but what   will it be when I tell you that that number often amounted to   hundreds  and that
