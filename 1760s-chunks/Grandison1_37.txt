and such a quantity before  Unconscionable  say  and let me  Echo like  repeat  Unconscionable  HARRIET BYRON     87Sunday Night   Letters from Northamptonshire  by Farmer Jenkins  I kiss the seals  What agreeable things  now  has my Lucy to say to her Harriet  Disagreeable ones she cannot write  if all my beloved friends are well   LETTER XV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Monday  February 6   AND so my uncle Selby  you tell me  is making observations in writing  on my Letters  and waits for nothing more to begin with me  than my conclusion of the conversations that offered at Lady Betty s   And is it expected that I should go on furnishing weapons against myself —It is   Well  with all my heart  As long as I can contribute to his amusement  as long as I know that he rather sometimes delights to say what may be said  than what he really thinks  as long as I have my good aunt Selby for my advocate  as long as my grandmamma is pleased and diverted with what I write  as well as with his pleasantries on her girl  and as long as you  my Lucy  stand up for your Harriet  I will proceed  and when my measure is full  and runs over  in his opinion  then let him ascribe vanity and what he pleases to me  I am but a woman  And he knows that I must love him the better for his stripes  Only let him take care  that  when he lays at my door faults of which I think I can acquit myself  he increases not in me the vanity he is so ready to attribute to me   Well  but will you not  my Harriet  methinks you ask  write with less openness  with more reserve  in apprehension of the rod which you know hangs over your head     88 Indeed I will not  It is my glory  that I have not a thought in my heart which I would conceal from any one whom it imported to know it  and who would be gratified by the revealing of it  And yet I am a little chagrin d at the wager which you tell me my uncle has actually laid with my grandmamma  that I shall not return from London with a sound heart   And does he teaze you  my Lucy  on this subject  with reminding you of your young partiality for Captain Duncan  in order to make good his assertion of the susceptibility of us all   Why so let him  And why should you deny  that you were susceptible of a natural passion  You must not be prudish  Lucy  If you are not  all his raillery will lose its force  What better assurance can I give to my uncle  and to all my friends  that if I were caught  I would own it  than by advising you not to be ashamed to confess a sensibility which is no disgrace  when duty and prudence are our guides  and the object worthy   Your man indeed was not worthy  as it proved  but he was a very specious creature  and you knew not his bad character  when you suffered liking to grow into love  But when the Love fever was at the height  did you make any body uneasy with your passion  Did you run to woods and groves  to record it on the barks of trees —No —You sighed in silence indeed  But it was but for a little while  I got your secret from you  not  however  till it betray d itself in your pined countenance  and then the man s discover d unworthiness  and your own discretion  enabled you to conquer a passion to which you had given way  supposing it unconquerable  because you thought it would cost you pains to contend with it   As to myself  you know I have hitherto been on my guard  I have been careful ever to shut the door of my heart against the blind deity  the moment I could   89 imagine him setting his incroaching foot on the threshhold  which I think liking may be called  Had he once gained entrance  perhaps I might have come off but simply   But I hope I am in the less danger of falling in love with any man  as I can be civil and courteous to all  When a stream is sluiced off into several channels  there is the less fear that it will overflow its banks  I really think I never shall be in love with any body  till duty directs inclination   Excuse me  Lucy  I do now and then  you know  get into a boasting humour  But then my punishment  as in most other cases  follows my fault  My uncle pulls me down  and shews me  that I am not half so good as the rest of my friends think me   You tell me  that Mr  Greville will be in London in a very few days  I can t help it  He pretends business  you say  and  since that calls him up  intends to give himself a month s pleasure in town  and to take
