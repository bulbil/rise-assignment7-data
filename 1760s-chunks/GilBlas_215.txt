been acting a very humorous farce  But I did not look for the concluding scene  My only thought was to secure you board and lodging under my own roof  and there was no other possibility of making the proposition in a modest way but by passing you off for my brother  But I am heartily glad that the chapter of accidents has opened with so good a berth for you  The Marquis de Marialva is a noble man of liberal and honourable sentiments  who will be better than his word in what he does for you  But confess now  There is scarcely a woman in existence except myself would have given so coming on a reception to a fellow who shirks his friends without saying with your leave or by your leave  I however am one of those simple hearted girls  who are glad to receive back again the base man they have once loved  though he should have offended and repented seven  or even seven thousand times   The best way for me was to acknowledge the extreme ill breeding of which I had been guilty  to blush and beg pardon once for all  After this explanation  she led the way to a very handsome dining room  We placed ourselves at table  where having a chambermaid and a footboy for eye witnesses  we kept within the bounds of brother and sister  When we had done dinner  we went back again into the same closet where we had been conversing before  Having our time to ourselves  my paragon of a Laura  giving herself up to her natural love of merriment  and to her no less natural curiosity  required from me a faithful and true narrative of all my pros and cons  my ins and outs  since that unmannerly separation of ours  I gave her a full and particular account  nothing extenuating on my own behalf  nor setting down aught in malice on the other side  When I had quenched her thirst after a story  she slaked mine  by communicating the particulars of her eventful life to the following effect       CH  VII     Laura s Story   I SHALL just run over to you  as briefly as possible  the circumstances which led me to embrace the theatrical profession   After you took French leave  so much to your credit  great events happened  My mistress Arsenia  more surfeited with a glut of pleasures than scandalized at their immorality  renounced the stage  and took me with her to a fine estate which she had just purchased in the neighbourhood of Zenora with the wages of her sinful life  We soon got acquainted in the town  Our visits there were very frequent  and sometimes for a day or two together  With the exception of these little excursions  we were as closely domesticated as probationers in a nunnery  and almost as piously employed   On one of our high days and holidays  Don Felix Moldonado  the corregidor s only son  saw me by chance  and took a liking to me  He soon found an opportunity of speaking with me in private  and  as it is in vain to affect modesty before one who knows me so well  there was some little contrivance of my own to bring the interview about  The young gentleman was not twenty years of age  the very picture of Venus s sweetheart  or Venus s sweetheart the very picture of him  with a form for a sculptor to work from  with an address so elegant  and with sentiments so generous  as to throw even his personal graces into the background  There was such a winning way with him  so pressing an earnestness to prevail  when he took a large diamond from his own finger  and slid it upon mine  that it would have been quite brutal not to have let it stay there  It was really something like sentiment that I began to entertain towards a swain of so interesting a character  But what an absurd thing it is for wenches of a certain sort to hook themselves upon young men of family  when their surly fathers hold official situations  The corregidor  who had scarcely his equal in the whole tribe of corregidors  got wind of our correspondence  and determined to close it in a summary manner  He sent a host of alguazils to take me into custody  who dragged me away  in spite of my cries and tears  to the house of correction for female penitents   There  without bill of indictment or form of trial  the lady abbess ordered me to be stripped of my ring and my clothes  and to be dressed in the habit of the institution  a long gown of grey serge tied about the middle with a strap of black leather  whence depended a rosary with large beads swinging down to my heels  After this pleasant reception  they took me into a hall  where there was an old monk  the deuce knows of what order  who set to work preaching up repentance and resignation  pretty much in the same strain as Dame Leonarda  when she exhorted you to patience in the subterraneous cavern  He told me that I was excessively obliged indeed to those good people who had so kindly shut me up  and could never thank them sufficiently for their good deed  in rescuing me from
