I begin with her stature  She cannot be said to be tall  but yet is something above the middling  Her Shape—But what care I for her shape  I  who hope to love her still more  tho  possession may make me admire her less  when she has not that to boast of  We young fellows who have been abroad  are above regarding English shapes  and prefer to them the French negligence  By the way  I think the foreign Ladies in the right  that they aim not at what they cannot attain  Whether   8we are so much in the right to come into their taste  is another thing  But be this as it will  there is so much ease and dignity in the person  in the dress  and in every air and motion of Miss Harriet Byron  that fine shapes will ever be in fashion where she is  be either native or foreigner the judge   Her complexion is admirably fair and clear  I have sat admiring her complexion  till I have imagined I have seen the life blood slowing with equal course thro  her translucent veins   Her Forehead  so nobly free and open  shews dignity and modesty  and strikes into one a kind of awe  singly contemplated  that  from the delight which accompanies the awe  I know not how to describe  Every single feature  in short  will bear the nicest examination  and her whole Face  and her Neck  so admirably set on her finely proportioned Shoulders—let me perish  if  taking all together  I do not hold her to be the most unexceptionable beauty I ever beheld  But what still is her particular Excellence  and distinguishes her from all other English women  for it must be acknowleged to be a characteristic of the French women of quality  is  the grace which that people call Physiognomy  and we may call Expression  Had not her seatures and her complexion been so fine as they are  that grace alone  that Soul shining out in her lovely aspect  joined with the ease and gracefulness of her Motion  would have made her as many admirers  as beholders   After this  shall I descend to a more particular description —I will   Her Cheek—I never saw a cheek so beautifully turn d  illustrated  as it is  by a charming Carmine flush  which denotes sound health  A most bewitching dimple takes place in each  when she smiles  and she has so much reason to be pleased with herself  and with all about her  for she is the idol of her relations  that I believe from infancy  she never frowned    9 nor can a frown  it is my opinion  sit upon her face for a minute  Would to heaven I were considerable enough with her to prove the contrary   Her Mouth—There never was so lovely a mouth  But no wonder  since such rosy Lips  and such ivory and even Teeth  must give beauty to a mouth less charming than hers   Her Nose adds dignity to her other features  Her Chin is sweetly turned  and almost imperceptibly dimpled   Her Eyes —Ay  madam  her Eyes —Good Heaven  what a lustre  yet not a fierce  but a mild lustre  How have I despised the romancing Poets for their unnatural descriptions of the Eyes of their heroines  But I have thought those descriptions  tho  absurd enough in conscience  less absurd  allowing something for poetical licence  ever since I beheld those of Miss Harriet Byron   Her Hair is a real and unlaboured ornament to her  All natural its curls  Art has no share in the lustre it gives to her other beauties   I mentioned her Neck—Here I dare not trust myself—Inimitable creature  All attracting loveliness   Her Arm—Your Ladyship knows my passion for a delicate Arm —By my Soul  madam  your own does not exceed it   Her Hands are extremely fine  Such Fingers  And they accustomed to the Pen  to the Needle  to the Harpsichord  excelling in all—O madam  women have Souls  I am now convinced they have  I dare own to your Ladyship  that once I doubted it  on a supposition that they were given us for temporary purposes only —And have I not seen her dance  Have I not heard her sing —But indeed  mind and person  she is all harmony   Then for Reading  for acquired knowledge  what Lady so young—But you know the character of her grandfather Shirley  He was a man of universal   10 learning  and  from his public employments abroad  as polite as learned  This Girl  from Seven years of age  when he came to settle in England  to Fourteen  when she lost him  was his delight  and her education and instruction the amusement of his vacant hours  This is the Period  he used to say  in which the foundations of all female goodness are to be laid  since so soon after Fourteen they leap into women   The dead languages he aimed not to teach her  lest he should overload her young mind  But in the Italian and French he made her an adept   Nor were the advantages common ones which she received from his Lady  her grandmother
