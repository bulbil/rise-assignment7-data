you related the story   of these divine citizens  I was imperceptibly stolen away  and won   entirely from self  I entered into all their interest  their passions    and affections   and was wrapped  as it were  into a new world of   delightful sensibilities  Is this what you call virtue what you   call happiness       A good deal of it  my lord  There are in nature but two kinds   of self  in other words  there are but two sorts of will in the   universe  the will of infinite wisdom  of infinite benevolence  going   forth in beauty and beatitude on all creatures  and the will of   the creature  desiring  attracting  envying  coveting  and rending   all things from all  to its own interest and advantage  In the   first will subsists all possible good  from the second arises all   possible evil   and did not the first will  in some measure  inform   and meliorate the second  the will of every creature would be   an Ishmael his hand would be against every one  and every   one s hand against him   and there would be nothing but strife and   distraction  hatred  horror  and misery  throughout the creation      Hence it follows that  as there is but one will from eternity    infinitely wise to discern what is best throughout the universe    infinitely good to desire the accomplishment of what is best  and   infinitely powerful to put what is best in execution   every will   that is not informed by this ONE WILL  must of necessity act in   ignorance  in blindness  and error  I will further affirm  that every   act of every will  that is not informed by the ONE WILL of GOOD    NESS  must  of equal necessity  be the act of malevolence      I do not see the necessity of that  replied the earl  I well per    ceive that God can give to intelligent beings an existence or   identity distinct from himself  for I see that he has done it  What   should therefore prevent him from giving qualities as distinct from         40 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      himself as the essence   why might he not impart  to any limited   degree  capacity  discernment  power  wisdom  and goodness    Might not such a being instantly perceive  to a vast extent  the   relations of things  with their several fitnesses and disagreements    would he not consequently be enamoured of what was right and   beautiful  would he not act agreeable to such a just appro    bation  and would not such acts be fitly accounted the acts of   virtue      At this instant a messenger arrived on the spur  He brought   word to Mr  Meekly that his friend Mr  Husbands was taken sud    denly ill  and earnestly requested to see him directly   whereupon   Mr  Meekly  who preferred any matter of charity to all other con    siderations  immediately got up  made a silent bow  and vanished      To return to our hero  As soon as he was new rigged  he pressed   for another visit to his patron  who received him with accustomed   tenderness  but greatly wondered at his peasant dress  Nurse   then recited to him the whole adventure of the frittered robings     whereat the old gentleman in a manner devoured him with the   eagerness of his caresses      When nurse and Harry were departed  he called to him his old   domestic  James  said he  with a tear yet standing in his eye    I can no longer live without the company of this dear child   hasten    therefore  the orders I have already given you  and let all things   be in readiness for the first opportunity  The domestic  who had   caught the silent habit of his master  with a bow assented  and   retired      Autumn was now advanced  and Lord Dicky  with his brother    a number of little associates  and an attending footman  got leave   to go to the copse a nutting  As the children were perfectly   acquainted with the way  the servant desired to stay behind a while    in order to provide hooks for pulling down the branches  This was   granted  and forth they all issued in high chat and spirits      The copse lay at some distance  on one side of the park behind   the mansion house   but when they had nearly approached the   place of their destination  Harry missed a garter  and  promising   speedily to rejoin his companions  went back to seek it
