male sex in the neighbourhood  and the withering  hand of time hang threatening over her head  began to feel the horror of  eternal virginity  and  in a sort of desperation  resolved at any rate  to rescue herself from that reproachful and uncomfortable situation     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Thus determined  she formed a plan  the execution of which to a  spirit less enterprising and sufficient than hers  would have appeared  altogether impracticable  this was no other than to make a conquest of  the commodore s heart  which the reader will easily believe was not very  susceptible of tender impressions  but  on the contrary  fortified with  insensibility and prejudice against the charms of the whole sex  and  particularly prepossessed to the prejudice of that class distinguished  by the appellation of old maids  in which Mrs  Grizzle was by this time  unhappily ranked  She nevertheless took the field  and having invested  this seemingly impregnable fortress  began to break ground one day   when Trunnion dined at her brother s  by springing certain ensnaring  commendations on the honesty and sincerity of sea faring people   paying a particular attention to his plate  and affecting a simper of  approbation at everything which he said  which by any means she could  construe into a joke  or with modesty be supposed to hear  nay  even  when he left decency on the left hand  which was often the case  she  ventured to reprimand his freedom of speech with a grin  saying   Sure  you gentlemen belonging to the sea have such an odd way with you   But  all this complacency was so ineffectual  that  far from suspecting the  true cause of it  the commodore  that very evening  at the club  in  presence of her brother  with whom by this time he could take any manner  of freedom  did not scruple to d   her for a squinting  block faced   chattering p   kitchen  and immediately after drank  Despair to all old  maids   The toast Mr  Pickle pledged without the least hesitation  and  next day intimated to his sister  who bore the indignity with surprising  resignation  and did not therefore desist from her scheme  unpromising  as it seemed to be  until her attention was called off  and engaged  in another care  which for some time interrupted the progress of this  design   Her sister had not been married many months  when she exhibited evident  symptoms of pregnancy  to the general satisfaction of all concerned  and  the inexpressible joy of Mrs  Grizzle  who  as we have already hinted   was more interested in the preservation of the family name than in  any other consideration whatever  She therefore no sooner discovered  appearances to justify and confirm her hopes  than  postponing her own  purpose  and laying aside that pique and resentment she had conceived  from the behaviour of Mrs  Pickle  when she superseded her authority   or perhaps  considering her in no other light than that of the vehicle  which contained  and was destined to convey  her brother s heir to  light  she determined to exert her uttermost in nursing  tending  and  cherishing her during the term of her important charge  With this  view she purchased Culpepper s Midwifery  which with that sagacious  performance dignified with Aristotle s name  she studied with  indefatigable care  and diligently perused the Complete Housewife   together with Quincy s Dispensatory  culling every jelly  marmalade  and  conserve which these authors recommend as either salutary or toothsome   for the benefit and comfort of her sister in law  during her gestation   She restricted her from eating roots  pot herbs  fruit  and all sorts of  vegetables  and one day  when Mrs  Pickle had plucked a peach with her  own hand  and was in the very act of putting it between her teeth  Mrs   Grizzle perceived the rash attempt  and running up to her  fell on her  knees in the garden  entreating her  with tears in her eyes  to desist  such a pernicious appetite  Her request was no sooner complied with   than recollecting  that if her sister s longing was balked  the child  might be affected with some disagreeable mark or deplorable disease  she    6 22 15  3 45 PM   begged as earnestly that she would swallow the fruit  and in the mean  time ran for some cordial water of her own composing  which she forced  on her sister  as an antidote to the poison she had received   This excessive zeal and tenderness did not fail to be very troublesome  to Mrs  Pickle  who  having resolved divers plans for the recovery  of her own ease  at length determined to engage Mrs  Grizzle in such  employment as would interrupt that close attendance  which she found so  teasing and disagreeable  Neither did she wait long for an opportunity  of putting her resolution in practice  The very next day a gentleman  happening to dine with Mr  Pickle
