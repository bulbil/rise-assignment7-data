Wind was fair  should he alter his Course to set me upon Shore  his Owners would ruin him  but he would take Care of me  he swore  and begged Pardon for getting to Bed to me —but since what was done could not be undone  he supposed there was no Harm  he said  if I and he stowed in the same Birth together   What could I do  Gentlemen  in these most wretched Circumstances  He added  that when I came to the West Indies  I should live like a Lady  that he would bring me safe back again  and that if it   102〈1  duplicate〉  103〈1  duplicate〉  104cost him all he was worth in the World  he would find out the Villains who had wronged me   For the Remainder of the Voyage we lived together  and when the Ship came into Harbour  he fulfilled his Promise of behaving to me like a Man —He sold me for a three Years indented Servant  having persuaded me to sign a Paper before he went ashore  which he said was necessary for both our Securities to his Owners   You may wonder  perhaps  Mr  Junior  how I had a Fortitude of Mind sufficient to endure such Shocks as these were  Indeed  Gentlemen  I cannot boast of what your Sex calls Stoicism —I don t know whether I am right in the Word  or no  but I mean that Philosophic Armour of Indifference  in which the famous Men of former Times are said to have given Battle to the Passions   Yet our Sex has a Shield that is our sure Defence  when we please to make Use of it  It is Spirit—and a Lady s Spirit  like a King s Prerogative  is absolute  we will do what we please with it   I was taken by a Widow Lady  a Tawny moor  to be her Waiting woman  I had an easy Place of it  only   105now and then I was a little puzzled about chusing Ribbands to suit her Complexion—You smile  Gentlemen  upon my Honour it is true  Tho  her Face  Neck and Arms were exactly a Copper Colour  she spent three Hours every Day at her Dressing table  but these Mulattos are much more affected than Europeans  at least  I fancy  if in England any ill favoured Persons should take Pains to ornament their Faces  they would be stared at as Prodigies of Vanity  vastly odd Creatures  and such as don t appear above once in a Century   My Mistress  tho  very old  as well as intolerably ugly  was incredibly rich  several Persons  even of the best Families upon the Island  paid their Addresses to her  in this too I hope we differ from them    One Afternoon  as I was sitting by myself in the Dining room  a Gentleman  who was the greatest Favorite my Mistress had  came behind me softly  and before I was aware  throwing his Arms round my Neck  gave me three or four Kisses  the first and the last Time he ever served me so  the old Lady entered that Moment  and took immediately such an Antipathy to me  that she was resolved to have me poisoned  those   106Things are often  and very easily done there   Had it not been for an Englishman  one of the Overseers of her Slaves  I had died a Victim to her Jealousy  By his Means  tho  it was attended with innumerable Difficulties  I made my Escape off the Island  He took me with him to Hispaniola  from whence we sailed for England  but on the Cornish Shore our Ship was lost  and tho  we sav d several Things of Value out of the Wreck  the Country People came down  Women as well as Men  and plundered us of them all   I wonder those Things are suffered in such a Kingdom as England is  I am no Politician  but really believe our Legislators know not that such Things are practis d  or if they have heard of them  fansy them to be so much exaggerated  they are not worth attending to   Mr  Saltern   I have heard  that a Clause concerning the preserving of Properties in the Case of Shipwrecks  is to be tacked to the Bill for Preservation of the Game throughout England  for at present it is not only on the Coast of Cornwall  but on every County in this Kingdom  whose Land lies open to the Sea  where a Ship   107comes on Shore  the Vessel is not only plunder d  but the Sailors too often murder d   Lady   Thus  Sir  it was they serv d the Person who came over with me  As he strove to defend a Chest of valuable Effects  which he had purchas d Abroad  he receiv d a blow on his Head by a Club  from one of the Barbarians  of which Fracture he died  On the Day of his Death  I was brought to Bed of the Child Mr  Junior has so generously taken Care of  and with which Infant I have wander d ever since  in a most miserable Condition   It is almost incredible  what a Woman s Pride can make
