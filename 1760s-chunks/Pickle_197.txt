the  rest of the season   CHAPTER LXXIII   Peregrine arrives at the Garrison  where he receives the last  Admonitions of Commodore Trunnion  who next Day resigns his Breath  and  is buried according to his own Directions  Some Gentlemen in the Country  make a fruitless Attempt to accommodate Matters betwixt Mr  Gamaliel  Pickle and his eldest Son   About four o clock in the morning our hero arrived at the garrison   where he found his generous uncle in extremity  supported in bed by  Julia on one side  and Lieutenant Hatchway on the other  while Mr   Jolter administered spiritual consolation to his soul  and between  whiles comforted Mrs  Trunnion  who  with her maid  sat by the fire   weeping with great decorum  the physician having just taken his last  fee  and retired  after pronouncing the fatal prognostic  in which he  anxiously wished he might be mistaken     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Though the commodore s speech was interrupted by a violent hiccup  he  still retained the use of his senses  and  when Peregrine approached   stretched out his hand with manifest signs of satisfaction  The young  gentleman  whose heart overflowed with gratitude and affection  could  not behold such a spectacle unmoved  He endeavoured to conceal his  tenderness  which  in the wildness of his youth  and the pride of his  disposition  he considered as a derogation from his manhood  but  in  spite of all his endeavours  the tears gushed from his eyes  while he  kissed the old man s hand  and he was so utterly disconcerted by his  grief  that  when he attempted to speak  his tongue denied its office   so that the commodore  perceiving his disorder  made a last effort of  strength  and consoled him in these words    Swab the spray from your  bowsprit  my good lad  and coil up your spirits  You must not let the  toplifts of your heart give way  because you see me ready to go down at  these years  Many a better man has foundered before he has made half  my way  thof I trust  by the mercy of God  I shall be sure in port in a  very few glasses  and fast moored in a most blessed riding  for my  good friend Jolter hath overhauled the journal of my sins  and  by  the observation he hath taken of the state of my soul  I hope I shall  happily conclude my voyage  and be brought up in the latitude of heaven   Here has been a doctor that wanted to stow me chock full of physic  but   when a man s hour is come  what signifies his taking his departure with  a  pothecary s shop in his hold  Those fellows come alongside of dying  men  like the messengers of the Admiralty with sailing orders  but  I told him as how I could slip my cable without his direction or  assistance  and so he hauled off in dudgeon  This cursed hiccup makes  such a rippling in the current of my speech  that mayhap you don t  understand what I say  Now  while the sucker of my wind pump will go  I  would willingly mention a few things  which I hope you will set down  in the log book of your remembrance  when I am stiff  d ye see  There s  your aunt sitting whimpering by the fire  I desire you will keep her  tight  warm  and easy in her old age  she s an honest heart in her own  way  and  thof she goes a little crank and humoursome  by being often  overstowed with Nantz and religion  she has been a faithful shipmate to  me  and I daresay she never turned in with another man since we first  embarked in the same bottom  Jack Hatchway  you know the trim of her as  well as e er a man in England  and I believe she has a kindness for  you  whereby  if you two will grapple in the way of matrimony  when I  am gone  I do suppose that my godson  for love of me  will allow you to  live in the garrison all the days of your life    Peregrine assured him  he would with pleasure comply with any request  he should make in behalf of two persons whom he esteemed so much   The lieutenant  with a waggish sneer  which even the gravity of the  situation could not prevent  thanked them both for their good will   telling the commodore  he was obliged to him for his friendship  in  seeking to promote him to the command of a vessel which he himself had  worn out in the service  but that  notwithstanding  he should be content  to take charge of her  though he could not help being shy of coming  after such an able navigator   Trunnion  exhausted as he was  smiled at this sally  and  after some  pause  resumed his admonitions in this manner    I need not talk of
