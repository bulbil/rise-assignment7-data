in my heart     Deserving of praise as thou art  said Cozro  thou for the present must suppress thy ardor to do good  for though  Page  170  by the death of Schemzeddin thou art no longer a prisoner  thou art not nevertheless yet at liberty to leave thy house  Why not  answered ← Nourjahad →   who is there now to prevent me     The young sultan  replied Cozro  deeply afflicted for the death of his father  and out of a pious regard to his memory  has given strict commandment  that all his subjects should observe a solemn mourning for him  during the space of twenty days  in which time all the shops  and places of public resort  except the mosques  are to be shut up  and no business of any kind transacted  nor are any persons to be seen in the streets  excepting those who visit the  Page  171  sick  and the slaves who must necessarily be employed to carry provisions  on pain of the sultan s heavy displeasure     This edict was published yesterday  and the people of Ormuz all love the memory of Schemzeddin  and the person of their present sultan too well  not to pay an exact obedience to it     If so  said ← Nourjahad →   I will not by my example encourage others to infringe their duty  yet as the relieving of the poor is in itself meritorious  I would not wish to be with held from doing it so long as twenty days  How many virtuous people may be during that time pining for want  more especially as this  Page  172  prohibition must cut off all intercourse between man and man  and deprive many poor wretches of the charitable succour they might otherwise receive  I think therefore that thou  Cozro  in thy slave s habit  mayst go forth unsuspected  and by privately seeking out  and alleviating the miseries of our fellow citizens  do an act of more real benefit  than can result from the strictest conformity to this pageant of sorrow  which many in their hearts I am sure must condemn     Cozro approving of these sentiments  readily agreed to the expedient  and taking a large purse of gold with him to distribute as occasion might serve  immediately  Page  173  diately set out in order to execute his lord s commands     ← Nourjahad → now entered on a total reformation in his way of living  He rose at day break  and spent the morning in study or meditation  Luxury and intemperance were banished from his board  his table was spread with the plainest dishes  and he wholly abstained from excess in wine  His slumbers were sweet  and he found his health more vigorous     I will no more  said he  enslave myself to the power of beauty  I have lived to see the decay of a whole seraglio of the fairest faces in Persia  and have sighed  Page  174  for the ingratitude of the next generation that succeeded them  I will not then seek out for those destroyers of my quiet  for whose death or infidelity I must for ever complain  Mandana was the only woman who ever really deserved my love  could I recal her from the grave  and endue her with the same privilege of which I am myself possessed  I would confine myself to her arms alone  but since that is impossible  I will devote myself to the charms of virtue  which of all things she most resembled     Whilst ← Nourjahad → was thus resolving to correct the errors of his past life  his virtue was not merely in speculation  He never laid him down to rest  without  Page  175  the satisfaction of having made some one the better for him  Cozro  who constantly spent the day in enquiring out and relieving the distressed  failed not to return every night to give an account of his charitable mission  and to infuse into his master s bosom  the  till now unfelt  joy which springs from righteous deeds     The heart of ← Nourjahad → was expanded  and glowed with compassion for those sufferings which Cozro feelingly described as the lot of so many of his fellow creatures  As charity and benevolence rose in his breast  he found his pride subside  He was conscious of his own unworthiness  He kneeled  he prayed   Page  176  he humbled himself before the Almighty  and returned thanks to God for enabling him to succour the unfortunate     In this happy frame of mind he continued for eighteen days  there wanted but two more to the expiration of the mourning for the sultan  when Nourjahad was to be at full liberty to pursue in his own person the dictates of his reformed  and now truly generous and benevolent heart     He was sitting alone in his apartment  waiting the arrival of Cozro  in the pleasing expectation of receiving some fresh opportunity of doing good  The hour of his usual return was already  Page  177  past  and ← Nourjahad → began to fear some accident had happened to him  but he little knew that a black cloud hung
