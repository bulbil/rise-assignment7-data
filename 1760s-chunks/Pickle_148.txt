 he was conducted to his  own bed  and the chamber being evacuated  they locked their door  fully  resolved to admit no more visitants for that night  while Peregrine   mad with seeing the delicious morsel snatched  as it were  from his very  lip  stalked through the passage like a ghost  in hope of finding some  opportunity of re entering  till the day beginning to break  he was  obliged to retire  cursing the idiotical conduct of the painter  which  had so unluckily interfered with his delight   CHAPTER LV    They depart from Ghent  Our Hero engages in a Political Dispute with his  Mistress  whom he offends  and pacifies with Submission  He practises  an Expedient to detain the Carriage at Alost  and confirms the Priest in  his Interest   Next day  about one o clock  after having seen everything remarkable in  town  and been present at the execution of two youths  who were hanged  for ravishing a w    they took their departure from Ghent in the same  carriage which had brought them thither  and the conversation turning  upon the punishment they had seen inflicted  the Flemish beauty  expressed great sympathy and compassion for the unhappy sufferers   who  as she had been informed  had fallen victims to the malice of the  accuser  Her sentiments were espoused by all the company  except the  French lady of pleasure  who  thinking the credit of the sisterhood  concerned in the affair  bitterly inveighed against the profligacy of  the age  and particularly the base and villainous attempts of man upon  the chastity of the weaker sex  saying  with a look of indignation  directed to the painter  that for her own part she should never be  able to manifest the acknowledgment she owed to Providence  for having  protected her last night from the wicked aims of unbridled lust  This  observation introduced a series of jokes at the expense of Pallet  who  hung his ears  and sat with a silent air of dejection  fearing that   through the malevolence of the physician  his adventure might reach the  ears of his wife  Indeed  though we have made shift to explain the  whole transaction to the reader  it was an inextricable mystery to every  individual in the diligence  because the part which was acted by the  Capuchin was known to himself alone  and even he was utterly ignorant  of Pickle s being concerned in the affair  so that the greatest share  of the painter s sufferings were supposed to be the exaggerations of his  own extravagant imagination   In the midst of their discourse on this extraordinary subject  the  driver told them that they were now on the very spot where a detachment  of the allied army had been intercepted and cut off by the French  and   stopping the vehicle  entertained them with a local description of the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   battle of Melle  Upon this occasion  the Flemish lady  who  since her  marriage  had become a keen partisan for the French  gave a minute  detail of all the circumstances  as they had been represented to her by  her husband s brother  who was in the action  This account  which sunk  the number of the French to sixteen  and raised that of the allies to  twenty thousand men  was so disagreeable to truth  as well as to the  laudable partiality of Peregrine  that he ventured to contradict her  assertions  and a fierce dispute commenced  that not only regarded the  present question  but also comprehended all the battles in which the  Duke of Marlborough had commanded against Louis the Fourteenth  In the  course of these debates  she divested the great general of all the  glory he had acquired  by affirming  that every victory he gained was  purposely lost by the French in order to bring the schemes of Madame de  Maintenon into discredit  and  as a particular instance  alledged  that  while the citadel of Lisle was besieged  Louis said  in presence of the  Dauphin  that if the allies should be obliged to raise the siege  he  would immediately declare his marriage with that lady  upon which  the  son sent private orders to Marshal Boufflers to surrender the place   This strange allegation was supported by the asseveration of the priest  and the courtesan  and admitted as truth by the governor  who pretended  to have heard it from good authority  while the doctor sat neutral  as  one who thought it scandalous to know the history of such modern events   The Israelite  being a true Dutchman  himself under the banners of our  hero  who  in attempting to demonstrate the absurdity and improbability  of what they had advanced  raised such a hue and cry against himself   and  being insensibly heated in the altercation  irritated his Amanda  to such a degree  that her charming eyes kindled with fury  and he  saw great reason to think  that if he did not fall upon some method to  deprecate her wrath  she would  in a twinkling
