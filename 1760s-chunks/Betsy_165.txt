  even amidst the most unbounded gratification of her amorous desires with   the man that had excited them  the dread of losing him embittered all   the transports of possession  she very well knew he had broke off with   Miss Betsy  and doubted not but that event had happened through the   artifice she had put in practice  yet  as there was a possibility that   the adventure of Denham should be unravelled  and the innocency of Miss   Betsy cleared up  she trembled lest such an eclaircissement should renew   all his former tenderness for that once so much loved rival  and herself   be reduced to all the horrors of despair and shame  It was therefore to   sound the inclinations of Miss Betsy  that alone brought her thither  in   the wicked hope  that if there was the least probability of a   reconciliation between them  she might find some opportunity of   traversing all the steps that might be taken by either party for that   purpose       But Miss Betsy was too much upon her guard to give her any room to   discover what her sentiments were in that point  she received her very   coolly  and  even on her first entrance  told her that she was obliged   to go out that evening  but the other taking no notice of the little   pleasure Miss Betsy expressed on seeing her  told her she came out of   friendship to visit her  that she had been told Mr  Trueworth and she   were entirely parted  that if she had so great an affection for him as   the world had been pleased to say  she must certainly stand in need of   all the consolation that could be given her   But  I hope  my dear     said she   you have too much good sense not to despise him now  Nothing   is more common than that men should be false  Remember what the poet   says             Ingratitude s the sin  which  first or last        Taints the whole sex  the catching court disease         Miss Betsy was so provoked at being talked to in this manner  that she   replied  that there was neither falsehood nor ingratitude in the case    if Mr  Trueworth had desisted his visits  it was only because he was   convinced she desired not the continuance of them       It is possible these words were more galling to the jealous heart of   Miss Flora than any thing she could have said  though she spoke them   with no other intent than to clear herself of the imputation of having   been forsaken  a thing she looked upon as the worst blemish that could   be cast upon her reputation  Miss Flora  finding no more was to be got   out of her  took her leave for this time  resolving  however  in her own   mind  to keep up an acquaintance with her  that seeming to her the most   likely way both to satisfy her curiosity  and prevent any effort of what   the extravagance of her passion made her apprehend       Miss Betsy did not give herself much trouble in reflecting on what Miss   Flora had said  but as soon as her watch reminded her of the appointed   hour  she bid her footman fly and get a chair  on her coming to the   house  Mrs  Modely herself opened the door at the first rap  and desired   her to walk in   No  no   said Miss Betsy  still sitting in the chair     I cannot stay  I only called to tell you that I will have the silver   robings put upon the green night gown  and will buy a new trimming for   the pink     I shall be sure to obey your orders  Madam   replied the   other   but I must intreat you will do me the honour to come in and   drink a dish of tea  the kettle boils  and I have just now had a present   of a cannister of some of the finest Hyson in the world     I must leave   you then as soon as I have tasted it   said Miss Betsy  coming out of   the chair   for I have twenty visits to make this evening        She had not been three minutes in the parlour  when the person for whom   all this ceremony was affected  entered the room in somewhat of an   abrupt manner   I come  Mrs  Modely  to complain   said he   my servants   tell me    With these words he stopt short  and fixed his eyes full on   Miss Betsy  with a kind of astonishment   Mrs  Modely  pretending to be   in a
