      How far the event answered her expectations shall very shortly be   related  but incidents of another nature requiring to be first   mentioned  the gratification of that curiosity  which this may have   excited  must for a while be deferred                CHAPTER XIII       Is the recital of some accidents  as little possible to be foreseen by   the reader as they were by the persons to whom they happened          In youth  when the blood runs high  and the spirits are in full   vivacity  affliction must come very heavy indeed  when it makes any deep   or lasting impression on the mind  That vexation which Miss Betsy had   brought upon herself  by going to the play with Miss Forward  was severe   enough the whole night  and the ensuing day  A great while  it must be   confessed  for a person of her volatile disposition  and when the more   violent emotions had subsided  the terror she had lately sustained  had    at least  this good effect upon her  it made her resolve to take all   possible precautions not to fall into the like danger again  As she had   an infinite deal of generosity in her nature  when not obscured by that   pride and vanity which the flatteries she had been but too much   accustomed to  had inspired her with  she could not reflect how ill she   had treated Mr  Trueworth  and the little regard she had paid to the   tender concern he had shewn for her reputation  without thinking she   ought to ask his pardon  and acknowledge she had been in the wrong  If   Mr  Trueworth could have known the humour she was at present in  how   readily would he have flown to her with all the wings of love and kind   forgiveness  but as he had not the spirit of divination  and could only   judge of her sentiments by her behaviour  it was not in his power to   conceive how great a change had happened in his favour  through a just   sensibility of her own error       She  in the mean time  little imagined how he far he resented the   treatment she had given him  especially as she heard he had been to wait   upon her the day in which she saw no company  and  after having passed   a night of much more tranquillity than the former had been  went down in   the morning to breakfast with her usual chearfulness  She had not been   many minutes in the parlour before she was agreeably surprized with the   sight of her elder brother  Mr  Thomas Thoughtless  who  it seems  had   arrived the night before  After the first welcomes were over  Mr    Goodman asked him  wherefore he did not come directly to his house    saying  he had always a spare bed to accommodate a friend  to which the   other replied  that he had come from Paris with some company whom he   could not quit  and that they had lain at the Hummums  Miss Betsy was   extremely transported at his return  and said a thousand obliging things   to him  all which he answered with more politeness than tenderness  and   this young lady soon perceived  by this specimen of his behaviour to   her  that she was not to expect the same affection from him  as she had   received so many proofs of from her younger brother       His long absence from England  and some attachments he had found abroad    had indeed very much taken off that warmth of kindness he would   doubtless otherwise have felt for an only sister  and one who appeared   so worthy of his love  As Mr  Goodman had acquainted him by letter  that   he had hired a house for him  according to his request  the chief of   their conversation turned on that subject  and  as soon as breakfast was   over  they took a walk together to see it  On their return  he seemed   very much pleased with the choice Mr  Goodman had made  and the little   time he staid was entirely taken up with consulting Lady Mellasin  his   sister  and Miss Flora  concerning the manner in which he should   ornament it  for the honest guardian had taken care to provide all such   furniture as he thought would be necessary for a single gentleman       No intreaties were wanting to prevail on him to make that house his   home  till his own was thoroughly aired  and in all respects fit for him   to go into  but he excused himself  saying  he could not leave the   friends he had travelled with  till they were provided for as well as   himself
