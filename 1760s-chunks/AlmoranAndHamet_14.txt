left his   countenance paler than the light clouds that pass by night over the   moon  ALMORAN took no notice of his confusion  but that he might more   effectually conceal his sentiments and prevent suspicion  he suddenly   adverted to another subject  while HAMET was hesitating what to reply    By this artifice HAMET was deceived  and concluded  that whatever   ALMORAN had heard of ALMEIDA  had passed slightly over his mind  and   was remembered but by chance  he  therefore  quickly recovered that ease   and chearfulness  which always distinguished his conversation       ALMORAN observing the success of his artifice  soon after  as if by a   sudden and casual recollection  again mentioned the lady  and told him    he would congratulate Abdallah upon having resigned her to his bed  As   HAMET could not bear to think of ALMORAN S mentioning ALMEIDA to her   father as his mistress  he replied  that he had no such intimacy with   ALMEIDA as he supposed  and that he had so high an opinion of her   virtue  as to believe  that if he should propose it she would not   consent  The imagination of ALMORAN caught new fire from beauties which   he found were yet unenjoyed  and virtue which stamped them with superior   value by rendering them more difficult of access  and as HAMET had   renounced a connection with her as a mistress  he wanted only to know   whether he intended her for a wife       This secret he was contriving to discover  when HAMET  having reflected    that if he concealed this particular  ALMORAN might think himself at   liberty to make what attempts he should think fit upon ALMEIDA  without   being accountable to him  or giving him just cause of offence  put an   end to his doubts  by telling him  he had such a design  but that it   would be some time before he should carry it into execution  This   declaration increased ALMORAN S impatience  still  however  he concealed   his interest in the conversation  which he now suffered to drop       He parted from his brother  without any farther mention of ALMEIDA but   while he was yet near him  turned hastily back  and  as if merely to   gratify his curiosity  told him with a smile  that he must indulge him   with a fight of his Circassian  and desired he might accompany him in   his next visit  or at some more convenient time  with this request    HAMET  as he knew  not how to refuse it  complied  but it filled his   mind with anxiety and trouble       He went immediately to ALMEIDA  and told her all that had happened  and   as she saw that he was net without apprehensions of mischief from his   brother s visit  she gently reproached him for doubting the fidelity of   her affection  as she supposed no power could be exerted by ALMORAN to   injure him  who in power was his equal  HAMET  in a transport of   tenderness  assured her that he doubted neither her constancy nor her   love  but as to interrupt the comfort of her mind  would only double his   own distress  he did not tell her whence his apprehensions proceeded    nor indeed had they any determinate object  but arose in general from   the character of his brother  and the probability of his becoming a   competitor  for what was essential to the happiness of his life       But if the happiness of HAMET was lessened  the infelicity of ALMORAN   was increased  All the enjoyments that were in his power he neglected    his attention being wholly fixed upon that which was beyond his reach    he was impatient to see the beauty  who had taken intire possession of   his mind  and the probability that he would be obliged to resign her to   HAMET  tormented him with jealousy  envy  and indignation       HAMET  however  did not long delay to fulfil his promise to his brother    but having prepared ALMEIDA to receive him  he conducted him to her   apartment  The idea which ALMORAN had formed in his imagination  was   exceeded by the reality  and his passion was proportionably increased    yet he found means not only to conceal it from HAMET  but from ALMEIDA    by affecting an air of levity and merriment  which is not less   incompatible with the pleasures than the pains of love  After they had   been regaled with coffee and sherbet  they parted  and HAMET   congratulated himself  that his apprehensions of finding in ALMORAN a   rival for ALMEIDA S love  were now at an end       But ALMORAN  whose passions were become more violent by restraint  was   in a state of mind little
