 Sit down  my Lord  said I  we are not particularly engaged  He came nearer  his hat under his arm  bowing to her  who sat as stately as a princess on her throne  But yet looked disobliged  You gave yourself pretty airs  my Lord—don t you   Pretty airs  madam —Pretty airs —By my Soul  I think  madam—And with such a glow in your face  madam—Taking his laced hat from under his arm  and with an earnest motion swinging it backwards and forwards  as unknowing what he did —  What  Sir  am I to be buffetted  Sir —  He put his hat under his arm again—Buffeted  madam —Would to heaven—  What has heaven to do with your odd ways  Lord G    I beg pardon for intruding  madam—But I thought—  That you had a privilege  Sir—But marriage itself  Sir  shall not give you a privilege to break into my retirements  You thought  Sir—You could not think—So much the worse if you did—  If I have really offended—I will be more circumspect for the future—I beg pardon  madam—Miss Byron I hope will forgive me too   He was going  in great discomposure  and with an air of angry humility   Charlotte  whispered I—Don t be silly—  Come  come  now you have broke in upon us  you may stay—But another time when you know me to be retired with a friend so dear to me  let it enter into your head  that no third person  unsent for  can be welcome   Poor man —How he loves her —His countenance changed at once to the humble placid  He looked as if he had rather be in fault than she   Oh  how little did she make him look   But he has often  as well as in this instance  let her see her power over him  I am afraid she will use it  I now see it is and will be his misfortune that she can   103 vex him without being vexed herself  And what may he expect  who can be treated with feigned displeasure  which  while it seems to be in earnest to him  will be a jest to his wife   I was very angry with her  when we were alone  and told her  that she would be an enemy  I was afraid  of her own happiness  But she only laughed at me  Happiness  my dear  said she  That only is happiness which we think so  If I can be as happy in my way  as you can be in yours  shall I not pursue it  Your happiness  child  is in the still life  I love not a dead calm  Now a tempest  now a refreshing breeze  I shall know how to enjoy the difference—My brother will not be here to turn jest into earnest  as might perhaps be the effect of his mediation—But  high ho  Harriet  that the first week were over  and I had got into my throne   She ended with an Italian air  contrasted with another High ho  and left me for a few moments   Poor Lord G   said I looking after her   She returned soon  Poor Lord G   repeated she  Those were the piteous words you threw after me—But if I should provoke him  do you think he would not give me a cuff  or so —You know he can t return joke for joke  and he must revenge himself some way—If that should be the case  Poor Charlotte  I hope you would say—  Not if you deserved it   Deserve a cuff  Harriet —Well  but I am afraid I shall   Remember next Tuesday  Charlotte —You must vow obedience—Will you break your vow —This is not a jesting matter   True  Harriet  And that it is not  was perhaps one of the reasons that made me disinclined to go to so solemn a place as the church with Lord G —Don t you think it one with those who insist upon being married in their own chamber     104 I believe great people  said I  think they must not do right things in the common way  That seems to me to be one of their fantastic reasons  But the vow is the vow  Charlotte  God is every where   Now you are so serious  Harriet  it is time to have done with the subject   I HAVE no sleep in my eyes  and must go on  What keeps me more wakeful is  my real concern for this naughty Miss Grandison  and my pity for Lord G   for the instance I have given you of her petulance is nothing to what I have seen  But I thought  so near the day  she would have changed her behaviour to him  Surely  the situation her brother is in  without any fault of his own  might convince her  that she need not go out of her path to pick up subjects for unhappiness   Such a kittenish disposition in her  I called it  for it is not so much the love of power that predominates in her mind  as the love of playfulness  And when the fit is upon her
