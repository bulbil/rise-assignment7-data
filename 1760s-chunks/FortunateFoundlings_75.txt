  your servant as companion       This resignation and seeming tranquility under an insult  she expected   would have been so mortifying  was the greatest disappointment could be   given to Melanthe  and increased her rage to such a degree  that she   flew to her as she was going out of the room  and struck her several   blows  using at the same time expressions not decent to repeat  but   such  as in some unguarded moments  women of quality level themselves   with the vulgar enough to be guilty of  This is a behaviour  madam    which demeans yourself much more than me  said Louisa  and when reason   gets the better of your passion  I doubt not but you will be just enough   to acknowledge you have injured me       She got out of the room with these words  but heard Melanthe still   outrageous in her reproaches  but determined not to answer  made what   haste she could into her own chamber  where having shut herself in  she   gave a loose to the distraction so unexpected an event must   naturally occasion       Pride is a passion so incident to human nature  that there is no breast   whatever that has not some share of it  and it would be to describe   Louisa such as no woman ever was  or ever can be  especially at her   years  to say she was not sensibly touched at the indignity she had   received from a person  but a few hours before  had treated her as   pretty near an equality with herself   Nor was her amazement inferior to   her grief  when after examining  with the utmost care  all her words and   actions  she could find nothing in either that could possibly give   occasion for this sudden turn       From the present  she cast thoughts back on the past accidents of her   life  and comparing them together  how cruelly capricious is my fate    said she  which never presents me with a good but to be productive of an   adequate evil   How great a blessing was the protection and tenderness I   found from Dorilaus  yet how unhappy did the too great increase of that   tenderness render  me   What now avails all the friendship received from   Melanthe  but to make me the less able to support her ill usage   And   what  of what advantage is it to me that I am beloved by a man the most   worthy to be loved  since I am of a condition which forbids me to give   any encouragement to his  or my own wishes       In this manner did she pour forth the troubles of her soul  till the   hour of supper being arrived  Melanthe s woman knocked at the chamber    and Louisa having opened it  she told her that she was sorry to see such   an alteration in the family  but it was her ladyship s pleasure that she   should eat at the second table  It is very well  said Louisa  resolving    whatever she endured  not to let Melanthe see any thing she could do   disturbed her too much  and in saying so  went with her into the hall   and sat down to table  but with what appetite I leave the reader   to guess       Melanthe  who now hated her to a greater degree than ever she had loved   her  gave to the ladies who were with her the whole history of Louisa    as far as she knew of it  and rather aggravated  than any way softened   the mean condition from which she had relieved her  but when they asked   her what that unhappy creature had done to forfeit a continuance of her   goodness  she only answered in general  that she had found her to be an   ungrateful and perfidious wretch       As she mentioned no particular influence on which this accusation was   grounded  every one was at liberty to judge of it as they pleased   The   accomplishments Louisa was mistress of  made every one convinced she had   been educated in no mean way  tho  by some accidents she might have been   reduced to the calamities Melanthe had so largely expatiated upon  and   more there were who pitied her than approved the behaviour of her   superior   some indeed  who had envied the praises they had heard   bestowed on her  were rejoiced at her fall  and made it a matter of   mirth wherever they came   and others again thought themselves affronted   by having a person  who they now found was no more than a servant    introduced into their company  and would never visit Melanthe afterward   the whole time she stayed in Venice       The affair  however  occasioned a
