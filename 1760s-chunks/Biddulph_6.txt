our own domestics to be orderly and regular  but she cannot answer for what other people’s may be   I begin to recover my spirits  my brother’s arrival has given new life to the family  my mother thinks  that in his company  with a lady or two  there will be no impropriety in suffering me to go  at least  half a dozen times into public during the season  even without the sanction of her presence—How kind  how considerate is this dear mother  I find this was one  amongst others  of her principal reasons for wishing Sir George to be with us  as it will save her from the necessity of going to public diversions  which otherwise she would have done  rather than have me debarred the pleasure of partaking of them  through the want of a proper protector  Every day lays me under fresh obligations to her   April 20  My brother has had another letter from Mr Faulkland  He has been but a fortnight at Bath  and already has found benefit from the use of the pump  I wish his wrist was quite well  I never was so impatient to see any body—But  Sidney  have a care—this heart has never yet been touch’d  this man is represented as a dangerous object  What an an ill fated Girl should I be  if I should fall in love with him  and he should happen not to like me  Should happen  what a vain expression was that  I would not for the world any one should see it but my Cecilia —Well  if he should not like me  what then  why  I will not like him  I have a heart  not very susceptible of what we young    women call love  and in all likelihood I shall be as indifferent to him  as he may be to me—Indeed I think I ought to resolve on not liking him  for notwithstanding those fine out lines of a character  which my brother gave of him in the presence of my mother  I have since drawn out of Sir George  who is always talking of him  some farther particulars  which do not please me so well  for I think he is made up of contrarieties   Nature  says Sir George  never formed a temper so gentle  so humane  so benevolent as his  yet  when provoked  no tempest is more furious  You would imagine him so humble  that he thinks every one superior to himself  yet through this disguise have I discovered  at certain times  a pride which makes him look down on all mankind  With a disposition formed to relish  and a heart attached to the domestic pleasures of life  he is of so enterprising a temper  that dangers and difficulties rather encourage than dishearten him in the pursuit of a favourite point  His ideas of love  honour  generosity  and gratitude  are so refined  that no hero in romance ever went beyond him  of this I was convinced from many little incidents which occurred in the course of my acquaintance with him  The modesty and affability of his deportment makes every body fancy  when he is in company with them  that he is delighted with their conversation  nay  he often affects to be improved and informed  yet there is a sly turn to ridicule in him  which  though without the least tincture of ill nature  makes him see and represent things in a light  the very opposite of that in which you fansied he saw them  With the nicest discernment  where he permits his judgment alone to determine  let passion interfere  and a child can impose on him  Though as I have already told you he is very handsome  he affects to despise beauty in his own sex  yet is it easy to perceive  by the nice care he takes in his dress  though the farthest in the world from a fop   that he does not altogether disregard it in his own person   Are not these faults  yes  surely they are  yet Sir George protests he has none  or at least says  if these be such  they are so overbalanced by his good qualities  that unless it be you sister  flattering creature  though that is seldom his failing  I don’t know the woman that deserves him  I did not thank him for the compliment he paid me  at the expense of the rest of our poor sex   May 5  A month is past since my brother arrived  and Mr Faulkland does not    yet talk of coming to town—If Sir George had drawn half such a flattering picture of me to him  as he has done of him to me  his curiosity would have brought him here sooner —My mother has mentioned him several times  and asked when he is to be in town  My brother has taken a very handsome house for him in the Square  We are all in expectation of this blazing star’s making its appearance in London  If he stays much longer  my patience will be so tired  that I shall not give a pinch of snuff to see him   May 19  Six weeks  and no news of Mr Faulkland’s coming  I’ll positively give him but another week  I begin to
