his passion for her  none of which the fond family thought worthy of their Clementina  nor any of whom could engage her heart  but  above all  the difference in religion  the young Lady so remarkably stedfast in hers  that it was with the utmost difficulty they could restrain her from assuming the veil  and who once declared  in anger  on hearing me  when called upon  avow my principles  that she grudged to an heretic the glory of having saved the Barone della Poretta  all these considerations outweighed any hopes that might otherwise have arisen in a bosom so sensible of the favours they were continually heaping upon me   About the same time  the troubles  now so happily appeased  broke out in Scotland  Hardly any thing else was talked of  in Italy  but the progress  and supposed certainty of success  of the young invader  I was often obliged to stand the triumphs and exultations of persons of rank and figure  being known to be warm in the interest of my country  I had a good deal of this kind of spirit to contend with  even in this more moderate Italian family  and this frequently brought on debates which I would gladly have avoided holding  But it was impossible  Every new advice from England revived the disagreeable subject  for the success of the rebels  it was not doubted  would be attended with the restoration of what they called the Catholic religion  And Clementina particularly   182 pleased herself  that then her heretic tutor would take refuge in the bosom of his holy mother  the church  And she delighted to say things of this nature in the language I was teaching her  and which  by this time  she spoke very intelligibly   I took a resolution  hereupon  to leave Italy for a while  and to retire to Vienna  or to some one of the German courts that was less interested than they were in Italy  in the success of the Chevalier s undertaking  and I was the more desirous to do so  as the displeasure of Olivia against me began to grow serious  and to be talked of  even by herself  with less discretion than was consistent with her high spirit  her noble birth  and ample fortune   I communicated my intention to the Marchioness first  The noble Lady expressed her concern at the thoughts of my quitting Italy  and engaged me to put off my departure for some weeks  but  at the same time  hinted to me  with an explicitness that is peculiar to her  her apprehensions  and her Lord s  that I was in Love with her Clementina  I convinced her of my honour  in this particular  and she so well satisfied the Marquis  in this respect  that  on their daughter s absolute refusal of the Count of Belvedere  they confided in me to talk to her in favour of that gentleman  The young Lady and I had a conference upon the subject  Dr  Bartlett can give you the particulars  The father and mother  unknown to us both  had placed themselves in a closet adjoining to the room we were in  and which communicated to another  as well as to that  They had no reason to be dissatisfied with what they heard me say to their daughter   The time of my departure from Italy drawing near  and the young Lady repeatedly refusing the Count of Belvidere  the younger brother  still unknown to me  for he doubted not but I should rejoice at the honour he hoped to prevail upon them to do me  declared in   183 my favour  They objected the more obvious difficulties in relation to religion  and my country  He desired to be commissioned to talk to me on those subjects  and to his sister on her motives for refusing the Count of Belvedere  but they would not hear of his speaking to me on this subject  the Marchioness giving generous reasons  on my behalf  for her joining in the refusal  and undertaking herself to talk to her daughter  and to demand of her  her reasons for rejecting every proposal that had been made her   She accordingly closetted her Clementina  She could get nothing from her  but tears  A silence  without the least appearance of sullenness  had for some days before shewn  that a deep melancholy had begun to lay hold of her heart  She was  however  offended when Love was attributed to her  yet her mother told me  that she could not but suspect  that she was under the dominion of that passion without knowing it  and the rather  as she was never chearful but when she was taking lessons for learning a tongue  that never  as the Marchioness said  was likely to be of use to her     As the Marchioness said —Ah my Lucy    The melancholy increased  Her tutor  as he was called  was desired to talk to her  He did  It was a task put upon him  that had its difficulties  It was observed  that she generally assumed a chearful air while she was with him  but said little  yet seemed pleased with every thing he said to her  and the little she did answer  tho  he spoke
