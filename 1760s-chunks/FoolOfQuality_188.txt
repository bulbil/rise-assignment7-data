   ment  and very formally took their leave      When she had seen them to the door  and that I had handed   them into their carriages  she turned without speaking to me  and   withdrew toward her own apartment  I followed  and as she was   about to enter My Matilda  my sister  said I  with a voice of   cordial tenderness  do your Harry the favour to accept this trifle    as an instance of my regard for the daughter of my friend for the   dearest object upon earth of my esteem and aifection  So saying    I presented her with my recent purchase  She did not  however    even deign to look at it   but  surveying me from head to foot with   an eye of strange passions  she took it and dashed it against the   floor  and  rushing into her chamber  she shut to the door upon me    without speaking a word      I stood in an inconceivable astonishment and concern  In vain   I searched and researched my memory for the recollection of some   instance wherein I might have offended her  but not presuming   to obtrude upon her  in order to question or expostulate with   her  I retreated to my apartment under the deepest dejection   of spirits      Mr  Golding did not return till it was late in the evening  He   immediately sent for me  Harry  says he  what is the matter    Has any thing happened amiss   I never saw you look so discom    posed  Indeed  sir  I am not as well as I could wish  Bless me    we had better send for a doctor  No  sir  I am in hopes it will   soon be over  Where is Matilda  In her chamber  sir  I believe    He then called Mrs  Susan  and bid her tell Matilda that he   desired to speak with her  but she answered that her mistress   was gone to bed indisposed  and requested that she might not   be disturbed      Supper being served up  we sat down in silence   and as neither   of us offered to take a bit  I rose  wished Mr  Golding a good night    and retired to my chamber      After a sleepless night  my servant entered in a visible alarm    and told me that Miss Golding was extremely ill  and that almost   all the physicians in London had been sent for      Very unhappy were many succeeding days  I saw my friend  my   father  the man I loved above the world I saw him in a depth of   distress that bordered on distraction  and I found my heart wrung   with inexpressible anguish      Though I was constant in my inquiries after Miss Golding  yet   I purposely avoided appearing in her presence  lest the sight of   one so obnoxious should add to her distemper  At length the good   old man came to me  wringing his hands Will you not go  Harry    says he will you not go and see Matilda before she dies  The   doctors tell me they have tried all the powers of medicine  but that   they do not yet know what to make of her sickness      My dear sir  said I  it is then no longer time to conceal from you   what I know or conjecture concerning this matter  Miss Matilda   herself intrusted me with the secret  but under the strictest   injunctions of silence   the extremity of her case  however  ought         190 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      to dispense with all such engagements  Your daughter loves    sir she loves with passion   but who the object of her affection   is  I cannot imagine  Let it be your part to discover what she so   industriously hides from the world   she will refuse nothing to the   authority  or rather to the tenderness  of such a parent      Here Mr  Golding left me  but returned in about an hour  His   whole frame seemed to labour with something extraordinary  You   were right  Harry  he cried   you were right in your conjectures     My prayers and my tears have at length prevailed   with difficulty   I have wrung the secret from her  O  my son   it is greatly in   your power to befriend us  Would you not do something for the   relief of a family who doat upon you as we do   would you not do   something for your old friend  who loves you as fondly as ever   father loved a child   Something for you  sir  said I  Yes
