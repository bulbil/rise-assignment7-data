torrent ran so violently against him  but sat down with his loss  and withdrew his opposition  though at bottom extremely mortified and incensed  Sir Everhard was unanimously elected  and appeared to be the happiest man upon earth  for  besides the pleasure arising from his victory over this competitor  he was now fully satisfied that his son  instead of disgracing  would do honour to his family  It would have moved a heart of stone  to see with what a tender transport of paternal joy he received his dear Launcelot  after having heard of his deportment and success at Ashenton  where  by the bye  he gave a ball to the ladies  and displayed as much elegance and politeness  as if he had been bred at the court of Versailles    This joyous season was of short duration  In a little time all the happiness of the family was overcast by a sad incident  which hath left such an unfortunate impression upon the mind of the young gentleman  as  I am afraid  will never be effaced  Mr  Darnel s niece and ward  the great heiress  whose name is Aurelia  was the most celebrated beauty of the whole country  if I said the whole kingdom  or indeed all Europe  perhaps I should barely do her justice  I don t pretend to be a limner  gemmen  nor does it become me to delineate such excellence  but surely I may presume to repeat from the play—       Oh  she is all that painting can express        Or youthful poets fancy when they love    At that time she might be about seventeen  tall and fair  and so exquisitely shaped—you may talk of your Venus de Medicis  your Dianas  your Nymphs  and Galateas  but if Praxiteles  and Roubilliac  and Wilton  were to lay their heads together  in order to make a complete pattern of beauty  they would hardly reach her model of perfection —As for complexion  poets will talk of blending the lily with the rose  and bring in a parcel of similes of cowslips  carnations  pinks  and daisies — There s Dolly  now  has got a very good complexion —Indeed  she s the very picture of health and innocence—you are  indeed  my pretty lass — but parva componere magnis —Miss Darnel is all amazing beauty  delicacy  and dignity  Then the softness and expression of her fine blue eyes  her pouting lips of coral hue  her neck  that rises like a tower of polished alabaster between two mounts of snow  I tell you what  gemmen  it don t signify talking  if e er a one of you was to meet this young lady alone  in the midst of a heath or common  or any unfrequented place  he would down on his knees  and think he kneeled before some supernatural being  I ll tell you more  she not only resembles an angel in beauty  but a saint in goodness  and an hermit in humility —so void of all pride and affectation  so soft  and sweet  and affable  and humane  Lord  I could tell such instances of her charity    Sure enough  she and Sir Launcelot were formed by nature for each other  Howsoever  the cruel hand of fortune hath intervened  and severed them for ever  Every soul that knew them both  said it was a thousand pities but they should come together  and extinguish  in their happy union  the mutual animosity of the two families  which had so often embroiled the whole neighbourhood  Nothing was heard but the praises of Miss Aurelia Darnel and Mr  Launcelot Greaves  and no doubt the parties were prepossessed  by this applause  in favour of each other  At length  Mr  Greaves went one Sunday to her parish church  but  though the greater part of the congregation watched their looks  they could not perceive that she took the least notice of him  or that he seemed to be struck with her appearance  He afterwards had an opportunity of seeing her  more at leisure  at the York assembly  during the races  but this opportunity was productive of no good effect  because he had that same day quarrelled with her uncle on the turf    An old grudge  you know  gemmen  is soon inflamed to a fresh rupture  It was thought Mr  Darnel came on purpose to show his resentment  They differed about a bet upon Miss Cleverlegs  and  in the course of the dispute  Mr  Darnel called him a petulant boy  The young squire  who was as hasty as gunpowder  told him he was man enough to chastise him for his insolence  and would do it on the spot  if he thought it would not interrupt the diversion  In all probability they would have come to points immediately  had not the gentlemen interposed  so that nothing further passed  but abundance of foul language on the part of Mr  Anthony  and a repeated defiance to single combat    Mr  Greaves  making a low bow  retired from the field  and in the evening danced at the assembly with a young lady from the bishoprick  seemingly in good temper and spirits
