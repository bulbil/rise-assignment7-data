there had been a convention of the whole family  the Urbino branch  as well as the General  being present  There the terms to be proposed to the supposed happy man were settled  but they were not to be mentioned to him  till after he had seen the Lady  A wrong policy  surely   He was then at Vienna  Signor Jeronymo  in his Letter  congratulated him in high terms  as a man  whom he had it now  at last  in his power to reward  And he hinted  in general  that the conditions would be such  as it was impossible but he must find his very   189 great advantage in them  As to fortune  to be sure  he meant   The friend so highly valued could not but be affected with the news  Yet  knowing the Lady  and the family  he was afraid that the articles of Residence and Religion would not be easily compromised between them  He therefore summoned up all his prudence to keep his fears alive  and his hope in suspense   He arrived at Bologna  He was permitted to pay his compliments to Lady Clementina in her mother s presence  How agreeable  how nobly frank  was the reception from both mother and daughter  How high ran the congratulations of Jeronymo  He called the supposed happy man brother  The Marquis was ready to recognize the fourth son in him  A great fortune  additional to an estate bequeathed her by her twograndfathers  was proposed  My father was to be invited over  to grace the nuptials by his presence   But let me cut short the rest  The terms could not be complied with  For I was to make a formal renunciation of my religion  and to settle in Italy  only once  in two or three years  was allowed  if I pleased  for two or three months  to go to England  and  as a visit of curiosity  once in her life  if their daughter desired it  to carry her thither  for a time to be limited by them   What must be my grief  to be obliged to disappoint such expectations as were raised by persons who had so sincere a value for me  You cannot  madam  imagine my distress  So little as could be expected to be allowed by them to the principles of a man whom they supposed to be in an error that would inevitably cast him into perdition  But when the friendly brothe implored my compliance  when the excellent mother  in effect  besought me to have pity on her heart  and on her child s head  and when the tender  the amiable Clementina  putting herself out of the question  urged me  for my soul s sake  to embrace the doctrines of her holy mother the church—What  madam—But how I grieve you     190  He stopt His handkerchief was of use to him  as mine was to me—What a distress was here    And what  and what  Sir  sobbing  was the result  Could you  could you resist   Satisfied in my own faith  Entirely satisfied  Having insuperable objections to that I was wished to embrace —A lover of my native country too—Were not my God and my Country to be the sacrifice  if I complied  But I laboured  I studied  for a compromise  I must have been unjust to Clementina s merit  and to my own Character  had she not been dear to me  And indeed I beheld graces in her then  that I had before resolved to shut my eyes against  her Rank next to princely  her Fortune high as her rank  Religion  Country  all so many obstacles that had appeared to me insuperable  removed by themselves  and no apprehension left of a breach of the laws of hospitality  which had  ti l now  made me struggle to behold one of the most amiable and noble minded of women with indifference —I offered to live one year in Italy  one in England  by turns  if their dear Clementina would live with me there  if not  I would content myself with passing only three months  in every year  in my native country  I proposed to leave her entirely at her liberty  in the article of religion  and  in case of children by the marriage  the daughters to be educated by her  the sons by me  a condition to which his Holiness himself  it was presumed  would not refuse his sanction  as there were precedents for it  This  madam  was a great sacrifice to Compassion  to Love —What could I more   And would not  Sir  would not Clementina consent to this compromise   Ah the unhappy Lady  It is this reflexion that strengthens my grief  She would have consented  She was earnest to procure the consent of her friends upon these terms  This her earnestness in my favour  devoted as she was to her religion  excites my compassion  and calls for my gratitude   What scenes  what distressful scenes  followed —   191 The noble father forgot his promised indulgence  the mother indeed seemed  in a manner  neutral  the youngest brother was still  however  firm
