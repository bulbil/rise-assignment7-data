upon our language  than at this very time when they were our masters   William now thought proper to deprive Bishops of all judgment in civil cases  which they had enjoyed during the whole Saxon succession  from their conversion to Christianity  He restrained the clergy to the exercise of their ecclesiastical power alone  He endeavoured to abolish trials by Ordeal and Camp Fight  The Ordeal trial  which had been a remainder of Pagan superstition  and still was held in veneration by the Saxons  was either by fire or water  It was used in criminal cases  where the suspicions were strong  but the proofs not evident  In that of fire  the person accused was brought into an open plain  and several ploughshares  heated red hot  were placed at equal intervals before him  over these he was to walk blindfold  and  if he escaped unhurt  he was acquitted of the charge  In the other trial of water  the accused was thrown into the water  if he sunk  he was declared innocent  but  if he swam  guilty   The trial of Camp Fight was another instance of the deplorable barbarity of the times  This was performed by single combat  in lists  appointed for that purpose  between the accuser and the   64 accused  he that  in such a case  came off victorious  was deemed innocent  and he who was conquered  if he survived his antagonist s resentment in the field  was sure to suffer  as a malefactor  some time after  Both these trials this King abolished as unchristian and unjust  and reduced all causes to the judgment of twelve men  of a rank nearly equal to that of the prisoner  This number was called a Jury  and this was a method of trial common to the Saxons and Normans long before  but confirmed by him with all the sanction of royalty   Having continued thirteen years in England  he now thought of re visiting his native dominions  but  no sooner was his back turned  when a new conspiracy was set on foot  This was more terrible  as it was carried on by the joint counsels of Normans as well as English  several Lords  of both nations  already possessed of opulence  were desirous of independence also  and pretended many grievances  or imagined themselves aggrieved  The Earl Walthof  who had been formerly pardoned for a like offence  entered secretly into a correspondence with Swayne  King of Denmark  and Drone  King of Ireland  Their measures were conceived with caution  and pursued with secrecy  but some delays  intervening  were fatal to counsels which were entrusted  necessarily  to many  the plot was discovered some days before the Danes arrived  the heads of the conspiracy were taken  and Fitz Auber  a noble Norman  and Walthof  were beheaded upon this occasion  Whether this act of rigour was executed by the King s command  sent over from Normandy  or by Odon  his brother  left behind  and naturally inclined to severity  is not apparent  However  these two   65 were the only noblemen executed in England during the reign of William the Conqueror  notwithstanding so many revolts on their side  and so much power in him to punish   Though good fortune seemed to attend this Monarch thus far on his reign  here the curtain may be drawn for the rest  His decline was marked with domestic quarrels  which could neither end in glory nor in gain  his endeavours were opposed by his own subjects  for whom he had laboured with such perseverance  He had four sons  Robert  Richard  William  and Henry  besides several daughters  The most poignant of his distresses must  therefore  come from that quarter  where he least expected an attack  and was least guarded to oppose  His eldest son  Robert  encouraged by the King of France  pretended a right to possess Normandy  even during the life of his father  William could place confidence in none but the English  to bring this unnatural son to his duty  and  drawing an army of Englishmen together  he passed over into Normandy  to put a stop to the progress of so unexpected an insurrection  It is remarkable enough  that the same commander  who formerly led over an army of Normans to conquer England  now returned with an army of English to subdue Normandy  To reduce his son  however  was found a much more difficult task than William had at first expected  Robert seemed to inherit  though not his father s virtues  at least his conduct and intrepidity  He led on his troops with courage  and laid his ambuscades with secrecy  In one of these  after he had killed part of a troop of English  and put the rest to flight  he boldly advanced against the main body  where William commanded in person  By   66 a strange fatality of circumstances  the father and son were opposed  without knowing each other  William was now grown old  and unable to perform those extraordinary feats  for which he was once so famous  The son charged with such fury  that his aged father fell to the ground with the blow  death would inevitably have been the consequence  and the son
