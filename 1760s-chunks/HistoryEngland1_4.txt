of the then known world  but  in England  separated  by its situation  from the continent  the reader may consider the whole narrative  with all its viciffitudes  in one point of view  it unites the philosopher s† definition of beauty  by being variously uniform   The materials for an history of our own country are therefore excellent  but I can direct to few who have improved them with a proper degree of assiduity or skill  The historians  who have treated of this subject  have in general written for a party  many with an open avowal of virulence and abuse  Some  who have had talents for this undertaking  were unable to afford themselves sufficient leisure to polish their work into the degree of requisite perfection  while others  who have laboured with sufficient assiduity  have been woefully deficient in point of sagacity  or proper skill in the choice of those facts they thought proper to relate  Whatever has been known  and not what was worth knowing  has been faithfully transcribed  so that the present accounts of the country resemble the ancient face of the soil  here an uncultivated forest  there a desolate wild  and  in a very few   10 places  a spot of earth adorned by art  and smiling with all the luxuriance of nature  To make history like the soil truly useful  the obstacles to improvement must be torn away  new assistances must be acquired from art  nor can the work be deemed properly finished  till the whole puts on simplicity  uniformity  and elegance  as the case is at present  we must read a library  to acquire a knowledge of English history  and  after all  be content to forget more than we remember   The history of England may be divided  properly enough  into three periods  with regard to their duration  indeed  very different  but almost of equal importance  The first is from the commencement of our knowledge of the country to its conquest by the Norman  the second  from the time of William the Conqueror to the alteration of the constitution  by the beheading King Charles I  the last contains the remaining period of English history  It will at once appear  that such a division is extremely unequal  the first department may be said to extend to a period of more than a thousand years  the second contains not less than seven hundred  while the remaining does not take up two  Chronologists  indeed  would divide it in a very different manner  however  I am rather inclined to this division  more by the peculiar use which may be made of each period  than the mere regularity of time  To consider the first part  with accuracy  belongs properly to the philosopher  the second is the business of him who would understand our constitution  and is the proper study of a legislator  and the last of such as would be acquainted with the connexions and relations in which we stand with regard to our neighbours of   11 the continent  and our foreign and domestic trade  namely to the merchant and politician   There is scarce any other passion  but that of curiosity  excited by a knowledge of the early part of our history  We may go through the account of that distant aera  with the same impartiality with which we consider the original inhabitants of any other country  as the customs of our British ancestors have no connexion with our own  But then  to some minds  it must be a pleasing disquisition to observe the human animal  by degrees  divesting himself of his native ferocity  and acquiring the arts of happiness and peace  to trace the steps  by which he leaves his precarious meal  acquired by the chace  for a more certain  but a more laborious  repast  acquired by cultivation   After the conquest  the rude outlines of our present constitution began to be formed  Before the Norman invasion  there might be some customs resembling those at present in practice  but the only reason of their continuance was  because they had before been practised in common among the invaders  At this period  therefore  an Englishman becomes interested in the narrative  he perceives the rise and the reasons for several laws  which now serve to restrain his own conduct  or preserve his property  The rights of our monarchs  the claims of foreign potentates  the ineffectual struggles for liberty  and the gradual incroachments of ambition  should highly interest him  as he in some measure owes to these transactions the happiness he enjoys   But the last period is what is chiefly incumbent upon almost every man to be particularly conversant   12 in  Every person  residing here  has a share in the liberties of this kingdom  and the generality of the people are ultimately invested with the legislation  It is therefore each man s duty to know that constitution  which  by his birth right  he is called to govern  a freeholder  in a free kingdom  should certainly be instructed in the original of that agreement  by which he holds so precious a tenure   These are motives that equally influence almost every rank of people  but how much more forcibly should they operate upon you  whose honours  whose trusts  and possessions
