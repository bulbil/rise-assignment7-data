 he encouraged a play of wit  was fond of good stories and lively repartees  On this hint I formed myself  Every morning I wrote down in my pocket book such anecdotes as I meant to rack off in the course of the day  My stock was considerably extensive  so that I was a walking budget of balderdash  Yet even my estate in nonsense required economy  and I began to get out at elbows  so as to be reduced to borrow from myself  and mortgage my resources twenty times over  but when the shallow current of wit and wisdom was nearly at its summer drought  a torrent of matter of fact lies gave new force to the exhausted stream of quibble  Intrigues which never had been intrigued  and practical jokes which had never been played off were the tools I worked with  and exactly to the level of the grand duke  nay  what often happens to dull dealers in inextinguishable vivacity  the mornings were spent in finaciering those hinds of conversation  which were to be drawn upon after dinner  as if from a perennial spring of preternatural wealth   I had even the impudence to set up for a poet  and made my broken winded muse trot to the praises of the prince  I allow candidly that the verses were execrable  but then they were quite good enough for their readers  and it remains a doubt whether  if they had been better  the grand duke would not have thrown them into the fire  They seemed to be just what he would have written upon himself  In short  it was impossible to miss the proper style on such a subject But whatever might be my merit as a poet  the prince  by little and little  took such a liking to my person  as gave occasion of jealousy to his courtiers  They tried to find out who I was  This  however  was beyond their compass  All they could learn was  that I had been a renegado  This was whispered forthwith in the prince s ear  in the hopes of hurting me  Not that it succeeded  on the contrary  the grand duke one day commanded me to give him a faithful account of my adventures at Algiers  I obeyed  and the recital  without reserve on my part  contributed more than any other of my stories to his entertainment  Don Raphael  said he  after I had ended my narrative  I have a real regard for you  and mean to give you a proof of it  which will place my sincerity beyond a doubt Henceforth you are admitted into my most private confidence  as the first fruits of which  you are to know that one of my ministers has a wife  with whom I am in love  She is the most enchanting creature at court  but at the same time the most impregnable  Shut up in her own household  exclusively attached to a husband who idolizes her  she seems to be ignorant of the combustion her charms have kindled in Florence  You will easily conceive the difficulty of such a conquest And yet this epitome of loveliness  so deaf to all the whispers of common seduction  has sometimes listened to my sighs  I have found the means of speaking to her without witnesses  She is not unacquainted with my sentiments  I do not flatter myself with having warmed her into love  she has given me no reason to form so sweet a conjecture  Yet I will not despair of pleasing her by my constancy  and by the cautious conduct  even to mystery  which I take care to observe   My passion for this lady  continued he  is known only to herself  Instead of pursuing my game wantonly  and overleaping the rights of my subjects like a true sovereign  I conceal from all the world the knowledge of my love  This delicacy seems due to Mascarini  the husband of my beloved mistress  His zeal and attachment to me  his services and honesty  oblige me to act in this business with the closest secrecy and circumspection  I will not plunge a dagger into the bosom of this ill starred husband  by declaring myself a suitor to his wife  Would he might for ever be insensible  were it within possibility  to the secret flame which devours me  for I am persuaded that he would die of grief  were he to know the circumstances I have just now confided to you  I therefore veil my pursuit in impenetrable darkness  and have determined to make use of you  for the purpose of conveying to Lucretia the merit of the sacrifices my delicacy imposes on my feelings  Of these you shall be the interpreter  I doubt not but you will acquit yourself to a marvel of your commission  Contrive to be intimate with Mascarini  make a point of worming yourself into his friendship  Then an introduction to his family will be easy  and you will secure to yourself the liberty of conversing freely with his wife  This is what I require from you  and what I feel assured that you will execute with all the dexterity and discretion necessary to so delicate an undertaking   I promised the grand duke to do my utmost  in furtherance of his good opinion  and in aid of his success with the object of his desires  I kept my
