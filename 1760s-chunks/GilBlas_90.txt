 as if they did him a favour by making him their laughing stock  In short  he served them for a butt while they sat at table  which they did not quit during the afternoon  nor till late at night  We  as well as our masters  drank as we liked  so that the servants  hall and the dining room were in equally high order when we took our leave of the young jeweller       CH  V     Gil Blas becomes the darling of the fair sex  and makes an interesting acquaintance   AFTER some hours  sleep I got up in fine spirits  and calling the advice of Melendez to mind  went  till my master was stirring  to pay my court to our steward  whose vanity was rather flattered by this attention  He received me with a gracious air  and inquired how I was reconciled to the habits and manners of the young nobility  I answered  that they were strange to me as yet  but that use and good example might work wonders in the end   Use and good example did work wonders  and that right soon  My temper and conduct were quite altered  From a discreet  sober lad  I got to be a lively  heedless merry andrew  Don Antonio s servant paid me a compliment on my transformation  and told me that there wanted nothing but a tender interest in the lovely part of the creation to shine like a new star dropped from the heavens  He pointed out to me that it was an indispensable requisite in the character of a pretty fellow  that all our set were well with some fine woman or other  and that he himself  to his own share  engrossed the favours of two beauties in high life  I was of opinion that the rascal lied  Master Mogicon  said I  you are doubtless a very dapper  lively little fellow  with a modest assurance  but still I do not comprehend how women of quality  not having your sweet person on their own private establishments  should run the risk of being detected in an intrigue with a footman out of doors  Oh  as for that  answered he  they do not know my condition  To my master s wardrobe  and even to his name  am I indebted for these conquests  I will tell you how it is  I dress myself up as a young nobleman  and assume the manners of one  I go to public places  and tip the wink first to one woman and then to another  till I meet with one who returns the signal  Her I follow  and find means to speak with her  I take the name of Don Antonio Centell√©s  I plead for an assignation  the lady is squeamish about it  I am pressing  she is kind  et caetera  Thus it is  my fine fellow  that I contrive to carry on my intrigues  and I would have you profit by the hint   I was too ambitious of shining like a new star dropped from the heavens  to turn a deaf ear to such counsel  besides  there was about me no aversion to an amour  I therefore laid a plan to disguise myself as a young nobleman  and look out for adventures of gallantry  There was a risk in assuming my masquerade dress at home  lest it might be observed  I took a complete suit from my master s wardrobe  and made it up into a bundle  which I carried to a barber s  where I thought I could dress and undress conveniently  There I tricked myself out to the best advantage  The barber too lent a helping hand to my attire  When we thought it adjusted to a nicety  I sauntered towards Saint Jerome s meadow  whence I felt morally certain that I should not return without making an impression  But I could not even get thither  without a proof of my own attractions   As I was crossing a bye street  a lady of genteel figure  elegantly dressed  came out of a small house  and got into an hired carriage standing at the door  I stopped short to look at her  and bowed significantly  so as to convey an intimation that my heart was not insensible  On her part  to show me that her face was not less lovely than her person  she lifted up her veil for a moment  In the mean time the coach set off  and I stood stock still in the street  not a little stiffened at this vision  A vastly pretty woman  said I to myself  bless us  this is just what is wanting to make me perfectly accomplished  If the two ladies who share Mogicon between them are equally handsome  the scoundrel is in luck  I should be delighted with her for a mistress  Ruminating on these things  I looked by chance towards the house whence that lovely creature had glided  and saw at a window on the ground floor an old woman beckoning me to come in   I flew like lightning into the house  and found  in a very neat parlour  this venerable and wary matron  who  taking me for a marquis at least  dropped a low curtsey  and said
