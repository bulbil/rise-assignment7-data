 I dare say  your good Nature and Generosity would be shocked  therefore I shall be silent —let it suffice to tell you  I have suffered dearly for my Indiscretion  and   as to mention is to suffer Pain   I shall continue this Subject no farther  If you are curious  Tom can give you all the Particulars  who has behaved  with great good Nature  in the Affair  and I would not have mentioned it at all to you  if I did not suspect that he would do it himself  tho  I had his Promise he would not   My Aunt is still ignorant of your having been in Town  But  I fear  will not long be so    97 as there wants only this  to compleat the Affair  But this and all other Ills vanish  when I compare them to the Loss of your Life  which I had Reason so lately to apprehend  or to the Loss of your Love  which I live in constant Apprehension of  You desire me to write often  to amuse you  but my Letters are a slight Return for the Pleasure of yours  tho  Sappho says    The less my Sense  the more my Love appears     Which  by the Way  is no great Compliment to that Passion  at least  this is not such a Passion as you are capable of inspiring  However  I have often doubted of your own Tenderness  from the Opinion I have of your Understanding  and have sometimes asked myself    From whence do all his soft Expressions come   Sure not from Love  for that  they say  is dumb   But such a Passion may I never prove   Give me a speaking and a writing Love   A Man that does with Eloquence persuade   And justifies the Fondness of a Maid     Adieu   P  S  Upon Recollection  I beg that  if Tom has not mentioned the Affair to you  you will not write to him about it  and you shall hear it   98 all from me  when we meet  I have a Reason for this  which did not occur to me  when I gave you Leave to ask him   I sent off the Things  you desired me to buy  by —  I hope you got them safe  and approved my Choice and Bargains   LETTER LVII   My dear FANNY   LAST Post I received yours  in Answer to mine  from —  and I assure you  the Hints you gave me of some Uneasiness you suffer at present  lay me under the same Circumstances  and more so  because I cannot guess  what it is which affects you  Tom not having mentioned a single Word of it to me  as you apprehended  and has so far proved himself a better Confidant to you  than a Friend to me  Now  I must insist upon it  that you will give me a full Account of this Matter in your next Letter  and not keep me any longer in Suspence  on that Condition  and no other  I will not inquire about it from Tom  nor shall I ever mention a Circumstance relating to it  to any Person living  if there be any Thing in the Story  which requires being kept secret  As to my State of Health  which you are so kind to   99 be anxious about  I am  I think  growing better every Day  tho  but slowly  I am however pronounced by the Physicians to be out of Danger  and am resolved never to fall again  except at your Feet  I have discharged my Doctors  and Time shall be the only Physician I will make Us of  for the future  to perfect my Cure  for  as he comes generally unsent for  I may spare my Fees  of which I happen to have less  at present  than even of Health  Time has this in common with most Physicians  that  tho  he fails to cure his Patients  he can give them an Opiate  which quiets them   till the Day of Judgment  and how it may fare with us then  Time only can shew   The Things you bought for me  are not come to Hand yet  which happens to be very inconvenient to me  Your Neglect of sending them by Mr  — was the Occasion of this Mishap  and  the Moral of the Tale I sing   that ill Luck must attend every Thing you do contrary to my Advice  which brings me back to my first Subject  and may give you a sufficient Hint  not to delay informing me fully of what you allude to in your former Letter  which that you may the sooner apply yourself to the Discharge of  I shall trespass no longer on your Leisure  but conclude  what I shall never otherwise conclude  except with Life   Your sincere and affectionate Lover  and your Friend     100  LETTER LVIII   Dear HARRY   LAST Post brought me the pleasing Account of your Recovery  surely some Sylph  whose Charge I am  contrived that it should then arrive
