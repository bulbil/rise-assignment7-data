owing the useful improvement of tapping in th  139 dropsy  at once by means of a swathe  But  of all the other arts  poetry in this age was carried to the greatest perfection  The language  for some ages  had been improving  but now it seemed entirely divested of its roughness and barbarity  Among the poets of this period we may place John Philips  author of several poems  but of none more admired than that humourous one  intitled  The splendid Shilling  he lived in obscurity  and died just above want  William Congreve deserves also particular notice  his comedies  some of which were but cooly received upon their first appearance  seemed to mend upon repetition  and he is  at present  justly allowed the foremost in that species of dramatic poesy  His wit is ever just and brilliant  his sentiments new and lively  and his elegance equal to his regularity  Next him Vanburgh is placed  whose humour seems more natural  and characters more new  but he owes too many obligations to the French  entirely to pass for an original  and his total disregard to decency  in a great measure  impairs his merit  Farquhar is still more lively  and  perhaps  more entertaining than either  his pieces still continue the favourite performances of the stage  and bear frequent repetition without satiety  but he often mistakes pertness for wit  and seldom strikes his characters with proper force or originality  However  he died very young  and it is remarkable  that he continued to improve as he grew older  his last play  intitled The Beau Stratagem  being the best of his productions  Addison  both as a poet and prose writer  deserves he highest regard and imitation  His Campaign  and Letter to Lord Halifax from Italy  are masterpieces in the former  and his Essays published in the Spectator are inimitable specimens of the latter  Whatever he treated of was handled with elegance nd precision  and that virtue which was taught in is writings  was enforced by his example  Steele   140 was Addison s friend and admirer  his comedies ar perfectly polite  chaste  and genteel  nor were hi other works contemptible  he wrote on severa subjects  and yet it is amazing  in the multiplicity of his pursuits  how he found leisure fo the discussion of any  Ever persecuted by creditors  whom his profuseness drew upon him  or pur¦suing impracticable schemes  suggested by ill grounded ambition  Dean Swift was the professed antagonist of both Addison and him  He perceived that there was a spirit of romance mixed with all the works of the poets who preceded him  or  in other words  that they had drawn nature on the most pleasing side  There still therefore was a place left for him  who  careless of censure  should describe it just as it was  with all its deformities  he therefore owes much of his fame  not so much to the greatness of his genius  as to the boldness of it  He was dry  sarcastic  and severe  and suited his style exactly to the turn of his thought  being concise and nervous  In this period also flourished many of subordinate fame  Prior was the first who adopted the French elegant easy manner of telling a story  but if what he has borrowed from that nation be taken from him  scarce any thing will be left upon which he can lay claim to applause in poetry  Rowe was only outdone by Shakespear and Otway as a tragic writer  he has fewer absurdities than either  and is  perhaps  as pathetic as they  but his flights are not so bold  nor his characters so strongly marked  Perhaps his coming later than the rest may have contributed to lessen the esteem he deserves  Garth had success as a poet  and  for a time  his fame was even greater than his desert  In his principal work  the Dispensary  his versification is negligent  and his plot is now become tedious  but whatever he may lose as a poet  t would be improper to rob him of the merit he deserves for having written the prose dedication  and   141 preface  to the poem already mentioned  in which he has shewn the truest wit  with the most refined elegance  Parnel  though he has written but one poem  namely  the Hermit  yet has found a place among the English first rate poets  Gay  likewise  by his Fables and Pastorals  has acquired an equal reputation  But of all who have added to the stock of English poetry  Pope  perhaps  deserves the first place  On him foreigners look as one of the most successful writers of his time  his versification is the most harmonious  and his correctness the most remarkable of all our poets  A noted cotemporary of his own  calls the English the finest writers on moral topics  and Pope the noblest moral writer of all the English  Mr  Pope has somewhere named himself the last English Muse  and  indeed  since his time  we have seen scarce any production that can justly lay claim to immortality  he carried the language to its highest perfection  and those who have attempted still farther to improve it  instead of ornament  have only
