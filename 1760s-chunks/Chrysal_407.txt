Nothing ever was so highly worked up  It gave me   ineffable pleasure          If you can prove this to be wrote by that person    said the other    spitting and wriggling in his chair  after having poured over it for   some time   your fortune is made  You know his enemies are striv    ing to run him down by any means  Now  this will give them so   plausible a handle against him  that they will not fail to reward you   liberally for the discovery  All you have to do is to prove it   plainly upon him          I am pretty sure that may be done   answered my master  with   some hesitation    but I â€” I â€” I â€”  I hardly know how  I am under    personal obligation          Nay  if you let such things as that interfere  I give you up  What   signifies past obligation  when put in competition  with present       The proof sheet of a  of the Essay on Woman  which Kidgell   obtained for the ministers  Sandwich and Dashwood  Lord Le De    spenser   through the mediation of the Earl of March  Eventually  he   got hold of the remainder  see p  492        Wilkes  The Essay was an obscene burlesque of Pope s Essay on   Man  and was equipped  with notes ascribed to Bishop Warburton    Thomes Potter seems to have been the author  Wilkes was charged   with printing and publishing it  although only thirteen copies were   struck ofi for private circulation          492 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     interest   You know what my old antagonist says  that it is a rule   among his former fraternity never to let any social or moral duties   interfere with religion  of which he gives a remarkable instance in   his own story  Now  my interest is my religion  and everything   which interferes with that I abjure  as I have sufficiently proved    But I beg pardon  I would by no means press you to do anything   against your conscience  if it is so tender          Wrong me not  my dearest friend  by such an opinion   my con    science is as far from being tender as yours can be  I was only   surprised that I had not myself seen what you mentioned  But   now that your friendship has pointed it out to me  you shall see   me pursue it as eagerly as you can desire  All I want is your   â  direction  Leave the rest to me        The remainder of the evening was spent in consultation upon   the plan proper to be pursued  the former of which my master sub    mitted implicitly to the superior judgment and experience of his   friend  who was so pleased with this mark of his respect  and so   sure of success  that on going away he took a modest hint and lent   him five guineas  reminding him at the same time of the confidence   he had placed in his honour  by disclosing his affairs to him  and   â  enjoining him to secrecy            CHAPTER LVII     â  cheysal s mastbb ptjesttes his scheme  and violates moral   honesty to serve the caitsb oe virtue and religion â€” he   waits upon his patron  who honestly refuses a character   to which he knows he has no right   but undertakes the   aefair from a more prevailing motive  in which he is   bbjlarkably assisted by another person op less modesty    who pleads the cause op religion and virtue in vain  till   honour at length turns the scale in their favour â€”     CHRYSAL s MASTER IS DISAPPOINTED IN HIS HOPES  AND MAKES USB   OF AN EXPEDIENT IN CHARACTER  TO ESCAPE FROM THE JUST   REWARD OF ALL HIS LABOURS â€” CHRYSAL CHANGES HIS SERVICE     Not to lose a moment s time  in a matter of such importance  my   master went next morning to his worthy friend the printer  to   whom he opened his scheme  and by his influence  â  B ith the assistance   of the bribe  and promises of much more  he prevailed on the fellow   from whom the former paper was got  to betray the trust of hia   employer  and steal the whole ballad  The next thing was to make       The Essay on Woman had been privately printed  and however   reprehensible the work was  the fact of non publication made the pro    ceedings against Wilkes on the score of it a gross injustice
