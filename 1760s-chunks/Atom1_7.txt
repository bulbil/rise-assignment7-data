non Latin alphabet 〉pruritus  That great naturalist would have imputed it to a redundancy of cholicky salts  got out of the stomach and guts into the blood  and thrown upon these parts  and he would have attempted to break their colluctations with oil   c  but I  who know the real causes of this disorder  smile at these whims of philosophy   Be that as it may  certain it is  all the most eminent physicians in Japan were consulted about this strange tickling and tingling  and among these the celebrated Fan sey  whose spirit afterwards informed the body of Rabelais  This experienced leech  having prescribed a course of cathartics  balsamics  and sweeteners  on the supposition that the blood was    33 tainted with a scorbutical itch  at length found reason to believe that the disease was local  He therefore tried the method of gentle friction  for which purpose he used almost the very same substances which were many centuries after applied by Gargantua to his own posteriors  such as a night cap  a pillow bier  a slipper  a poke  a pannier  a beaver  a hen  a cock  a chicken  a calf skin  a hare skin  a pigeon  a cormorant  a lawyer s bag  a lamprey  a coif  a lure  nay even a goose s neck  without finding that volupté merifique au trou de cul  which was the portion of the son of Grangousier  In short  there was nothing that gave Fika kaka such respite from this tormenting titillation as did smearing the parts with thick cream  which was afterwards licked up by the rough tongue of a boarcat  But the administration of this remedy was once productive of a disagreeable incident  In the mean    34 time  the distemper gaining ground became so troublesome  that the unfortunate Quanbuku was incessantly in the fidgets  and ran about distracted  cackling like a hen in labour   The source of all this misfortune was the juxta position of two atoms quarrelling for precedency  in this the Cuboy s seat of honour  Their pressing and squeezing and elbowing and jostling  tho  of no effect in discomposing one another  occasioned all this irritation and titillation in the posteriors of Fika kaka—What  dost thou mutter  Peacock  dost thou presume to question my veracity  now by the indivisible rotundity of an atom  I have a good mind  caitiff  to raise such a buzzing commotion in thy glandula pinealis  that thou shalt run distracted over the face of the earth  like Io when she was stung by Juno s gadfly  What  thou who hast been wrapt from the cradle in visions of mystery and revelation  swallowed    35 impossibilities like lamb s wool  and digested doctrines harder than iron three times quenched in the Ebro  thou to demur at what I assert upon the evidence and faith of my own consciousness and consistency —Oh  you capitulate  well  then beware of a relapse—you know a relapsed heretic finds no mercy   I say  while Fika kaka s podex was the scene of contention between two turbulent atoms  I had the honour to be posted immediately under the nail of the Dairo s great toe  which happened one day to itch more than usual for occupation  The Cuboy presenting himself at that instant  and turning his face from his master  Got hama baba performed the exercise with such uncommon vehemence  that first his slipper  and then his toe nail flew off  after having made a small breach in the perineum of Fika kaka  By the same effort  I was divorced from the great    36 toe of the sovereign  and lodged near the great gut of his minister  exactly in the interstice between the two hostile particles  which were thus in some measure restrained from wrangling  though it was not in my power to keep the peace entirely  Nevertheless  Fika kaka s torture was immediately suspended  and he was even seized with an orgasm of pleasure  analogous to that which characterises the extacy of love   Think not  however  Peacock  that I would adduce this circumstance as a proof that pleasure and pain are meer relations  which can exist only as they are contrasted  No  pleasure and pain are simple  independent ideas  incapable of definition  and this which Fika kaka felt was an extacy compounded of positive pleasure ingrasted upon the removal of pain  but whether this positive pleasure depended upon a particular center of percussion hit    37 upon by accident  or was the inseparable effect of a kicking and scratching conferred by a royal foot and toe  I shall not at present unfold  neither will I demonstrate the modus operandi on the nervous papillae of Fika kaka s breech  whether by irritation  relaxation  undulation  or vibration  Were these essential discoveries communicated  human philosophy would become too arrogant  It was but the other day that Newton made shift to dive into some subaltern laws of matter  to explain the revolution of the planets  and analyse the composition of light  and ever since  that reptile man has believed itself a demi god—I hope to see the day when the petulant philosopher shall be driven back to his Categories and the Organum Universale of Aristotle  his 〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉  his 〈 in non
