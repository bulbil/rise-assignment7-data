of his city friends  in order to conduct his daughter home    On their arrival I was deeply engaged in the counting house  and   it was near the time for supper before I could attend  As I en    tered  Mr  Golding presented me to his daughter  saying This    my dear  is Mr  Clinton  my partner  my friend  my son  and your   brother  Hereupon Miss Golding coloured  and drawing back as I   approached to salute her If I am not mistaken  sir  said she  he   is something more to us than all you have mentioned  it would   ill become me to forget that he is the deliverer of your daughter    Your deliverer  my dear Matty  how  where  when  Why    pray  papa  did Mr  Clinton never tell you of his adventure at   Barnet  No  indeed  my  fcai  It is not every one who would be   silent where so much was  to be said to their own honour  I remem    ber that your knights in romance  when too modest to boast of their   own achievements  used to permit some friend or squire to deliver   down to posterity the history of their adventures  and I take the   liberty to be squire to Mr  Clinton on the like occasion      Here Miss Golding began to give a narrative of the matter   already recited  but in terms of high praise and aggravated en    comium  While all abashed and confused  I withdrew  saying  that   I did not remember to have heard of any knights who stayed to   hear their own story      In truth  I was much surprised to hear Miss Golding mention   the adventure of Bamet  for I did not recollect that I had ever   seen her  and had taken much more note of two or three other   misses than I had of her      Being re summoned to supper  Mr  Golding met me as I entered    and clasping me in his arms Oh  my Harry  he cried  how won    derfully gracious has God been to me  in sending my best friend to   the rescue of my only child   in sending  at so critical and very   fearful a conjuncture  perhaps the only person who had either   gallantry or humanity enough to preserve her  Indeed  sir  I   replied  you owe me nothing   I did not even know that the lady   was your daughter   and I could not pride myself  in any degree    on an action which I thought incumbent on every man to perform      During supper  Miss Golding was very cheerful and agreeable  Her   face  indeed  could not be numbered among the beauties   but her   person was grace and majesty  though in miniature   her conversa          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  185     tion was pleasing   and when she sung  or touched her instruments    for she was mistress of several  her mien and motions were music    each note seemed a sentiment  and we felt her fingers playing on   the cordage of our hearts      For the first three months after Miss Golding s arrival  all was   crowding and gaiety  assembly and festival  at our house  She was   as a magnet  that drew and grouped all the peerage and gentry of   England together  But  as business happened to be very urgent   at this season  I was not at liberty to partake of their amusements    and I resigned to Mr  Golding the commission which he had given   me respecting the parties who declared themselves suitors      As those suitors  in a daily and numerous succession  applied to   Mr  Golding for his consent  his general answer was  that his good    liking was inseparable from that of his only child   that he would    if they pleased  consult her on the occasion  and faithfully report   to them her approbation or dissent  In the like conclusive manner    when Mr  Golding repeatedly questioned his daughter  she would   take his hand between hers  and kissing it  say Oh no   my dear   papa  this is not the man      One day  as I sat alone in the counting house  Miss Golding en    tered and presented me with an order from her father for 250    And pray  madam  said I  why this ceremony  this matter of form     Sure Miss Golding may at any time command twenty times this   sum without any order save her own intimation  Indeed   are you   serious  Mr  Clinton   I
