 and procured the Earl of Lenox  brother to the late regent  to be elected in his room  In the mean time  while she was employed in bringing Scotland to measures  she found herself attacked  in her own dominions  by a conspiracy  the Pope  in order to assist the rebels  procured a bull to be fixed up in several places in London  whereby he excommunicated Elizabeth  and absolved her subjects from their oath of allegiance  This bull was fixed up by John Felton  grand uncle to him whom we are shortly to see act another desperate part  John Felton  when he was told that the government was in pursuit of him  disdained to fly  he waited with intrepidity till he was taken  and then boldly confessed the fact of which he was charged  and gloried in the commission  he might have received pardon upon acknowledging his crime  but he refused it  and was hanged near the place  meeting death with a resolution that astonished even the brave  What noble actions might not such a mind   288 have been capable of  had it at first received a right direction   These efforts  in favour of the Queen of Scots  only served to hasten her ruin  The two Queens entered into various negotiations and frivolous treaties  the one attempting to humble her prisoner  the other  with fruitless pride  attempting to preserve the lustre of fallen Majesty  Scotland  in the mean time  streamed with blood  the Papists and the Protestants carried on a civil war  The Archbishop of St  Andrew s  one of the warmest partizans of Mary  was taken in arms  and executed upon the deposition of his confessor  who swore that this prelate had privately confessed that he was an accomplice in the murder of Darnly   The greatest misfortunes of Mary rather proceeded from her friends than enemies  The Duke of Norfolk  who professed a friendship for her  expected  by her means  to rise to the British throne  he  therefore  privately negotiated a marriage with her  and she  on the other hand  attempted to break off that which she had already contracted with Bothwell  He formed a party in London  feeble indeed  but he expected assistance from the intrigues of the Pope  and the arms of Spain  he was himself a weak man  and his plots were but shallow  the spies of Elizabeth discovered them all  he was arrested  accused  condemned  and executed  This nobleman s blood only contributed to fasten the chains of the unfortunate Mary  yet  still  she conceived hopes from foreign assiances  which seldom are of any weight in domestic disputes  She had the League in France in her favour  the Pope  the Spaniards  and the Jesuits  she not only hoped to be reinstated in her   289 former power  but to have the crown of England  to which she laid claim as her birth right  added to her own  In pursuance of these designs  a new conspiracy was formed  fourteen of the conspirators executed  and  last of all  Mary was brought to a trial  before a Queen who had no other right to be her judge  but that of power  Forty two members of parliament  and five judges  were sent to examine her in prison  she protested against their right  yet made a defence  they had originally no foundation in justice to try her  and they carried on her accusation with only a shew of equity  In short  after an imprisonment of eighteen years  this unhappy Princess was brought to the block  and beheaded in one of the rooms of her prison  which had been hung in black for the occasion  This action stained the reign of Elizabeth with such colours  as neither her dissimulation  nor the prosperity of her reign  could ever wash away  her subjects  while they found themselves happy  attempted to excuse her conduct  but conscience internally condemned her cruelty  and time  that speaks plain  at last declares her guilt  In treating the actions of mankind  we almost ever find both sides culpable  and so it was here  Mary  who was a murderer and adulteress  died by the orders of Elizabeth  who was at once cruel and unjust   I am   c   LETTER XXXVI   THE constitution of England took a long series of years to settle into form  nor even yet was its structure entirely completed  the 〈◊〉 still preserved a degree of ancient pride    290 and often were guilty of injustice and tyranny  without punishment  Had the actions of Elizabeth  which are now the subject of our praise  only been performed by one of our present Monarchs  they would be sufficient to cause his expulsion  there is something lucky in every great reign  like this in view  its lustre is rather owing to the indifferent periods that preceded it  than to its own intrinsic value  Elizabeth left her kingdom  it must be owned  in a better state than she found it  but her actions should be neither the subject of our praise  nor the object of our imitation   We see a mixture of cruelty and gallantry in all the transactions of these times  while Elizabeth
