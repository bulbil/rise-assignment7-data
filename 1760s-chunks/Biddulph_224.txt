  Your estate  said I  is unsettled  and if you were to die abroad in the predicament in which you now stand  what is to become of your son     I have already done for my son  said he  all that I thought in justice was in my power to do  I have long ago settled my personal fortune on him  that in case my next heirs should on account of the illegitimacy of his birth  claim the family estate  he may have a handsome support without it   And indeed I never wished to debar my lawful heirs in favour of this child  though I love him tenderly  and they are worthless people  whom I despise  and with whom I never had any intercourse   I replied  if that were so  as the manner of the child’s birth was a secret  I wished he might  undisturbed  inherit his father’s fortune  when he should come to pay the last debt to nature   He answered  where such a vast property was at stake  there would not be people wanting whose interest would engage them to discover the secret  and he doubted not but the irregularity of his wife’s conduct  had already occasioned enquiries to be made   Supposing  said I  you had had another son by Mrs Faulkland since your marriage—as you could have no objection to the bequeathing your fortune to him  would it not have appeared strange in the eyes of the world that you should disinherit your eldest son   It might have appeared so  said he  but I certainly should have done it  and for that reason  as I have no child but him  I have made such a disposition of my fortune as I now tell you  If I live  I may increase my son’s patrimony  if not  he must be contented with that which I have bequeathed to him  and let my kindred scramble for the rest   We staid together till it was late  he discoursed on a variety of subjects  but mentioned not my sister’s name during the whole time   I thought I left him well  and his mind tolerably composed  We were to set out on our return in six days  but an account was brought to me in the morning  that Mr Faulkland was found dead in his bed   There were no symptoms discovered on the body that could let us into the occasion of his death  but as my own fears suggested too much  I chose not to be particular in my enquiries  Wishing rather that his fatal story should be buried in silence   Mr Warner found that his affairs were likely to delay him longer than the time proposed  and as I had nothing farther to detain me in Holland  I set out the day after my unfortunate friend’s death  leaving to Mr Warner  the care of conveying his remains to England  agreeably to the desire he had expressed  which I now considered as his last injunction laid on me     Thus  proceeded Sir George  by a series of fatal events  each of which was occasioned by motives in themselves laudable  has one of the bravest and most noble minded men on earth been cut off in the prime of his youth—O  Faulkland  why did you suffer that gallant spirit to be vanquished — Sir George’s emotion stopped his farther speech  I was too much affected to say any thing to him  but took a hasty leave of Lady Sarah  in order to go to Mrs Arnold   As soon as I entered my friend’s room Cecilia  said she  if your countenance be as faithful an interpreter of your mind as it used to be  you have some thing disastrous to relate  you may say anything  misfortune and I have been so familiar  I shall not shrink as its approach   Sir George is returned  I replied  you will see him to day   Is he come alone  she asked  Alone  I replied  You but repeat my words  Cecilia  without adding any thing from yourself  Shall I interpret the meaning of that mournful echo  Mr Faulkland no longer lives   I was silent—Oh I knew him too well  said she  raising her voice with energy  to think he would survive this last blow   His death was natural  said I  for any thing that appears to the contrary  God be praised for that  cried Mrs Arnold  If so  I am satisfied that he is at peace   She then enquired after Mr Warner  and her brother  without making any farther mention of Mr Faulkland   Whilst we were in discourse  Master Faulkland ran into the room  He had been at play with the two little Miss Arnolds  who were in pursuit of him  And he flew to Mrs Arnold to hide him  She folded him tenderly in her arms  then turning to me  Look at this boy  said she  he is the perfect image of his father   When am I to go to my papa  cried the child  as he hung round her neck  This innocent unexpected demand quite vanquished Mrs Arnold’s fortitude  She set him down without being able to answer his question  then said  Excuse
