cause of virtue and honour         Madam  I have no more time to trifle in this manner   therefore    once more I desire you to let me know yovir final determination     for notwithstanding this behaviour  I still have such a regard for   you  that I am unwilling to take an answer which must separate us   for ever  Think then  before you speak   and let my making you   this generous offer  and preventing your exposing yourself in vain    teach you a proper return of gratitude          I want not a moment to determine between virtue and vice   â€” infamy and honour          Then take the consequence   and blame yourself when it is   too late          I will  if any blame falls on me  And now that I see you are   serious  in return for the notice you have so generously given me    I let you know that I have obviated the advantage you flatter   yourself you have over me  by conforming legally to your religion    before I was married to you          Confiasion   what is that you say   When  where did you   conform           When I went to the wedding of my cousin  as you will find upon   inquiry  which I advise you to make  before you proceed furflier   in a scheme that can only expose you to worse infamy than that   with which you threatened me          Infernal witch   Was this your love           No   it was the prudence of my friends  My love could harbour   no doubt of you  but they knew you better   and took this honest    wise precaution  to guard against villany  which I now am sensible   they foresaw   and  therefore  as you have thought proper to refer   me to the law  I now tell you that I will immediately claim   its protection  and declare my marriage   nor suffer any longer   in the opinion of the world by a secrecy that was enjoined   for 30 base a purpose   by which I shall have at least the satis    faction of saving another woman from falling into tlie snare laid   for her          Saying this  she flung out of the room  to conceal tears which         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 515     Bhe thought would betray a weakness unworthy of her  and could   no longer restrain      The nature of my master a meditations on this discovery may   be easily conceived  He cursed that foolish fondness which had   thus led him blindfold into his own snare   and damned all woman    kind in revenge for being foiled at his own weapons by one of the sex      When he had vented his rage in this manner for some time  a   sudden gleam of hope flattered him  that what she said might   possibly have been only the instantaneous suggestion of resentment   and despair  without being really true  Pleased with the thought    he sent directly to make the proper inquiry  the result of   which confirmed the defeat of all his designs  But this was not   the only mortification he suffered  His wife  the moment she left   him  went to her father  and discovering to him her husband s   baseness  he supported her in her resolution of declaring her marriage    as the most proper means to prevent his forming any further schemes   against her      The consequence is obvious  The public received such a curious   piece of scandal with pleasure   and paid respect to his wife  if only   to show contempt for him   particularly the women  who made   hers the cause of the sex  as he had precluded all further designs   upon himself  by marriage      This  though  however flattering to her vanity and resentment   at the time  only widened a breach that she wished to close  His pride   was piqued to disappoint her design  as she had his  and he left   her to languish out the rest of her life in worse than widowhood    and repent of the folly of attempting to attach herself to a man   who  she knew  had betrayed others of the sex      As for my master  this detection made him desperate  He threw   off every appearance of regard even to common decency  which   he thought could no longer be of use to him  and determined to   bear down scandal
