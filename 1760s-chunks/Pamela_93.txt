   and my packet  But pray don t encourage him  as I said  for he is much   too heady and precipitate as to this matter  in my way of thinking    though  to be sure  he is a very good man  and I am much obliged to him          Monday morning       Alas a day  we have bad news from poor Mr  Williams  He has had a sad   mischance  fallen among rogues in his way home last night  but by good   chance has saved my papers  This is the account he gives of it to Mrs    Jewkes           GOOD MRS  JEWKES        I have had a sore misfortune in going from you  When I had got as   near the town as the dam  and was going to cross the wooden bridge  two   fellows got hold of me  and swore bitterly they would kill me  if I did   not give them what I had  They rummaged my pockets  and took from me   my snuff box  my seal ring  and half a guinea  and some silver  and   halfpence  also my handkerchief  and two or three letters I had in   my pockets  By good fortune  the letter Mrs  Pamela gave me was in   my bosom  and so that escaped but they bruised my head and face  and   cursing me for having no more money  tipped me into the dam  crying  be   there  parson  till to morrow  My shins and knees were bruised much   in the fall against one of the stumps  and I had like to have been   suffocated in water and mud  To be sure  I shan t be able to stir out   this day or two  for I am a frightful spectacle  My hat and wig I was   forced to leave behind me  and go home  a mile and a half  without  but   they were found next morning  and brought me  with my snuff box  which   the rogues must have dropped  My cassock is sadly torn  as is my band    To be sure  I was much frightened  for a robbery in these parts has not   been known many years  Diligent search is making after the rogues  My   humble respects to good Mrs  Pamela  if she pities my misfortunes  I   shall be the sooner well  and fit to wait on her and you  This did not   hinder me in writing a letter  though with great pain  as I do this   To   be sure this good man can keep no secret   and sending it away by a man   and horse  this morning  I am  good Mrs  Jewkes                                    Your most obliged humble servant         God be praised it is no worse  And I find I have got no cold  though   miserably wet from top to toe  My fright  I believe  prevented me from   catching cold  for I was not rightly myself for some hours  and know   not how I got home  I will write a letter of thanks this night  if I am   able  to my kind patron  for his inestimable goodness to me  I wish I   was enabled to say all I hope  with regard to the better part of his   bounty to me  incomparable Mrs  Pamela           The wicked brute fell a laughing  when she had read this letter  till   her fat sides shook  Said she  I can but think how the poor parson   looked  after parting with his pretty mistress in such high spirits    when he found himself at the bottom of the dam  And what a figure he   must cut in his tattered band and cassock  and without a hat and wig    when he got home  I warrant  added she  he was in a sweet pickle   I   said  I thought it was very barbarous to laugh at such a misfortune  but   she replied  As he was safe  she laughed  otherwise she would have   been sorry  and she was glad to see me so concerned for him  It looked   promising  she said       I heeded not her reflections  but as I have been used to causes for   mistrusts  I cannot help saying  that I don t like this thing  And their   taking his letters most alarms me   How happy it was they missed my   packet  I knew not what to think of it   But why should
