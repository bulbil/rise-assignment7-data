the government  in which his reign made no material alteration  The priests being the most powerful body of men  it is not surprizing to find the King seconding their schemes  which perhaps he found it impossible to oppose  Religion was then the pretext for every sinister action  obedience to the church the only rule of merit  and  to oppose the enemies of Christianity  preached up as an antidote for every former transgression  The kingdom of Palestine had been  for some time  the theatre of war  and had drained Europe of its most chosen troops  which fell like leaves in autumn  either by pestilence  famine  or the sword  In this quarrel the clergy found means to embark the King  by awakening his ambition  and strengthening his natural superstitions  A romantic desire for strange adventures  and an immoderate zeal for the external parts of Christianity  were the ruling passion of the times  and they easily became the ruling passion of Richard   Impressed with a desire of rescuing the Holy Land from the Infidels  he left England  and with a numerous army passed through France  took Cyprus from a Christian Prince  landed in Palestine  overcame Saladine  with a slaughter of forty thousand Saracens  took several cities from the Infidels  and gained much reputation for conduct and personal bravery  yet  after all  acquired no real   88 advantages for himself  or the cause in which he was engaged  Having concluded a truce for three years with Saladine  he set fail for his return  but  his ships being dispersed by a tempest  he was obliged to land upon the coasts of Italy  where  pursuing his way homeward by land  he was arrested by the Duke of Austria  and put into the power of the Emperor  who cruelly and ungenerously detained him a prisoner  upon the slightest and most trivial pretences   In the mean time England had been left under the government of two prelates  the Bishop of Durham  and Longchamp  Bishop of Ely  The clergy  sole possessors and rulers of the kingdom  might have given what laws they thought proper  but there is a fatality in the affairs of men  that  when friends are destitute of other enemies  they generally make foes of each other  The governors  now without rivals in the temporal interest  disagreed among themselves  and thus weakened the power of the clergy  John  brother to Richard  who long had aspired to the crown  fomented this jealousy among the clergy  and  putting himself at the head of the temporal lords  increased their authority by the addition of his own  He heard of the imprisonment of his brother with secret satisfaction  and used all his interest to continue his captivity   The English  notwithstanding these ungenerous efforts  continued faithful to their King  his bravery and generosity had secured the hearts of the people  and the cause he fought for engaged the affections of the clergy  The monasteries  therefore  strained their finances to raise a sum to procure his release  and the churches gave up their treasures upon promise of having them restored   89 upon his return  By these efforts Richard at length procured his liberty  the Emperor  either ashamed of his own baseness  or fearing the resentment of the German Princes  agreed upon his release for a large ransom  and England once more saw her brave Monarch return crowned with conquest  after numberless victories  distresses  and surmounted dangers   The generosity of this Prince was equal to his valour  he knew that his brother John had  in his absence  attempted to supplant him in the throne  he had an exact information of all his intrigues with the French  who had long endeavoured to blast his laurels  and interrupt his conquests  yet  upon this Prince s submission  he generously forgave him all    I wish  cried he  taking his brother by the hand  I wish I could as easily forget your offences  as you will my pardon    This condescension was not lost upon a man whose heart  though naturally bad  was not dead to all the sentiments of humanity  From this time John served him with fidelity  and did him noble services in his battles with the French  which followed soon after     While Richard was engaged upon the continent in a French war  an infurrection was suppressed at London  which  though but slightly mentioned by historians  should be particularly marked by such as would trace the constitution  William Fitzosborn  commonly called Longbeard  is represented at once as a man brave and enterprising  He had long been an advocate for the poor and meanest of the people  and had gained the hearts of the populace  who held him in extreme veneration  Upon inflicting a new tax  the hurthen of which was to fall entirely on the poor  he raised an insurrection of the people  which the   90 Archbishop was  at first  unable to appease  The principal citizens being called  upon this occasion  to arms  Longbeard was at length hard pressed  and obliged to take refuge in one of the churches  but no sanctuary could screen this self delegated champion  he was seized  convicted  and  with nine of his
