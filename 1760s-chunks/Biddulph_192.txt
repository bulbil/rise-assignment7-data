by that means she had obliged me with so many interesting particulars of her family  and then requested she would proceed  She bowed with a pretty modest grace  and went on   I informed you  Madam  that my father  having accepted of the tuition of Mr Ware’s son  prepared to attend him on his travels  He took his leave very reluctantly of my poor mother and me  whom he tenderly recommended to Mr Ware’s patronage  and set out with the young gentleman  having given up his cure  as his absence was to be of a long continuance   Mr Ware  who was a truly good man  was punctual in the performance of his promise towards my mother and me  and behaved while my father was away like a second parent  His son continued abroad upwards of four years  and returned a very accomplished gentleman   Mr Ware was exceedingly pleased with my father’s conduct  for which he told him both his son and himself owed him the utmost gratitude  He was now far advanced in years  and grown indolent from infirmities  he thought it better to be himself the rewarder of my father’s merit  than take upon him the trouble of soliciting other people to provide for him  and accordingly resolved to give him an annual income of two hundred pounds during his life  He told him  at the same that as his estate was entailed  it was not in his power to confirm this grant by a will  but he was sure his son was too sensible of what he owed him  not to promise in the most solemn manner to continue to him this income  when he should come into his inheritance  The young gentleman  who was present  handsomely acknowleged the obligations he had to my father  and assured him he thought he could never sufficiently repay them   My father  who now wished for nothing more than to sit down peacably on a competency  thought himself very happy  he retired to his little house in Berkshire  where my mother and I still lived  and    gave himself up to domestic contentment   The old gentleman was punctual to his agreement  constantly paying my father fifty pounds every quarter  He died in something less than three years  his son immediately on his accession to his fortune  being at that time in London  wrote my father a very affectionate letter  assuring him of the continuance of his friendship  Nor did he fail in his promise  for two years he was punctual in his remittances to my father  He did not during that time come down to Berkshire  having another country seat  of which he was fonder  At this time I lost my dear mother  who had been for some years in a declining way  and though during her health  as she was an exceedingly good œconomist  my father might have laid by some of his income  yet the frequent journies she was prescribed to Bath  and other places  for change of air  together with the expence of physicians at home  put it out of his power to save any thing  which on my account gave him great uneasiness  but as he was still strong and hale  he was in hopes he might yet live to lay by something for me  I was now about fifteen  and the darling of my father’s heart  He was inconsolable for my mother’s death  but I endeavoured to comfort him  and at last in some measure succeeded  Mr Ware  whom my father had not seen since the death of the good old gentleman  came down now to revisit his paternal seat  He would not omit paying a visit of condolement to his old friend and tutor  and accordingly came to our house the day after his arrival in the country  Though I had seen him before  as it was in my childhood  I had taken but little notice of him  he is indeed a handsome genteel young man   The innocent girl blushed as she spoke these words  but I seemed not to observe it   She proceeded with a sigh  My father who loved him  was rejoiced to see him  Mr Ware behaved with a tenderness and respect almost filial towards him  and very obliging to me  He continued about a week in the country  calling to ask my father how he did every day  When he was about to return to London  he pressed my father to pass a few weeks with him in town  you are melancholy here  said he  changing the scene a little  will divert both your daughter and you   My father thanked him for the honour he did him  but modestly declined it   Mr Ware guessed at his motive  and told him  smiling  I know your objection  but to obviate it at once  I must tell you that I have    prevailed on my sister to come and keep house for me  and I expect to find her at home on my return  I knew his sister  a maiden lady some years older than himself  who had on the death of his father gone to live with a near relation of theirs  My father smiling in his turn  told him he had guessed his mind rightly  and since that was the
