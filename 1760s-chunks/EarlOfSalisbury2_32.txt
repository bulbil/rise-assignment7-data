miseries  under which Raymond groaned  He found himself indeed a  prisoner  guarded by his own people  and in the absolute power of his  perfidious creature  He stood in mute surprise  and Grey was just  preparing to repeat his insolence  when the noise of horsemen called him  suddenly forth   A small troop had been descried at a considerable distance  pressing  towards the castle  with the most violent and precipitate speed  Those  of Raymond s attendants  who had refused to unite in the treachery of  Grey  first espied their approach  and  mounting their horses  called  for their Lord to stand on his defence  or bravely to lead them against  the enemy  for such they deemed them   But Grey now appeared  and with  a sudden recollection of thought  told them  in the name of Raymond   that no resistance was to be attempted  that their Lord feared not nor  would oppose these visiters  but that he directed his friends to march a  mile eastward of the castle  and there to expect him  They obeyed  and  Grey now observed the little troop more distinctly  wondering at the  small number  and struck with a sudden and instinctive terror  when he  discovered Lord William  whose person he well knew  at the head of this  company   He gazed earnestly round him  yet still but a few persons only were in  view — By heaven   cried Grey         he comes not with a force to drive us hence  but to make himself our  prisoner         then hastily ordered his associates to suffer these men to enter  unopposed and unmolested  and  instantly afterwards  to shut fast the  castle gates  He cursed his own folly and rashness  which had led him to  betray himself to Lord Raymond  He now saw a noble occasion of repairing  his fault  and  instead of persevering in his resolution of giving up  Raymond into the hands of the Earl  he now deemed it in his power  and  judged it the wisest course  to give up the Earl into the hands of his  Lord                  SECT  IV     WILLIAM had indeed exposed himself to the utmost danger  by his  ungoverned violence  He had taken his way at the head of a princely  retinue  well appointed  and zealous to vindicate his cause  so that  now his port was that of a warlike Baron  marching to assist his King   against some sudden invasion  Part of his powers was directed to advance  towards the castle by different approaches  so as to surround it  and  prevent the escape of Raymond or his people  He himself  at the head of  a chosen band  attended by the two French Nobles  rushed directly  forward  But the impetuosity of the Earl soon left his attendants at a  distance  all but young Chauvigny and a few others  who with difficulty  kept pace with him  They arrived at the castle gates  without  perceiving that they were come unsupported  and William  far from  recollecting his danger  rushed on with furious and impatient ardour    till he had reached the apartment of the Countess     He flew to take her in his arms  and started back in an agony of terror  and surprize  at the discovery of her unhappy condition  He called upon  her with earnest  yet tender accents  and now nature seemed to  make some efforts to shake off its lethargic weight  The Countess  trembled  as at some extraordinary appearance  gazed with a look less  vacant  as if the dawn of reason were returning  sighed and wept —  Art  thou   said the Earl  turning to Elinor  who busily assisted him to  support her mistress         Art thou that good matron  whose cares have administered comfort to my  wife —Heaven shall reward thee  and William shall not be unmindful of  thy honest affection  But say—conceal not the truth  Whence this sad  disorder in her noble mind  Hath not her oppressor compleated his vile  design  Hath he not forcibly taken possession of her bed         —Elinor assured him  that heaven had been pleased to preserve her from  such pollution  but that  surprized by the shocking tidings of his  death  she had lately fallen into this her present state of  melancholy —William again pressed the hand of Ela   Speak to me   cried  he       say that thou rejoicest at my return —No word of congratulation  No look  of joy  Is this the happiness which my busy fancy formed  Is this my  reception         —The Countess gazed upon him  and seemed in violent agitation  but still  she was unable to return his affection  Reason had not yet regained its  seat —At length  the Earl  whose heart was torn with
