they remedied by stuffing rags between my body and the hoops  after which I was taken to the place appointed and hung on a gibbet which was ready prepared   The cloth over my face being slightly tied  was soon detached by the wind  and probably its blowing on my face expedited my recovery  certain it is  that in this situation I came to myself   The gibbet was placed at one corner of a field  where my sister s cows ran  and about this time a lad came to drive them home for evening milking  The creatures which were feeding almost under me  brought him near the gibbet  and in the very moment   10 he looked up  saw me open my eyes and move my under jaw  He immediately ran home to inform the people at his master s  At first they made some difficulty to believe his story  at length  my brother come out  and by the time he got to the field  I was so much alive  that my groans were very audible   In their confusion  the first thing they thought of was a ladder One of my brother s men mounted and putting his hand to my stomach felt my heart beating strongly  But it was found impossible to detach me from the gibbet  without cutting it down  A saw was got for that purpose  and in less than half an hour  having freed me from my irons  they got me blooded and put in a warm bed   It is amazing  that tho  above eight persons was entrusted with this transaction  and I remained three days in the place after it happened  not one betrayed the secret  Early next morning it was known the gibbet was cut down  and it occurred to every body that it was done by my relations  to put a veil over their shame  by burying the body  but when my brother was summoned to the Mayor s house  in order to be questioned  and he denied knowing any thing of the matter  little more stir was made about it  beeause he was respected by all the neighbouring gentlemen  and in some measure  because I persisted in being innocent of the fact for which I suffered   Thus was I delivered from an ignominious death but how was I to dispose of my life now I had regained it  To stay in England was impossible  without exposing myself to the terrors of the law  In this dilemna a fortunate circumstance occurred  There had lain at my brother s house  some of the principal Officers of a privateer that was preparing   11 for a cruize  and just then ready to sail  The captain offered to take me aboard with him  and proper necessaries being provided for me  my sister giving me ten guineas in my pocket  recommended me to the protection of God and the worthy Commander  who received me in the light of his Clerk  and a sort of Under assistant to his Purser   We had been six months out upon our cruize  having had but indifferent success  when being on the coast of Florida  then in the hands of the Spaniards  we fell in with a squadron of their men of war  and being consequently taken without striking a stroke  were all brought prisoners into the harbour of St  Helen s  I was really tired of my life  and should have been glad to have ended it in the dungeon  where  with forty others of my countrymen  the enemy had put me  but after three years confinement  we were let out  in order to be put on board transports  to be conveyed to Pennsylvania  and from thence to England  This was a disagreeable sentence to me  taking it for granted  that a return home would be a return to the gallows  Being therefore  a tolerable master of the Spanish language  I solicited to be left behind  which favour I obtained  by means of the master of the prison and he not only took me into his house  as soon as my countrymen were gone  but  in a short time  procured me a small salary from the Governor  for being his Deputy   Indeed  at this particular time the office was by no means agreeable  The coast had been long infested with pirates  the most desperate gang of villains that can be imagined  and scarce a month passed  but one or other of their vessels fell into the Governor s hands  and the crew as constantly was   12 put under my care  Once I very narrowly escaped being knocked on the head by one of the ruffians  and having the keys took from me  Another time I was shot at  It is true  in both cases the persons suffered for their attempt  and in the last  I thought a little too cruelly  for the person that let off the carabine  was not only put to the torture to confess his accomplices  but afterwards broke on the wheel where he was left to expire  the most shocking spectacle I ever beheld   I had been in my office about three months  when a ship arrived from Port Royal  another Spanish settlement on the coast  and nine English prisoners on board  I was standing in the street
