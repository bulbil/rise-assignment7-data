poignant grief      Her husband  she said  who had been an officer of distinguished   rank in the English forces  and had fallen in one of the defeats they   suffered in the beginning of the war  before England had exerted   herself in such a manner as to entitle her to success  the news of   whose death affected her so extraordinarily that she resolved to   brave aU the fatigues and dangers of so long a voyage by sea  and   journey through uninhabited deserts in time of war  for the melan    choly pleasure of one last view of his dear remains  which she had   accordingly obtained  though not so much to her satisfaction as   she could have wished  the body being in a state of putrefaction    not possible to be approached without disgust and abhorrence    nor to be distinguished from any other mass of corruption  when   she had caused it to be dug out of the grave in which it had been   buried  on the spot where he had been killed  among the other   victims of the day  and was now returning home  when she had   happily been foTind by his people      Though my master was as much unversed in the regular rules of   politeness as of war  good nature taught him the essentials of one    as reason had of the other  He heard out her story  though not   without pity and contempt at the extravagance and folly of it    and  consoling her with some general remarks on the error of in    dulging immoderate grief for things not to be remedied  offered to   send her  under a sufficient escort  to his own habitation  where   she might remain in safety  and have the conversation and attend    ance of his women  till the conclusion of the campaign  when he   would convey her himself to the next seaport  in order to her   returning to her own country      Though she would have looked upon any attempt to console her   as the highest affront in another situation  her present circumstances   made her think it not proper to show any resentemnt of it to him     besides  there was something in his appearance that somehow made   it less disagreeable from him than it would have been from any   other person  and would possibly have influenced her to accept   of his offer  had not the mention of his women alarmed her delicacy    and set her virtue on its guard      Resolving  therefore  to have this cleared up before she would   give any direct answer to his offer  she expressed her high sense of   his kindness in the politest terms  and entering into a general   conversation  among other questions of mere curiosity  asked him    in a careless manner  whom he meant by his women  and in what   capacity they served him      Such a question was more than he desired  though he had in    considerately laid himself open to it  However  as he thought no   delicacy could justify deceit  he answered her directly  and without   preface  that they served him in the natural capacity of women    while they pleased to continue with him  nor did he desire any   other service from them          360 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     Though she was a good deal disconcerted at this answer  she   had the address not to seem to understand it  in hopes that he   would take the hint  and explain himself into a meaning less offen    sive to her modesty  to give an opportunity for which â€”   I presume    sir    replied she    you mean that they wait upon your lady  or   perform the other domestic offices of your family  in which women    servants only are employed          No  really  madam    answered he    that was not my meaning    I have no lady for them to wait upon   nor do they live so immedi    ately in my own family  as to have any domestic employment   in it         How  sir   Are you not married           Not particularly to any one person  madam          That s very strange    said she  pleased at having gained so   material a piece of intelligence  and resolving to pursue the con    versation    That is really very strange  And pray  sir  are these   ladies Europeans   I suppose    sighing heavily and wiping her   eyes    they are the unhappy widows of such officers as are fallen
