the scene of her distress  when I perceived   37 Sir Timothy get up and move homeward  a circumstance  which  though it gave me some satisfaction  in as much as I thereby knew I had not killed him  filled me with just apprehension of his resentment  which I found myself in no condition to withstand  especially when I considered his intimacy with our  Squire  to whom I knew he would easily justify himself for what he had done  by imputing it to his love  and desiring his brother Bruin to take the same liberty with his sister  without any fear of offence —When we arrived at the house  Narcissa assured me  she would exert all her influence in protecting me from the revenge of Thicket  and likewise engage her aunt in my favour  At the same time  pulling out her purse  offered it as a small consideration for the service I had done her —But I stood too much upon the punctilios of love to incur the least suspicion of being mercenary  and refused the present  saying  I had merited nothing by barely doing my duty —She seemed astonished at my disinterestedness  and blushed  I felt the same suffusion  and with a down cast eye and broken accent  told her  I had one request to make  which if her generosity would grant  I should think myself fully recompensed for an age of misery —She changed colour at this preamble  and with great confusion  replied  she hoped my good sense would hinder me from asking any thing she was bound in honour to refuse  and therefore bid me signify my desire —Upon which I kneeled  and begged to kiss her hand  She immediately  with an averted look  stretched it out  I imprinted on it an ardent kiss  and bathing it with my tears  cried    Dear Madam  I am an unfortunate gentleman    38 who loves you to distraction  but would have died a thousand deaths  rather than make this declaration under such a servile appearance  were he not determined to yield to the rigour of his fate  to fly from your bewitching presence  and bury his presumptuous passion in eternal silence    With these words I rose and went away  before she could recover her spirits so far as to make any reply —My first care was to go and consult Mrs  Sagely  with whom I had maintained a friendly correspondence ever since I left her house  When she understood my situation  the good woman  with real concern  condoled me on my unhappy fate  and approved of my resolution to leave the country  being perfectly well acquainted with the barbarous disposition of my rival    who by this time  said she  has no doubt mediated a scheme of revenge —Indeed  I cannot see how you will be able to elude his vengeance  being himself in the commission  he will immediately grant warrants for apprehending you  and as almost all the people in this country are dependant on him or his friend  it will be impossible for you to find shelter among them  If you should be apprehended  he will commit you to jail  where you may possibly languish in great misery till the next assizes  and then be transported for assaulting a magistrate  —  While she thus warned me of my danger  we heard a knocking at the door  which threw us both into great consternation  as in all probability  it was occasioned by my pursuers  whereupon this generous old lady  putting two guineas into my hand  with tears in her eyes  bid me  for God s sake  get out at the back   39 door  and consult my safety as providence should direct me —There was no time for deliberation —I followed her advice  and escaped by the benefit of a dark night  to the sea side  where while I ruminated on my next excursion  I was all of a sudden surrounded by armed men  who  having bound my hands and feet  bid me make no noise  on pain of being shot  and carried me on board of a vessel  which I soon perceived to be a smuggling cutter —This discovery gave me some satisfaction at first  because I concluded myself safe from the resentment of Sir Timothy  But when I found myself in the hands of ruffians  who threatned to execute me for a spy  I would have thought myself happily quit for a year s imprisonment  or even transportation —It was in vain for me to protest my innocence  I could not persuade them that I had taken a solitary walk to their haunt  at such an hour  merely for my own amusement  and I did not think it my interest to disclose the true cause of my retreat  because I was afraid they would have made their peace with justice by surrendering me to the penalty of the law —What confirmed their suspicion was  the appearance of a Customhouse yacht  which gave them chace  and had well nigh made a prize of their vessel  when they were delivered from their fears by a thick fog  which effectually screened them  and favoured their arrival at Buloign —But before they got out of sight of their pursuer  they held a council of war about me  whom some of the most serocious among them
