a passion  I am only displeased at seeing so much excellence so unjustly disposed of   The uneasiness which I feel is not for myself  but for the beautiful christian  When I reflect on the barbarity of him for whom she is designed  I pity  indeed I pity her  When I think that she must only share one heart  who deserves to command a thousand  excuse me  if I feel an emotion  which universal benevolence extorts from me  As I am convinced  that you take a pleasure in those sallies of humanity  and are particularly pleased with compassion  I could not avoid discovering the sensibility with which I felt this beautiful stranger s distress  I have for a while forgot in hers  the the miseries of my own hopeless situation  Our tyrant grows every day more severe  and love which softens all other mind into tenderness  seems only to have encreased his severity  Adieu   LETTER XXXV  From the same   THE whole Haram is filled with a tumultuous joy  Zelis  the beautiful captive  has consented to embrace the religion of Mahomet  and become one of the wives of the fastidious Persian  It is impossible to describe the transport that sits on every face on this occasion  Music and feasting fill every apartment  the most miserable slave seems to forget his chains  and sympathizes with the happiness of Mostadad  The herb we tread   150 beneath our feet is not made more for our use  than every slave around him for their imperious master  mere machines of obedience they wait with silent assiduity  feel his pains  and rejoice in his exultation  Heavens  how much is requisite to make one man happy   Twelve of the most beautiful slaves  and I among the number  have got orders to prepare for carrying him in triumph to the bridal apartment  The blaze of perfumed torches are to imitate the day  the dancers and singers are hired at a vast expense  The nuptials are to be celebrated on the approaching feast of Barboura  when an hundred taels in gold are to be distributed among the barren wives  in order to pray for fertility from the approaching union   What will not riches procure  an hundred domestics  who curse the tyrant in their souls  are commanded to wear a face of joy  and they are joyful  An hundred flatterers are ordered to attend  and they fill his ears with praise  Beauty  all commanding beauty  sues for admittance  and scarcely receives an answer  even love itself seems to wait upon fortune  or though the passion be only feigned  yet it wears every appearance of sincerity  and what greater pleasure can even true sincerity confer  or what would the rich have more   Nothing can exceed the intended magnificence of the bridegroom  but the costly dresses of the bride  six eunuchs in the most sumptuous habits are to conduct him to the nuptial couch  and wait his orders  Six ladies  in all the magnificence   151 of Persia  are directed to undress the bride  Their business is to assist to encourage her  to divert her of every encumbering part of her dress  all but the last covering  which  by an artful complication of ribbons  is purposely made difficult to unloose  and with which she is to part reluctantly even to the joyful possessor of her beauty   Mostadad  O my father  is no philosopher  and yet he seems perfectly contented with his ignorance  Possessed of numberless slaves  camels  and women  he desires no greater possession  He never opened the  of Mentius  and yet all the slaves tell me that he is happy   Forgive the weakness of my nature  if I sometimes feel my heart rebellious to the dictates of wisdom  and eager for happiness like his  Yet why wish for his wealth with his ignorance  to be like him  incapable of sentimental pleasures  incapable of feeling the happiness of making others happy  incapable of teaching the beautiful Zelis philosophy   What  shall I in a transport of passion give up the golden mean  the universal harmony  the unchanging essence for the possession of an hundted camels  as many slaves  thirty five beautiful horses  and seventy three fine women  first blast me to the centre  Degrade me beneath the most degraded  Pare my nails  ye powers of heaven  ere I would stoop to such an exchange  What  part with philosophy  which teaches me to suppress my passions instead of gratifying them  which teaches me even to divest my soul of passion  which   152 teaches serenity in the midst of tortures  philosophy  by which even now I am so very serene  and so very much at ease  to be persuaded to part with it for any other enjoyment  Never  never  even though persuasion spoke in the accents of Zelis   A female slave informs me that the bride is to be arrayed in a tissue of silver  and her hair adorned with the largest pearls of Ormus  but why teize you with particulars  in which we both are so little concerned  the pain I feel in separation throws a gloom over my mind  which in this scene of universal joy I fear may be attributed to some other cause  how
