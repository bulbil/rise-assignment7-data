 that is  she has pleased herself       As to her inclination for your brother  I am of their opinion  that she loves him without being quite clear in the point herself  she has not yet confessed the fact even to me  but she has speaking eyes  Lucy  and I think I can interpret their language       Whether he sees it or not I cannot tell  I rather think he does  because he has been less here  and more guarded in his manner when here  than before this matrimonial affair was put an end to  which is natural enough on that supposition  because he knows the impertinence of Quebec  and is both prudent and delicate to a great degree       He comes  however  and we are pretty good company  only a little more reserved on both sides  which is  in my opinion  a little symptomatic       La  here s papa come up to write at my bureau  I dare say  it s only to pry into what I am about  but excuse me  my dear Sir  for that  Adieu  jusqu au demain  ma tres chere   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER LXXI   71   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Feb  20   EVERY hour  my Lucy  convinces me more clearly there is no happiness for me without this lovely woman  her turn of mind is so correspondent to my own  that we seem to have but one soul  the first moment I saw her the idea struck me that we had been friends in some pre existent state  and were only renewing our acquaintance here  when she speaks  my heart vibrates to the sound  and owns every thought she expresses a native there       The same dear affections  the same tender sensibility  the most precious gift of Heaven  inform our minds  and make us peculiarly capable of exquisite happiness or misery       The passions  my Lucy  are common to all  but the affections  the lively sweet affections  the only sources of true pleasure  are the portion only of a chosen few       Uncertain at present of the nature of her sentiments  I am determined to develop them clearly before I discover mine  if she loves as I do  even a perpetual exile here will be pleasing  The remotest wood in Canada with her would be no longer a desert wild  it would be the habitation of the Graces       But I forget your letter  my dear girl  I am hurt beyond words at what you tell me of my mother  and would instantly return to England  did not my fondness for this charming woman detain me here  you are both too good in wishing to retire with me to the country  will your tenderness lead you a step farther  my Lucy  It would be too much to hope to see you here  and yet  if I marry Emily  it will be impossible for me to think of returning to England       There is a man here whom I should prefer of all men I ever saw for you  but he is already attached to your friend Bell Fermor  who is very inattentive to her own happiness  if she refuses him  I am very happy in finding you think of Temple as I wish you should       You are so very civil  Lucy  in regard to me  I am afraid of becoming vain from your praises       Take care  my dear  you don t spoil me by this excess of civility  for my only merit is that of not being a coxcomb       I have a heaviness of heart  which has never left me since I read your letter  I am shocked at the idea of giving pain to the best parent that ever existed  yet have less hope than ever of seeing England  without giving up the tender friend  the dear companion  the adored mistress  in short the very woman I have all my life been in search of  I am also hurt that I cannot place this object of all my wishes in a station equal to that she has rejected  and I begin to think rejected for me       I never before repined at seeing the gifts of fortune lavished on the unworthy       Adieu  my dear  I will write again when I can write more chearfully   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER LXXII   72   To the Earl of —       My Lord   Silleri  Feb  20   YOUR Lordship does me great honor in supposing me capable of giving any satisfactory account of a country in which I have spent only a few months       As a proof  however  of my zeal  and the very strong desire I have to merit the esteem you honor me with  I shall communicate from time to time the little I have observed  and may observe  as well as what I hear from good authority  with that lively pleasure with which I have ever obeyed every command of your Lordship s       The French  in the first settling this colony  seem
