 Selby s wishes and mine  that the man   29 who had rescued the dear createre from insult and distress  might be at liberty to intitle himself to her grateful Love   The noble manner in which you have explained yourself on a subject which has greatly embarrassed you  has abundantly satisfied Mrs  Selby  Lucy  and myself  We can have no scruples of delicacy  Nor am I afraid of suffering from yours by my frankness  But  as to our Harriet—You may perhaps meet with some  not affectation  she is a ove it  difficulty with her  if you expect her whole heart to be yours  She  Sir  experimentally knows how to allow for a double  a divided Love—Dr  Bartlett  perhaps should not have favoured her with the character of a Lady whom she prefers to herself  and Mrs  Selby and I have sometimes  as we read her melancholy story  thought  not unjustly  If she can be induced to love  to honour  the man of her choice  as much as she loves  honours  and admires Lady Clementina  the happy Man will have reason to be satisfied  You see  Sir  that we  who were able to give a preference to the same Lady against ourselves  Harriet Byron is ourself  can have no scruples on your giving it to the same incomparable woman  May that Lady be happy  If she were not to be so  and her unhappiness were to be owing to our happiness  that  dear Sir  would be all that could pain the hearts of any of us  on an occasion so very agreeable to  Your sincere Friend and Servant  HENRIETTA SHIRLEY   But  my dear Lady G  does your brother tell you and Lady L  nothing of his intentions  Why  if he does  do not you—But I can have no doubt  Is not the man Sir Charles Grandison  And yet  methinks  I want to know what the contents of his next Letters from Italy will be   You will have no scruple  my dear Lady G  to   30 shew my whole Letter to Lady L  and  if you please  to my Emily—But only mention the contents  in your own way  to the gentlemen  I beg you will yourself shew it to Mrs  Reeves  She will rejoice in her prognostigations  Use that word to her  She will understand you  Your brother must now  less than ever  see what I write  I depend upon your discretion  my dear Lady G   HARRIET BYRON   LETTER IX  Lady G  To Miss BYRON    Wedn  Sept  23   EXcellent Mrs  Shirley  Incomparable woman  How I love her  If I were such an excellent ancient  I would no more wish to be young  than she has so often told us  she does  What my brother once said  and you once wrote to your Lucy  is true  in her case  at least   that the matronly and advanced time of life  in a woman  is far from being the least elegible part of it  especially  I may add  when health and a good conscience accompany it  What a spirit does she  at her time of Life  write with —But her heart is in her subject—I hope I may say that  Harriet  without offending you   Not a word did my brother speak of his intention  till he received that Letter  and then he invited Lady L  and me  and our two honest men  to afternoon tea with him— O but I have not reckoned with you for your saucy rebukes in your last of the 7th  I owe you a spite for it  and  Harriet  depend on payment—What was I writing —I have it—  And when tea was over  he  without a blush  without looking down  as a girl would do in this situation— But why so  Harriet  Is a woman  on these occasions  to act a part as if she supposed herself to be the greatest gainer by   31 matrimony  and therefore was ashamed of consenting to accept of an honourable offer  As if  in other words  she was to be the self denying receiver rather than conferrer of an obligation —Lord  how we rambling headed creatures break in upon ourselves   with a good grace he told us of his intention to marry  of his apparition to Mrs  Shirley  of his sudden vanishing  and all that—And then he produced Mrs  Shirley s Letter  but just received   And do you think we were not overjoyed —Indeed we were  We congratulated him  We congratulated each other  Lord L  looked as he did when Caroline gave him his happy day  Lord G  could not keep his seat  He was tipsy  poor man  with his joy  Aunt Nell prank d herself  stroked her ribbands of pink and yellow  and chuckled and mumped for joy  that her nephew at last would not go out of Old England for a wife  She was mightily pleased too with Mrs  Shirley s Letter  It was just such a one as she herself would have written upon the occasion   I posted
