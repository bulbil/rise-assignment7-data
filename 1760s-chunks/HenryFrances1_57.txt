strike each Point with native Force of Mind   While puzzled Learning labours far behind   and are fitter to be yourself the Preceptor  than the Pupil  For my Part  I acknowledge to have been taught several Things by you  but the most material  and what pleases me most  is  that you have brought me to suspect  that I never loved before  I have Reason to think now  that I formerly mistook a high Fever  for that noble Passion  and  not being sensible of those Heart burnings  and quick Pulses toward you  which I had formerly felt for another  I ingenuously confessed  that the Love  which makes such a Bustle in Romances  was quite extinct in me  However  tho  I might have felt the Passion  I think  I never did the Sentiment  before  for your Charms  Inspire  not Lust  but elegant Desire   and are the exact Reverse of Sidley s Art  as they   197 are capable of imparting the chastest Wishes to the loosest Heart  and  as Milton expresses it  in refining upon sensual Pleasure  can raise  the very Spirit of Love  and amorous Delight   All my Family have been this Fortnight at —  attending my Sister s happy Minute  which is not yet arrived  and I have passed my Time here  after a Manner I like best  when I can t spend it with you  I rise at Day break  perform the Ambarvalia  and divide the whole Day light between my Ploughs and the Planting of my Trees  never dine  till Night  then come in hungry  cold  and tired  to a good Fire  a Mutton Chop  a Pint of Wine  a Pinch of Snuff  and a Book  How often  and how sincerely  have I wished for you  in this Retirement  And what an Age it appears to me  since I saw you last  Which makes me suspect that Mr  Locke s Assertion is not just  for  if Time is measured but by the Succession of Ideas  how can your Absence appear tedious to me  who have thought of nothing else but you  There is something  however  in this disparted State  which is not altogether unpleasant  and shews the infinite Goodness of Providence  and the Happiness of a Mind properly turned  that there are Satisfactions and Emoluments  even in the Misfortunes and Distresses of human Life  and that we may  as Young expresses it   Elaborate an artificial Happiness from Pains     198 And it is really my Opinion  upon a good deal of Reflection  that no Person was ever possessed of sublime Sense or Virtue  who was incapable of melancholy Pleasures  The Presence of those we love is like the Noon  their Absence  like the Even of Life  which latter has  I believe  a good deal of that sort of Pleasure I have just mentioned     I am  as I told you once before in this Letter  both  Your Lover and your Friend  Henry   LETTER CIX  FRANCES to HENRY   NOthing less than the extreme Pleasure I received from your last dear  elegant Epistle  could possibly have roused me from the lethargic Stupidity I have been lately immersed in    As after Winds of ruffling Wing  the Sea  subsiding slow  settles into a Calm   But  as I have already said  it was such a one  as I by no Means can boast of  for it was from Passion being exhausted  not the Power of Reason  this Apathy arose  But thy much loved  thy dear  kind  forming Hand   to healthful Measure has reduced and tempered the Rage of Pride  the Felness of Revenge  and all the weak Excesses of my Heart       199Oh  what a Charm has Flattery  when it proceeds from those we truly love  How far beyond Expression is the Pleasure I receive from your saying  I am what I most wish to be  For  tho  I am not vain enough to fancy I have the least Pretence to those Praises you lavish on me  yet  as every Eye creates its own Charmer  your kind Partiality may  perhaps  set my little Merits in such an advantageous Light  as may render me pleasing to the single Person  whose Approbation is of more Consequence to me  than that of the united World   With Regard to myself  I must differ from the Opinion you advance  that   the Statue is originally in the Stone   for I am thoroughly conscious  that I am more indebted to you for any amiable Quality  which I may possess  than to Nature  Perhaps the first Sparks were formed by Nature  but they lay as dead as Fire in Flint  which can only be extracted by Steel  — What you have made  accept of  I am indeed a Creature of your own forming  and therefore all your own — But  oh  my dearest Harry  remember that  as you have raised the Sensations of my Mind to know the highest Happiness the human Heart can feel  you have also rendered me capable of such Pains  as would
