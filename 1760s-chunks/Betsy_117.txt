assured she was not still so  and it was more owing to her   impatience to be ascertained of the truth  than to any real resentment   she had conceived against Mr  Trueworth  that she complied with the   invitation of her now suspected friend  and resolved to put the question   home to her  concerning her present manner of life  and the means by   which she was supported  she had found her removed from the lowest   degree of penury and wretchedness  into a state equal to what she could   have been mistress of had she been re established in the favour of her   father  and now  for the first time  began to think it strange she   should be so  from the mere bounty of a distant relation  to whom in her   utmost distress she had never applied  nor even once mentioned in the   recital of her melancholy history   I will talk to her   said she to   herself   watch carefully  not only the replies she makes to what I say    but also her very looks  unperceiving my suspicions  and  if I find the   least room to believe what Mr  Trueworth has insinuated  shall pity    but will never see her more        In this prudent disposition did she enter the lodgings of Miss Forward    but had no opportunity for the execution of her purpose  some company    which she herself thought  by their behaviour  to be not of the best   sort  happening to be just come before her  and departed not till it was   time to go to the play  Miss Betsy was more than once about to tell Miss   Forward that she had changed her mind  and would not go  but her   complaisance  as having been the person who made the first proposal  as   often stopped her mouth       In fine  they went  but the house being very full  and the fellow who   had been sent to keep places for them going somewhat too late  they were   obliged to content themselves with sitting in the third row  This  at   another time  would have been a matter of some mortification to Miss   Betsy  but  in the humour she now was  to shew herself was the least of   her cares  Never had she entered any place of publick entertainment with   so little satisfaction  Mr  Trueworth s words ran very much in her mind    she had lost no part of them  and though she could not bring herself to   approve of the freedom he had taken  yet  in her heart  she could not   forbear confessing  that his admonitions testified the most zealous and   tender care for her reputation  and  if given by any one except a lover    would have demanded more of her thanks than her resentment       But  alas  those serious considerations were but of short duration  the   brilliant audience  the musick  the moving scenes exhibited on the   stage  and  above all  the gallantries with which herself and Miss   Forward were treated by several gay young gentleman  who  between the   acts  presented them with fruits and sweetmeats  soon dissipated all   those reflections which it was so much her interest to have cherished    and she once more relapsed into her former self       Towards the end of the play  there were two rakes of distinction that   stuck very close to them  and when it was ended  took the liberty to   invite them to sup at a tavern  Miss Betsy started at the motion  but   was very well pleased to find Miss Forward shewed an equal dislike to   it   You will give us leave  then   cried one of the gentlemen   to   guard you safe home  ladies     That I think  my dear   said Miss   Forward to Miss Betsy   may be granted  for the sake of being protected   from the insults of those who may know less how to behave towards our   sex        Miss Betsy making no opposition  they all four went into a   hackney coach to Miss Forward s lodgings  it being agreed upon between   them  that Miss Betsy should be set down there  and take a chair from   thence to Mr  Goodman s  Nothing indecent  nor that could be any way   shocking to the most strict modesty  being offered during their passage    on their alighting from the coach at Mr  Screener s door  Miss Forward   thought  that to ask them to come in would incur no censure from her   fair friend  as they had behaved with so much civility and complaisance    accordingly she did so  and they  who expected no less  took each man
