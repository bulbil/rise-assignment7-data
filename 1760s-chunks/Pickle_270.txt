I was not much alarmed   because I believed myself superior to him in point of bravery  should  the worst come to the worst  But  contrary to my expectation  and his  usual behaviour to our sex  he accosted me very politely  and began to  expostulate on the contents of my letter  I freely told him  that I had  rashly assented to his proposal  for my own convenience only  that  when  I reflected on what I had done  I thought it ungenerous in me to live  with him upon these terms  and that  as I did not like him  and  could not dissemble  such a correspondence could never tend to the  satisfaction of either  He allowed the inference was just  though he  was very much chagrined at my previous proceeding  He relinquished his  claim  restored my clothes  and never afterwards upbraided me with my  conduct in this affair  though he at one time owned  that he still loved  me  and ever should  because I had used him ill  a declaration that  strongly marks the peculiarity of his character  As for my own part  I  own that my behaviour on this occasion is no other way excusable  than  on account of the miserable perplexity of my circumstances  which were  often so calamitous  that I wonder I have not been compelled to take    6 22 15  3 45 PM   such steps as would have rendered my conduct much more exceptionable  than it really is    At last all my hopes were blasted by the issue of my suit  which was  determined in favour of my lord  Even then I refused to yield  on the  contrary  coming out of retirement  I took lodgings in Suffolk street   and set my tyrant at defiance  But  being unwilling to trust my doors  to the care of other people  I hired a house in Conduit street  and no  sooner appeared in the world again  than I was surrounded by divers and  sundry sorts of admirers  I believe I received the incense and addresses  of all kinds under the sun  except that sort which was most to my  liking  a man capable of contracting and inspiring a mutual attachment   but such a one is equally rare and inestimable  not but that I own  myself greatly obliged to all those who cultivated my good graces   though they were very little beholden to me  for where I did not really  love  I could never profess that passion  that sort of dissimulation is  a slavery that no honest nature will undergo  Except one worthy young  man whom I sometimes saw  they were a strange medley of insignificant  beings  one was insipid  another ridiculously affected  a third void of  all education  a fourth altogether inconsistent  and  in short  I found  as many trifling characters among the men  as ever I observed in my own  sex  Some of them I endeavoured to bring over to my maxims  while they  attempted to make a proselyte of me  but  finding the task impracticable  on both sides  we very wisely dropped each other    At length  however  I was blessed with the acquaintance of one  nobleman  who is  perhaps  the first character in England  in point  of honour  integrity  wit  sense  and benevolence  when I have thus  distinguished him  I need scarce mention Lord     This great  this good  man  possesses every accomplishment requisite to inspire admiration   love  and esteem  With infinitely more merit than almost ever fell to  one man s share  he manifests such diffidence of his own qualifications   as cannot fail to prepossess every company in his favour  He seems to  observe nothing  yet sees everything  his manner of telling a story   and making trifles elegant  is peculiar to himself  and  though he has  a thousand oddities  they serve only to make him more agreeable  After  what I have said  it may be supposed that I was enamoured of his person   but this was not the case  love is altogether capricious and fanciful   yet I admire  honour  and esteem him to the highest degree  and when I  observe that his character resembled that of my dear departed friend Mr   B    or rather  that Mr  B    had he lived  would have resembled Lord      I pay the highest compliment I can conceive both to the living and  to the dead    In this nobleman s friendship and conversation I thought myself happy   though I was  as usual  exposed to the indefatigable efforts of my lord   who  one day  while I was favoured with the company of this generous  friend  appeared at my door in his coach  attended by another gentleman   who demanded entrance with an air of authority  A very honest  footman  who had been long in my service  ran upstairs in the utmost  consternation  and gave me an account of what
