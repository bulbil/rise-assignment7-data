1 forgot to tell you  gentlemen  that our mother deceased before   our father engaged in arms  insomuch that we became orphans in         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  231     all respects  I fell to the share of an uncle by my mother s side    He had a small estate of about a hundred and twenty pounds   yearly income  with one son  and a daughter whom I thought very   lovely      My uncle appointed me overseer of his labourers  as also his   occasional clerk  for casting accounts and inditing his letters   c      but when it was intimated to him that there was a secret liking   between his daughter and me  he called me aside  and  taking up a   book of profane poems  he kissed it  and swore by the contents   thereof  that if ever I married his daughter he would not give us a   groat      If you ever knew what love was  said he to Mr  Clement  you   must know that it breaks over stronger fences than these  In   short  we were wedded  and turned out of the house without any   thing to live upon except about the value of twenty pounds in   small matters  which had been given to my wife from time to time    by Lady Goodly  her godmother      We made the best of our way to London  My wife understood   needlework  and as I knew that my father in law was quite irre    concilable  I joined myself to a house painter  to whom I gave my   time for nothing  on condition of his giving me a sight into his   business      In the third year my dear wife brought this poor creature into   the world   but happily  she did not encumber mankind with any   more of our wretched and depending progeny      All our care and delight was fixed on this our little daughter    and we thought nothing of any pains or labour that might serve   to introduce her  like herself  into the world      As soon as Charles II  had ascended the throne  our relations   were fully assured that we should be restored to our ancient rights   and possessions   and they contributed  as it were for their own   credit  to set us forth in a suitable manner for appearing at court    There  accordingly  we attended  from time to time  for the space of   twelve months  and got a number of woful memorials presented to   his majesty   but his majesty was so deeply engaged in his pleasures    or so fearful of offending the enemies of his house  that he gave no   attention to our wrongs  There may be also something in the   breasts of the great that excites them to acts of bounty rather   than acts of justice   for these  as they apprehend  might be ac    cepted as matter of debt and not as matter of favour      Being tired of a fruitless suit  I returned to my former employ    ment  and  by industry and frugality  I lived with my little family   quite happy and contented      About ten months ago  two men came to our lodgings  The one   was in a rich livery  and  having inquired for my daughter  pre    sented her with a note to this effect   Lady Diana Templar   sends Diana Stern  the enclosed bill of twenty five pounds  in order   to put her into some little way of livelihood   As my poor dear   child had no cause to suspect any fraud or evil intention in the case    she desired the men to return her most humble thanks and duty to   her ladyship  and away they went      As this lady was a distant relation of my wife s father  my         232 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      daughter in a few days dressed herself in her best  and went to   return thanks to her ladyship in person  but was told that she was   gone to her seat in the country      In the mean time she laid out her supposed bounty in furnishing   a little front shop with some millinery wares  and was already   beginning to get some custom  when one evening two bailiffs en    tered  laid an action upon her  and  taking her up in their arms    hurried her into a coach that drove up to the door      My wife and I had rushed out on hearing our child shriek   and    seeing a coach set off with her at a great rate  we ran after as
