my son s wedding was over    How    cried I    relinquish the cause of truth  and let him be an husband  already driven to the very verge of absurdity  You might as well advise me to give up my fortune as my argument     That fortune    returned my friend    I am now sorry to inform you  is almost nothing  Your merchant in town  in whose hands your money was lodged  has gone off  to avoid a statute of bankruptcy  and it is thought has not left a shilling in the pound  I was unwilling to shock you or the family with the account till after the wedding  but now it may serve to moderate your warmth in the argument  for  I suppose  your own prudence will enforce the necessity of dissembling at least till your son has the young lady s fortune secure    —   Well    reurned I    if what you tell me be true  and if I am to be a beggar  it shall never make me a rascal  or induce me to disavow my principles  I ll go this moment and inform the company of my circumstaces  and as for the argument   Page  16  I even here retract my former concessions in the old gentleman s favour  nor will I allow him now to be an husband either dejure  de facto  or in any sense of the expression      It would be endless to describe the different sensations of both families when I divulged the news of my misfortunes  but what others felt was slight to what the young lovers appeared to endure  Mr  Wilmot  who seemed before sufficiently inclined to break off the match  was by this blow soon determined  one virtue he had in perfection  which was prudence  too often the only virtue that is left us unimpaired at seventy two   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  III   A migration  The fortunate circumstances of our lives are generally found at last to be of our own procuring   THE only hope of our family now was  that the report of our misfortunes might be malicious or premature  but a letter from my agent in town soon came with a confirmation of every particular  The loss of fortune to myself alone would have been trifling  the only uneasiness I felt was for my family  who were to be humble without such an education as could render them callous to contempt   Near a fortnight passed away before I attempted to restrain their affliction  for premature consolation is but the remembrancer of sorrow  During this interval   Page  18  my thoughts were employed on some future means of supporting them  and at last a small Cure of fifteen pounds a year was offered me in a distant neighbourhood  where I could still enjoy my principles without molestation  With this proposal I joyfully closed  having determined to encrease my salary by managing a little farm   Having taken this resolution  my next care was to get together the wrecks of my fortune  and all debts collected and paid  out of fourteen thousand pounds we had now but four hundred remaining  My chief attention therefore was next to bring down the pride of my family to their circumstances  for I well knew that aspiring beggary is wretchedness itself    You can t be ignorant  my children    cried I    that no prudence of ours could have prevented our late misfortune  but prudence may do much in disappointing its effects  We are now poor  my fondlings  and wisdom bids us conform to our humble situation  Let us then  without repining   Page  19  give up those splendours with which numbers are wretched  and seek in humbler circumstances that peace with which all may be happy  The poor live pleasantly without our help  and we are not so imperfectly formed as to be incapable of living without theirs  No  my children  let us from this moment give up all pretensions to gentility  we have still enough left for happiness if we are wise  and let us draw upon content for the deficiencies of fortune      As my eldest son was bred a scholar  I determined to send him to town  where his abilities might contribute to our support and his own  The separation of friends and families is  perhaps  one of the most distressful circumstances attendant on penury  The day soon arrived on which we were to disperse for the first time  My son  after taking leave of his mother and the rest  who mingled their tears with their kisses  came to ask a blessing from me  This I gave him from my heart  and which   Page  20  added to five guineas  was all the patrimony I had now to bestow    You are going  my boy    cried I    to London on foot  in the manner Hooker  your great ancestor  travelled there before you  Take from me the same horse that was given him by the good bishop Jewel  this staff  and take this book too  it will be your comfort on the way  these two lines in it are
