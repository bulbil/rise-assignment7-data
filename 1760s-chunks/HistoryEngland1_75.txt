again took sanctuary in the monastery of Bethlem  The Prior of this house gave him up to the King  upon promise of a pardon  and Perkin was now a second time confined in the Tower  but  plotting  even there  against the King  he and the Earl of Warwick being convicted of designs to kill the keeper of the Tower  and so escape  they were both put to death   There was as yet  in Henry s reign  nothing but plots  treasons  insurrections  ingratitude  imposture  and punishments  You have seen several of these somentors of treason brought to justice  yet infinitely greater numbers pardoned  but there was a wide difference between the punishments of this  and those arbitrary sentences of the reigns preceding  the courts of judicature now sat upon every criminal  uninfluenced by the royal authority  and scarce one person was punished for treason  but such as would  at present  receive the same rigorous treatment  A King  who can reign without ever punishing  is happy  but that Monarch must certainly be undone  who  through fear  or ill timed lenity  suffers repeated guilt to escape without notice  When a country becomes quite illicit  punishments then  like the loppings in a garden  only serve to strengthen the stock  and prepare for a new harvest of virtues   I am   c     220  LETTER XXVIII   YOU have hitherto only seen Henry employed in suppressing rebellion  and bringing the kingdom from a state of anarchy to just subordination  let me now exhibit that part of his reign in which he most deserves our admiration  and shew him as the friend of peace  and the refined politician  Indeed no man loved peace more than he  and much of the ill will of his subjects arose from his attempts to repress their inclination for war  The usual preface to his treaties was  That  when Christ came into the world  peace was sung  and  when he went out of the world  peace was bequeathed  He had no ambition to extend his power  except only by treaties  and by wisdom  by these he rendered himself much more formidable to his neighbours  than his predecessors had done by their victories  They were formidable only to their own subjects  Henry was dreaded by rival Kings   He all along had two points principally in view  one to depress the nobility and clergy  and the other to humanize and raise up the populace  From the ambition of the former  and the blind dependence of the latter  all the troubles in former reigns arose  every nobleman was possessed of a certain number of subjects  over whom he had an absolute power  and  upon every occasion  could influence numbers to join in revolt and disobedience   He first  therefore  considered  that giving these petty Monarchs a power of selling their estates  which before they had not a right to do  would greatly weaken their interest  With this view he   221 got an act passed  in which the nobility were granted a power of alienating their possessions  a law infinitely pleasing to the commons  nor was it disagreeable even to the nobility  since they thus had an immediate resource for supplying the waste of prodigality and the demands of their creditors  The blow reached their posterity alone  but they were too ignorant to be sensible of remote sufferings   His next scheme was to prevent their giving liveries to many hundreds of dependents  who served  like standing forces  to be ready at the summons of their lord  By an act passed in his reign  none but menial servants were permitted to wear a livery  under severe penalties  and this law he took care to enforce with the utmost rigour  It is told us  by Bacon  that the King  one day paying a visit to the Earl of Oxford  was entertained  by him with all possible splendor and magnificence  When the King was ready to depart  he saw ranged  upon both sides  a great number of men  dressed up in very rich liveries  apparently to do him honour  The King  surprized at such a number of domestics  as he thought them  cried out    What  my Lord of Oxford  are all these fine fellows your menial servants   The Earl  not perceiving the King s drift  answered  with a smile  that they were only men whom he kept in pay to do him honour upon such occasions  At this the King started a little  and said   By my faith  my Lord  I thank you for your good chear  but I must not suffer to have the laws broken  my Attorney General must talk with you   The historian adds  that the King exacted a severe fine for this transgression of the statute       222 It has been already observed what a perverted use was made of monasteries  and other places appropriated to religious worship  by the number of criminals who took refuge in them  This privilege the clergy assumed as their undoubted right  and those places of pretended sanctity were become the abode of murderers  robbers  and conspirators  Witches and necromancers were the only persons who could
