word more of such a suggestion  madam  I should hate myself  were I capable of treating Lord G  meanly  or contemptibly  with a thought of preference to any man breathing  now I am his  I have a great opinion of Mr  Beauchamp  He deserves it  But I never had the shadow of a wish  that I had been his  I never should have spoken of my brother s excellencies  as outshining those of Lord G  had he not been my brother  and therefore could not be more to me  and had they not been so conspicuous  that no other man could be disgraced by giving place to him  No  madam  let me assure you  once for all  that I am so far from despising my Lord G  that  were any misfortune to befal him  I should be a miserable woman   She embraced me  Why then—  I know your inference  madam  It is a just one  I am afraid I think as well of my own understanding as I do of Lord G s  I love to jest  to play  to make him look about him  I dislike not even his petulance  You see I bear all the flings and throws  and peevishness  which he returns to my sauciness  I think I ought  His complaints of me to you  to Lord and Lady L  which bring upon me their and your grave lecturings  and even anger  I can forgive him for  and this I shew by making those complaints matter of pleasantry rather than resentment  I know he intended well  in taking the house  tho  he consulted me not first  It was surely wrong in him  yet I am not mortally offended with him for it  His violence to my poor harpsichord startled me  but I recollected myself  and had he buffetted me instead of that  as I was afraid he would  Page  58 I should have thought I ought to have borne it  whether I could or not  and to have returned him his hat with a courtesy  Believe me  madam  I am not a bad  I am only a whimsical creature  I tried my brother once  I set him up  I was afraid of him  indeed  But I tried him again  Then he called it constitution  and laughed at me  and run me out of breath in my own way  So I let him alone  Lord L  Lady L  had it in turn  Lord G  has a little more than his turn perhaps  And why  because he is for ever fitting the cap to his head  and because I don t love him less than those I am less free with  Come  madam  let me demand your kind thoughts  I will deserve them  Contradiction and opposition  mediators and mediatrices  have carried my playfulness further than it would otherwise have gone  But henceforth your precepts  my brother s  and Miss Byron s  shall not want their weight with me  whether I may shew it or not at this Instant  My reign  I am afraid  will be but short  Let the man bear with me a little now and then  I am not absolutely ungenerous  If he can but shew his love by his forbearance  I will endeavour to reward his forbearance with my love   She embraced me  and said  That now she attributed to the gaiety of my spirits  and not to perverseness  my till now unaccountable behaviour  I was sure  said she  that you were more your mother s  than your father s daughter  Let me  when my Lord comes in  see an instance of the behaviour you bid me hope for   I will try  said I  what can be done—We parted  I went up to my pen  and scribbled down to this place   This moment my Lord is come in  Into my brother s study is he directly gone  Not a question asked about me  Sullen  I warrant  He used to pay his duty to me  and ask blessing the moment he came in  if admissible  Is that a word  Harriet    But times are altered  Ah  Harriet  when I know I am saucy  I Page  59 can bear negligence and slight  But when I intend to be good  knowing my own heart to be right  I shall be quite saucy if he is sullen  Is not the duty of wedded people reciprocal —Aunt Eleanor and he are talking together  She is endeavouring  I suppose  to make a Philosopher of him     Promise nothing for me  aunt Nell  I will have the whole merit of my own reformation      LETTER XI  Lady G  In Continuation   PRepare  Harriet  to hear strange and wonderful things   My Lord sent up his compliments  and desired to know  if he might attend me  I was in my dressingroom  He was not always so polite  I wish  thought I  since displeasure produces respect  that familiarity does not spoil this man  But I ll try him   I shall be glad to see my Lord
