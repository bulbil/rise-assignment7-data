better than distraction  one moment he   determined to seize upon the person of ALMEIDA in the night  and secrete   her in some place accessible only to himself  and the next to   assassinate his brother  that he might at once destroy a rival both in   empire and in love  But these designs were no sooner formed by his   wishes  than they were rejected by his fears  he was not ignorant  that   in any contest between him and HAMET  the voice of the public would be   against him  especially in a contest  in which it would appear  that   HAMET had suffered wrong       Many other projects  equally rash  violent  and injurious  were by turns   conceived and rejected  and he came at last to no other determination    than still carefully to conceal his passion  till he should think of   some expedient to gratify it  lest HAMET should have a just reason for   refusing to let him see the lady again  and remove her to some place   which he might never be able to discover                CHAP  VIII          In the mean time  OMAR  to whom HAMET had from time to time disclosed   the minutest particulars of his situation and design  kept his eye   almost continually upon ALMORAN  and observed him with an attention and   sagacity  which it was difficult either to elude or deceive  He   perceived  that he was more than usual restless and turbulent  that in   the presence of HAMET he frequently changed countenance  that his   behaviour was artificial and inconsistent  frequently shifting from   gloomy discontent and furious agitation  to forced laughter and noisy   merriment  He had also remarked  that he seemed most discomposed after   he had been with HAMET to ALMEIDA  which happened generally once in a   week  that he was become fond of solitude  and was absent several days   together from the apartment of his women       OMAR  who from this conduct of ALMORAN had begun to suspect his   principles  determined to introduce such topics of discourse  as might   lead him to discover the state of his mind  and enable him to enforce   and confirm the principles he had taught him  by new proofs and   illustrations       ALMORAN  who  since the death of his father  had nothing to apprehend   from the discovery of sentiments which before he had been careful to   conceal  now urged his objections against religion  when OMAR gave him   opportunity  without reserve   You tell me   says he   of beings that   are immortal  because they are immaterial  beings which do not consist   of parts  and which  therefore  can admit no solution  the only natural   cause of corruption and decay  but that which is not material  can have   no extension  and what has no extension  possesses no space  and of such   beings  the mind itself  which you pretend to be such a being  has no   conception         If the mind   says OMAR   can perceive that there is in itself any   single  property of such a being  it has irrefragable evidence that it   is such a being  though its mode of existence  as distinct from matter    cannot now be comprehended    And what property of such a being   said   ALMORAN   does the mind of man perceive in itself    That of  acting     said OMAR   without  motion   You have no idea  that a material   substance can act  but in proportion as it moves  yet to  think   is to    act   and with the idea of thinking  the idea of motion is never   connected  on the contrary  we always conceive the mind to be fixed  in   proportion to the degree of ardour and intenseness with which the power   of thinking is exerted  Now  if that which is material cannot act   without motion  and if man is conscious  that to think  is to act and   not to move  it follows  that there is  in man  somewhat that is not   matter  somewhat that has no extension  and that possesses no space    somewhat which  having no contexture or parts that can be dissolved or   separated  is exempted from all the natural causes of decay        OMAR paused  and ALMORAN having stood some moments without reply  he   seized this opportunity to impress him with an awful sense of the power   and presence of the Supreme and Eternal Being  from whom his own   existence was derived   Let us remember   said
