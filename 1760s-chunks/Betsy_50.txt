and engrossed her   so much to himself  that Wildly had the liberty of addressing me    without letting her see his choice gave me the preference        Sir John  after using Mademoiselle with some freedoms  which I could   perceive she did not greatly resent  told her  there was an exceeding   fine picture in the next room  and asked her to go and look upon it   O   yes   replied she   I am extravagantly fond of painting   Are you not    Miss   continued she to me with a careless air   No   said I   I had   rather stay here  and look out of the window  but I would not hinder   this gentleman   meaning Mr  Wildly  who replied   I have seen it   already  so will stay and keep you company         I believe  indeed  we might have spared ourselves the trouble of these   last speeches  for our companions seemed as little to expect as to   desire we should follow them  but ran laughing  jumping  and skipping    out of the room  utterly regardless of those they left behind        Thus  you see  my dear Miss Betsy   continued she   Wildly had  a   second time  the opportunity of triumphing over the weakness of your   unhappy friend  Oh  had it been the last  perhaps I had not been the   wretch I am  but  alas  my folly ceased not here  I loved  and every   interview made him still dearer to me        On Mademoiselle s return  we began to talk of going home   Bless me     cried I   it is now too late to go into town  What excuse shall we make   to the governess for not having bought the ribbands     I have already   contrived that   replied she   I will tell her  that the woman had none   but ugly old fashioned things  and expects a fresh parcel from London in   two or three days     Oh  that is rare   cried I   that will be a   charming pretence for our coming out again     And a charming   opportunity for our meeting you again   said Sir John Shuffle   If you   have any inclination to lay hold of it   rejoined Mademoiselle   And you   have courage to venture   cried he   You see we are no cowards     answered she briskly   Well  then  name your day   said Wildly   if Sir   John accepts the challenge  I will be his second  but I am afraid it   cannot be till after Thursday  because my lord talks of going back to         and we cannot be back in less than three days         Friday  therefore  was the day agreed upon  and we all four were   punctual to the appointment  I shall not trouble you with the   particulars of our conversation in this or any other of the meetings we   had together  only tell you  that by the contrivance of one or other of   us  we found means of coming together once or twice every week  during   the whole time these gentlemen staid in the country  which was upwards   of two months        On taking leave  I pressed Wildly to write to me under cover of   Mademoiselle Grenouille  which he promised to do  and I was silly enough   to expect  Many posts arriving  without bringing any letter  I was sadly   disappointed  and could not forbear expressing my concern to   Mademoiselle  who only laughed at me  and told me  I as yet knew nothing   of the world  nor the temper of mankind  that a transient acquaintance    such as ours had been with these gentlemen  ought to be forgot as soon   as over  that there was no great probability we should ever see one   another again  and it would be only a folly to keep up a correspondence   by letters  and added  that by this time  they were  doubtless  entered   into other engagements   And so might we too   said she   if the place   and fashion we live in did not prevent us         I found by this  and some other speeches of the like nature  that it   was the sex  not the person  she regarded  I could not  however  be of   her way of thinking  I really loved Mr  Wildly  and would have given the   world  had I been mistress of it  to have seen him again
