  Have you  my Lord  asked I  any Lady in your eye   No  said he  indeed I have not   I was the better pleased with him  that he had not  because I was afraid  that  like our VIIIth Henry  he   85 had some other woman in view  which might have made him more uneasy than he would otherwise have been with Giffard  For tho  it was better that he should marry  than live in scandal  and a woman of untainted character  rather than one who had let the world see that she could take a price for her honour  yet I thought him better justified in his complaints of that woman s misbehaviour  than in the other case he would have been  And that it was an happiness to both  if a right use were made of the event  that they had been unable to live on  as they had set out   He told me  that he should think himself the happiest of men  if I could find out  and recommend to him  a woman  that I thought worthy of his addresses  and even would court her for him   Your Lordship ought not to expect fortune   I do not   She should be a gentlewoman by birth and education  a woman of a serious turn  Such an one is not likely in affluence to run into those scenes of life  from which  perhaps  only want of fortune has restrained the gayer creature  I would not have your Lordship fix an age  tho  I think you should not marry a girl  Some women  at Thirty  are more discreet than others at Forty  And if your Lordship should be blessed with a child or two to inherit your great estate  that happy event would domesticate the Lady  and make your latter years more happy than your former   My Lord held up his hands and eyes  and tears seemed to make themselves surrows on his cheeks   He made me look at him  by what he said on this occasion  and with anger  till he explained himself   By my soul  said he  and clapped his two lifted up hands together  I have your father  I never heartily loved him  but now I hate him more than ever I did in my life   My Lord —    86 Don t be surprised  I hate him for keeping so long abroad a son  who would have converted us both  Lessons of morality  given in so noble a manner by regular practice  rather than by preaching theory  those were his words  not only where there is no interest proposed to be served  but against interest  must have subdued us both  and that by our own consents  O my sister  and he clasped his hands  and lifted up his eyes  as if he had the dear object of his brotherly address before him  how have you blessed me  in your son —  This apostrophe to my mother affected me  What a mixture is there in the character of Lord W   What a good man might he have made  had he been later his own master —His father died before he was of age   He declared  that I had described the very wife he wished to have  Find out such an one for me  my dear kinsman  said he  and I give you charte blanche  But let her not be younger than Fifty  Make the settlements for me  I am very rich  I will sign them blindsold  If the Lady be such an one as you say I ought to love  I will love her  Only let her say  she can be grateful for my love  and for the provision you shall direct me to make for her  and my first interview with her shall be at the altar   I think  my friend  I have in my eye such a woman as my Lord ought to do very handsome things for  if she condescend to have him  I will not tell you  not even you  whom I mean  till I know she will encourage such a proposal  and  for her own fortune s sake  I think she should  But I had her not in my thoughts when I proposed to my Lord the character of the woman he should wish for   Adieu  my dear friend     87  LETTER XII  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Tuesday  Mar  21   DR  Bartlett went to town yesterday  He returned early enough to breakfast with us  He found at dinner with his patron  the whole Danby family and Mr  Sylvester  as also  the two masters of the young gentlemen  with Mr  Galliard  whose son is in love with Miss Danby  and she with him  There all the parties had confirmed to them the generous goodness of Sir Charless  of which he had assured Mr  Sylvester and the two brothers and sister before   I am sorry  methinks  the doctor went to town  We should otherwise  perhaps  have had the particulars of all  from the pen of the benevolent man  Such joy  such
