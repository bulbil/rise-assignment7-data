  I was but just set down to dinner  nobody with me but Patty and my children  A note was brought into me  which  they said came by a porter  who waited for an answer  I opened and read it  My eyes were struck with the unlooked for name of Orlando Faulkland at the bottom  the contents filled me with terror and surprize  I know not what I have done with the note  but he informed me in it that he was just arrived in town  and begged I would appoint an hour that evening to see him alone  adding  that his arrival was  and must be  a secret to every body but me   Troubled and shocked as I was  I returned for answer  by the same    messenger  that I should expect him at six o’clock  I need not tell you how I passed the interval ’till that hour  It was impossible for me  amidst a thousand conjectures  to form one which could probably occasion this amazing visit  So strangely introduced  so unthought of  and from one I imagined to be in another kingdom   Precisely at six o’clock  I heard a coach stop at the door  Patty was in the way to receive him  and presently Mr Faulkland himself entered the drawing room  Distraction was in his looks  I rose to receive him  but shook from head to foot  and I felt the blood forsaking my face  He ran to me  as if with a design to salute me  but started back without making the offer  I made a motion to a chair for him  and sat down myself  for I was not able to stand  You are welcome to England  Sir  I am glad to see you—scarce knowing what I said  I hope your lady is well  He looked wildly  as if in horror at the question  Then suddenly catching both my hands  he fell on his knees before me  his eyes fixed mournfully on my face  and it was some time before he could answer   I could not speak  I burst into tears —there was something dreadful in his silence  He kissed both my hands  but I withdrew them from him  Sir  Sir  speak I conjure you  You shock me to death  I see I have  said he  and I am afraid to proceed  you will die at the relation  For God’s sake  Sir  explain yourself — You see a man  said he  whose life is forfeited to the law—My wife is dead—and by my hand—   I don’t know whether he said more  for I fainted away  It seems he did not call for any help  but by his own endeavours at last brought me to myself  and I found him weeping bitterly over me   The sound of the last horrid words I had heard him speak still rung in my ears  I begged him to explain them   That wife  said he  that woman whom you persuaded me to marry  I caught in adultery  and I punished the villain who had wronged me with death  She shared in his fate  though without my intending it  For this act of justice  which the law will deem murder  I myself must die  and I am come but to take a last look —What recompence then can you make the man  whom you have brought to misery  shame and death   His looks  and the tone of voice with which he spoke this  made my blood run cold  and my heart die within me   I wrung my hands  and redoubling my tears  I do not need your reproaches  said I  to make me the most miserable woman on earth—    What recompence indeed can I make you—None  none  but to tell you that if you will fly this instant  my fortune will be at your disposal  and I will take care to supply you in what part soever of the world you shall chuse for your residence   And can you after all that is past  said he  persist in such barbarity as to drive me from you  or are you determined to see me perish here  If that be so  I will soon rid you of this miserable hated wretch   He drew his sword like a madman  and with a dreadful imprecation  which made me shudder  swore that if I did not that minute  promise to bear him company in his flight  he would plunge it into his breast  and die before my eyes —Good God  what a scene of horror was this  I will  I will  I cried  I will go with you to the farthest verge of the earth  I catched his arm  fell down on my knees  and was more mad  if possible than himself   I begged of him to put up his sword  which he did  seeing me almost dead with fear  You know  said he  the means of dying are always in my own power  take care you do not trifle with me  nor plead in excuse for falsifying your promise  that you made it to save me from immediate destruction   I beseeched him to calm himself
