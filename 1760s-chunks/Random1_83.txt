 and we could have no meat till next noon —But I had already laid in sufficient for the occasion  and therefore desired to be excused  expressing a curiosity to know the meaning of banyan day —They tole me  that on Mondays  Wednesdays and Fridays  the ship s company had no allowance of meat  and that these meagre days were called banyan days  the reason of which they did not know  but I have since learned they take their denomination from a sect of devotees in some parts of the East Indies  who never taste flesh       235 After dinner  Thomson led me round the ship  shewed me the different parts  described their uses  and as far as he could  made me acquainted with the particulars of the discipline and oeconomy practised on board —He then demanded of the boatswain  an hammock for me  which was slung in a very neat manner by my friend Jack Rattlin  and as I had no bed Cloaths  procured credit for me with the purser  for a matrass and two blankets —At seven a clock in the evening  Morgan visited the sick  and having ordered what was proper for each  I assisted Thomson in making up his prescriptions  But when I followed him with the medicines into the sick birth or hospital  and observed the situation of the patients  I was much less surprised to find people die on board  than astonished to find any body recover —Here I saw about fifty miserable distempered wretches  suspended in rows  so huddled one upon another  that not more than fourteen inches of space was allotted for each with his bed and bedding  and deprived of the light of the day  as well as of fresh air  breathing nothing but a noisome atmosphere of the morbid steams exhaling from their own excrements and diseased bodies  devoured with vermin hatched in the filth that surrounded them  and destitute of every convenience necessary for people in that helpless condition     236  CHAP  XXVI   A disagreeable accident happens to me in the discharge of my office—Morgan s nose is offended—a dialogue between him and the ship s steward—upon examination  I find more causes of complaint than one—my hair is cut off—Morgan s Cookery—the manner of sleeping on board—I am waked in the night by a dreadful noise   I Could not comprehend how it was possible for the attendants to come near those who hung on the inside towards the sides of the ship  in order to assist them  as they seemed barricadoed by those who lay on the outside  and entirely out of the reach of all visitation —Much less could I conjecture how my friend Thomson would be able to administer clysters  that were ordered for some in that situation —When I saw him thrust his wig in his pocket  and strip himself to his waistcoat in a moment  then creep on all fours  under the hammocks of the sick  and forcing up his bare pate between two  kept them asunder with one shoulder  until he had done his duty —Eager to learn the service  I desired he would give me leave to perform the next operation of that kind  he consenting  I undressed myself after his example  and crawling along  the ship happened to roll  which alarmed me    237 I laid hold of the first thing that came within my grasp  with such violence  that I overturned it  and soon found by the smell that issued upon me  I had not unlocked a box of the most delicious perfume  it was well for me that my nostrils was none of the most delicate  else I know not how I might have been affected by this vapour  which diffused itself all over the ship to the utter discomposure of every body who tarried on the same deck —neither was the consequence of this disgrace confined to my sense of smelling only  for I felt my misfortune more ways than one  That I might not  however  appear altogether disconcerted in this my coup d essai  I got up  and pushing my head with great force between two hammocks  towards the middle  where the greatest resistance was  I made an opening indeed  but not understanding the knack of dexterously turning my shoulder to maintain my advantage  I had the mortification to find myself stuck up as it were in a pillory  and the weight of three or four people bearing on each side of my neck  so that I was in danger of strangulation —While I remained in this defenceless posture  one of the sick men  rendered peevish by his distemper  was so enraged at the smell I had occasioned  and the rude shock he had received from me in my elevation  that with many bitter reproaches  he seized me by the nose  which he tweaked so unmercifully that I roared with anguish  Thomson perceiving my condition  ordered one of the waiters to my assistance  who with much difficulty disengaged me from this embarras  and hindered me from taking vengeance of the sick man  whose indisposition would not   238 have screened him from the effects of my indignation   After having made an end of our ministry for that time  we descended to the cockpit  my friend comforting me for what had happened  with a homely proverb  which I do not chuse to repeat —When we had got
