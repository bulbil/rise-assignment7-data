the whole family sympathized with their approaching happiness  the apartments were brightened up with lights that diffused the most exquisite perfume  and a lustre   67 more bright than noon day  The lady expected her youthful lover in an inner apartment with impatience  when his servant approaching with terror in his countenance  informed her  that his master was fallen into a fit  which would certainly be mortal  unless the heart of a man lately dead  could be obtained  and applied to his breast She scarce waited to hear the end of his story  when  tucking up her cloaths  she ran with a mattock in her hand to the coffin  where Choang lay  resolving to apply the heart of her dead husband as a cure for the living  She therefore struck the lid with the utmost violence  In a few blows the coffin flew open  when the body  which  to all appearance had been dead  began to move  Terrified at the sight  Hansi dropped the mattock  and Choang walked out  astonished at his own situation  his wife s unusual magnificence  and her more amazing surprize  He went among the apartments  unable to conceive the cause of so much splendor  He was not long in suspense before his domestics informed him of every transaction since he first became insensible  He could scarce believe what they told him  and went in pursuit of Hansi herself  in order to receive more certain information  or to reproach her infidelity  But she prevented his reproaches  he found her weltering in blood  for she had stabbed herself to the heart  being unable to survive her shame and disappointment   Choang  being a philosopher  was too wise to make any loud lamentations  he thought it best to bear his loss with serenity  so  mending up the old coffin where he had lain himself  he placed his faithless spouse in his room  and  unwilling that so many nuptial preparations should be expended   68 in vain  he the same night married the widow with the large fan   As they both were apprised of the foibles of each other before hand  they knew how to excuse them after marriage  They lived together for many years in great tranquillity  and not expecting rapture  made a shift to find contentment  Farewell   LETTER XIX  To the same   THE gentleman dressed in black  who was my companion through Westminster Abbey  came yesterday to pay me a visit  and after drinking tea  we both resolved to take a walk together  in order to enjoy the freshness of the country  which now begins to resume its verdure  Before we got out of the suburbs  however  we were stopped in one of the streets by a crowd of people  gathered in a circle round a man and his wife  who seemed too loud and too angry to be understood  The people were highly pleased with the dispute  which upon enquiry we found to be between Dr  Cacafogo an apothecary  and his wife  The doctor  it seems  coming unexpectedly into his wife s apartment  found a gentleman there in circumstances not in the least equivocal   The doctor  who was a person of nice honour  resolving to revenge the flagrant insult  immediately   69 flew to the chimney piece  and taking down a rusty blunderbuss  drew the trigger upon the defiler of his bed  the delinquent would certainly have been shot through the head  but that the piece had not been charged for many years  The gallant made a shift to escape through the window  but the lady still remained  and as she well knew her husband s temper  undertook to manage the quarrel without a second  He was furious  and she loud  their noise had gathered all the mob who charitably assembled on the occasion  not to prevent  but to enjoy the quarrel   Alas  said I to my companion  what will become of this unhappy creature thus caught in adultery  Believe me  I pity her from my heart  her husband  I suppose  will shew her no mercy  Will they burn her as in India  or behead her as in Persia  will they load her with stripes as in Turkey  or keep her in perpetual imprisonment  as with us in China  Prythee  what is the wife s punishment in England for such offences  When a lady is thus caught tripping  replied my companion  they never punish her  but the husband  You surely jest  interrupted I  I am a foreigner  and you would abuse my ignorance  I am really serious  returned he  Dr  Cacafogo has caught his wife in the act  but as he had no witnesses  his small testimony goes for nothing  the consequence therefore of his discovery will be  that she may be packed off to live among her relations  and the doctor must be obliged to allow her a separate maintenance  Amazing  cried I  is it not enough that she is permitted to live separate from the object she derests  but must he give her money to keep her in spirits too  That he must  says my guide  and be called a cuckold   70 by all his neighbours into the bargain  The men will laugh at him
