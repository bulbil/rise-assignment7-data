his duty to sustain  He lived at a time when the spirit of the law was in opposition to the genius of the people  and governing by old rules  instead of endeavouring to accommodate himself to the changes of the times  he fell in the universal convulsion  Many Kings before him expired by treasons  plots  or assassination  but never   43 since the times of Agis the Lacedemonian were any but him sacrificed by their subjects with all the formalities of justice  Upon the whole  it must be confessed  that  though the nation was branded by foreigners with reproach upon this occasion  yet these struggles at length ended in domestic happiness and security  the laws became more precise  and the subject more ready to obey  as if a previous fermentation in the constitution was necessary to its subsequent refinement     I am   c   LETTER VI   CROMWELL  who had secretly solicited the King s death  now began to feel wishes to which he had been hitherto a stranger  he perceived himself not far removed from the object of his most unbounded ambition  His views expanded with success  and his first principles of liberty shrunk when opposed to the unbounded prospect of power  The parliament  which was still permitted to enjoy the shadow of authority  voted it high treason to acknowledge Charles Stewart  son of the murdered King  as successor to the throne  They likewise voted the house of Lords useless and dangerous  and passed an act for the abolition of all kingly power  A great seal was made  on one side of which were engraved the arms of England and Ireland  with this inscription    The great seal of England   on the reverse was represented the house of commons sitting  with this motto   The first year of freedom  by God s blessing  restored  1648     They next proceeded to try those gallant men whose attachment to their late Sovereign had been most remarkable  The Duke of Hamilton and Lord   44 Capel were accused  condemned  and beheaded  several others shared the same fate  The Earl of Norwich and Sir John Owen were condemned  but reprieved  The Scotch were not a little displeased at the death of the Duke  who was executed not only contrary to the laws of war  but the law of nations  they were therefore determined to acknowledge the young Prince for their King  But their love of liberty  in some measure  seemed to combat their resentment  they called him to the throne indeed  but  at the same time  abridged his power with every limitation which they had formerly attempted to impose on their late Sovereign  The second Charles had neither the virtue  the constancy  nor the principles of his father  Attached to no religion  he agreed to all their proposals  and was contented to accept the formalities without the power of a King  He was received at Edinburgh with demonstrations of profound respect  and entered the city by that very gate on which the limbs of the brave Montrose  one of his most faithful adherents  were still exposed  but he soon found that the life he was likely to lead would be an insupportable bondage to one of his volatile disposition  He was surrounded and incessantly importuned by the Scotch fanatical clergy  who came to instruct him in religion  and obliged him to listen to long sermons  in which they seldom failed to stigmatize the late King as a tyrant  to accuse his mother of idolatry  and himself of an untoward disposition  Upon appointed days he was obliged to hear six sermons without intermission  They insisted upon his observing Sunday with a Jewish strictness  They even watched his looks  and  if he happened to smile at any part of their absurd enthusiasms  he was reprimanded for his profaneness  Charles for a while bore this insolence with hypocritical tranquility  and even pretended to be highly edified by their instructions  but    45 notwithstanding this  he only wished for an opportunity of escaping from such a variety of disgusting impertinence   In the mean time the English parliament  alarmed at the King s restitution in Scotland  sent to recall Cromwell from Ireland  where he had carried on the war with his usual success  He had reduced Kilkenny and many other places  and prosecuted his conquests with surprising rapidity  However  he now left the war in that kingdom to be carried on by Ireton  his deputy lieutenant  and returned to England  in obedience to the mandate of the parliament  When he took his seat in the house  the speaker thanked him for the services he had done the commonwealth  They then proceeded to deliberate upon the war with Scotland  They desired to know if Fairfax would conduct the enterprize  Fairfax  a rigid Presbyterian  who had all along fought from principle  declined opposing a nation which he considered as co operating in the same good work for which he had first drawn the sword  he therefore declined the command  sent his commission to the commons  and retired to spend the remainder of his life in privacy and peace   This was an inlet to Cromwell s subsequent power  he was appointed general of the forces of the commonwealth  and soon marched into Scotland at the head of an army
