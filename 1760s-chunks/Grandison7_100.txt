generously did she extol me  how delighted  how affected  was the dearest of men  how delicate was his behaviour to both  the tender friend in her  the beleved wife  were with the nicest propriety  distinguished by him   The dear Lady was too much disordered by her own grateful rapture  to recover a train of reasoning  She told me  however  that she would ponder  weigh  consider every thing that had passed   God give her happiness  prays with her whole heart   Your HARRIET GRANDISON   LETTER LI  Lady GRANDISON  To Mrs  SHIRLEY    Thursday  May 17   LADY Clementina is thoughtful  solemn  and shuns company  Not one word will anybody say to her of the Count of Belvedere  But as he is expected here every day to take his leave  Sir Charles thinks she ought not to be surprized by his coming at unawares  She neither dined nor supped in company yesterday  nor breakfasted with us this morning  She loves  as you have heard  to walk in the garden  She diverts herself often with feeding the deer  which gather about her  as soon as she enters   257 the park  Sir Charles just now passed her in the garden  He asked after her health —My mind is not well  Chevalier —God Almighty heal it  said he  taking her hand  and bowing upon it —Thank you  Sir  Continue your prayers for me  That last conversation  Chevalier—But  adieu   She took a path that led to the park  He looked after her She turned once to see if he did  He bowed  and motioned with his hand as for leave to follow her  She understood his motion  and by hers forbid him —Poor Lady   Thursday Evening  Six o clock   MR  LOWTHER returned from London about an hour ago  He has always been of opinion with the physicians of Italy  that a disorder of mind not hereditary  but circumstanced as Lady Clementina s was  will be in no danger of returning  or of becoming hereditary  unless on some new distress like the former  He expressed his wonder more than once  at her relations acquiescence with her plea  as she made that the principal against marriage  tho  he allowed it to be a noble and generous one in her  And now  in order to justify his opinion  he has taken  of his own accord  the opinions of the most noted London physicians  who entirely agree with him   Saturday  May 19   LADY Clementina has been generously lamenting to me the unhappiness of the cruel Laurana  What I hinted to Sir Charles  said she  of her Love for the Count of Belvedere  is but too true  I have been urged to have compassion  as it is called  on him  He should have shewed some for her  She was proposed to him  He rejected the proposal with haughtiness  But  I believe  knew not how much she loved him  I have faint remembrances of her ravings  as I may call them  for him  to her mother and woman  Sometimes vowing revenge for slighted Love—Poor Laurana was another Olivia in the violence of her passion    258 In the few lucid intervals I had when I was under her management  I always expected that these ravings would end in harder usage of me  Yet even then  when I had calmness enough to pity myself  I pitied her  O that the Count would make her happy  and could think himself happy in her —  She asked me if Sir Charles were not indeed inclined to favour the Count   He wishes you  madam  to marry  answered I  because he thinks  and physicians of Italy and England  and Mr  Lowther  concur with your parents wishes  if there were a man in the world whom you could consent to make happy  the consequence would not only make your whole family so  but yourself  But the choice of the man  he thinks  should be entirely left to you  He thinks that the count  so often refused  ought not to be insisted on  and that time should be given you   Let me ask you  Lady Grandison  as one sister to another  Could you  in my situation  have resolved to give your hand—She stopt  blushed  looked down  I snatched her hand  and lifted it to my lips—Speak your whole Heart  my Clementina  to your Harriet —But yet I will spare you  when I understand your meaning  Noblest of women  I am not Clementina  I could not  situated as you once were  all my friends consenting  and the man—such as you knew him to be  have refused him my hands as well as heart  But what may not be expected from a Lady  who  from a regard to her superior duties could make the most laudable passion of inferior force —You have already overcome the greatest difficulty  and when you can persuade yourself that it is your duty to enter into new▪ measures  I am sure  whatever they may be —  Dear Lady Grandison  say no more—My duty—How delicate are your intimations —What a subject have we
