of the   religion of Cihristians  the first precept in respect to the mutual   intercourse between man and man  is brotherly love to each other    Such a precept bears intrinsic evidence of its divine origin  But   still  human perversion has dared to represent the breach of it as   a duty of that revealed law  by confining the benefit of the obliga    tion to the profession of some particular opinions  and not only   excluding the rest of mankind from the circle of the general brother    hood  but also making it a merit to propagate those opinions  by   the extirpation of all dissenting from them  who are held incapable   of the favour of Heaven  and therefore not entitled to the common   rights of humanity      Of all the people who profess Christianity  the Spaniards are the   most bigoted slaves to this narrow and gross prejudice  With   them  therefore  the natural animosity of war is heightened by   religious abhorrence  against all who iffer in opinion from them    and the laws which more enlightened nations have mutually agreed   in  to restrain its ravages  and facilitate the restitution of peace    are often broken through  with a cruelty disgraceful to the name of   man      In a sally made one night by the besieged  a noble Spaniard    who had penetrated so far into the trenches that it was impossible   for him to get back  fell wounded into the hands of the English    The gallantry with which he had defended himself gained him re    spect from his enemies  and he was treated with that generous   tenderness which brave men feel for each other      Struck with a behaviour so different from what he expected  for   he had been taught to look upon the English as enemies to man    kind  and delighting in the most savage cruelty  he desired to be   led to the commander  to whom  he said  he had something of con    sequence to propose  Accordingly  as soon as his wounds were   dressed  he was conducted to the general  with whom my master     happened to be  and advancing to him with an air of dignity   I     am  come  illustrious chief    said he   to thank you for the humane         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 311     and generous treatment I have received from your brave soldiers    which  if known to my countrymen  would facilitate an accom    modation between them and you  as dread of your power  raised    I am now convinced  by injurious misrepresentations  has hitherto   principally prevented their listening to any terms from you  I   speak not this from ignorance  My father is governor of the city    If you will let him know that I am your captive  he will directly   pay for me whatever ransom you desire  and  on my return  I will   faithfully remove the prejudices which keep up their animosity   against you  and by that means open the way to a reconciliation  till   the pleasure of our sovereigns shall restore peace to their subjects        Such an offer required no arguments to enforce it        The English    answered the general    never abuse the advan    tages they obtain in war  I desire no ransom for your liberty     you are free to return to your father when you please   and if you   can be the means of preventing the effusion of more blood  as you must   be convinced that resistance is in vain  I shall think myself happy   in having an opportunity to show respect to all whom you shall   recommend as your friends  and deserving of it        These words filled the benevolent heart of the Spaniard with joy       I fly    replied he eagerly    to execute a commission  in which   there can be no difficulty  As you are brave and faithful to your   sovereign  you will require no terms which brave men and good   subjects ought not to comply with        The general then prevailed upon him to take some refreshment    after which he and my master went with him to the head of the   lines  where he dismissed him with every mark of respect  attended   by an officer with a flag of truce to bring back the governor s answer    But this pleasing prospect was soon overcast  The officer and he   had not advanced haU the way between the trenches and the town    when they were fired upon by a party of Spaniards  who lay in   ambush among the ruins of some old buildings  At
