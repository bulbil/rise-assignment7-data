the treatment you received will be pardoned for   the sake of the occasion   I own that at a   place where you might have been as particular as   you pleased with me without suspicion  it enraged   me to see you waste those precious moments   with others which I flattered myself to have solely   engrossed   besides  the character of mademoiselle   Sanserre is so well known  that I thought   you would have avoided her of all others  yet   had she forced herself upon you  sure you might   afterwards have come to me  when I had given   you so particular a description of the habit I   should wear  but instead of making any excuse   for a first transgression  you hurry to a second    and pay all your devoirs to another  whom indeed   I knew not at that time  but am since informed   she is one of the maids of honour to princess   Louisa   I must confess I had not resolution   enough to suffer so cruel an injustice  and being   too much overcome by my passion to resent it as   I ought  I left the place  and desired our friend to   do it for me   I find she somewhat exceeded   her commission  but you must forgive her  since   it was her love for me   I am now at her   house  where I impatiently expect you  The   baron is secure for some hours   those we may   pass together  if you still think there is any thing   worth quitting the masquerade for  to be found   in the arms of       Yours    c        P S   If you now fail  no excuse hereafter shall   ever plead your pardon           This letter confirmed Horatio in the belief he had before  that he had   been mistaken by the lady for some favorite person  but who the lady   was  he was as much in the dark as ever  nor would he have given himself   any trouble concerning it  if he had not hoped by that means to have   retrieved the good opinion of Charlotta  He was however impatient to   shew her the letter  as he doubted not but she had seen it delivered to   him  but with all his assiduity he could not obtain one word in private   during the masquerade  and when it was broke up  which was not till near   morning  and they returned to St  Germains  it was impossible  because   he knew she must be in the princess s chamber  as he in that of the   Chevalier St  George  he was therefore obliged to content himself with   the hope that the next day would be more favourable             CHAP  VII        An explanation of the foregoing adventure  with a continuation of the   intrigues of some French ladies  and the policy of mademoiselle Coigney   in regard of her brother        It cannot be supposed that either of our young lovers enjoyed much true   repose that night  tho  the fatigue of the dance might naturally require   it  the one did but just know herself a lover before she felt the worst   torments of that passion in her jealousy  and the other having been   compelled  as it were  to lay open his heart in order to convince his   charmer it had no object but herself in view  knew not but his temerity   in doing so might be imputed to him as no less a crime than that from   which he attempted to be cleared  each had their different anxieties    but those of Horatio were the least severe  because thro  all the   indignation of his mistress he saw marks of an affection  which he could   not have flattered himself with if they had not been evident  and   conscious of his innocence  doubted not but time would both explain that   and reconcile the offended fair   whereas Charlotta was far from being   able to assure herself of her lover s fidelity  she could not conceive   how  in the compass of one night  such a plurality of mistakes should   happen to the same man  and trembled at the reflection that this man    who possibly was the falsest of his sex  should not only have made an   impression on her heart  but also  by the concern she had so unwarily   expressed  have reason to triumph in his conquest   ashamed therefore of   what she felt  and determined to make use of her utmost efforts to   conceal it for the future  if not to conquer it  she thought to shun all   occasions of seeing or speaking to this dangerous invader of
