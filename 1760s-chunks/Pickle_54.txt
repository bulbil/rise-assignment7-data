from the  place where he had contracted such imprudent connections  and send him  to the university  where his education might be completed  and his fancy  weaned from all puerile amusements   This plan had been proposed to his own father  who  as hath been already  observed  stood always neuter in everything that concerned his eldest  son  and as for Mrs  Pickle  she had never heard his name mentioned  since his departure with any degree of temper or tranquility  except  when her husband informed her that he was in a fair way of being ruined  by this indiscreet amour  It was then she began to applaud her own  foresight  which had discerned the mark of reprobation in that vicious  boy  and launched out in comparison between him and Gammy  who  she  observed  was a child of uncommon parts and solidity  and  with the  blessing of God  would be a comfort to his parents  and an ornament to  the family   Should I affirm that this favourite whom she commended so much  was in  every respect the reverse of what she described  that he was a boy of  mean capacity  and  though remarkably distorted in his body  much more  crooked in his disposition  and that she had persuaded her husband to  espouse her opinion  though it was contrary to common sense  as well as  to his own perception   I am afraid the reader will think I represent a  monster that never existed in nature  and be apt to condemn the economy  of my invention  nevertheless  there is nothing more true than every  circumstance of what I have advanced  and I wish the picture  singular  as it is  may not be thought to resemble more than one original   CHAPTER XX    Peregrine is summoned to attend his Uncle  Is more and more hated by his  own Mother  Appeals to his Father  whose Condescension is defeated by  the Dominion of his Wife   But  waiving these reflections  let us return to Peregrine  who received  a summons to attend his uncle  and in a few days arrived with Mr  Jolter  and Pipes at the garrison  which he filled with joy and satisfaction   The alteration  which  during his absence  had happened in his person   was very favourable to his appearance  which  from that of a comely boy   was converted into that of a most engaging youth  He was already taller  than a middle sized man  his shape ascertained  his sinews well knit   his mien greatly improved  and his whole figure as elegant and graceful  as if it had been cast in the same mould with the Apollo of Belvedere   Such an outside could not fail of prepossessing people in his favour   The commodore  notwithstanding the advantageous reports he had heard   found his expectation exceeded in the person of Peregrine  and signified  his approbation in the most sanguine terms  Mrs  Trunnion was struck  with his genteel address  and received him with uncommon marks of  complacency and affection  he was caressed by all the people in the  neighbourhood  who  while they admired his accomplishments  could    6 22 15  3 45 PM   not help pitying his infatuated mother  for being deprived of that  unutterable delight which any other parent would have enjoyed in the  contemplation of such an amiable son   Divers efforts were made by some well disposed people to conquer  if  possible  this monstrous prejudice  but their endeavours  instead of  curing  served only to inflame the distemper  and she never could be  prevailed upon to indulge him with the least mark of maternal regard  On  the contrary  her original disgust degenerated into such inveteracy  of hatred  that she left no stone unturned to alienate the commodore s  affection for this her innocent child  and even practised the most  malicious defamation to accomplish her purpose  Every day  did she abuse  her husband s ear with some forged instance of Peregrine s ingratitude  to his uncle  well knowing that it would reach the commodore s knowledge  at night   Accordingly Mr  Pickle used to tell him at the club  that his hopeful  favourite had ridiculed him in such a company  and aspersed his spouse  on another occasion  and thus retail the little scandalous issue of his  own wife s invention  Luckily for Peregrine  the commodore paid no  great regard to the authority of his informer  because he knew from what  channel the intelligence flowed  besides  the youth had a staunch friend  in Mr  Hatchway  who never failed to vindicate him when he was thus  unjustly accused  and always found argument enough to confute the  assertions of his enemies  But  though Trunnion had been dubious of  the young gentleman s principles  and deaf to the remonstrances of the  lieutenant  Perry was provided with a bulwark strong enough to defend  him from all such assaults  This was no other than his aunt  whose  regard for him was perceived to increase in the same proportion as his  own mother s diminished
