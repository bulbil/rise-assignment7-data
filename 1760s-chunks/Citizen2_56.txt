received in Asia  may be alledged as an objection to such a design  But how readily have several European merchants found admission into regions the most suspecting  under the character of Sanjapins  or northern pilgrims  to such not even China itself denies access   To send out a traveller  properly qualified for these purposes  might be an object of national concern  it would in some measure repair the   173 breaches made by ambition  and might shew that there were still some who boasted a greater name than that of patriots  who professed themselves lovers of men  The only difficulty would remain in chusing a proper person  for so arduous an enterprize  He should be a man of a philosophical turn  one apt to deduce consequences of general utility from particular occurrences  neither swollen with pride  nor hardened by prejudice  neither wedded to one particular system  nor instructed only in one particular science  neither wholly a botanist  nor quite an antiquarian  his mind should be tinctured with miscellaneous knowledge  and his manners humanized by an intercourse with men  He should be  in some measure  an enthusiast to the design  fond of travelling  from a rapid imagination  and an innate love of change  furnished with a body capable sustaining every fatigue  and an heart not easily terrified at danger   Adieu   LETTER CVI  From the same   ONE of the principal tasks I had proposed to myself on my arrival here  was to become acquainted with the names and characters of those now living  who as scholars or wits  had acquired the greatest share of reputation  In order to succeed in this design  I fancied the surest method would be to begin my enquiry among the ignorant    174 judging that his fame would be greatest  which was loud enough to be heard by the vulgar  Thus predisposed  I began the search  but only went in quest of disappointment and perplexity  I found every district had a peculiar famous man of its own  Here the story telling shoemaker had engrossed the admiration on one side of the street  while the bellman  who excelleth at a catch  was in quiet possession of the other  At one end of a lane the sexton was regarded as the greatest man alive  but I had not travelled half its length  till I found an enthusiast teacher had divided his reputation  My landlady perceiving my design  was kind enough to offer me her advice in this affair  It was true  she observed  that she was no judge  but she knew what pleased herself  and if I would rest upon her judgment  I should set down Tom Collins as the most ingenious man in the world  for Tom was able to take off all mankind  and imitate besides a sow and pigs to perfection   I now perceived  that taking my standard of reputation among the vulgar  would swell my catalogue of great names above the size of a Court Calendar  I therefore discontinued this method of pursuit  and resolved to prosecute my enquiry in that usual residence of fame  a bookseller s shop  In consequence of this I entreated the bookseller to let me know who were they who now made the greatest figure either in morals  wit  or learning  Without giving me a direct answer  he pulled a pamphlet from the shelf  The Young Attorney s Guide  there  Sir  cries he  there s a touch for you  fifteen hundred of these moved off in a day  I take the author of this pamphlet either for   175 title  preface  plan  body  or index to be the completest hand in England  I found it was vain to prosecute my enquiry  where my informer appeared so incompetent a judge of merit  so paying for the Young Attorney s Guide  which good manners obliged me to buy  I walked off   My pursuit after famous men now brought me into a print shop  Here  thought I  the painter only reflects the public voice  As every man who deserved it had formerly his statue placed up in the Roman forum  so here probably the pictures of none but such as merit a place in our affections are held up for public sale  But guess my surprize when I came to examine this depositary of noted faces  all distinctions were levelled here  as in the grave  and I could not but regard it as the catacomb of real merit  The brick dust man took up as much room as the truncheoned hero  and the judge was elbowed by the thieftaker  quacks  pimps  and buffoons encreased the groupe  and noted stallions only made room for more noted whores  I had read the works of some of the moderns previous to my coming to England  with delight and approbation  but I found their faces had no place here  the walls were covered with the names of authors I had never known  or had endeavoured to forget  with the little self advertising things of a day who had forced themselves into fashion  but not into fame  I could read at the bottom of some pictures  the names of      and        and          all equally candidates for the vulgar
