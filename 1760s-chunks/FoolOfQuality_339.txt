however  that we   esteem him highly  affect him tenderly  shall think of him  shall         374 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      pray for him  and  lastly  that you saw us drop a grateful tear to   his remembrance      As I could extort no further intelligence from my friend Mr  De   Wit  I parted in a half kind of chagrin  and prepared to pursue my   fugitives  though I knew not what road to take  nor where to turn   me for the purpose  At all adventures  however  I set out on the   way to France   as they appeared to be of that country  as well by   the elegance of their manners as by their fluency in the language      I was attended by eleven of as brave and faithful fellows as ever   thrust themselves between their master and danger      On the fifth or sixth day  as we got on the borders of French   Flanders  in an open and desolate way  with a forest far on the   left  a man rode toward us on the spur  and  approaching  cried   out Help  gentlemen  for heaven s sake   Help to rescue my dear   ladies  who are plundered and carried away by the banditti    They have already killed twenty of my companions  and I alone am   left to cry out for relief  I bid him lead  and we followed      In a few minutes we came where we saw a great number of the   dead and dying covering the sand and thin herbage   but our leader   cried out Stop not here  my noble friends  Yonder they are    yonder they are   They have but just taken away all our horses    luggage  and coach  and are now at the plunder  I am weak   through loss of blood  but will help you the best I may      Here he spurred again toward the enemy  but his horse would   not answer his courage  I then looked about to observe if any   advantage could be taken for I perceived that the ruffians were   still very numerous about thirty who had survived the late com    bat   but seeing that the country was quite open  and that we had   nothing but resolution and our God to help us  I commended myself   to Him in so good a cause  and  putting my horse to speed  I rode   full at the foe  confident of being well and gallantly seconded      When the banditti perceived us  they instantly quitted the   plunder  and  gathering into a group  they prepared their carabines    and discharged them full at us as we drew near      As I happened to be foremost  I received the greatest damage    One of their balls gave me this mark in my neck   another passed   through the flesh of my left shoulder   and another through my   hat  and left this scar in my head      But when we came in upon them  as the Komans say  cominus   ewe  hand to hand  had they doubled their numbers they would   have been as nothing to us  My faithful Irishman levelled half a   score of them with his own hand  and in less than three minutes   we had no opponent in the field  I then rode up to the coach  and   perceived two ladies hi it  pale as death  and sunk senseless to   the bottom      Immediately I ordered James  my surgeon s mate  to take a little   blood from them  and  on their recovery  to follow me  with all my   people  and all the horses  baggage   c   to the nearest inn  Then    feeling my wounds begin to smart  I took my surgeon with me  and   galloped away      In about a league we came to a large house of entertainment    and finding myself sick and qualmish  through the great effusion of         THE FOOL OF QUALITY          375         blood  I had my wounds directly dressed  and  taking a draught of   wine whey  got into a warm bed      After a night of uneasy slumbers  the curtain of my bed was   gently drawn aside  and awaking  I heard a voice say  in soft music   Ah  my dear mamma  it is he   it is he himself       On lifting my feeble eyes  I perceived a vision at my side of a   female appearance  but more wonderful and more lovely than any
