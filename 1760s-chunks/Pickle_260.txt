the light of a lover    Upon our arrival at Valenciennes  he accommodated me with a little  money  for a little was all I would take  and returned to his own city   after we had settled a correspondence by letters  I was detained a  day or two in this place by my indisposition  which increased  but   nevertheless  proceeded to Paris  to make interest for a protection from  the king of France  which that monarch graciously accorded me  in three  days after my first application  and his minister sent orders to all the  governors and intendants of the province towns  to protect me against  the efforts of Lord       in whatever place I should choose to reside    Having returned my thanks at Versailles for this favour  and tarried  a few days at Paris  which was a place altogether unsuitable to the  low ebb of my fortune  I repaired to Lisle  where I intended to fix my  habitation  and there my disorder recurred with such violence  that I  was obliged to send for a physician  who seemed to have been a disciple  of Sangrado  for he scarce left a drop of blood in my body  and yet I  found myself never a whit the better  Indeed  I was so much exhausted by  these evacuations  and my constitution so much impaired by fatigue and  perturbation of mind  that I had no other hope of recovering but that of  reaching England  and putting myself under the direction of a physician  on whose ability I could depend    With this doubtful prospect  therefore  I determined to attempt a  return to my native air  and actually departed from Lisle  in such a  melancholy  enfeebled condition  that I had almost fainted when I was  put into the coach  But before I resolved upon this journey  I was  reduced to the utmost exigence of fortune  so that I could scarce afford  to buy provisions  had it been in my power to eat  and should not have  been able to defray my travelling expenses  had I not been generously  befriended by Lord R   H    who  I am sure  would have done anything  for my case and accommodation  though he has unjustly incurred the  imputation of being parsimonious  and I had no reason to expect any such  favour at his hands    In this deplorable state of health I was conveyed to Calais  being all  the way  as it were  in the arms of death  without having swallowed the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   least sustenance on the road  So much was my indisposition augmented by  the fatigue of the journey  that I swooned when I was brought into the  inn  and had almost expired before I could receive the least assistance  or advice  However  my spirits were a little revived by some bread and  wine  which I took at the persuasion of a French surgeon  who  chancing  to pass by the door  was called up to my relief  Having sent my servant  to Brussels  to take care of my clothes  I embarked in the packet boat   and by the time we arrived at Dover was almost in extremity    Here I found a return coach  in which I was carried to London  and was  put to bed at the house we put up at  more dead than alive  The people  of the inn sent for an apothecary  who administered some cordial that  recalled me to life  and  when I recovered the use of speech  I told him  who I was  and desired him to wait upon Dr  S    and inform him of my  situation  A young girl  who was niece to the landlord s wife  seeing  me unattended  made a tender of her service to me  and I accepted the  offer  as well as of a lodging in the apothecary s house  to which I was  conveyed as soon as my strength would admit of my removal  There I was  visited by my physician  who was shocked to find me in such a dangerous  condition  However  having considered my case  he perceived that  my indisposition proceeded from the calamities I had undergone  and  encouraged me with the hope of a speedy cure  provided I could be kept  easy and undisturbed  I was accordingly attended with all imaginable  care  my lord s name being never mentioned in my hearing  because I  considered him as the fatal source of all my misfortunes  and in a month  I recovered my health  by the great skill and tenderness of my  doctor  who now finding me strong enough to encounter fresh troubles   endeavoured to persuade me  that it would be my wisest step to return  to my husband  whom at that time he had often occasion to see  But I  rejected his proposal  commencing a new lawsuit for separation  and took  a small house in St  James s square    About this time my woman returned
