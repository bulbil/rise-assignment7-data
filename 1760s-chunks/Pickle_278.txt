that prevailed  of my lover s being actually engaged in a treaty of  marriage  however  I gave little credit to this rumour till I was  obliged to go to town about business  and there I heard the same  information confidently affirmed  Though I still considered it as a  vague surmise  I wrote to him an account of what I had heard  and   in his answer  which is still in my possession  he assured me  with  repeated vows and protestations  that the report was altogether false   Satisfied with this declaration  I returned to his house  and  though  the tale was incessantly thundered in my ears  still believed it void of  all foundation  till my suspicion was awakened by a very inconsiderable  circumstance    One day  on his return from hunting  I perceived he had a very fine  pair of Dresden ruffles on his shirt  which I could not suppose he would  wear at such a rustic exercise  and  therefore  my fears took the alarm   When I questioned him about this particular of his dress  his colour  changed  and though he attempted to elude my suspicion  by imputing  it to a mistake of his servant  I could not rest satisfied with this    6 22 15  3 45 PM   account of the matter  but inquired into the truth with such eagerness  and penetration  that he could not deny he had been to make a visit   By degrees  I even extorted from him a confession  that he had engaged  himself further than he ought to have proceeded  without making me  acquainted with his design  though he endeavoured to excuse his conduct   and pacify my displeasure  by saying  that the affair would not be  brought to bear for a great while  and  perhaps  might never come to a  determination but he was in great confusion  and  indeed  hardly knew  what he said    I would have quitted his house that moment  had not he beforehand  obtained a promise that I would take no rash resolution of that kind   and put it out of my power to procure any method of conveyance by  which I could make my retreat  I gave no vent to reproaches  but only  upbraided him with his having permitted me to return  in ignorance  to  the country  after I was once fairly gone  upon which he swore that he  could not bear the thoughts of parting with me  This declaration was a  mystery at that time  but I have been since so fully satisfied of his  reasons for his conduct  that I heartily acquit him of all injustice  to me  And  indeed  it is my sincere opinion  that  if ever young man  deserved to be happy  he is certainly entitled to that privilege   and  if I may be allowed to judge  has a heart susceptible of the most  refined enjoyment    The violence of the grief and consternation which I suffered from this  stroke having a little subsided  I deliberated with myself about the  measures I should take  and determined to leave his house some day when  he should be abroad  I was encouraged in this resolution by the advice  of our Scotch friend  who came about this time from London  on a visit  to his fellow traveller  We thought such an abrupt departure would be  less shocking than to stay and take a formal leave of my lover  whose  heart was of such a delicate frame  that  after I told him I should one  day withdraw myself in his absence  he never came home from the chase   or any other avocation  without trembling with apprehension that I had  escaped    After he had been some time accustomed to these fears by my previous  intimation  I at length decamped in good earnest  though my heart  ached upon the occasion  because I left him loving and beloved  for  his affection was evident  notwithstanding the step he had taken by the  advice and importunity of all his relations  who laid a disagreeable  restraint upon his inclinations  while they consulted his interest in  every other particular    While I halted in the next great town  until I could be supplied  with fresh horses  I was visited by a gentleman who had been formerly  intimate with my lover  but a breach had happened in their friendship   and he now came to complain of the treatment he had received  Perceiving  that I was not in a humour to listen to his story  he shifted the  conversation to my own  and observed  that I had been extremely  ill used  I told him that I was of a different opinion  that it was not  only just  but expedient  that a young man of Mr     s fortune should  think of making some alliance to strengthen and support the interest of  his family  and that I had nothing to accuse him of but his letting  me remain so long in ignorance of his intention  He then gave me to  understand
