flirting  but were soon joined by our honoured parent  who interrupted our tête à tête  He told Florence how much he was obliged to me  and expressed his gratitude to myself  in terms which left no doubt of our being a very happy family  I made the most of so favourable a disposition  by telling the good man  that if he would bestow on me an acknowledgment the nearest to my heart  he must hasten my marriage with his daughter  My eagerness was not taken amiss  He assured me  that in three days at latest I should be a happy bridegroom  and that instead of six thousands ducats  the fortune he had promised to give my wife  he would make it up ten  as a substantial proof how deeply he felt himself indebted to me for the service I had rendered him   Here we were  therefore  quite at home with our good friend Jerome de Moyadas  sumptuously entertained  and catching every now and then a vista vision of ten thousand ducats  with which we proposed to march off abruptly from Merida  Our transports  however  were not without their alloy  It was by no means improbable that within three days the bonâ fide son of Juan Velez de la Membrilla might come and interrupt our sport  This fear had for its foundation more than the weakness of our nerves  On the very next morning  a sort of clodpole  with a portmanteau across his shoulders  knocked at the door of Florence s father  I was not at home at the time  but my colleague had to bear the brunt of it  Sir  said the rustic to our sagacious friend  I belong to the young gentleman at Calatrava who is to be your son in law    to Signor de la Membrilla  We have both just come off our journey  he will be here in an instant  and sent me forward to prepare you for his arrival  Hardly had these unaccountable tidings been announced  when the master appeared in person  which stretched the old fellow s blinkers into a stare  and put Moralez a little to the blush   Young Pedro was what we call a tall fellow of his inches  He began at once paying his compliments to the master of the house  but the good man did not give him time to finish his speech  and turning towards my partner in iniquity  asked what was the meaning of all this  Hereupon Moralez  whose power of face was not to be exceeded by any human impudence  boldly asserted our identity  and said to the old gentleman    Sir  these two men here before you belong to the gang which pillaged us on the highway  I have a perfect recollection of their features  and in particular could swear to him who has the effrontery to call himself the son of Signor Juan Velez de la Membrilla  The old citizen gulped down the lies of Moralez like nectar  and told the intruders  on the supposition of their being the impostors    Gentlemen  you are come the day after the fair  the trick was a very good one  but it will not pass  the enemy has taken the ground before you  Pedro de la Membrilla has been under this roof since yesterday  Have all your wits about you  answered the young man from Calatrava  you are nursing a viper in your bosom  Be assured that Juan Velez de la Membrilla has neither chick nor child but myself  And what relation is the hangman to you  replied the old dupe  you are better known than liked in this house  Can you look this young man in the face  or can you deny that you robbed his master  If I were anywhere but under your roof  rejoined Pedro in a rage  I would punish the insolence of this scoundrel who fancies to pass me off for a highwayman  He is indebted for his safety to your presence  which puts a curb upon my choler  Good sir  pursued he  you are grossly imposed on  I am the favoured youth to whom your brother Austin has promised your daughter  Is it your pleasure for me to produce the whole correspondence with my father on the subject of the impending match  Will you be satisfied with Florence s picture sent me by him as a present a little while before his death   No  put in the old burgess crustily  the picture will work just as strongly on my conviction as the letters  I am perfectly aware by what chance they all fell into your hands  and if you will take a stupid fellow s advice  Merida will soon be rid of such rubbish  A quick march may save you a trouncing  This is beyond all bearing  screamed out the young royster with an overwhelming vehemence  My name shall never be stolen from me  and assumed by a common cheat with impunity  neither shall my person be confounded with that of a free booter  There are those in this town who can identify me  they are forth coming  and shall expose the fallacy by which you are prejudiced against me  With this assurance he withdrew  attended by his servant  and Moralez kept possession of the field  The adventure had even the effect of determining Jerome de Moyadas to fix the wedding
