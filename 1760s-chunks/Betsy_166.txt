great fright  cried   For Heaven s sake  Sir Frederick  what is the   matter  I hope nothing in my house has given your honour any cause of   complaint     No  no  it is over now   cried he   your house is become a   temple  and this is the divinity that honours it with her presence  this   Græcian Venus   Miss Betsy was too much accustomed to company to be   easily abashed  and answered briskly   If you mean the compliment to me    Sir  the Græcian Venuses are all painted fat  and I have no resemblance   of that perfection     Only in your face  Madam   returned he   Such   sparkling eyes  such a complexion  such a mouth  In your shape you are   Helen of Troy     That Helen of Troy   said Miss Betsy  with an ironical   smile   I think  was a Græcian princess  and must also be fat  or she   would not have been reputed a beauty there        The baronet  finding by this he had been guilty of an absurdity when he   intended a fine speech  thought to salve up the matter by saying   Sure    you are a Diana  then     Worse and worse   cried Miss Betsy   I beseech   you  Sir  compare me to no such boisterous goddess  that runs up and   down  bare footed and bare legged  hunting wild boars in the   forest     What shall I call you then   resumed he   O  tell me by what   name you will be worshipped     The lady s name  Sir Frederick   cried   Mrs  Modely   is Miss Betsy Thoughtless     Betsy   said he   then Betsy   let it be  Betsy shall henceforth become more famous than Cytherea was   of old        He was going on with this fulsome stuff  in which he was often exposed   by the ready wit of Miss Betsy  when a maid belonging to the house came   in  and told her that a gentleman in a hackney coach was at the door    and desired to speak with her   With me   cried she  not able to guess   who should have followed her there   Pray  call my footman  and bid him   ask the person s name that enquires for me   The maid did as she was   ordered  and Miss Betsy s servant presently after brought her this   intelligence   Mr  Munden  Madam   said he   not finding you at home    has taken the liberty to call on you here  in order to conduct you where   you are to pass the evening     He must be a happy man  indeed  that   dare take such liberties   cried Sir Frederick  somewhat fiercely   Many   take more than they are allowed to do   said Miss Betsy   Go   continued   she to the fellow   and tell him my mind is changed  that I cannot leave   the company I am with  and will not go   Mr  Munden having received this   message  ordered the coachman to drive away  very much dissatisfied  as   the reader may easily suppose       Miss Betsy  the day before  had agreed to pass this evening with the   ladies at St  James s  and some others  to play at commerce  a game then   very much in vogue  Mr  Munden was to be one of the company  and calling   at Miss Betsy s lodgings  in hopes of having some time with her before   this meeting  the maid  who had not lived long enough with her mistress   to know her humour  presently told him  she was only gone to her   mantua maker s  and gave him directions to the house  he also thinking   it no indecorum to call on her at the house of a woman of that   profession  had reason enough to be mortified at the repulse he met with   for so doing       As to Miss Betsy  though she was a little angry at the freedom Mr    Munden had taken  yet she was in reality much more pleased  and this for   two reasons  first  because she saw it gave her new lover some jealous   apprehensions  and  secondly  because it furnished her with a plausible   pretence for complying with his entreaties to stay  which  she   protested  she would not on any terms have been prevailed upon to do    but to prevent either him or Mrs  Modely from suspecting she would go   where Mr  Munden had desired
