what they alleged  an air of probability  and even of truth  They swore that Mr  M   had  taken out an action against him for a very large sum of money  that they  had actually seen the writ  that the intention of it was to throw him  into prison for life  and ruin his cause  in consequence of an agreement  made by him with Lord A    and his other enemies  to retrieve the money  that he had laid out in the cause    This plausible tale was enforced with such an air of truth  candour   and earnest concern for his safety  and was strengthened by so many  imprecations and corroborating circumstances of their invention  as  would have staggered one of much greater experience and knowledge of  mankind than Mr  A   could be supposed at that time to possess  The    6 22 15  3 45 PM   notion of perpetual imprisonment  and the certain ruin they made him  believe his cause was threatened with  worked upon his imagination to  such a degree  that he suffered himself to be led like a lamb to the  slaughter by this artful band of villains  who secreted him at the  lodgings of one P    an intimate of G   s  for several days  under  colour of his being hunted by bailiffs employed by Mr  M    where he was  not only obliged by them to change his name  but even his wife was not  suffered to have access to him    Their design was to have sold him  or drawn him into a ruinous  compromise with his adversaries  for a valuable consideration to  themselves  But as no ties are binding among such a knot of villains   the rest of the conspirators were jockeyed by G    who  in order to  monopolize the advantage to himself  hurried his prize into the country   and secreted him even from his confederates  in a place of concealment  one hundred miles from London  under the same ridiculous pretence of  M   s having taken out a writ against him  and of bailiffs being in  pursuit of him everywhere round London    He was no sooner there  than G    as a previous step to the other  villainy he intended  tricked him out of a bond for six thousand pounds   under colour of his having a person ready to advance the like sum upon  it  as an immediate fund for carrying on his cause  assuring him  at  the same time  that he had a set of gentlemen ready  who were willing  to advance twenty five thousand pounds more for the same purpose  and to  allow him five hundred pounds a year for his maintenance  till his cause  should be made an end of  provided that Mr  M   should have no further  concern with him and his cause    Mr  A    having by this time received some intimations of the deceit  that had been put upon him  made answer  that he should look upon  himself as a very ungrateful monster indeed  if he deserted a person who  had saved his life  and so generously ventured his own  together with  his fortune  in his cause  until he should first be certain of the truth  of what was alleged of him  and absolutely rejected the proposal  G     who had no other view in making it  than to cover the secret villainy he  meditated against him  and to facilitate the execution thereof  easily  receded from it  when he found Mr  A   so averse to it  and undertook  nevertheless to raise the money  adding  that he might  if he pleased   return to Mr  M   whenever it was secured  The whole drift of this  pretended undertaking to raise the twenty five thousand pounds  was only  to lay a foundation for a dexterous contrivance to draw Mr  A   unwarily  into the execution of a deed  relinquishing all his right and title   under a notion of its being a deed to secure the repayment of that sum    G   having  as he imagined  so far paved the way for the execution of  such a deed  enters into an agreement with an agent  employed for that  purpose by Mr  A   s adversaries  purporting that in consideration of  the payment of a bond for six thousand pounds  which he  G    had  as  he pretended  laid out in Mr  A   s cause  and of an annuity of seven  hundred pounds a year  he was to procure for them from Mr  A   a deed  ready executed  relinquishing all right and title to the A   estate and  honours  Everything being prepared for the execution of this infernal  scheme  unknown to Mr  A    G   then thought proper to send for him  to town from his retirement  in order  as he pretended  to execute a
