life  Another day was  spent  and another night passed away more tranquil and refreshing  and I  rose with my thoughts fixed on the kind Les Roches  and in anxious  impatience for his return  The day advanced  but my friend still  delayed his coming At length the charitable Abbot appeared  not with a  front of placid serenity  but gloomy and contracted  full of anxiety and  grief  which like the infectious blast that at once destroys the fruits  of nature  filled my soul instantly with I knew not what dreadful and  ominous presage    Unhappy son  said he  Malleon has discovered  if not  the place of thy concealment  at least that thou art concealed in this  island  thanks to the indiscretion of some of thy countrymen which  disclosed the name of their commander  His jealousy points to Les  Roches as the author of thy escape  vengeance is denounced against him   and this moment the good Les Roches lies in the damp dungeon    For me   said I  And is charity so great a crime  Is tyranny suffered to rage  thus without controul in France  For me doth my kind preserver endure  the pain of captivity — With a look in which affection and authority  were united  the father here repressed my emotion  Son  said he  the  time calls for calm and determined measures  In this place thou can st  not longer abide   Thy coming was not secret  and should it reach Mal leon  alas  I fear  the impetuosity of that proud Count might drive him to violate the  sacred privileges of our house  Les Roches  though now unable to assist  thee  is yet anxious still for thy preservation  The peasant sent by  him to inform me of thy dangers  waits to conduct thee faithfully to the  vessel prepared to convey thee to Rochelle  Thither thy ransomed friends  have already directed their course  and from thence some fortunate event  may conduct thee to thy native country  Tarry here  until the shades of  night may conceal thy departure  Then issue forth  and may all good  angels hold thee in their protection  Our prayers  —Here pity stopped  his voice  and filled his eyes with tears  whilst I in broken accents  laboured to express my sense of his goodness  my pity for the kind and  injured Les Roches  and my indignation at the baseness of Mal leon  He  saw my passionate disorder  he entreated  he exhorted  and he reproved   till perceiving by my wandering and inattention  that my mind was too  busily engaged to admit his spiritual counsels  he retired and  abandoned me to my own reflections  and these were intirely confined to  the misfortunes of the generous and kind Les Roches  I accused myself as  the sole author of his sufferings  and abhorred the mean design of  flying  when I had involved my friend in danger  What can the malice of  Mal leon inflict on me  it was thus I reasoned  if to purchase the  liberty of my preserver  I resign myself into his power  To kill  me —That were unnatural  The man I never injured cannot proceed to such  an extravagance of calm unprovoked cruelty  Or if he could  my country  could not long be unacquainted with my fate  and would  he must be well  assured  discharge all it s vengeance on my destroyer  And shall the  fear of bearing the insult and triumph of my rival in arms  shall the  tediousness of captivity or the severities of a prison  drive me from  the man who suffers for his goodness towards me  Shall I sacrifice  his freedom  perhaps his life  only to hasten my return to England —The  thought appeared odious and dishonourable  I instantly formed the  darling resolution of purchasing the freedom of Les Roches  by  delivering myself into the hands of my enemy  and spent the remaining  hours of day in that satisfaction and complacency which arise from the  flattering ideas of self applause  The sun declined  darkness gradually  prevailed  and at length brought on the hour of my departure  And now   firmly and obstinately settled in my dangerous purpose  I received the  benediction of the reverend Abbot  with a countenance of fixed  serenity  which he  good man  commended  as an indication of my  reliance upon heaven  Touched with his goodness  I could not suppress  the tears that started from me  and interrupted my grateful  acknowledgements of his charitable care  and his zealous prayers for my  protection  Our hands were clasped in each other  our eyes rather than  our tongues spoke the emotions of our breasts  until the father  who  first made the effort to repress his passion  urged the necessity of my  departure  and while he ardently commended me to every holy faint  I  issued forth under the direction of the peasant my conductor     I had not departed many paces from the Abbey  when addressing myself to  the guide  with a voice which bespoke a deliberate and determined  resolution  I
