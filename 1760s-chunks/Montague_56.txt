 and a certain involuntary attention  and softness of manner I have to all women  has supposed me in love with her  and with a frankness I cannot but admire  and a delicacy not to be described  has let me know I am far from being indifferent to her       I was at first extremely embarrassed  but when I had reflected a moment  I considered that the ladies  though another may be the object  always regard with a kind of complacency a man who loves  as one who acknowledges the power of the sex  whereas an indifferent is a kind of rebel to their empire  I considered also that the confession of a prior inclination saves the most delicate vanity from being wounded  and therefore determined to make her the confidante of my tenderness for Emily  leaving her an opening to suppose that  if my heart had been disengaged  it could not have escaped her attractions       I did this with all possible precaution  and with every softening friendship and politeness could suggest  she was shocked at my confession  but soon recovered herself enough to tell me she was highly flattered by this proof of my confidence and esteem  that she believed me a man to have only the more respect for a woman who by owning her partiality had told me she considered me not only as the most amiable  but the most noble of my sex  that she had heard  no love was so tender as that which was the child of friendship  but that of this she was convinced  that no friendship was so tender as that which was the child of love  that she offered me this tender  this lively friendship  and would for the future find her happiness in the consideration of mine       Do you know  my dear  that  since this confession  I feel a kind of tenderness for her  to which I cannot give a name  It is not love  for I love  I idolize another  but it is softer and more pleasing  as well as more animated  than friendship       You cannot conceive what pleasure I find in her conversation  she has an admirable understanding  a feeling heart  and a mixture of softness and spirit in her manner  which is peculiarly pleasing to men  My Emily will love her  I must bring them acquainted  she promises to come to Quebec in May  I shall be happy to shew her every attention when there       I have seen the lands  and am pleased with them  I believe this will be my residence  if Emily  as I cannot avoid hoping  will make me happy  I shall declare myself as soon as I return  but must continue here a few days longer  I shall not be less pleased with this situation for its being so near Madame Des Roches  in whom Emily will find a friend worthy of her esteem  and an entertaining lively companion       Adieu  my dear Lucy   Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS       I have fixed on the loveliest spot on earth  on which to build a house for my mother  do I not expect too much in fancying she will follow me hither     LETTER LXXXVI   86   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  March 13   STILL with Madame Des Roches  appearances are rather against him  you must own  Lucy  but I will not say all I think to you  Poor Emily  we dispute continually  for she will persist in defending his conduct  she says  he has a right to marry whoever he pleases  that her loving him is no tie upon his honor  especially as he does not even know of this preference  that she ought only to blame the weakness of her own heart  which has betrayed her into a false belief that their tenderness was mutual  this is pretty talking  but he has done every thing to convince her of his feeling the strongest passion for her  except making a formal declaration       She talks of returning to England the moment the river is open  indeed  if your brother marries  it is the only step left her to take  I almost wish now she had married Sir George  she would have had all the douceurs of marriage  and as to love  I begin to think men incapable of feeling it  some of them can indeed talk well on the subject  but self interest and vanity are the real passions of their souls  I detest the whole sex       Adieu   A  FERMOR     LETTER LXXXVII   87   To the Earl of —       My Lord   Silleri  March 13   I GENERALLY distrust my own opinion when it differs from your Lordship s  but in this instance I am most certainly in the right  allow me to say  nothing can be more ill judged than your Lordship s design of retiring into a small circle  from that world of which you have so long been one of the most brilliant ornaments  What you say of the disagreableness of age  is by no means applicable to your Lordship  nothing is in this respect so fallible as the parish register
