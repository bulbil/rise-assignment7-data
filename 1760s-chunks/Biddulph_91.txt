at present in too critical a suspence to trust the knowledge of it to anybody  If Mr Faulkland fails in his design  his avowal of it will be far from serving me  Sir George was with us for a few minutes to day  only to exult in Mr Faulkland’s recovered credit  Has he not well explained himself  said he  Oh  I knew there must have been some mystery at the bottom of that conduct which surprized us all so much  There’s a man for you  Shew me another who would carry his noble disinterested love to such lengths     My mother did not like that he should run on in that strain  and therefore stopped him  The end crowns all  Sir George  let us see how your friend will conduct himself through this ticklish affair  Let him get through it how he will  answered my brother a little bluntly  I think Sidney has obligations to him she ought never to forget   December 16  More intelligence  my dear  stranger and stranger still  I am sorry I sent off my last packet  as I am sure you must be impatient for the conclusion of Mr Faulkland’s adventure  and then what sorry stuff has the interval been filled up with  but I will now make you amends  My mother is better too  thank God  and every thing promises well   Sir George has had a second packet from Boulogne  Take the continuation of Mrs Gerrarde’s history as follows   How rude is the hand of sickness  my Bidulph  it had like to have spoiled one of the best projects that ever was undertaken  and consigned to oblivion an action worthy of immortality  I have been very ill since I last wrote to you  the disorder  which I then complained of  turned out to be an ugly fever  and I was for three days in extreme danger  Mrs Gerrarde was  during that time  closely attended by Pivet  whose services I dispensed with on that account  He told me she appeared uneasy at my situation  and enquired constantly  and kindly too  after my health  When I grew well enough to sit up  I begged the favour of seeing her in my chamber  She came very readily  and seemed downright anxious for my recovery  I told her I hoped she had been treated with proper care and respect during my sickness  She said Mr Pivet was a very obliging  good natured man  and had endeavoured to make her confinement as easy to her as possible   The plan she had formed of turning to the most lasting advantage the inclination she supposed I had for her  inclined her to assume a very different behaviour from what was natural to her  The weakness of my condition  while it afforded me a pretence for a more cold and languid behaviour than I could with any colour have put on at another time  gave her an opportunity of playing off her arts  and facilitated my design beyond my hopes   She was seated at my bed side  our first conversation consisted of nothing but complaints on my side  and condolements on her’s  I sighed several times  and she sighed in return  Mrs Gerrarde  said I     you are afflicted  but my illness has no share in your concern  Something else oppresses you  you regret the being separated from Mr Arnold  and I am always the object of your hatred  Neither one nor t’other  answered she  in a kind voice  ’Tis impossible to hate you  you know it is not in nature for a woman to hate such a man as Mr Faulkland  As for Mr Arnold  though I own my former weakness in regard to him  yet I hope I have something to plead in my excuse  I was married very early to an old man  and had never experienced the happiness of reciprocal love  he died  and left me destitute  Mr Arnold’s generous  though I must confess unwarrantable passion  rescued me from distress  I did not know he was married when I first unwarily accepted of his addresses  and it was too late to retreat before I found it out  otherwise the universe should not have tempted me to have listened to him   In the midst of the affluence I obtained from him  it often grieved me to think of the injury I did his wife  There is nothing  Mr Faulkland  so grating to a generous mind  and I think I may venture to assert that mine is one  as to live in a state of dependence  and  at the same time  owe that very dependence to a vice that you disdain   I was delighted to find that she had got into this strain  it was the thing I wished  but durst hardly hope for without abundance of trouble on my part  and a dissimulation that was irksome to me  I knew she had studied this speech  and got it by rote to answer her own purpose  but in this  as is generally the case of designing people  she overshot herself  and became the dupe to her own artifice  I laid hold of the cue she gave  Oh  madam  you charm me  go on  go on  now indeed you shew a generous
