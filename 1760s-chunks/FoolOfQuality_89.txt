own   naughty passions   and I have seen a giant of a pedagogue  raving    raging  and foaming  over a group of shrinking infants  like a kite   over a crouching parcel of young turkeys      There are  I admit  some parents and preceptors  who annex   other motives to that of the rod  they promise money  gaudy   clothes  and sweetmeats  to children   and  in their manner of ex    patiating on the use and value of such articles  they often excite  in   their little minds  the appetites of avarice  of vanity  and sensuality     they also sometimes add the motive of what they call emulation    but which  in fact  is rank envy  by telling one boy how much   happier  or richer  or finer  another is than himself      Now  though envy and emulation are often confounded in terms    there are not two things more different  both in respect to their         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  67     object and in respect to their operation  the object of envy is   the person  and not the excellence  of any one  but the object   of emulation is excellence alone  as when CHKIST  exciting us to   be emulous of the excellence of God himself  bids us be perfect    as our Father which is in heaven is perfect  the operation of   envy is to pull others down   but the act of emulation is to exalt   ourselves to some eminence or height proposed   the eyes of envy   are sore and sickly  and hate to look at the light   but emulation   has the eye of an eagle  and soars  while it gazes in the face   of the sun      Were tutors half as solicitous  throughout their academies  to   make men of worth as to make men of letters  there are a   hundred pretty artifices  very obvious to be contrived and practised   for the purpose  They might institute caps of shame and wreaths   of honour in their schools   they might have little medals  ex    pressive of particular virtues  to be fixed on the breast of the   achiever till forfeited by default   and on the report of any boy s   having performed a signal action of good nature  friendship  grati    tude  generosity  or honour   a place of eminence might be appointed   for him to sit on  while all the rest of the school should bow   in deference as they passed  Such arts as these  I say  with that   distinguishing affection and approbation which all persons ought   to show to children of merit  would soon make a new nation of   infants  and consequently of men      When you  Mr  Vindex  iniquitously took upon you to chastise   my most noble and most incomparable boy  you first whipped him   for his gallant and generous avowal of the truth   and next  you   barbarously flayed him because he refused to betray those who had   confided in his integrity      When I behold so many scoundrels walking openly throughout   the land who are styled your honour  and your honour  and who   impudently usurp the most exalted of all characters the character   of a gentleman   I no longer wonder  when I reflect that they have   been principled  or rather unprincipled  by such tutors as Mr    Vindex      The merry devils  Mr  Vindex  who took you in hand  were not   of a species so alienated from humanity as you might imagine    they have  therefore  appointed me their vehicle of some smart    money in recompense  but desire no further advantage from your   company or instructions      So saying  Mr  Fenton put a purse of five and twenty guineas   into the hands of the preceptor  and withdrew without speaking   another word      Friend  Upon my credit  this Mr  Fenton I long to know some    thing more of him he is a sensible kind of a man  and has given   us some very valuable hints upon education  But may I be so   free with you as to drop some general remarks upon the whole of   what I have read      Author  Free  sir   by all means   as free as you please  to be   sure  Believe me  you cannot do me a greater favour      Friend  Why  there s the plague on t  now   you begin to     p 2         68 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      kindle already
