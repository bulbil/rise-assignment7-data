 and the Bishop led him out  in order to enquire into the occasion of my warmth   When I turned to the company  I found the dear Clementina  supported by the two Marchionesses  and attended by Camilla  just by me  passing towards the door  in order  it seems  at her motion  to withdraw  She stopt  Ah  Chevalier  said she  and reclining her head on her mother s bosom  seemed ready to faint  I took one hand  as it hung down lifelessly extended  her mother held the other   and  kneeling  pressed it with my lips—Forgive me  Ladies  forgive me  Lady Clementina —My soul overflowed with tenderness  tho  the moment before it was in a tumult of another kind  for she cast down her eyes upon me with a benignity  that for a long time they all afterwards owned they had not beheld  I could not say more  I arose  She moved on to the door  and when there  turned her head  straining her neck to look after me  till she was out of the room  I was a statue for a few moments  till the Count  snatching my hand  and Father Marescotti s  who stood nearest him  We see to what the malady is owing—Father  you must join their hands —Chevalier  you will be Page  7 a Catholic —Will you not —O that you would  said the Father—Why  why  joined in the Count  did we refuse the so earnestly requested interview  a year and half ago   The young Marchioness returned  weeping—They will not permit me to stay  My sister  my dear sister  is in fits —O Sir  turning graciously to me  you are—I will not say what you are—But I shall not be is danger of disobeying my Lord  on your account   Just then entered the General  led in by the Bishop  Now  brother  said the latter  if you will not be generous  be  however  just—Chevalier  Were you not a little hasty   I was  my Lord  But surely the General was unseasonable   Perhaps I was   There is as great a triumph  my Lord  said I  in a due acknowlegement  as in a victory  Know me  my Lords  as a man incapable of meanness  who will assert himself  but who  from the knowlege he has of his own heart  wishes at his soul to be received as the unquestionably disinterested friend of this whole family  Excuse me  my Lords  I am obliged to talk greatly  because I would not wish to act petulantly  But my soul is wounded by those distresses  which had not  I am sorry to say it  a little while ago  a first place in your heart   Do you reproach me  Grandison   I need not  my Lord  if you feel it as such  But indeed you either know not me  or forget yourself  And now  having spoken all my mind  I am ready to ask your pardon for any thing that may have offended you in the manner  I snatched his hand so suddenly  I hope not rudely  but rather fervently  that he started—Receive me  my Lord  as a Friend  I will deserve your friendship   Tell me  brother  said he to the Bishop  what I shall say to this strange man  Shall I be angry or pleased   Page  8 Be pleased  my Lord  replied the Prelate   The General embraced me—Well  Grandison  you have overcome  I was unseasonable  You were passionate  Let us forgive each other   His Lady stood suspended  not being able to guess at the occasion of this behaviour  and renewed friendship  The Count was equally surprised  Father Marescotti seemed also at a loss  The Marquis had withdrawn   We sat down  and reasoned variously on what had passed  with regard to the unhappy Lady  according to the hopes and fears which actuated the bosoms of each  But I cannot help thinking  that had this interview been allowed to pass with less surprize to her  she might have been spared those fits  with the affecting description of which the young Marchioness alarmed us  till Camilla came in with the happy news  that she was recovering from them  and that her mother was promising her another visit from me  in hopes it would oblige her  tho  it was not what she required   I took this opportunity to put into the hands of the young Marchioness  sealed up  the opinions of the physicians I had consulted in England  on the case of Clementina  requesting that she would give it to her mother  in order to have it considered   The Bishop withdrew  to acquaint Jeronymo  in the way he thought best  with what had passed in this first interview with his sister  resolving not to take any notice of the little sally of warmth between the General and me   I hope to make the pride and passion of this young nobleman of use to myself  by way of caution  For am I not naturally too much inclined to the same fault  O Dr  Bartlett
