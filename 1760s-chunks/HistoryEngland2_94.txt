and a dissention began  which still continues to subsist   The declaration of war with Spain  soon after  shewed how well grounded Mr  Pitt s measures were  when he proposed a former rupture  However  the union of France and Spain  and the disunion of our own ministry at home  did not seem to retard the progress of our arms  The island of Martinico was conquered by Admiral Rodney and General Monckton  the island of St  Lucia surrendered soon after to Captain Harvey  Granada was taken by Brigadier Walsh  and all the neutral islands submitted to the English dominion  But a bolder blow was struck against the Spaniards  a powerful fleet  and an army of fifteen thousand men  was sent against the Havannah  the key of all their possessions in South America  It made a noble resistance  but in the end was taken  And now the enemies of Great Britain were humbled on every side  the French left without trade or shipping  the source of Spanish oppulence interrupted  nothing remained for them  but to ask for peace  upon such terms as we were pleased to grant  A negociation was accordingly once more begun between the three powers  by the intervention   254 of the King of Sardinia s Ambassador  the Duke of Bedford was sent over to Paris  and the Duke De Nivernois came to London  and  at length  the definitive treaty was signed at Paris by the Duke of Bedford  the Duc De Praslin  and the Marquis De Grimaldi  and arrived in London February 19  1763  In order to purchase peace the French gave up all Canada  their right to the neutral islands  the fort of Senegal  and their right of fishing on the coasts of Newfoundland and the gulph of St  Lawrence  but at a certain distance from shore  Spain also gave up  on her part  the extensive country of Florida  so that the English empire was thus greatly enlarged  and  if we compute its strength by the quantity of land included in its dominions  it can now boast more power than even the great Roman empire   But no country should build upon remote strength  true power must always subsist at home  When the branches of a large empire become more powerful than the original stem  instead of assisting it s growth  they only overload and exhaust it nourishment  The discontents  therefore  which many have expressed at the conclusion of the late peace  that we did not insist upon harder terms  and increase our possessions  were ill founded  since it is probable we are already possessed of more than government can manage  There is ever a certain extent of empire which politics are able to wield  beyond this her magnificence is but empty pomp  and her size but corpulence      unnumbered   A CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF ENGLISH EVENTS     TABLE I  Of the Saxon Heptarchy   256        A  D   1   VORTIGERN first King of Kent   455  2   Kingdom of the South Saxons contained Surry and Sussex  continued one hundred and thirteen years         Ella  first King thereof  and  488     Ethelwolph  first Christian King   3   Kingdom of the West Saxons contained what we now call Cornwall  Devon  Dorset  Somerset  Wilts  Berks  and Hampshire  continued three hundred years  began  519     Cherdick  first King thereof  and        Hingels  first Christian King      4   Kingdom of Northumberland at this time contained the counties of York  Durham  Lancaster  Westmorland  Cumberland  and Nottinghamshire  and continued three hundred and seventy nine years  began to be so  527     Ella and Ida  the first Kings thereof  and        Edwin  the first Christian King      5   Kingdom of Mercia contained the counties of Oxford  Gloucester  Worcester  Salop  Cheshire  Stafford  Warwick  Buckingham  Huntingdon  with part of Hertford  Northampton  Rutland  Lincoln  Leicester  Derby  and Nottinghamshire  this kingdom contained two hundred and two years  began  582     Cerdan was first King  and        Peada the first Christian King      6   Kingdom of the East Angles contained Norfolk  Suffolk  and Cambridgeshire  This kingdom continued three hundred and fifty three years  began  775     Uffa was the first King thereof         Redwald the first Christian King  and        Edmond the last King  whom the Danes slew  and he was buried at a village then called Heglisdune  but afterwards  in honour to Edmond  called St  Edmond s Bury           TABLE II  Of the chief British princes who contended with the Saxons for their country s right         A  D   1   Vortigern  Vortimer his son  and Aurelius Ambrosius  from 393  to  497  2   Uter Pendragon  497  3   Arthur  son of Pendragon   516
