 since you have touched on Family Affairs  you must give me Leave to tell you  that I am extremely concerned for poor Nancy  When I was at Belvidere  I pitied her as much as I ever did any Creature  for  tho  I cannot suppose her   174 capable of that exquisite Anguish  which more cultivated Minds must feel  she could not avoid Suffering greatly  from a Certainty of Sally s being the reigning Favourite  If the Want of an elevated Mind prevented her feeling the  Hydra of Calamities  in the most poignant Manner  it likewise deprived her of the only Resource  which can be found for the Forsaken that of scorning the perjured Lover  but she  poor Soul  pointed her misplaced Rage at her triumphant Rival  forgetting the nine Hundred and ninety nine Damsels  who must have been dethroned  before she took Possession of the capacious Empire of your Heart   I am really sorry her Behaviour obliged you to part with her  she was a good Servant  and  I believe  sincerely attached to your Interest  notwithstanding Mr  — s Report to the Contrary   I cannot say how much I am obliged by your Writing so constantly  let me intreat you will continue to deserve my sincerest Thanks  for they are all that I can offer in Return  It is not Want of Gratitude  but Power  that prevents my repaying the Obligation  you must then  like a compounding Creditor  accept all I have to give  tho  it falls ever so short of the Debt     175I again intreat you to believe  that I passionately long to see you  and that I am  with the sincerest Affection   Your s  and only Your s   LETTER XCVIII   Paraclete—Michaelmas Day   My dearest and best loved Love   YOUR Manner of Writing  about my going to London  charms me extremely  as it is very sensible and rational  It flatters me too  as it is somewhat in the Stile I have always treated you  for I would never sacrifice one Sentiment of Friendship to all the Extravagance of Love  for which Reason  to ordinary Seeming  I might  perhaps  appear not to have loved you  half as well  as I really did  However that may be  I do solemnly assure you  upon my Word of Honour  which  when seriously given  I never forfeited to you yet  that  from the Instant I first saw you here  I have loved and approved you better  than I ever did before  and such a Turn  at this Stage of our Acquaintance  is very likely to last for Life — Amen  so be it   There is something  however  in your Manner  which sometimes perplexes me  As for Example  in the two recent Instances of Paraclete  and my going to London  you speak of   176 Things  which you seem to desire  and  when I think you in Earnest  as I generally do  my own Inclinations according with your s  you then tell me  you did not seriously intend what you hinted at  But I am not to be trifled with  after this Manner  For  whatever I undertake in Complaisance to you  I shall certainly go thro  with  in Compliance with my own Inclinations  So I shall certainly pay my Visit to you in London soon  in Hope you will return the Compliment to Paraclete next Summer   I hope you rejoice in the same Weather we have in the Country  we have not had even the Whisper of a Michaelmas Rig yet  and October  which is generally a fine Month  is setting in with all good Omens  There is something more charming in a fine Season  at this Time of the Year  than in all the Sunshine of a Summer s Meridian  Methinks it affects us somewhat like the pleasing Reverence we feel  when we meet with Chearfulness in the Decline of Life  I hope this Weather will continue  till I see you —   Bear me but to her  then fail me  if you can   Not that I am such a fair Weather Spark  that the Difference of Season shall make any Difference in my stedfast Purpose to see you  as soon as I can   Nor yet the Wint ry Blasts I fear   Nor Storms  nor Night  shall keep me here     I am  my Dearest  your s  till I see you  and  till I can see you no more     177  LETTER XCIX   NEED I tell my dear Harry that his Letter gave me the highess Pleasure  as the utmost Wish my Heart e er formed  was to be approved by him  Let us now mutually congratulate each other  on our Coming to a right Understanding  for I am persuaded that great Part of those Uneasinesses  we have both given  and received  have been owing to our not being thoroughly acquainted with the Motives  on which we separately acted  I may have misconstrued Friendship into Want of Tenderness  and you deemed that Caprice  which was Excess of Love  However  this I am sure of  that we either love one
