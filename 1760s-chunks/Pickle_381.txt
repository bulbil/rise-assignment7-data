45 PM   was interrupted by a ticket porter  who  putting a letter in his hand   vanished in a moment  before he had time to peruse the contents   Our hero  opening the billet  was not a little surprised to find a  bank note for fifty pounds  enclosed in a blank sheet of paper  and   having exercised his memory and penetration on the subject of this  unexpected windfall  had just concluded  that it could come from no  other hand than the lady who had so kindly visited him a few days  before  when his ears were suddenly invaded by the well known sound of  that whistle which always hung about the neck of Pipes  as a memorial of  his former occupation  This tune being performed  he heard the noise  of a wooden leg ascending the stair  upon which he opened his door  and  beheld his friend Hatchway  with his old shipmate at his back   After a cordial shake of the hand  with the usual salutation of   What  cheer  cousin Pickle   honest Jack seated himself without ceremony  and  casting his eyes around the apartment   Split my top staysail   said he   with an arch sneer   you have got into a snug berth  cousin  Here you  may sit all weathers  without being turned out to take your watch  and  no fear of the ship s dragging her anchor  You han t much room to spare    tis true  an  I had known as how you stowed so close  Tom should have  slung my own hammock for you  and then you mought have knocked down this  great lubberly hurricane house  But  mayhap  you turn in double  and so  you don t choose to trust yourself and your doxy to a clue and canvas    Pickle bore his jokes with great good humour  rallied him in his turn  about the dairy maid at the garrison  inquiring about his friends in  the country  asked if he had been to visit his niece  and  finally   expressed a desire of knowing the cause of his journey to London  The  lieutenant satisfied his curiosity in all these particulars  and  in  answer to the last question  observed that  from the information of  Pipes  understanding he was land locked  he had come from the country in  order to tow him into the offing   I know not how the wind sets   said  he   but if so be as three thousand pounds will bring you clear of the  cape  say the word  and you shan t lie wind bound another glass for want  of the money    This was an offer which few people in our hero s situation would have  altogether refused  especially as he had all the reason in the world to  believe  that  far from being a vain unmeaning compliment  it was  the genuine tribute of friendship  which the lieutenant would have  willingly  ay  and with pleasure  paid  Nevertheless  Peregrine  peremptorily refused his assistance  though not without expressing  himself in terms of acknowledgment suitable to the occasion  He told  him  it would be time enough to make use of his generosity  when he  should find himself destitute of all other resource  Jack employed all  his rhetoric  with a view of persuading him to take this opportunity  to procure his own enlargement  and  finding his arguments ineffectual   insisted upon his accepting an immediate supply for his necessary  occasions  swearing with great vehemence  that he would never return  to the garrison  unless he would put him upon the footing of any other  tenant  and receive his rent accordingly   Our young gentleman as positively swore  that he never would consider  him in that light  remonstrating  that he had long ago settled the  house upon him for life  as a pledge of his own esteem  as well as in  conformity with the commodore s desire  and beseeching him to return    6 22 15  3 45 PM   to his usual avocations  protested that  if ever his situation should  subject him to the necessity of borrowing from his friends  Mr  Hatchway  should be the first man to whom he would apply himself for succour   To convince him that this was not the case at present  he produced the  bank note which he had received in the letter  together with his  own ready money  and mentioned some other funds  which he invented  extempore  in order to amuse the lieutenant s concern  In the close  of this expostulation  he desired Pipes to conduct Mr  Hatchway to the  coffee house  where he might amuse himself with the newspaper for half  an hour  during which he would put on his clothes  and bespeak something  for dinner  that they might enjoy each other s company as long as his  occasions would permit him to stay in that place   The two sailors were no sooner gone  than he took up the pen  and wrote  the following letter  in which he
