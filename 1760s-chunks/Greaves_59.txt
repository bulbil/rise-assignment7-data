security and defence from injury and violence  What right have you  or any man upon earth  to excite riot in a public inn  which may be deemed a temple sacred to hospitality  to disturb the quiet of your fellow guests  some of them perhaps exhausted by fatigue  some of them invaded by distemper  to interrupt the king s lieges in their course of journeying upon their lawful occasions  Above all  what motive but wanton barbarity could prompt you to violate the apartment  and terrify the tender hearts of two helpless young ladies  travelling  no doubt  upon some cruel emergency  which compels them  unattended  to encounter in the night the dangers of the highway     Hearkye  Don Bethlem   said the captain  strutting up  and cocking his hat in the face of our adventurer   you may be mad as ever a straw crowned monarch in Moorfields  for aught I care  but damme  don t you be saucy  otherwise I shall dub your worship with a good stick across your shoulders    How  petulant boy   cried the knight   since you are so ignorant of urbanity  I will give you a lesson that you shall not easily forget   So saying  he unsheathed his sword  and called upon the soldier to draw in his defence   The reader may have seen the physiognomy of a stockholder at Jonathan s when the rebels were at Derby  or the features of a bard when accosted by a bailiff  or the countenance of an alderman when his banker stops payment  if he has seen either of these phenomena  he may conceive the appearance that was now exhibited by the visage of the ferocious captain  when the naked sword of Sir Launcelot glanced before his eyes  far from attempting to produce his own  which was of unconscionable length  he stood motionless as a statue  staring with the most ghastly look of terror and astonishment  His companion  who partook of his panic  seeing matters brought to a very serious crisis  interposed with a crest fallen countenance  assuring Sir Launcelot they had no intention to quarrel  and what they had done was entirely for the sake of the frolic    By such frolics   cried the knight   you become nuisances to society  bring yourselves into contempt  and disgrace the corps to which you belong  I now perceive the truth of the observation  that cruelty always resides with cowardice  My contempt is changed into compassion  and as you are probably of good families  I must insist upon this young man s drawing his sword  and acquitting himself in such a manner as may screen him from the most infamous censure which an officer can undergo    Lack a day  sir   said the other   we are no officers  but prentices to two London haberdashers  travellers for orders  Captain is a good travelling name  and we have dressed ourselves like officers to procure more respect upon the road    The knight said he was very glad  for the honour of the service  to find they were impostors  though they deserved to be chastised for arrogating to themselves an honourable character which they had not spirit to sustain   These words were scarce pronounced  when Mr  Clarke approaching one of the bravadoes  who had threatened to crop his ears  bestowed such a benediction on his jaw  as he could not receive without immediate humiliation  while Timothy Crabshaw  smarting from his broken head and his want of supper  saluted the other with a Yorkshire hug  that laid him across the body of his companion  In a word  the two pseudo officers were very roughly handled  for their presumption in pretending to act characters for which they were so ill qualified   While Clarke and Crabshaw were thus laudably employed  the two young ladies passed through the kitchen so suddenly  that the knight had only a transient glimpse of their backs  and they disappeared before he could possibly make a tender of his services  The truth is  they dreaded nothing so much as their being discovered  and took the first opportunity of gliding into the chaise  which had been for some time waiting in the passage   Mr  Clarke was much more disconcerted than our adventurer by their sudden escape  He ran with great eagerness to the door  and  perceiving they were flown  returned to Sir Launcelot  saying   Lord bless my soul  sir  didn t you see who it was    Ha  how   exclaimed the knight  reddening with alarm   who was it    One of them   replied the lawyer   was Dolly  our old landlady s daughter at the Black Lion  I knew her when first she  lighted  notwithstanding her being neatly dressed in a green joseph  which  I ll assure you  sir  becomes her remarkably well  â€”I d never desire to see a prettier creature  As for the other  she s a very genteel woman  but whether old or young  ugly or handsome  I can t pretend to say  for she was masked  I had just time to salute Dolly  and ask a few questions  but all she could tell me was  that the
