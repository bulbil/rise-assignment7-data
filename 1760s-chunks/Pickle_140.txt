in acknowledging the  excellence of those who fell under his examination   It was not to be supposed that one actor could shine equally in all  characters  and though his observations were undoubtedly very judicious   he himself could not help wondering that some of them had always escaped  his notice  though he had been an assiduous frequenter of the  playhouse   The player in question   said he   has  in your own opinion   considerable share of merit in the characters of comic life  and as to  the manners of the great personages in tragedy  and the operation of  the grand passions of the soul  I apprehend they may be variously  represented  according to the various complexion and cultivation of  different men  A Spaniard  for example  though impelled by the same  passion  will express it very differently from a Frenchman  and what  is looked upon as graceful vivacity and address by the one  would be  considered as impertinence and foppery by the other  nay  so opposite is  your common deportment from that of some other nations  that one of  our own countrymen  in the relation of his travels  observes  that the  Persians even of this age  when they see any man perform unnecessary  gestures  says he is either a fool or Frenchman  The standard of  demeanour being thus unsettled  a Turk  a Moor  an Indian  or inhabitant  of my country whose customs and dress are widely different from ours   may  in his sentiments  possess all the dignity of the human heart   and be inspired by the noblest passion that animates the soul  and yet  excite the laughter rather than the respect of an European spectator    When I first beheld your famous Parisian stage heroine in one of her  principal parts  her attitudes seemed so violent  and she tossed  her arms around with such extravagance  that she put me in mind of  a windmill under the agitation of a hard gale  while her voice and  features exhibited the lively representation of an English scold  The  action of your favourite male performer was  in my opinion  equally  unnatural  he appeared with the affected airs of a dancing master  at  the most pathetic junctures of his fate he lifted up his hands above his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   head  like a tumbler going to vault  and spoke as if his throat had  been obstructed by a hair brush  yet  when I compared their manners with  those of the people before whom they performed  and made allowance  for that exaggeration which obtains on all theatres  I was insensibly  reconciled to their method of performance  and I could distinguish  abundance of merit beneath that oddity of appearance    The chevalier  perceiving Peregrine a little irritated at what he had  said  asked pardon for the liberty he had taken in censuring the English  players  assuring him that he had an infinite veneration for the British  learning  genius  and taste  which were so justly distinguished in  the world of letters  and that  notwithstanding the severity of his  criticism  he thought the theatre of London much better supplied with  actors than that of Paris  The young gentleman thanked him for his  polite condescension  at which Pallet excited  saying  with a shake of  the head   I believe so  too  Monsieur   and the physician  impatient  of the dispute in which he had borne no share  observed  with a  supercilious air  that the modern stage was altogether beneath one who  had an idea of ancient magnificence and execution  that plays ought to  be exhibited at the expense of the state  as those of Sophocles were by  the Athenians  and that proper judges should be appointed for receiving  or rejecting all such performances as are offered to the public   He then described the theatre at Rome  which contained eighty thousand  spectators  gave them a learned disquisition into the nature of the  persona  or mask  worn by the Roman actors  which  he said  was a  machine that covered the whole head  furnished on the inside with a  brazen concavity  that  by reverberating  the sound  as it issued from  the mouth  raised the voice  so as to render it audible to such an  extended audience  He explained the difference between the saltator and  declamator  one of whom acted  while the other rehearsed the part  and  from thence took occasion to mention the perfection of their pantomimes   who were so amazingly distinct in the exercise of their art  that a  certain prince of Pontus  being at the court of Nero  and seeing one of  them represent a story  begged him of the emperor  in order to employ  him as an interpreter among barbarous nations  whose language he did  not understand  Nay  divers cynic philosophers  who had condemned this  entertainment unseen  when they chanced to be eye witnesses of their  admirable dexterity  expressed their sorrow for having so long debarred  themselves of such national enjoyment   He
