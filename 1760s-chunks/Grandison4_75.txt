just concluded his brief history of Clementina—   And now  madam  what can I say —Honour forbids me —Yet honour bids me—Yet I cannot be unjust  ungenerous  selfish    —If I may flatter myself  Lucy  that he did love me when he said this  and that he had a conflict in his noble heart between the Love on one side so hopeless  for I could not forgive him  if he did not love  as well as pity Clementina   and on the other not so hopeless  were there to have been no bar between—Shall we not pity him for the arduous struggle  Shall we not see that honour carried it  even in favour of the hopeless against the hopeful  and applaud him the more for being able to overcome  How shall we call virtue by its name  if it be not tried  and if it hath no contest with inclination     If I am a vain self flatterer  tell me  chide me  Lucy  but allow me  however  at the same time  this praise  if I can make good my claim to it  that my conquest of my passion is at least as glorious for me  as his is for him  were he to love me ever so well  since I can most sincerely  however painfully  subscribe to the preference which Honour  Love  Compassion  unitedly  give to CLEMENTINA   LETTER XXVI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Monday Night   MY cousins and I  by invitation  supp d with Lady G  this afternoon  Lord and Lady L  were there  Lady Olivia also  and Lady Maffei   I have s•t them all into a consternation  as they expressed themselves  by my declaration of leaving London on my return home early on Friday morning next  I knew  that were I to pass the whole summer here  I must be peremptory at last  The two sisters vow    188 that I shall not go so soon  They say  that I have seen so few of the town diversions—Town diversions  Lucy —I have had diversion enough of one sort —But in your arms  my dear friends  I shall have consolation—And I want it   I have great regrets  and shall have hourly more  as the day approaches  on the leaving of such dear and obliging friends  But I am determined   My cousin s coach will convey me to Dunstable  and there  I know  I shall meet with my indulgent uncle  or your brother  I would not have it publicly known  because of the officious gentlemen in the neighbourhood   Dr  Bartlett intended to set out for Grandison hall to morrow  But from the natural kindness of his heart he has suspended his journey to Thursday next  No consideration  therefore  shall detain me  if I am well   My cousins are grieved  They did not expect that I would be a word and a blow  as they phrase it   Lady Olivia expressed herself concerned  that she  in particular  was to lose me  She had proposed great pleasure  she said  in the parties she should make in my company  But  after what Emily told me  she appears to me as a Medusa  and were I to be thought by her a formidable rival  I might have as much reason to be afraid of the potion  as the man she loves of the poniard  Emily has kept the secret from every body but me  And I rely on the inviolable secrecy of all you▪ my friends   Lord and Lady L  had designed to go to Colnebrooke to morrow  or at my day  having hopes of getting me with them  But now  they say  they will stay in town till they can see whether I am to be prevailed upon  or will be obdurate   Lady Olivia enquired after the distance of North hamptonshire  She will make the tour of England  she says  and visit me there  I was obliged to say I should take her visit as an honour     189 Wicked Politeness  Of how many falshoods dost thou make the people  who are called polite  guilty   But there is one man in the world  who is remarkable for his truth  yet is unquestionably polite  He censures not others for complying with fashions established by custom  but he gives not in to them  He never perverts the meaning of words  He never  for instance  suffers his servants to deny him  when he is at home  If he is busy  he just finds time to say he is  to unexpected visiters  and if they will stay  he turns them over to his Sisters  to Dr  Bartlett  to Emily  till he can attend them  But then he has always done so  Every one knows that he lives to his own heart  and they expect it of him  and when they can have his company  they have double joy in the ease and chearfulness that attend his leisure  They then have him wholly  And he can be the more polite  as the company then is all his business   Sir Charles might the better do so  as
