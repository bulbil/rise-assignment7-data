ought to be desirable  but so far as it is necessary or useful to   man  Instruct my darling  daily and hourly  if possible  in a         TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  127     preference of manners and things that bear an intrinsic value  to   those that receive their value and currency from the arbitrary and   fickle stamp of fashion  Show him also  my Hammel  that the   same toils and sufferings  the same poverty and pain  from which   people now fly as they would from a plague  were once the desire   of heroes and the fashion of nations   and that thousands of patriots    of captains  and philosophers  through a love of their country or   of glory  of applause during life or distinction after death  have   rejected wealth and pleasure  embraced want and hardship  and   suffered more from a voluntary mortification and self denial  than   our church seems to require in these days for the conquest of a   sensual world into which we are fallen  and for entitling us to   a crown in the kingdom of eternity      So saying  Mr  Fenton got up from table  and  observing that it   was late  wished Clement a good night      Our hero was now eight years of age  and weekly and daily con    tinued to be exercised in feats of bodily prowess and agility  and   in acts of mental benevolence and service to mankind      Mr  Fenton had already provided his favourite with a dancing    master  the most approved for skill in his profession   as also with   a noted fencing master  who further taught him the noble science   of the cudgel and quarter staff  He was now on the search for the   most distinguished champion of the Bear garden  in order to   accomplish our hero in the mysteries of bruising  of wrestling  and   of tripping   and having in a short time procured the person de    sired  he purchased for his Harry a small but beautiful Spanish   jennett  that was perfectly dressed as they called it  or rid to the   manage  and once in every week or fortnight he accompanied his   darling to the riding house in Islington  where he saw him in    structed in all the arts and elegancies of horsemanship      Thus Harry had his little hands as full of business as they could   hold  But he was naturally of an active and vivid disposition   and   time  unemployed  lay upon him as the heaviest and most irksome   of all burdens  He therefore proceeded from his book to his   exercises  and from one exercise to another  as an epicure does   among a number of dishes  where the variety of the seasoning   excites in him a new appetite to each      Within a few weeks after the late dissertation upon blushing    the same company being present  and dinner removed Harry    says Mr  Fenton  tell me which of the two is the richest  the man   who wants least  or the man who hath most   Let me think  father    says Harry  Why  sure they are the same thing   are not they    dada   By no means  my darling  cried Mr  Fenton      There lived two famous men at the same time  the one was   called Diogenes  and the other Alexander  Diogenes refused to   accept of any worldly goods  save one wooden cup to carry water   to his mouth   but when he found that he could drink by lying   down and putting his mouth to the stream  he threw his cup away    as a thing that he did not want      Alexander  on the other side  was a great conqueror   and when   he had conquered and got possession of all the world  he fell a   crying because there were not a hundred more such worlds for him         128 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      to conquer  Now  which of these two was the richest  do you   think      O  exclaimed Harry  Diogenes to be sure Diogenes to be sure     He who wants nothing is the richest man in the world  Diogenes   was richer than Alexander by a hundred worlds      Very true  my love  rejoined Mr  Fenton  Alexander had a   whole world more than Diogenes wanted  and yet desired a hundred   worlds more than he had  Now  as no man will allow that he   wants what he does not desire  and all affirm that they want what    soever they do desire  desires and wants are generally accounted
