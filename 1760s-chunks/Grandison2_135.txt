 to Mr  Edward Danby  let me know your Situation  your prospects   Sir  I was put to a French wine merchant  My master is in years  I am the sole manager of his business  and he would leave off to me  I believe  and to his nephew  who knows not so much of it as I do  nor has the acquaintance  either in France or England  that I have  could I raise money to purchase half the stock   And what  Sir  is necessary for that purpose   O Sir  at least six thousand pounds  But had my uncle left me the three thousand we once hoped for  I could have got the other half at an easy interest  for I am well beloved  and have always borne a good character   What did you suppose your uncle would do with the bulk of his fortune  you judged it  I suppose  to be large  if you expected no more than three thousand guineas each at the most  besides what he had given you   We all thought  Sir  said Mr  Edward Danby  it   338 would be yours  from the time that he owed his life to your courage and conduct  We never entertained hopes of being his heirs general  And he several times told me  when I was in France  that you should be his heir   He never hinted that to me  What I did was as necessary to be done for my own Safety  as for his  He much over rated my services  But what are your prospects  Mr  Edward Danby  in the French winetrade   O Sir  very great   And will your master leave off to you and his nephew  think you   I dare say he would  and be glad of retiring to Enfield  where he has a house he is so fond of  that he would be continually there  by his good will   And have you  Sir  any prospect of adding to your circumstances by marriage   Women are a drug  Sir  I have no doubt of offers  if once I were my own master   I started  His sister looked angry  His brother was not pleased  Mr  Sylvester  who  it seems  is an old bachelor  laughed—  A true merchant this already  thought I   Well  now  shall I have your consents  gentlemen  to take your sister aside —Will you trust yourself with me  Miss Danby  Or had you rather answer my question in company   Sir  your character  your goodness  is so well known  I scruple not to attend you   I took her hand  and led her to my study  leaving the door open  to the drawing room in which they were  I seated her  Then sat down  but still held her hand   Now  my dear Miss Danby  you are to suppose me  as the executor of your uncle  his representative  If you had that good uncle before you  and he was urging you to tell him what would make you happy  with   339 an assurance  that he would do all in his power towards it  and if you would open your mind freely to him  with equal freedom open it to me  There was only this difference between us  He had resentments against your father  which he carried too far  when he extended them to his innocent children  But it was an atrocious attempt  that embitter d his otherwise benevolent spirit   I have no resentment  and am armed with his power  and have all the will he ever could have  to serve you  Aud now  let me know  what will effectually do it   The worthy girl wept  She looked down  She seemed as if she were pulling threads out of her handkerchief  But was unable to return any other answer  than what her eyes  once cast up  as if to Heaven  made for her   Give me  my good Miss Danby  I would not distress you  give me  as your brothers did of their Situation  some account of yours  Do you live with either of your brothers   No  Sir  I live with an aunt  My mother s sister   Is she good to you   Yes  Sir  very good  But she has children  and cannot be so good as she would be to me  Yet she has always been kind  and has made the best of my uncle s allowance for my education  And my fortune  which is unbroken  is the same sum that he gave my brothers  And it is in good hands  And the interest of it  with my aunt s additional goodness and management  enables me to make a genteel figure  And  with my own housewifry  I never have wanted some little matters for my pocket   Good girl  thought I —Mercantile carle  thy brother Edward  pretty one  How dared he to say  that women are drugs —Who  in their oeconomy  short as their power is  are generally superior to men   Your uncle was
