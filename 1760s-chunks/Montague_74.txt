for me  that I shall be justly blamed by all who love him for keeping him here  Tell him  I will not marry him in Canada  that his stay makes the best mother in the world wretched  that he owes his return to himself  nay to his Emily  whose whole heart is set on seeing him in a situation worthy of him  though without ambition as to myself  I am proud  I am ambitious for him  if he loves me  he will gratify that pride  that ambition  and leave Canada to those whose duty confines them here  or whose interest it is to remain unseen  Let him not once think of me in his determination  I am content to be beloved  and will leave all else to time  You cannot so much oblige or serve me  as by persuading Colonel Rivers to return to England       Believe me  my dear Madam   Your affectionate  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CXIX   119   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  April 9   YOUR brother  my dear  is gone to Montreal to look out for a settlement  and Emily to spend a fortnight at Quebec  with a lady she knew in England  who is lately arrived from thence by New York       I am lost without my friend  though my lover endeavors in some degree to supply her place  he lays close siege  I know not how long I shall be able to hold out  this fine weather is exceedingly in his favor  the winter freezes up all the avenues to the heart  but this sprightly April sun thaws them again amazingly  I was the cruellest creature breathing whilst the chilly season lasted  but can answer for nothing now the sprightly May is approaching       I can see papa is vastly in Fitzgerald s interest  but he knows our sex well enough to keep this to himself       I shall  however  for decency s sake  ask his opinion on the affair as soon as I have taken my resolution  which is the very time at which all the world ask advice of their friends       A letter from Emily  which I must answer  she is extremely absurd  which your tender lovers always are       Adieu  yours   A  FERMOR       Sir George Clayton had left Montreal some days before your brother arrived there  I was pleased to hear it  because  with all your bother s good sense  and concern for Emily s honor  and Sir George s natural coldness of temper  a quarrel between them would have been rather difficult to have been avoided     LETTER CXX   120   To Miss FERMOR   Quebec  Thursday morning   DO you think  my dear  that Madame Des Roches has heard from Rivers  I wish you would ask her this afternoon at the governor s  I am anxious to know  but ashamed to enquire       Not  my dear  that I have the weakness to be jealous  but I shall think his letter to me a higher compliment  if I know he writes to nobody else  I extremely approve his friendship for Madame Des Roches  she is very amiable  and certainly deserves it  but you know  Bell  it would be cruel to encourage an affection  which she must conquer  or be unhappy  if she did not love him  there would be nothing wrong in his writing to her  but  as she does  it would be doing her the greatest injury possible   tis as much on her account as my own I am thus anxious       Did you ever read so tender  yet so lively a letter as Rivers s to me  he is alike in all  there is in his letters  as in his conversation     All that can softly win  or gaily charm  The heart of woman     Even strangers listen to him with an involuntary attention  and hear him with a pleasure for which they scarce know how to account         He charms even without intending it  and in spite of himself  but when he wishes to please  when he addresses the woman he loves  when his eyes speak the soft language of his heart  when your Emily reads in them the dear confession of his tenderness  when that melodious voice utters the sentiments of the noblest mind that ever animated a human form My dearest  the eloquence of angels cannot paint my Rivers as he is       I am almost inclined not to go to the governor s to night  I am determined not to dance till Rivers returns  and I know there are too many who will be ready to make observations on my refusal  I think I will stay at home  and write to him against Monday s post  I have a thousand things to say  and you know we are continually interrupted at Quebec  I shall have this evening to myself  as all the world will be at the governor s       Adieu  your faithful        EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CXXI   121   To Miss MONTAGUE  at Quebec
