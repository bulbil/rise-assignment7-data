mind  happy would it be for all your sex  after having deviated from the paths of virtue  if they could return to them with so good a grace  so just a sense of their errors  To you  Sir  said she with a solemn air  I am indebted for my present resolutions  I hope from this time forward that my life will be irreproachable  I hope so too  madam  I guessed she understood these words as favouring her design  it was not meet to undeceive her  a little mental reservation  you know  Bidulph   she went on  little thinking she was forwarding my plan  when she only meant to promote her own  I hope Mr Arnold will be as sensible of his fault as I am of mine  and that he will never fall into the like indiscretion again  I believe there can be no true happiness but between a married pair  who sincerely love each other   Good  Good  thought I  sure my better genius prompts the woman    to speak thus  Ah  Mrs Gerrarde  how exactly do your thoughts correspond with mine  How just are all your sentiments  What a true relish have you for virtue  Yes  I hope with you that Mr Arnold will be able to tread in your steps  it is a pity he has not your noble example before him  Mrs Arnold is a good woman  and he might still live with her in tolerable contentment  if he can get the better of his irregular passion for you  What a noble triumph of virtuous resolution would this be  if you yourself were the instrument to bring this about  For Mrs Arnold’s and her brother’s sake  as well as your own  I wish this were feasible   I would do any thing in my power  said she  thinking she obliged me by the declaration   but I know not by what means such an event can be brought to pass   I was afraid to urge the matter farther  I was within an hair’s breadth of gaining my point  but did not think it prudent to press too forward  We’ll think of it another time  said I  and groaned heavily  as if my spirits were fatigued with talking  She took the hint  I am afraid I have tired you  you have talked too much  I answered her faintly  You are very good  She curtesied to me  and retired with a majestic step  I saw her no more that day  she had got upon stilts  and it was not yet time to take her down  To morrow may produce a wonder  I will wait for it  I am really weak  but begin to recover my spirits   Boulogne  December 6   Nothing is so conducive to the body’s health  as the mind’s being at ease  I have proved the truth of this observation  my soul had been racked with suspence and uncertainty during my illness  the uneasy state of my mind increased my disorder  the disorder itself had chiefly given rise to my apprehensions  as pain and sickness are naturally accompanied with a gloominess of thought  Thus the cause and its effects were united in mutual league against me  and reciprocally assisted each other to plague and torment me   My fears were intirely on Mrs Arnold’s account  What  thought I  would be the consequence of my project  in case of my death  Mrs Gerrarde will return back to England  and  upon telling her story  will be received again by Arnold  their union perhaps established as firmly as before  and poor Mrs Arnold’s hopes ruined for ever  Then I thought what a wretch I must appear in her eyes  doubtful  may be  of my sincerity as to the motives I urged to you for my conduct  On the other hand  if these motives should by any means happen to be    suspected by Mrs Gerrarde  it might be the means of producing the direct contrary effect from what I intended  and instead of banishing Arnold’s cruel suspicions of his lady  only serve to strengthen them  for I knew Mrs Gerrarde would leave nothing unsaid or undone for this horrid purpose  and it is not every one  Sir George  whose hearts are enlarged enough to suppose a man may now and then take a little pains from disinterested principles  This last suggestion of my thoughts made me almost mad  and actually brought on a delirium  and what may seem a paradox  though it is literally true  the total deprivation of my senses for two days was the means of my recovering them afterwards  for I am sure  had I retained enough of them to have ruminated longer on this fatal supposition  and my disorder had still threatened me with death  I should have run mad  The care of a skilful physician recalled me from the precincts of the grave  the strength of a constitution  naturally good  joined to all the resolution I could muster  did the rest   The first use I made of my recovered reason  was to consult with myself in what manner  or by what means  I should prevail on Mrs Gerrarde to lend a helping hand to my design  Her leaving Arnold to go off with me
