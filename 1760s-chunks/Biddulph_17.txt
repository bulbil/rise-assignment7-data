chamber  said the words I first repeated  and while I stood doing the ruffle  I heard the rest  There was a great deal more said  but I could not distinguish any thing besides  except a word here and there  which Sir George seemed to speak in a very angry tone  This was the second day of your illness  Mr Faulkland had been here in the morning to enquire how you did  my lady saw him  and I thought they parted very friendly  I met Mr Faulkland coming down stairs  he looked full of grief  my lady stood at the dining room door  and wished him a good morning  About an hour after came a letter directed to you  it was brought by a porter  who said it required no answer  As you were too ill to read it  I gave it to my lady  and it was soon after this  that I heard the conversation between Sir George and her ladyship  Mr Faulkland came again in the evening  Sir George was not at home  but my lady had him above an hour in the drawing room  and the footman  who let him out  said  he looked as if he were in sad trouble  He has never been here since  but sends constantly every day to know how you do  My lady ordered me  if any letters came for you  to deliver them to her  And has there any come to me  No madam  word was always sent to Mr Faulkland of your being so ill  that to be sure he thought it would be in vain for him to write to you ’  This was all I could gather from the maid  What a night did I    pass  I scarce closed my eyes  Ellen lay in a field bed by me  she had watched several nights  and I obliged her now to undress and go into bed  She slept soundly  how I envied her tranquility  If I forgot myself for a few minutes  my slumbers were distracted  and I started at the recollection of what I had already heard  and the dread of what I had still to hear  Mr Faulkland absenting himself from the house so long  my mother wishing me in the grave  rather than be his wife  my brother denouncing vengeance on the villain  These were the terrible ideas that haunted me till morning  What can he have done  I cried aloud several times  I summoned to my aid all the fortitude I was mistress of  and resolved not to sink under the calamity  be it of what nature it would   My mother  ever kind and tender  came early the next morning into my room  She enquired after my health  and looked as if she pitied me  I was ready to cry at her compassionate glances  they mortified me  but I was determined not to let her perceive it  I told her I was much better  and  what is surprizing  I was really so  notwithstanding the uneasy state of my mind  She talked of indifferent things  and said  she hoped I should soon be able to go into the country for a few days  to recover a little strength  I answered  I hope so too  madam  We were both silent for a while  my mother had her indulgent eyes fixed upon me  mine were cast down  at last I resolved to speak out  Madam  said I  looking steadfastly at her  what is the cause of your coldness towards Mr Faulkland  ’Tis in vain for you to hide it longer  you say he is well  and gone out of town  If he has shewn any slight towards me  tell me so at once  and do not entertain so mean an opinion of your daughter  as to suppose she cannot bear the news  Your tenderness  I see  would conceal something from me  but believe me  madam  I am prepared for the worst   My dear  replied my mother  it gives me great pleasure to hear you say so  I pray God preserve my child  and grant her a better lot than she could hope for in a union with Mr Faulkland  What has he done  madam  My dearest Sidney  she answered  this is the first trial you have ever had of your patience  but I have no doubt that your goodness and discretion will teach you to act as becomes your character   I did not intend to have spoken to you on the subject  till you were better able to bear the knowlege of what I am going to acquaint you with  but your prudence  I think  makes you equal to every thing  and    I hope your health will not be endangered by the discovery of Mr Faulkland’s baseness   What a dreadful preface    The day after you were taken ill  a letter  directed to you  was brought hither by a porter  which your maid  very discretely  delivered to me  As you were not in a condition to read it yourself  I thought proper to open it  The cover contained a few lines addressed to you  and in it was inclosed a letter directed to Mr Faulkland  Good
