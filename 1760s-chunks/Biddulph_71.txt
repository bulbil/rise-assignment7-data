from him to stay some time longer with them  at least till the old lady’s affairs were settled  who had left her fortune to Mr Faulkland  and to whom my lord V—— was executor   I told lady V—— I depended on her friendship  to keep this affair a secret from Mr Faulkland  lest the heat of his temper should make him take such notice of it  as might render my separation from Mr Arnold doubly injurious to my character  Lady V—— saw the necessity of this caution  and promised to observe it  She expressed great surprize at Mr Faulkland’s visiting Mrs Gerrarde  whom she said  she did not imagine he had been acquainted with  He is no stranger  said she  to your husband’s amour with her  as it has often been a topic of discourse between my lord and me  and I can hardly think he would be so indelicate as to carry on a love affair with such an abandoned creature  especially as I have often heard him express the utmost detestation of her  on account of her robbing you of your husband’s affection  which I had observed for a good while  But there is no knowing mankind  added she  if that should be the case  you may depend upon it that vile Gerrarde has laid her plan deeper than we are aware of  and would out swear us all  that Faulkland came to her house for no other purpose  than to have an opportunity of seeing you  who to be sure  she said  had given him a private hint to meet you there  Now the worst of it is  it is impossible to have this matter cleared up to your husband  without Mr Faulkland’s concurrence  and that you will not consent to  By no means  I replied  I would not for the world have Mr Faulkland interfere in my justification  If the affair should really be as you have suggested  a little time may  perhaps  discover this wicked woman to Mr Arnold  and it will not then be so difficult to clear my innocence  At present  her influence    over him is too powerful for me to combat with  and I know he wishes for nothing more than to free himself from the restraint that my presence lays him under   Lady V—— acquiesced in my opinion  and said  she hoped a little time would chace away the dark cloud that now hung over me  She staid with me the whole day  it was a day of tears  the dear woman was quite subdued at parting with me  I see you no more  dear lady V——  said I  I shall go to London in two days—Preserve your fortitude  dearest Mrs Arnold  she replied  the time will come when your husband will repent of the bitter distress he has occasioned to you  my lord and I will use our utmost endeavours to convince him of his error —We shall meet in London  my dear  I shall go thither early in the winter on purpose—Have courage—Your innocence must be cleared  I answered her not  my heart was too full  We embraced  and lady V—— parted from me in silence   I have written to my mother  and directed my letter to St James’s Street  I would have her prepared for the shock before she sees me  a shock  which I fear she will not be able to sustain   September 16  Mrs Gerrarde has never called or sent to me since I was at her house  She has effected her purpose  and is contented without a triumph   I am prepared for my departure  To morrow I turn my back upon my husband’s house  and upon my children  I have been weeping over them this hour as they lie asleep in their nurse’s arms  But I will look at them no more —Poor Patty is almost dead with grief  she would fain go with me  but I have persuaded her to stay  I can rely on her fidelity and her tenderness towards my children  she says  she will be as precious of them as the apple of her eyes  and will give me an account of their welfare from time to time  Sure Mr Arnold will not turn her out too  she is an excellent manager  and he cannot do without a housekeeper   I have been debating with myself whether I should write to Mr Arnold or not  and have at length determined to depart in silence  It is an easy matter for the guilty to make as bold asseverations as the innocent  and nothing which I could now assert would make an impression on him  Had I only his suspicions to combat  there might be hopes  but his heart is alienated from me  and while it continues attached to another  I despair of his listening to the voice of reason or    of justice  If ever his eyes are opened  his error will prove sufficient punishment to him—Perhaps my mother or my brother may put me in a way—My conduct  in time  I hope  may justify me—Mean while I will not condescend to the weak justification of words   September 18  I have bid adieu to South park  and arrived this morning in London in a hired carriage  for I would not take one of Mr Arnold’s
