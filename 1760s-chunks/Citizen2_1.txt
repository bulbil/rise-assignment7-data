 THE CITIZEN of the WORLD  OR LETTERS FROM A CHINESE PHILOSOPHER  Residing in LONDON  TO HIS FRIENDS in the EAST   VOLUME the SECOND   LONDON  Printed for the AUTHOR  AND Sold by J  NEWBERY and W  BRISTOW  in St  Paul s Church yard  J  LEAKE and W  FREDERICK  at Bath  B  COLLINS  at Salisbury  and A  M  SMART and Co  at Reading  MDCCLXII      unnumbered   THE EDITOR s PREFACE   THE schoolmen had formerly a very exact way of computing the abilities of their Saints or authors  Escobar  for instance  was said to have learning as five  genius as four  and gravity as seven  Caramuel was greater than he  His learning was as eight  his genius as six  and his gravity as thirteen  Were I to estimate the merits of our Chinese Philosopher by the same scale  I would not hesitate to state his genius still higher  but as to his learning and gravity  these I think might safely be marked as nine hundred and ninety nine  within one degree of absolute frigidity   Yet upon his first appearance here  many were angry not to find him as ignorant as a Tripoline ambassador  or an Envoy from Mujac  They were surprized to find a man born so far from London  that school of prudence and wisdom  endued even with a moderate capacity  They expressed the same surprize at his knowlege that the Chinese do at ours   How comes it  said they  that the   iv Europeans  so remote from China  think with so much justice and precision  They have never read our books  they scarcely know even our letters  and yet they talk and reason just as we do  The truth is  the Chinese and we are pretty much alike  Different degrees of refinement  and not of distance  mark the distinctions among mankind  Savages of the most opposite climates  have all but one character of improvidence and rapacity  and tutored nations  however separate  make use of the very same methods to procure refined enjoyment   The distinctions of polite nations are few  but such as are peculiar to the Chinese  appear in every  of the following correspondence  The metaphors and allusions are all drawn from the East  Their formality our author carefully preserves  Many of their favourite tenets in morals are illustrated  The Chinese are always concise  so is he  Simple  so is he  The Chinese are grave and sententious  so is he  But in one particular  the resemblance is peculiarly striking  the Chinese are often dull  and so is he  Nor has my assistance been wanting  We are told in an old romance of a certain knight errant and his horse who contracted an intimate friendship  The horse most usually bore the knight  but  in cases of extraordinary dispatch  the knight returned the favour  and carried his horse  Thus in the intimacy between my author and me  he has usually given   v me a lift of his Eastern sublimity  and I have sometimes given him a return of my colloquial ease   Yet it appears strange in this season of panegyric  when scarce an author passes unpraised either by his friends or himself  that such merit as our Philosopher s should be forgotten  While the epithets of ingenious  copious  elaborate  and refined  are lavished among the mob  like medals at a coronation  the lucky prizes fall on every side  but not one on him  I could on this occasion make myself melancholly  by considering the capriciousness of public taste  or the mutability of fortune  but during this fit of morality  lest my reader should sleep  I ll take a nap myself  and when I awake tell him my dream   I imagined the Thames was frozen over  and I stood by its side  Several booths were erected upon the ice  and I was told by one of the spectators  that FASHION FAIR was going to begin  He added  that every author who would carry his works there  might probably find a very good reception  I was resolved however to observe the humours of the place in safety from the shore  sensible that ice was at best precarious  and having been always a little cowardly in my sleep   Several of my acquaintance seemed much more hardy thin I  and went over the ice with intrepidity    vi Some carried their works to the fair on fledges  some on carts  and those which were more voluminous  were conveyed in waggons  Their temerity astonished me  I knew their cargoes were heavy  and expected every moment they would have gone to the bottom  They all entered the fair  however  in safety  and each soon after returned to my great surprize  highly satisfied with his entertainment  and the bargains he had brought away   The success of such numbers at last began to operate upon me  If these  cried I  meet with favour and safety  some luck may  perhaps  for once attend the unfortunate  I am resolved to make a new adventure  The furniture  frippery and fireworks of China  have long been fashionably bought up  I ll try
