and  as they were improvided with a male  attendant  insisted upon squiring the ladies to their lodgings  Emilia  saw his drift  which was no other than to know where she lived  and  though she approved of his contrivance  thought it was incumbent upon  her  for the support of her own dignity  to decline the chivalry   she therefore thanked him for his polite offer  but would by no means  consent to his giving himself such unnecessary trouble  especially as  they had a very little way to walk  He was not repulsed by this refusal   the nature of which he perfectly understood  nor was she sorry to see  him persevere in his determination  he therefore accompanied them    6 22 15  3 45 PM   in their return  and made divers efforts to speak with Emilia in  particular  but she had a spice of the coquette in her disposition   and being determined to whet his impatience  artfully baffled all  his endeavours  by keeping her companion continually engaged in the  conversation  which turned upon the venerable appearance and imperial  situation of the place  Thus tantalized  he lounged with them to the  door of the house in which they lodged  when his mistress  perceiving   by the countenance of her comrade  that she was on the point of desiring  him to walk in  checked her intention with a frown  then  turning to Mr   Pickle  dropped him a very formal curtsy  seized the other young lady by  the arm  and saying   Come  cousin Sophy   vanished in a moment   CHAPTER XXIII   After sundry unsuccessful Efforts  he finds means to come to an  Explanation with his Mistress  and a Reconciliation ensues   Peregrine  disconcerted at their sudden disappearance  stood for some  minutes gaping in the street  before he could get the better of his  surprise  and then deliberated with himself whether he should demand  immediate admittance to his mistress  or choose some other method of  application  Piqued at her abrupt behaviour  though pleased with her  spirit  he set his invention to work  in order to contrive some means  of seeing her  and in a fit of musing arrived at the inn  where he found  his companions  whom he had left at the castle gate  They had already  made inquiry about the ladies  in consequence of which he learnt that  Miss Sophy was daughter of a gentleman in town to which his mistress  was related  that an intimate friendship subsisted between the two  young ladies  that Emilia had lived almost a month with her cousin  and  appeared at the last assembly  where she was universally admired  and  that several young gentlemen of fortune had since that time teased her  with addresses   Our hero s ambition was flattered  and his passion inflamed with this  intelligence  and he swore within himself that he would not quit the  spot until he should have obtained an undisputed victory over all his  rivals   That same evening he composed a most eloquent epistle  in which he  earnestly entreated that she would favour him with an opportunity of  vindicating his conduct  but she would neither receive his billet  nor  see his messenger  Balked in this effort  he inclosed it in a new cover  directed by another hand  and ordered Pipes to ride next morning to  London  on purpose to deliver it at the post office  that coming by such  conveyance she might have no suspicion of the author  and open it before  she should be aware of the deceit   Three days he waited patiently for the effect of this stratagem  and   in the afternoon of the fourth  ventured to hazard a formal visit  in  quality of an old acquaintance  But here too he failed in his attempt   she was indisposed  and could not see company  These obstacles  served only to increase his eagerness  he still adhered to his former    6 22 15  3 45 PM   resolution  and his companions  understanding his determination  left  him next day to his own inventions  Thus relinquished to his own ideas   he doubled his assiduity  and practised every method his imagination  could suggest  in order to promote his plan   Pipes was stationed all day long within sight of her door  that he might  be able to give his master an account of her motions  but she never  went abroad except to visit in the neighbourhood  and was always housed  before Peregrine could be apprised of her appearance  He went to church  with a view of attracting her notice  and humbled his deportment before  her  but she was so mischievously devout as to look at nothing but  her book  so that he was not favoured with one glance of regard  He  frequented the coffee house  and attempted to contract an acquaintance  with Miss Sophy s father  who  he hoped  would invite him to his house   but this expectation was also defeated  That prudent gentleman looked  upon him as one of those forward fortune hunters who go about
