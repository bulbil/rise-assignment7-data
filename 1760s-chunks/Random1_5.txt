incorruptible  She dreamed  she was delivered of a tennis ball  which the devil  who to her great surprize  acted the part of a midwife  struck so forcibly with a racket  that it disappeared in an instant  and she was for some time inconsolable for the loss of her off spring  when all of a sudden  she beheld it return with equal violence  and earth itself beneath her feet  whence immediately sprung up a goodly tree covered with blossoms  the scent of which operated so strongly on her nerves that she awoke —The attentive sage  after some deliberation  assured my parents  that their first born would be a great traveller  that he would undergo many dangers and difficulties  and at last return to his native land  where he would flourish with great reputation and happiness —How truly this was foretold  will appear in the sequel —It was not long before some officious person informed my grandfather of familiarities that passed between his son and housekeeper  which alarmed him so much  that  a few days after  he told my father it was high time for him to enter into the holy state of matrimony  and that he had provided a match for him  to which he could in justice have no objections  My father  finding it would be impossible to conceal his situation much longer  frankly owned what he had done  and excused himself for not having asked the consent of his father  by saying  he knew it would be to no purpose  and that  had his inclination been known  my grandfather might have taken such measures as would have effectually put the gratification   3 of it out of his power  he added  that no exception could be made to his wife s virtue  birth  beauty  and good sense  and as for fortune  it was beneath his consideration —The old gentleman  who kept all his passions  except one  in excellent order  heard him to an end with great temper  and then calmly asked  how he proposed to maintain himself and spouse —He replied  he could be in no danger of wanting  while his father s tenderness remained  which he and his wife would always cherish with the utmost veneration  that he was persuaded his allowance would be suitable to the dignity and circumstances of his family  and the provision already made to his brothers and sisters  who were happily settled under his protection —Your brothers and sisters  said my grandfather  did not think it beneath them to consult me in an affair of such importance as matrimony  neither  I suppose  would you have omitted that piece of duty  had you not some secret fund in reserve  to the comforts of which I leave you  with a desire that you will this night  seek out another habitation for yourself and wife  whither in a short time  I will send you an account of the …pence I have been at in your education  with a view of being reimbursed —Sir  you have made the grand tour—you are a polite gentleman—a very pretty gentleman—I wish you a great deal of joy  and am your very humble servant  So saying  he left my father in a situation easily imagined  However  he did not long hesitate  for lbeing perfectly well acquainted with his father s disposition  he did not doubt that he was glad of this pretence to get rid of him  and as his resolves were invariable like the laws of the Medes and Persians  he knew   4 it would be to no purpose to attempt him by prayers and intreaties  so without any farther application  he betook himself with his disconsolate bedfellow  to a farm house  where an old servant of his mother dwelt  there they remained some time in a situation but ill adapted to the elegance of their desires and tenderness of their love  which nevertheless  my father endured  rather than supplicate an unnatural and inflexible parent  but my mother  foreseeing the inconveniencies she would be exposed to  if she must be delivered in this place  and her pregnancy was very far advanced  without communicating her design to her husband  went in disguise to the house of my grandfather  hoping that her tears and condition would move him to compassion  and reconcile him to an event which could not otherwise be amended—She found means to deceive the servants  and was introduced as an unfortunate lady  who wanted to complain of some matrimonial grievances  it being my grandfather s particular province to decide in all cases of scandal  She was accordingly admitted into his presence  where discovering herself  she sell at his seet  and in the most affecting manner  implored his forgiveness  at the same time  representing the danger that threatned not only her life  but that of his own grandchild which was about to see the light —He told her  he was sorry that the indiscretion of her and his son had compelled him to make a vow  which put it out of his power to give them any assistance—That he had already imparted his thoughts on that subject to her husband  and was surprised that they should disturb his peace with any further importunity —This said  he retired —The violence of   5 my mother s affliction had such an effect on her constitution  that she was immediately seized with the pains
