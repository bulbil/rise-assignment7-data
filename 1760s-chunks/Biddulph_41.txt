of me  had he not been prejudiced in my favour  this young woman’s beauty and innocence  which he acknowleges  might have then engaged his honest vows  the wicked aunt would not have been tempted to betray her trust  nor he  shocking thought  whenever it recurs  to buy that favour he might have obtained on virtuous terms  His prior engagements to my brother was the final plea that undid them both  Had he not been furnished with this excuse  her hopes might have supported her virtue  or  if ignorant of this  she fell  what pretence could he offer  after the injury was done  for not fulfilling an obligation of so much importance  I could not have suffered by not obtaining a man I never saw  Miss B  is undone by losing him  Yet his word to Sir George  the breach of which could have been attended with no ill consequence  was to be preferred to an act of justice  This is that false honour upon which the men pique themselves so much  An innocent child stigmatized  an amiable woman abandoned to shame and grief  I thank Heaven I made not myself accessary to this  Had I married Mr Faulkland  knowing his fault  I could not say so  nor have blamed any thing but my own imprudence  if I in my turn found myself deserted  Who knows but he might  after having bound me in chains   return to his neglected mistress  and that love  which  when it would have been meritorious in him  he disrelished  he might have pursued with eagerness when interdicted  This might have been the case  I believe you may remember an instance of it among our own acquaintance  Mr Saunders  who refused a young lady for his bride  from an absolute dislike of her person  took uncommon pains to debauch her when she became the wife of his friend  Had Mr Faulkland so behaved  what a wretch it would have made me  You know I have not a grain of jealousy in my composition  yet I am sure a neglect of this kind would make me very miserable   You have not forgot  I believe  that about two years ago there was a match proposed to my mother by the bishop of B  between me and his nephew  The young man was heir to a good fortune  was reckoned    handsome and accomplished  and I think he really was so  I was intirely free from prepossessions in favour of any one  and had no objection to him  but that I knew he had a most lamentably vulnerable heart  for he had been in love with two or three women of my acquaintance  My mother mentioned him to me upon the good old prelate’s recommendation  and I gave her this as my reason for disliking the offer  which she approved of so intirely  that the thing went no farther  Indeed I think that woman is a fool  who risques her contentment with one of a light disposition  Marriage will not change men’s natures  and it is not every one who has virtue or prudence enough to be reclaimed  Upon the whole  I am satisfied with my lot  and am sure I could hear with pleasure  that Mr Faulkland was married to that Miss B  I wish I knew the other letters that compose her name   September 16  My mother asked me to day  Had I considered of what she had been saying to me  I told her I had  and only begged a little more time  She kissed me  with tears in her eyes  To be sure  my dear  as much as you can reasonably desire  I know my Sidney is above trifling  Mrs Vere was present when my mother left the room  Oh  Miss Bidulph  said she  who would refuse to gratify such a parent as that  Had my mother condescended to treat me so  I am sure she could have wrought on me to do any thing she liked  even though it had been repugnant to my inclination  Dear madam  I replied  how sweetly you inforce my duty—Yes  I will obey that kindest best of mothers  I believe I spoke this  tho’ without intending it  in a tone that implied something like making a merit of this concession  for Mrs Vere immediately answered  There’s a good child  that  to oblige its mamma  will accept of a very handsome young gentleman  with a good estate  and one that many a girl in England would give her eyes for  I felt the rebuke  but turning it off with a smile  said  but you forget  my dear  that I am not dying for him   September 20  How will you plume yourself on your sagacity  Cecilia  when you read this account of my love  which you so wisely foretold  I can tell you I am trying to like Mr Arnold as fast as I can  I make him sing and play for this purpose from morning till night  for he is here every day and all day  Lady Grimston holds her head a quarter of a yard higher    than she did before  and looks  as who should say  it was I that brought this about  The
