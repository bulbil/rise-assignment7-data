had the extreme mortification to find himself shut out  He  durst not knock or signify his presence in any other manner  on account  of the lady s reputation  which would have greatly suffered had the  snorer been waked by his endeavours  Had he known that the person  who thus thwarted his views was the painter  he would have taken some    6 22 15  3 45 PM   effectual step to remove him  but he could not conceive what should  induce Pallet to take up his residence in that corner  nor could he use  the assistance of a light  to distinguish him  because there was not a  candle burning in the house   It is impossible to describe the rage and vexation of our hero  while he  continued thus tantalized upon the brink of bliss  after his desire had  been exasperated by the circumstances of his former disappointments  He  ejaculated a thousand execrations against his own fortune  cursed all  his fellow travellers without exception  vowed revenge against the  painter  who had twice confounded his most interesting scheme  and was  tempted to execute immediate vengeance upon the unknown cause of his  present miscarriage  In this agony of distraction did he sweat two  whole hours in the passage  though not without some faint hope of being  delivered from his tormentor  who  he imagined  upon waking  would  undoubtedly shift his quarters  and leave the field free to his designs   but when he heard the cock repeat his salutation to the morn  which  began to open on the rear of night  he could no longer restrain his  indignation  Going to his own chamber  he filled a basin with cold  water  and  standing at some distance  discharged it full in the face  of the gaping snorer  who  over and above the surprise occasioned by the  application  was almost suffocated by the liquor that entered his  mouth  and ran down into his windpipe  While he gasped like a person  half drowned  without knowing the nature of his disaster  or remembering  the situation in which he fell asleep  Peregrine retired to his own  door  and  to his no small astonishment  from a long howl that invaded  his ears  learned that the patient was no other than Pallet  who had  now  for the third time  balked his good fortune   Enraged at the complicated trespasses of this unfortunate offender   he rushed from his apartment with a horsewhip  and  encountering the  painter in his flight  overturned him in the passage  There he exercised  the instrument of his wrath with great severity on pretence of mistaking  him for some presumptuous cur  which had disturbed the repose of the  inn  nay  when he called aloud for mercy in a supplicating tone  and his  chastiser could no longer pretend to treat him as a quadruped  such was  the virulence of the young gentleman s indignation  that he could  not help declaring his satisfaction  by telling Pallet he had richly  deserved the punishment he had undergone  for his madness  folly  and  impertinence  in contriving and executing such idle schemes  as had no  other tendency than that of plaguing his neighbours   Pallet protested  with great vehemence  that he was innocent as the  child unborn of an intention to give umbrage to any person whatever   except the Israelite and his doxy  who he knew had incurred his  displeasure   But as God is my Saviour   said he   I believe I am  persecuted with witchcraft  and begin to think that d  d priest is  an agent of the devil  for he has been but two nights in our company   during which I have not closed an eye  but  on the contrary  have been  tormented by all the fiends of hell   Pickle peevishly replied  that his  torments had been occasioned by his own foolish imagination  and asked  how he came to howl in that corner  The painter  who did not think  proper to own the truth  said  that he had been transported thither by  some preternatural conveyance  and soused in water by an invisible hand   The youth  in hope of profiting by his absence  advised him to retire  immediately to his bed  and by sleep strive to comfort his brain  which  seemed to be not a little disordered by the want of that refreshment     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Pallet himself began to be very much of the same way of thinking  and   in compliance with such wholesome counsel  betook himself to rest   muttering prayers all the way for the recovery of his own understanding   Pickle attended him to his chamber  and  locking him up  put the key in  his own pocket  that he might not have it in his power to interrupt him  again  but in his return he was met by Mr  Jolter and the doctor  who  had been a second time alarmed by the painter s cries  and came to  inquire about this new adventure  Half frantic with such a
