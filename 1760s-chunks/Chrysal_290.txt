have   served my country above forty years with fidelity   and I will take   the liberty to say with some success  And now when my constitu    tion is broken with wounds  fatigue  and change of climates  when   nature calls for rest and refreshment  the only reward I have to   expect is poverty  and its inseparable attendant  contempt  This    sir  is the cause of my unhappiness   and such a cause as I believe   you will think to be a just one          Very true  sir    replied the captain    it is a just one   and what   must affect every man of spirit  and a generous way of thinking    But you should not yield to it too far  You are still in the vigour         340 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     of life   and  while the war continues  should look forward with   hope  Though you have been unsuccessful hitherto  fortune may   prove more kind          Alas  sir    returned my master    I have been so long cheated   by hope  that I now detest it  When I came out upon this last   expedition  our force made me so confident of success  and I was   so well acquainted with the wealth in the place  that I  unhappily    gave way to hope  and ran into expenses  which  though far from   being unnecessary  were imprudent  and threaten now to involve   me in ruin on my return home  as it had been thought proper by   our superiors to rate our service in the conquest at so low a   price          If that is the case  then    said the captain    do not return till   matters mend  Whenever I am ordered home  I ll take care to get   you removed into another ship  Your staying abroad on such   nn account is not inconsistent with the strictest honour  as you do   it with an intention truly honest         Dear sir    answered my master    that is very true  But I am   precluded even from the wretched relief of a voluntary exile  I   have a wife and children at home  the apprehension of whose dis    tresses drives me to despair  It was to clothe and settle them in   f  little habitation  where they might enjoy the indispensable neces    saries of life with some degree of comfort  that I anticipated my   success in the manner I mentioned   and now  as the success has   fallen so far short of what I thought just expectation  all the former   savings of my life â€” savings from the very necessities of nature â€”   will be torn away by the rapacious hands of merciless creditors  to   make up the deficiency in the articles bought of themselves to   discharge their demands  and my wretched family thrown upon   the unfriendly world  without its being in my power to assist them    I must  therefore  return  and go into jail to prevent their starving   in the streets  What affected myself only  honest indignation   enabled me to support  I have seen boys whose ignorance I de    spised  and men whose principles I detested  preferred to command    while my services were overlooked   but  as I had not the interest   of the former  nor the modish merit of the latter  I bore my fate   with patience  But to have those dearer to me than life exposed   to misery  is more than I can bear         Nor shall you bear it     replied the captain  who had feigned   to cough to hide the sjrmpathetio tear that glistened in his eye      Nor shall you bear it   How much is the debt that alarms you     I will advance it for you directly   and not that only  I will   take upon me to make your merit â€” to which I am no stranger â€”   known to your superiors  in such Â» light as shall not fail of just   reward          Oh  sir     returned my master  as soon as the fulness of his heart   gave him utterance    how can I submit to obligations to which it   is impossible I should ever make any return         All the return I desire    answered the captain    is your friend    ship  Speak   how much do you want   The packet is yet in   sight  I will order a
