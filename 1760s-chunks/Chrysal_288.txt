critics on the conduct of their officers    and not only like people in higher stations revere the virtues which   they have not resolution to imitate  but also actually do imitate   them in a great degree            END OF THE SECOND VOLtTME         VOLUME III         CHAPTER I     THE FOLLY OF A PERSON PEOSTITTTTING HIS CHARACTER TO PLEASE   HIS COMPANY AGGRAVATED BY THE DANGEROITS MISTAKE OF   RIDICULE FOR APPLAUSE â€” CHRYSAL S MASTER CHANGES PLACE   WITH THE CHAPLAIN  AND PREACHES HIM AN INTERESTING SERMON    IN WHICH  AMONG REMARKS MORE JUST THAN POLITE  HE GIVES   AN UNCOMMON REASON FOR THE PARTICULAR DEFORMITY OF VICE   IN WOMEN     I HAVE already taken notice of the efEeot whicli the advice and   example of the captain had upon every one in the ship  The officers   lived like a family of brothers  and the men did their duty with   regularity and pleasure   but  though all paid due respect to what   he said  it was impossible to work such an instantaneous reforma    tion   but that some of them would now and then jest among   themselves upon his conduct  as  from comparison with that of   others of his rank  inconsistent with his character   and in other   respects indulge in the levities of discourse and behaviour too   general among persons not much accustomed to the rules of rational   conversation      But  whatever allowances the circumstances of their education   might claim for such sallies in the officers  the person who trans    gressed most was certainly entitled to none  This was the chaplain    who  to avoid the imputation of being hypocritically sanctified    ran into the opposite extreme  The selfish vanity of man always   takes pleasure in seeing any person debase himself by acting   beneath his character  especially if that character is such as appears   to be placed in a more respectable point of view than their   own  The officers  who in general look upon a chaplain as no better   than lumber in a ship  and think he is placed as a kind of check   upon them  were pleased with his prostitution  which he  by a   common mistake of ridicule for applause  gave still further into    imagining they laughed with him  when  in reality  they laughed   at him      But my master beheld the matter in another light  and  taking   an opportunity one day  when the chaplain and he were by them    selves in the ward room    I have observed with much concern  sir      said he    that you are falling into an error  which I have knowu   prove fatal to many gentlemen of your profession  This is depart    ing from your character in order to accommodate yourself to what   you thinli the humour of your company  Believe me  sir  no man   ever did so who did not immediately fall into contempt with the   very people whose approbation he strove to purchase at so dear   a rate  The greatest libertine despises a clergyman who is a liber    tine   and the reason is plain  You are set apart from the rest of         338 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     mankind to perform the rites of religion  and inculcate virtue by   your precepts and example   and for thia you are paid by the   public  who expect that you should earn your wages  by doing   your duty   and look upon those who do not as no better than   cheats  This may appear an odd way of speaking  but it is true   nevertheless  On the other hand  where a clergyman fulfils his   duty  and enforces his preaching by his practice  though he may   not absolutely reform all those with whom he converses  yet he   will certainly work this good effect  that he will keep them   in awe  and prevent their running into outrageous lengths of   wickedness  at least in his presence  For  whatever people may   inconsiderately imagine  no man ever acted in character  who was   not respected   no man ever acted out of character who was not   despised        Do but reflect a moment in what light you yourself would look   upon a lady who should speak obscenely  swear  drink  and talk   of fighting  and it will show you the justice of this remark  For   what makes these vices so particularly hateful in a woman  is not   anything in their nature particularly contradictory to the sex   more than ours  but because they are contrary to her character    I beg your pardon  sir
