 and Fairfax and Cromwell availed themselves of the circumstances that offered  Every city that they   32 appeared before capitulated  The young Prince of Wales  afterwards Charles II  participated in the misfortunes of his father  and fled to the island of Scilly  The King drew the shattered remains of his army into Oxford  and once more demanded peace  But  if he could not obtain it in the prosperous state of his affairs  it was not likely that he could now succeed in his desires after a defeat  The house of commons insulted his misfortunes  His letters to the Queen were published  with those illnatured remarks and railleries which none but the vicious are capable of making  To be at once merry and malicious is the sign of a corrupt heart and mean understanding   The King  after having taken every measure that he thought could procure peace  without effect  now saw himself shut up in Oxford  a place almost without any fortifications  and every day in danger of falling into the power of a fierce and exasperated party  In such a situation he therefore was obliged to chuse the least of two evils  and to deliver himself up to the Scotch army  rather than the English  as he expected to find less animosity in the former  The Scotch officers had made him some general promises  grounded  probably  upon their hopes of his compliance with every request they should make  He sent them word of his intention to come to their army  and they promised to receive him  and provide for his safety  Upon this precarious assurance the King left Oxford  and  travelling through byways and obscure places  arrived at the Scotch army in nine days  From that moment he ceased to be free  The Scotch began to negotiate with the English army  carried their royal prisoner about from one place to another  and  at length  upon consideration of being paid the arrears due for their service in England  which amounted to two hundred thousand pounds  they delivered up their King  and returned   33 home laden with the reproaches of all good men  and the internal conviction of their own baseness  From this period till the usurpation of Cromwell  the constitution was convulsed with all the distractions of guilt and party  When the kingly power was abolished  the parliament then took up the authority  but they were soon to lay it down in turn  and submit to a military democracy  a new form of government  which  like all other democracies  was turbulent  feeble  and bloody   I am   c   LETTER V   THE civil war was now over  the army of Scotland  being paid the reward of perfidy  returned to its own country  The parliament had now no enemy to fear  except those very troops which had fought their battles with success  You have been already informed  that this army  by a political stroke of Cromwell  was rendered independent of the parliament  and all its generals disabled from sitting there  The commons therefore were now willing to get rid of it as soon as possible  well knowing that  if the army continued  instead of receiving laws  it would presume to dictate  They therefore passed a vote  by which it was ordained  that a part of it should be disbanded  and another part of it sent over into Ireland  It may easily be imagined that Cromwell would not suffer this  Now was the crisis of his greatness  and he seized the opportunity  he formed a council of officers  and another of common soldiers  called Agitators  who were appointed to enquire into the grievances of the army  and lay them before the parliament  The very   34 same conduct which had formerly passed between the parliament and King was now put in practice between the army and parliament  As the commons granted every request the army rose in their demands  these accused the army of mutiny and sedition  and those retorted the accusation  by alledging a manifest design in the parliament to rule alone   The King had been confined since he came into the power of the English  at Holmby castle  the army were resolved to be possessed of his person  and sent one Joyce  a cornet  who from a taylor was become an officer  to take the King by force  and bring him a prisoner to Newmarket  This commission he executed with intrepidity and dispatch  It was in vain that the commons  now without power  complained of this insolence  the army  instead of being awed by their menaces  marched towards London  and now  in turn  prescribed laws to their employers  Cromwell  willing to give all his injustice the appearance of rectitude  caused eleven members of the house of commons to be accused  These were the most powerful and leading speakers  which so astonished the members  that  willing to appease the army at any rate  they writ to the general  that they were ready to receive any particular charge against such as fell under his displeasure   This was an overture for peace  but pre eminence was what the army aimed at  instead therefore of being pleased at this condescension  the general turned their accusation into a general complaint  and tried every method
