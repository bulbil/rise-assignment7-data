are full  to decoy you  I think you had   better come home to share our poverty with safety  than live with so   much discontent in a plenty  that itself may be dangerous  God direct   you for the best  While you have Mrs  Jervis for an adviser and   bed fellow   and  O my dear child  that was prudently done of you     we are easier than we should be  and so committing you to the divine   protection  remain                                  Your truly loving  but careful                                                         FATHER and MOTHER                LETTER XIV         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       Mrs  Jervis and I have lived very comfortably together for this   fortnight past  for my master was all that time at his Lincolnshire   estate  and at his sister s  the Lady Davers  But he came home   yesterday  He had some talk with Mrs  Jervis soon after  and mostly   about me  He said to her  it seems  Well  Mrs  Jervis  I know Pamela has   your good word  but do you think her of any use in the family  She told   me she was surprised at the question  but said  That I was one of the   most virtuous and industrious young creatures that ever she knew  Why   that word virtuous  said he  I pray you  Was there any reason to suppose   her otherwise  Or has any body taken it into his head to try her   I   wonder  sir  says she  you ask such a question  Who dare offer any thing   to her in such an orderly and well governed house as yours  and under a   master of so good a character for virtue and honour  Your servant  Mrs    Jervis  says he  for your good opinion  but pray  if any body did  do   you think Pamela would let you know it  Why  sir  said she  she is a   poor innocent young creature  and I believe has so much confidence in   me  that she would take my advice as soon as she would her mother s    Innocent  again  and virtuous  I warrant  Well  Mrs  Jervis  you abound   with your epithets  but I take her to be an artful young baggage  and   had I a young handsome butler or steward  she d soon make her market of   one of them  if she thought it worth while to snap at him for a husband    Alack a day  sir  said she  it is early days with Pamela  and she does   not yet think of a husband  I dare say  and your steward and butler are   both men in years  and think nothing of the matter  No  said he  if they   were younger  they d have more wit than to think of such a girl  I ll   tell you my mind of her  Mrs  Jervis  I don t think this same favourite   of yours so very artless a girl as you imagine  I am not to dispute with   your honour  said Mrs  Jervis  but I dare say  if the men will let her   alone  she ll never trouble herself about them  Why  Mrs  Jervis  said   he  are there any men that will not let her alone  that you know of    No  indeed  sir  said she  she keeps herself so much to herself  and yet   behaves so prudently  that they all esteem her  and shew her as great a   respect as if she was a gentlewoman born       Ay  says he  that s her art  that I was speaking of  but  let me tell   you  the girl has vanity and conceit  and pride too  or I am mistaken    and  perhaps  I could give you an instance of it  Sir  said she  you can   see farther than such a poor silly woman as I am  but I never saw any   thing but innocence in her  And virtue too  I ll warrant ye  said he    But suppose I could give you an instance  where she has talked a little   too freely of the kindnesses that have been shewn her from a certain   quarter  and has had the vanity to
