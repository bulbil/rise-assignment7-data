us that you   were formerly accustomed to set folk to sleep  but  for the present    you have opened all eyes to observation  Ah  madam   answered   Harry  could I have guessed at the moon that was to shine this   night  I should have assumed a very different character  What   character  I pray you   That of Endymion  madam  I wish  she   whispered  that you were a prince  or that I were a peasant   and   so saying  she turned from him and mixed in the crowd      Harry was next addressed by a shepherdess  and again by a nun    But he declined as honourably as he could to tend the flock of the   one  or to be the cause of any breach of vows in the other  observing   to her that she had already taken the veil  The boy is a FOOL     said she   I know it  said Harry      A gipsy then accosted  and taking him by the hand Will you   be pleased  sir  to be told your fortune  said she  By no means    my sweet voiced Cassandra  answered Harry   I would avoid  above   all things  prying into futurity  Knowledge  sir  is surely desirable    and  above all  foreknowledge  Not so  said Harry  foreknowledge   of evil would but double the misery   and foreknowledge of good   would deprive me of hope by certainty   and hope is a blessing   perhaps preferable to possession  Tell me  sir  and tell me truly    did you ever yet see the girl that you could like  Yes  madam    two or three  for whom I have conceived a very tender friendship    but no one yet for whom I have conceived a passion  Ah  then    Mr  Mercury   said the gentle prophetess  I have only to desire the   last cast of your office   when I am dead  be so grateful as to waft   my friendly spirit to the shades of Elysium  there to join Dido and   other unfortunate lovers      So saying  she turned and retired with a sigh that entered and   sunk into the heart of our hero      The company now began to depart  when the Earl of Albemarle    coming up to Harry  took him a little apart  and throwing his arm   over his shoulder  pressed him to him and said My dear fellow    you have done me singular honour this night  pray  double the   favour to me by letting me see you again speedily  and as often   as you can  For the present  you must not go till their majesties   have spoken with you  Not to night  so please your excellency    answered Harry   at all other times I shall be ready to attend and   serve their majesties without any mask      The next morning Mr  Fenton was much surprised by a visit         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  317     from the great man  During breakfast the earl pressed eagerly   for Harry s attendance at court  and promised every advantage and   honour that the crown could bestoAv  You must pardon me  my   lord  said Mr  Fenton   I am willing to advance to you two hundred   thousand pounds more towards his majesty s present expedition   against the French  whom I look upon to be our natural and   salutary enemies  They are as Carthage was to Rome   they hold   us in exercise  and keep a quarrelsome people from falling out   among themselves  Indeed  my lord  I am desirous of gratifying   my royal master with any thing except the sacrifice of my child    I cannot part with him till his education is completed   and then    if he answers my expectations  I doubt I may be more unwilling   to part with him  than ever      In the afternoon our company went again to the Tower  to   see as well as to hear the recent story of the great lion and the   little dog      They found the place thronged  and all were obliged to pay treble   prices  on account of the unprecedented novelty of the show  so   that the keeper in a short space acquired a little fortune      The great cage in front was occupied by a beast who  by way of   pre eminence  was called the king s lion   and  while he traversed   the limits of his straitened dominions  he was attended by a small   and very beautiful black spaniel  who frisked and gamboled about   him  and at times would pretend to snarl and bite
