you  and besides  if his views in her settlement are ambitious  how can he do better  You have a patent of nobility in your pocket  and upon that your posterity may ride easy  after five generations  when pedigree herself shall be lost in the confusion of her materials  it may exercise the diligence of learned inquiry  to trace the family of the Santillanes to the beginning of its archives  and consecrate the fame of its founder by the indistinctness of his story       CH  XIV     A double marriage  and the conclusion of the history   By this discourse  Scipio encouraged me to declare myself  without considering bow he exposed me to the danger of a refusal  My own resolution was taken with fear and trembling  Though I carried my years well  and might have sunk at least ten  it did not seem unlikely that a young beauty might turn up her nose at the disparity  I determined  however  to bolt the question the first time I saw her brother  who was not without his trepidations on the subject of my god daughter   He returned my call the next morning  just as I had done dressing  Signor de Santillane  said he  I wish to speak with you on some serious business  I took him into my closet  where entering on the subject at once  I imagine  continued he  that you are not unacquainted with the purpose of my visit  I love Seraphina  you are all in all with her father  I must request you therefore to intercede and procure for me the accomplishment of my heart s desire  then shall I have to thank you for the prime bliss of my existence  Signor Don Juan  answered I  as you come to the point at once  you can have no objection to my following your example  My good offices are fully at your service  and I shall hope for yours with your sister in return   Don Juan was agreeably surprised  Can it be possible  exclaimed he  that Dorothea should have made a conquest of your heart since yesterday  It is even so  said I  and it would make me the happiest of men  if the proposal should meet with your joint approbation  You may rely on that  replied he  though with some pretensions to family pride  yours is not an alliance to be despised  You flatter me highly  rejoined I  that you are not mealy mouthed about receiving a commoner into your pedigree  is a mark of good sense  but even if nobility had been a necessary ingredient in your sister s requisites for a husband  we should not have quarrelled on that account  I have worked out twenty years in the trammels of office  and the king  as a reward of my long labours  has granted me a patent of nobility  This high  minded gentleman read my credentials over with extreme satisfaction  and returning them  told me that Dorothea was mine  And Seraphina yours  exclaimed I   Thus were the two marriages agreed on between us  The consent of the intended brides was all that remained  for we neither of us presumed to control the inclinations of our wards  My friend therefore carried home my proposal to his sister  and I called Scipio  Beatrice  and my god daughter together  for the purpose of laying open a similar project  Beatrice voted loudly for immediate acceptance  and Seraphina silently  The father did not say much against it  but boggled a little at the fortune he must give to a gentleman whose seat required such immediate and extensive repairs  I stopped Scipio s mouth by telling him that was my concern  and that I should contribute four thousand pistoles to the architect s estimate   In the evening  Don Juan came again  Your business is going swimmingly  said I  pray heaven mine may promise as fairly  Better it cannot  answered he  my influence was quite unnecessary to prevail with Dorothea  your person had made its impression  and your manners pleased her  You were afraid she might not like you  while she  with more reason  having nothing to offer you but her heart and hand         What would she offer more  interrupted I  out of my wits with joy  Since the lovely Dorothea can think of me without repugnance  I ask no more  my fortune is ample  and the possession of her is the only dowry I should value   Don Juan and myself  highly delighted at having brought our views to bear so soon  were for hastening our nuptials  and cutting off all superfluous ceremonies  I closeted the gentleman with Seraphina s parents  the settlemeuts were soon agreed on  and he took his leave  promising to return next day with Dorothea  My eager desire of appearing agreeable in that lady s eyes  occasioned me to spend three hours at least in adjusting my dress  and communicating the air of a lover to my person  but I could not do it so much to my mind as in my younger days  The preparations for courtship are a pleasure to a young man  but a serious business and hazardous speculation to one who is beginning to be oldish
