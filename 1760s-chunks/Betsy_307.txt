rendezvous  The punctual Mr  Munden   waited for her at the chapel door  and conducted her where they had all   the freedom they could wish of indulging their vicious inclinations       They broke off this amorous intercourse much sooner than either of them   desired  Mademoiselle de Roquelair not being able to find a plausible   excuse to make to Mrs  Munden for staying beyond the time which her   pretended devotions might be reasonably supposed to take up  but  to   atone for this misfortune  a strategem was contrived between them  not   only for their meeting next day  but also for their continuing together   a much longer time  It was thus       She told Mrs  Munden that the reverend father to whom she had confessed    informed her that a young lady  of a very worthy family in England    having passed her year of probation at a monastery in Bologne  and   returned hither only to take an eternal leave of her friends  and of the   world  was now just ready to go back  in order to be initiated   To this   family   added she   the good father has offered to introduce me   to morrow  and if the young lady approves of my being the companion of   her voyage  as he assures me she certainly will  how happy shall I think   myself        The truth of all this not being suspected by Mrs  Munden  she   congratulated her upon it  It is easy to deceive the innocent  but  it   must be owned  this wicked woman had subtlety enough to have imposed on   a person more skilled in the artifices of the world than was the amiable   lady on whom she practised it       But  not to detain the reader s attention on so ungrateful a subject  I   shall only say  that one assignation was still productive of another    and the credulity of the injured wife served only as a matter of mirth   to the transgressing husband and his guilty partner       But now the time was come when the subterfuges must necessarily be at an   end  or become too gross not to be seen through  Mr  Thoughtless had   seen his friend  had paid the money into his hands  and received a bill   from him on the merchant at Bologne  When he delivered it to Mrs    Munden   Sister   said he   this paper will entitle your guest to the   receipt of three hundred louis d ors on her arrival at Bologne  but I   expect you will oblige her to depart immediately  for it is neither   consistent with your reputation to keep her in your house  nor with my   peace of mind that she should continue in the kingdom   To which she   replied  with a smile   That there was nothing more certain than that   his commands  in this point  would be punctually obeyed        This lady was rejoiced at having accomplished what she thought so good a   work  but  having perceived in Mademoiselle de Roquelair some abatement   of her first eagerness for a religious life  she thought proper  on   giving her the bill  to repeat to her the words her brother had said on   that account  to which the other coolly answered   Your brother  Madam    need be under no apprehensions of my offending him in this point  or of   giving you any farther trouble        This  though no more than what the lovers expected  was yet a dreadful   shock to them both  great part of the time they were together that   evening was taken up in talking of it  Mademoiselle de Roquelair   protested that death was less cruel than being torn from her dear Munden   thus early  thus in the infancy of their happiness  and gave some hints   that she wished he would hire private lodgings for her  but she knew   little of the temper of the man she had to deal with  He loved her as a   mistress  but hated the expence of keeping her as a mistress  he   therefore evaded all discourse on that head  and told her he fancied   that  by pretences such as already had been made  she might still   continue in the house   Means  at least   said he   might be found out   to protract our mutual misfortune  and give us more time to consider   what we have to do        She agreed  however  to make the experiment  and poor Mrs  Munden was   imposed upon  by some new invention  from one day to another  for   upwards of a week  but  at last  beginning to fear there was something   more at the bottom
