 Then the wicked creature appeared  whom I had never seen but once   before  and I was terrified out of my wits  No stratagem  thought I  not   one  for a poor innocent girl  but every thing to turn out against me    that is hard indeed       So I began to pull in my horns  as they say  for I saw I was now worse   off than at the farmer s       The naughty woman came up to me with an air of confidence  and kissed   me  See  sister  said she  here s a charming creature  Would she not   tempt the best lord in the land to run away with her  O frightful    thought I  here s an avowal of the matter at once  I am now gone  that s   certain  And so was quite silent and confounded  and seeing no help for   it   for she would not part with me out of her sight  I was forced to   set out with her in the chariot for she came thither on horseback  with   a man servant  who rode by us the rest of the way  leading her horse    and now I gave over all thoughts of redemption  and was in a desponding   condition indeed       Well  thought I  here are strange pains taken to ruin a poor innocent    helpless  and even worthless young body  This plot is laid too deep    and has been too long hatching  to be baffled  I fear  But then I put   my trust in God  who I knew was able to do every thing for me  when all   other possible means should fail  and in him I was resolved to confide       You may see   Yet  oh  that kills me  for I know not whether ever you   can see what I now write or no  Else you will see   what sort of woman   that Mrs  Jewkes is  compared to good Mrs  Jervis  by this           Every now and then she would be staring in my face  in the chariot  and   squeezing my hand  and saying  Why  you are very pretty  my silent dear    And once she offered to kiss me  But I said  I don t like this sort of   carriage  Mrs  Jewkes  it is not like two persons of one sex  She fell   a laughing very confidently  and said  That s prettily said  I vow  Then   thou hadst rather be kissed by the other sex   I fackins  I commend thee   for that       I was sadly teased with her impertinence  and bold way  but no wonder    she was innkeeper s housekeeper  before she came to my master  and those   sort of creatures don t want confidence  you know  and indeed she made   nothing to talk boldly on twenty occasions  and said two or three times    when she saw the tears every now and then  as we rid  trickle down my   cheeks  I was sorely hurt  truly  to have the handsomest and finest   young gentleman in five counties in love with me       So I find I am got into the hands of a wicked procuress  and if I was   not safe with good Mrs  Jervis  and where every body loved me  what a   dreadful prospect have I now before me  in the hands of a woman that   seems to delight in filthiness       O dear sirs  what shall I do  What shall I do   Surely  I shall never be   equal to all these things       About eight at night  we entered the court yard of this handsome  large    old  and lonely mansion  that looks made for solitude and mischief  as I   thought  by its appearance  with all its brown nodding horrors of lofty   elms and pines about it  and here  said I to myself  I fear  is to be   the scene of my ruin  unless God protect me  who is all sufficient       I was very sick at entering it  partly from fatigue  and partly from   dejection of spirits  and Mrs  Jewkes got me some mulled wine  and   seemed mighty officious to welcome me thither  and while she was absent    ordering the wine  the wicked Robin came in to me  and said  I beg a   thousand pardons for my part in this affair  since I see your grief and   your distress  and I do assure you  that I am sorry it fell to my task       Mighty well  Mr  Robert
