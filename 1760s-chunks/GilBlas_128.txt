about Don Lewis  for my mistress was in a fidget to ask the grand question  Of course          he is well with the ladies in your parts  Enough of         of love affairs         on his hands  Oh  do not you be afraid of that  rejoined the old lady  it is a forward sprig of gallantry  take my word for it  He has but to shew himself before the works  and the citadel sends to capitulate  Among the number of his conquests  he has got into the good graces of a lady  with as much youth and beauty as he will know what to do with  Her name is Isabella  Her father is an old doctor of laws  She is over head and ears in love with him  absolutely out of her wits  Well  but do tell me now  my dear little woman  interrupted Aurora  as if she was ready to burst  is he out of his wits too  He used to be very fond of her  answered Bernarda Ramirez  before he went last to Madrid  but whether he holds in the same mind still  I will not venture to say  because on these points he is not altogether to be trusted  He is apt to flirt  first with one woman  and then with another  just as all you young deceivers take pleasure in doing  You are all alike   The bonny widow had scarcely got to the end of her harangue  before we heard a noise in the court  On looking out at the window  behold  there appeared two young men dismounting from their steeds  Who should it be  but the identical Don Lewis Pacheco  just arrived from Madrid with a servant behind him  The old lady brushed off to go and usher him in  while my mistress was putting herself in order  not without some palpitation of heart  to enact Don Felix to the best of her conceptions  Without waiting for any formalities  in marched Don Lewis to our apartment in his travelling dress  I have just been informed  said he  paying his respects to Aurora  that a young nobleman of Toledo takes up his abode in this house  May I take the liberty of expressing my joy in the circumstance  and hoping that we may be better acquainted  During my mistress s reply to this compliment  it seemed to me as if Pacheco did not know what to make of so smock faced a young spark  Indeed he could not refrain from declaring a more than ordinary admiration of an air and figure so attractive  After abundance of discourse  with every demonstration of reciprocal good breeding  Don Lewis withdrew to the apartment provided for him   While he was getting his boots off and changing his dress and linen  a sort of a page  on the look out after him to deliver a letter  met Aurora by chance on the staircase  Her he mistook for Don Lewis  Thinking he had found the right owner for this tender message  of which he was the Mercury    Softly  my honoured lord and master  said he  though I have not the honour of knowing Signor Pacheco  there can be no occasion for asking whether you are the man  It is impossible to be mistaken in the guess  No  my friend  answered my mistress with a most happy presence of mind  assuredly you are not mistaken  You acquit yourself of your embassies to a marvel  I am Don Lewis Pacheco  You may retire  I will find an opportunity of sending an answer  The page vanished  and Aurora shutting herself up with her waiting maid and me  opened the letter  and read to us as follows      I have just heard of your being at Salamanca  With what joy did I receive the news  I thought I should have gone out of my senses  But do you love Isabella as well as ever  Lose no time in assuring her that you are still the same  In good truth  she will almost expire with pleasure when once she is assured of your constancy    This is a mighty passionate epistle  said Aurora  The heart that indited it has been caught in a trap  This lady is a rival of no mean capacity  No pains must be spared to wean Don Lewis from her  and even to prevent any future interview  The undertaking is difficult  I acknowledge  and yet there seems no reason to despair of the result  My mistress  taking her own hint  fell into a fit of musing  from which having recovered as soon as she fell into it  she added    I will lay a wager they are at daggers drawn in less than twenty four hours  It so happened that Pacheco  after a short repose in his apartment  came to look after us in ours  and entered once more into conversation with Aurora before supper  My dapper little knight  said he with a rakish air  I fancy the poor devils of husbands and lovers will have no reason to hug themselves on your arrival at Salamanca  You will make their hearts ache for them  As for
