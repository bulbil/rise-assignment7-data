had been long enacted  but  while penal statutes were mitigated on one hand  they were strangely increased by a number of others   The great business of the parliament  from this period  seemed to consist in restraining corruption  and bringing such to justice  as had grown wealthy from the plunder of the public  The number of laws that were now enacted every session  seemed calculated for the safety of the subject  but  in reality  were symptoms of the universal corruption  The more corrupt the commonwealth  the more numerous are the laws   William was willing to admit all the restraints they chose to lay on the royal prerogative in England  upon condition of being properly supplied with the means of humbling the power of France  War  and foreign politics  were all he knew  or desired to understand  The sums of money granted him for the prosecution of this war were incredible  and the nation  not contented with furnishing him with such supplies as they were immediately capable of raising  involved themselves in debts  which they have never since been able to discharge  For all this profusion England received  in return  the empty reward of military glory in Flanders  and the consciousness of having given the Dutch  whom they saved  frequent opportunities of being ungrateful   The treaty of Ryswick  at length  put an end to a war  in which England had engaged without interest  and came off without advantage  In the general pacification her interests seemed intirely deserted  and  for all her blood and treasure  the only   88 equivalent she received  was  the King of France s acknowledgment of King William s title to the crown   The King  now freed from a foreign war  laid himself out to strengthen his authority at home  He conceived hopes of keeping up the forces that were granted him  in time of war  during the continuance of the peace  but he was not a little mortified to find that the commons had passed a vote  that all the forces in English pay  exceeding seven thousand men  should be forthwith disbanded  and that those retained should be natural English subjects  A standing army was this Monarch s greatest delight  he had been bred up in camps  and knew no other pleasure but that of reviewing troops  or dictating to generals  He professed himself therefore entirely displeased with the proposal  and his indignation was kindled to such a pitch  that he actually conceived a design of abandoning the government  His ministers  however  diverted him from this resolution  and persuaded him to consent to passing the bill  Such were the altercations between the King and his parliament  which continued during his reign  He considered his commons as a set of men desirous of power  and consequently resolved upon obstructing all his projects  He seemed but little attached to any party in the house  he veered from Whigs to Tories  as interest  or immediate exigence  demanded  England he considered as a place of labour  anxiety  and altercation  He used to retire to his seat at Loo in Holland  for those moments which he dedicated to pleasure or tranquility  It was in this quiet retreat he planned the different successions of Europe  and laboured to undermine the politics of Lewis XIV  his insidious rival in power  and in fame  Against France his resentment was ever levelled  and he had made vigorous preparations for entering into a new war with that kingdom    89 when death interrupted the execution of his schemes  He was naturally of a very feeble constitution  and it was now almost exhausted by a life of continual action and care  He endeavoured to conceal the defects of his infirmities  and repair his health by riding  In one of his excursions to Hampton court  his horse fell under him  and he himself was thrown off with such violence that his collar bone was fractured  This  in a robust constitution  would have been a trifling misfortune  but to him it was fatal  Perceiving his end approach  the objects of his former care still lay next his heart  the interests of Europe still filled him with concern  The Earl of Albemarle arriving from Holland  he conferred with him in private on the posture of affairs abroad  Two days after  having received the sacrament from Archbishop Tennison  he expired  in the fifty second year of his age  after having reigned thirteen years   William left behind him the character of a great politician  though he had never been popular  and a formidable general  though he was seldom victorious  his deportment was grave and sullen  nor did he ever shew any fire  but in the day of battle  He despised flattery  yet loved dominion  Greater as the general of Holland  than the King of England  to the one he was a father  to the other a fuspicious friend  He scrupled not to employ the engines of corruption to gain his ends  and  while he increased the power of the nation he was brought to govern  he contributed  in some measure  to corrupt their morals   I am   c     90  LETTER XI   THE distresses occasioned by the death of Princes are not so great
