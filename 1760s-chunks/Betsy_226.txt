the surgeon  however  I think it would   be right to go to the house of this Modely  and see what is to be done        To this they both readily agreed  and they all went together  but  as   they were going   O what eternal plagues   said Mr  Francis   has the   vanity of this girl brought upon all her friends     You will still be   making too hasty reflections   cried Mr  Trueworth   I hope to see Miss   Betsy one day as much out shine the greatest part of her sex in   prudence  as she has always done in beauty        By this time they were at Mrs  Modely s door  but the maid  whom she had   tutored for the purpose  told them that Sir Frederick Fineer was   gone  that he would not pay her mistress for the lodgings  because she   had suffered him to be interrupted in them  and that she was sick in bed   with the fright of what had happened  and could not be spoke to       On this Mr  Trueworth ran up to his steward s chamber  not doubting but   he should there be certainly informed whether the mock baronet was gone   or not  the two Mr  Thoughtlesses waited in the parlour till his return    which was immediately  with intelligence  that the wretch had left the   house soon after himself had conducted Miss Betsy thence       They had now no longer any business here  but the elder Mr  Thoughtless   could not take leave of Mr  Trueworth without intreating the favour of   seeing him at his house  to which he replied  that he believed he should   not stay long in town  and while he did so  had business that very much   engrossed his time  but at his return should rejoice in an opportunity   of cultivating a friendship with him  With this  and some other   compliments  they separated  the two brothers went home  and Mr    Trueworth went where his inclinations led him                CHAPTER XVII       Love in death  an example rather to be wondered at than imitated          On Mr  Trueworth s going to Sir Bazil s  he found the two ladies with   all the appearance of the most poignant grief in their faces  Mrs    Wellair s eyes were full of tears  but those of her lovely sister seemed   to flow from an exhaustless spring       This was a strange phoenomenon to Mr  Trueworth  it struck a sudden damp   on the gaiety of his spirits  and he had but just recovered his surprize   enough to ask the meaning  when Mrs  Wellair prevented him  by saying     O  Mr  Trueworth  we have a melancholy account to give you  poor Mrs    Blanchfield is no more         Dead   cried he   Dead   repeated Miss Harriot   but the manner of it   will affect you most     A much less motive   replied he   if capable of   giving pain to you  must certainly affect me  but I beseech you  Madam     continued he   keep me not in suspense         You may remember   said Miss Harriot  sighing   that some time ago we   told you that Mrs  Blanchfield had taken leave of us  and was gone down   to Windsor  It seems she had not been long there before she was seized   with a disorder  which the physicians term a fever on the spirits    whatever it was  she lingered in it for about three weeks  and died   yesterday  some days before she sent for a lawyer  and disposed of her   effects by will  she also wrote a letter to me  which last she put into   the hands of a maid  who has lived with her almost from her infancy    binding her by the most solemn vow to deliver to me as soon as possible   after she was dead  and not till then  on any motive whatsoever        The good creature   pursued Miss Harriot   hurried up to town this   morning  to perform her lady s last injunctions  this is the letter I   received from her   continued she  taking it out of her pocket  and   presenting it to him   read it  and join with us in lamenting the fatal   effects of a passion people take so much pains to inspire        The impatience Mr  Trueworth was in for the full explanation of a   mystery  which
