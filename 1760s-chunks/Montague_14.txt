 haughty  stern  vindictive  when they are not  and their resentment is the more to be dreaded  as they hold it a point of honor to dissemble their sense of an injury till they find an opportunity to revenge it       They are patient of cold and heat  of hunger and thirst  even beyond all belief when necessity requires  passing whole days  and often three or four days together  without food  in the woods  when on the watch for an enemy  or even on their hunting parties  yet indulging themselves in their feasts even to the most brutal degree of intemperance  They despise death  and suffer the most excruciating tortures not only without a groan  but with an air of triumph  singing their death song  deriding their tormentors  and threatening them with the vengeance of their surviving friends  yet hold it honorable to fly before an enemy that appears the least superior in number or force       Deprived by their extreme ignorance  and that indolence which nothing but their ardor for war can surmount  of all the conveniencies  as well as elegant refinements of polished life  strangers to the softer passions  love being with them on the same footing as amongst their fellow tenants of the woods  their lives appear to me rather tranquil than happy  they have fewer cares  but they have also much fewer enjoyments  than fall to our share  I am told  however  that  though insensible to love  they are not without affections  are extremely awake to friendship  and passionately fond of their children       They are of a copper color  which is rendered more unpleasing by a quantity of coarse red on their cheeks  but the children  when born  are of a pale silver white  perhaps their indelicate custom of greasing their bodies  and their being so much exposed to the air and sun even from infancy  may cause that total change of complexion  which I know not how otherwise to account for  their hair is black and shining  the women s very long  parted at the top  and combed back  tied behind  and often twisted with a thong of leather  which they think very ornamental  the dress of both sexes is a close jacket  reaching to their knees  with spatterdashes  all of coarse blue cloth  shoes of deer skin  embroidered with porcupine quills  and sometimes with silver spangles  and a blanket thrown across their shoulders  and fastened before with a kind of bodkin  with necklaces  and other ornaments of beads or shells       They are in general tall  well made  and agile to the last degree  have a lively imagination  a strong memory  and  as far as their interests are concerned  are very dextrous politicians       Their address is cold and reserved  but their treatment of strangers  and the unhappy  infinitely kind and hospitable  A very worthy priest  with whom I am acquainted at Quebec  was some years since shipwrecked in December on the island of Anticosti  after a variety of distresses  not difficult to be imagined on an island without inhabitants  during the severity of a winter even colder than that of Canada  he  with the small remains of his companions who survived such complicated distress  early in the spring  reached the main land in their boat  and wandered to a cabbin of savages  the ancient of which  having heard his story  bid him enter  and liberally supplied their wants   Approach  brother   said he   the unhappy have a right to our assistance  we are men  and cannot but feel for the distresses which happen to men   a sentiment which has a strong resemblance to a celebrated one in a Greek tragedy       You will not expect more from me on this subject  as my residence here has been short  and I can only be said to catch a few marking features flying  I am unable to give you a picture at full length       Nothing astonishes me so much as to find their manners so little changed by their intercourse with the Europeans  they seem to have learnt nothing of us but excess in drinking       The situation of the village is very fine  on an eminence  gently rising to a thick wood at some distance  a beautiful little serpentine river in front  on which are a bridge  a mill  and a small cascade  at such a distance as to be very pleasing objects from their houses  and a cultivated country  intermixed with little woods lying between them and Quebec  from which they are distant only nine very short miles       What a letter have I written  I shall quit my post of historian to your friend Miss Fermor  the ladies love writing much better than we do  and I should perhaps be only just  if I said they write better       Adieu   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XII   12    To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Quebec  Sept  12   I YESTERDAY morning received a letter from Major Melmoth  to introduce to my acquaintance Sir George Clayton  who brought it  he wanted no other introduction to me than his
