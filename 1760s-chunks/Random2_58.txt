last capacity  he had  doubtless  introduced me to Strutwell  who was so notorious for a passion for his own sex  that he was amazed his character had never reached my ears  and that so far from being able to obtain for me the post he had promised  his interest at court was so low  that he could scarce provide for a superannuated footman once a year  in Chelsea hospital —that it was a common thing for him to amuse strangers whom his jack calls run down  with such assurances and caresses as he had bestowed on me  until he had stript them of their cash and every thing valuable about them —very often of their chastity  and then leave them a prey to want and infamy —that he allowed his servants no other wages than that part of the spoil which they could glean by their industry  and that the whole of his conduct towards me was so glaring  that no body who knew any thing of mankind could have been imposed upon by his insinuations       168 I leave the reader to judge how I relished this piece of information  which precipitated me from the most exalted pinnacle of hope to the lowest abyss of despondence  and well nigh determined me to take Banter s advice  and finish my chagrin with a halter —I had no room to suspect the veracity of my friend  because upon recollection  I found every circumstance of Strutwell s behaviour  exactly tallying with the character he had described  His hugs  embraces  squeezes and eager looks  were now no longer a ystery  no more than his defence of Petroius  and the jealous frown of his valet de chamre  who  it seems  was at present the favourite athic of his lord     169  CHAP  LII    I attempt to recover my watch and jewel  but to no purpose—resolve to revenge myself on Strutwell by my importunity—am reduced to my last guinea—obliged to inform Strap of my necessity  who is almost distracted with the news—but nevertheless obliged to pawn my best sword for present subsistence—that small supply being exhausted  I am almost stupified with my misfortunes—go to the gaming table  by the advice of Banter  and come off with unexpected success—Strap s exstacy—Mrs  Gawkey waits upon me  professes remorse for her perfidy  and implores my assistance—I do myself a piece of justice by her means  and afterwards reconcile her to her father   I Was so confounded that I could make no reply to Banter  who reproached me with great indignation  for having thrown away upon rascals  that which  had it been converted into ready money  would have supported the rank of a gentleman for some months  and enabled me  at the same time  to oblige my friends —Stupified as I was  I could easily divine the source of his concern  but sneaked away in a solitary manner  without yielding the least answer to his   170 expostulations  and began to deliberate with myself  in what manner I should attempt to retrieve the moveables I had so foolishly lost —I would have thought it no robbery to take them again by force  could I have done it without any danger of being detected  but as I could have no such opportunity  I resolved to work by finesse  and go immediately to the lodgings of Straddle  where I was so fortunate as to find him —   My Lord   said I  I have just now recollected  that the diamond I had the honour of presenting to you  is loosened a little in the socket  and there is a young fellow just arrived from Paris  who is reckoned the best jeweller in Europe  I knew him in France  and if your lordship will give me leave  will carry the ring to him to be set to rights  —  His lordship was not to be caught in this snare—he thanked me for my offer  and let me know  that having himself observed the defect  he had already sent it to his own jeweller to be mended —And indeed  by this time  I believe it was in the jeweller s hands  though not in order to be mended  for it stood in need of no alteration     Baulked in this piece of politicks  I cursed my simplicity  but resolved to play a surer game with the Earl  which I had thus devised —I did not doubt of being admitted into familiar conversation with him  as before  and hoped by some means  to get the watch into my hand  then on pretence of winding or playing with it  drop it on the floor  which in all probability would disorder the work so as to stop its motion  This event would furnish me with an opportunity of insisting upon carrying it away in order to be repaired  and had this happened  I should have   171 been in no hurry to bring it back —What pity it was I could not find an occasion of putting this fine scheme in execution  When I went to renew my visit to his lordship  my access to the parlour was as free as ever  but after I had waited some time  the valet de chambre came in with his Lord s compliments  and a desire to see me to morrow at his levée  being at present so much
