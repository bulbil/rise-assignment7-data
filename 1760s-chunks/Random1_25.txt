submissive questions of some present who knew him  about the welfare of his family —While he indulged himself in this state  amidst a profound silence  the curate approaching him with great reverence  asked if he would not be pleased to honour us with his company at dinner  To which he answered in the negative  saying  he had been to visit  squire Bumpkin  who had drank himself into a high fever at the last assizes  and that he had  on leaving his own house  told Betty he should dine at home —Accordingly  when he had made an end of his bottle and pipe  he got up and moved towards the door with the fame dignity as when he entered  where his journeyman stood ready with his nag —He had no sooner mounted  than this facetious person  coming into the kitchen  began in this manner    There the old rascal goes  and the D—l go with him —You see how the world wags  gentlemen —By G—d  this rogue of a vicar does not deserve to live —and yet he has two livings worth 400l  per annum  while poor I am fain to do all his drudgery  and ride twenty miles every Sunday to preach  for what  why truly  for 20l  a year —I scorn to boast of my own qualifications  but—comparisons  you know  are odious —I should be glad to know how this swag bellied doctor deserves to be more at ease than me —He can loll in his   63 elbow chair at home  indulge himself in the best of victuals and wine  and enjoy the conversation of Betty his house keeper —You understand me  gentlemen —Betty is the doctor s poor kinswoman  and a pretty girl she is —but no matter for that —ay  and a dutiful girl to her parents  whom she goes to see regularly every year  though I must own I could never learn in what county they live —My service t ye gentlemen  —  By this time dinner being ready  I waked my companion  and we eat all together with great chearfulness and satisfaction  When our meal was ended  and every man s share of the reckoning adjusted  the curate went out on pretence of some necessary occasion  and mounting his horse  left the two farmers to satisfy the host in the best manner they could —We were no sooner informed of this piece of finesse  then the exciseman who had been silent hitherto  began with a malicious grin    Ay  ay  this is an old trick of Shufle —I could not help smiling  when he talked of treating —You must know  this is a very curious fellow —He picked up some scraps of learning while he served young lord Trifle at the university —But what he most excells in  is pimping —No man knows his talents better than I  for I was valet de chambre to  squire Tattle  an intimate companion of Shuffle s lord —He got himself into a scrape  by pawning some of his lordship s cloaths  on which account he was turned away  but as he was acquainted with some particular circumstances of my lord s conduct  he did not care to exasperate him too much  and so made interest for his receiving orders  and afterwards recommended him to the curacy   64 which he now enjoys —However  the fellow cannot be too much admired for his dexterity in making a comfortable livelihood  in spite of such a small allowance —You hear he plays a good stick  and is really diverting company—this makes him agreeable wherever he goes —and as for playing at cards  there is not a man within three counties a match for him —the truth is  he is a damnable cheat  and can shift a card with such address  that it is impossible to discover him  —  At this he was interrupted by one of the farmers  who asked him  why he had not justice enough to acquaint them with these particulars before they engaged in play —The exciseman replied without any hesitation  that it was none of his business to intermeddle between man and man  besides  he did not know they were ignorant of Shuffle s character  which was notorious to the whole country —This did not satisfy the other  who taxed him with abetting and assisting the curate s knavery  and insisted on having his share of the winning returned  which the exciseman as positively refused  affirming  that whatever slights Shuffle might practise on other occasions  he was very certain  that he had play d on the square with them  and would answer it before any bench in christendom  so saying  he got up  and having paid his reckoning  sneaked off  The landlord thrusting his neck into the passage  to see if he was gone  shook his head  saying    Ah  Lord help us  if every sinner was to have his deserts —Well  we victuallers must not disoblige the excisemen —But  I know what —if parson Shuffle and he were weighed together  a straw thrown into either scale would make   65 the ballance kick the beam —But  masters  this is under the rose  continued Boniface with a whisper      CHAP  X   The highwayman is taken—we are detained as evidences against him—proceed to the next village—he escapes—we arrive at another inn
