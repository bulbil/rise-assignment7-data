we can take it from it s Semblance  Sleep — Which brings me to the Close of my Proposition  or   a certain Method to lengthen Life  in Spight of Fate  or the Grave     Henry   LETTER CLXXXVIII   Dear HARRY   I HAVE read the Treatise you mention  but like your Supplement to it much better  It is a double Charity to write to me on Subjects at present  because there is not a Book in this House  which could supply me with Matter for a Minute s Reflection  which makes the Time  except what I spend in reading your Letters  or writing to you  pass like an idle Dream  which leaves no Trace behind   Page  25Your Letter has made me grow quite impatient at the Reflection of having lost so much of my Life  The Desire of improving my Mind  and fixing it s Contemplation upon proper Objects  increases daily  yet  by some unforeseen Accident  I find myself continually deprived even of one Day s Retirement  and am  if I may use the Expression  constantly immersed in Idleness   The Tediousness of present Time is often irksome to the wise Man as well as the Fool  though not in so great a Degree  which has been considered as a Proof of the Soul s Immortality  For we are continually pushing forward to some Point of Time  which  when arrived at  falls short of the Expectations we had raised upon it  we still persist in flattering ourselves  and fix our Happiness on some future Period  which  in it s Course  brings Disappointment too  and yet we still go on  wishing the present Hour were past  and hoping Peace or Joy from some more distant Aera   till the Grave opening  interrupts our Schemes  and shews the only Prospect where the Soul can rest  Oh  may we fix our Grasp on that Strong Hold  which cannot  will not fail us  and  like the Patriarch  wrestle for a Blessing  Let the incumbering World recede  and even our mutual Loves decay  before the glorious Hope of Immortality  What Joy  what more than Transport  do I Page  26 feel  in thinking that  when Death shall have dissolved the poor  infirm  and feeble Forms  which now incase our Spirits  we shall meet again  conscious of each other s Love and Truth  in perfect Bliss above   I do not cordially approve of your lessening the Portions of Time allotted for Sleep  It is wise Nature prompts  and all Philosophy is vain which dares oppose her  She has appointed equal Periods to Labour and to Rest  while Man  impatient to be happy  steals from his only promised Blessing  Ease  to squander in the vain Pursuit of Wealth or Pleasure  I must own  notwithstanding your philosophical Moral  which I acknowledge to be very ingenious  that I am a great Friend to Sleep  whom Silius Italicus calls the most amiable of all the Gods  When tired out with Grief or Pain  it strengthens and renews the Springs of Life  we wake refreshed  and feel a Kind of silent Hymn of Gratitude arise in our Minds for this  more than for any other Blessing  While we sleep  we are  at least  negatively good  incapable of acting or designing Ill  and I am afraid  that even the best Man has more to answer for his waking than his sleeping Hours  be he never so great a Sluggard  However  I shall receive one Advantage from your Doctrine  that I shall insist upon your Practice keeping up to your Preaching  and I will certainly produce your Letter against Page  27 you  whenever I find you begin to yawn about Ten o Clock  for that is a most unreasonable Hour for a Person to go to Bed  who has not Occasion to sleep more than five   LETTER CLXXXIX   Dear FANNY   YOUR S of the 19th I shall answer  by desiring you to look into that Letter of mine  which gave you Occasion to speak upon this Head  and you will find  that I did not say my Philosophy prevented me from feeling  A Man may be very sensible of the Gout or Stone  without roaring — nay  more so  for the Expression of either Grief or Pain is observed to lessen the Poignancy of them  I would say with Romeo   hang up Philosophy   indeed  if it served to extinguish in my Breast the least Part of that manly Love  that tender Friendship  that soft Sentiment  or that warm Affection  which my charming Fanny is best capable of inspiring  my quick Sense of all which  I am proud to own  and grateful to acknowledge  I owe to her alone   As to your leaving England  you may remember  I told you before  that  though I might Page  28 submit  I never should consent  because I could never sincerely do it  But upon this Subject I hope to have an Opportunity of speaking more at large in a few Days  when I design being in Town   I do not remember the particular Conversation  you hint at  just before I left London  I am very certain  I
