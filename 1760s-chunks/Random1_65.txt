an end  but when I had finished my justification  shook his head  and beginning with his   181 usual exclamation     O Ch—st  said  that won t go down with me —I am very sorry I should have the misfortune of being concerned in the affair  but however shall be more cautious for the future—I will trust no man from henceforward—no  not my father who begat me—nor the brother who lay with me in my mother s womb—should the genius of truth appear I would question its veracity  and if Daniel would rise from the dead I should think him an impostor  —  I told him  that one day  it was possible  he might be convinced of the injury I had suffered  and repent of his premature determination —To which he answered the proof of my innocence would make his bowels vibrate with joy    but till that shall happen  continued he  I must beg to have no manner of connection with you—my reputation is at stake—O my good God  I shall be looked upon as your accomplice and abettor—people will say Jonathan Wild was but a type of me—boys will hoot at me as I pass along  and the cinder wenches belch forth reproaches wafted in a gale impregnated with gin—I shall be notorious—the very butt of slander  and cloaca of infamy  —  I was not in an humour to relish the climax of expressions upon which this gentleman valued himself in all his discourses  but without any ceremony took my leave  cursed with every sentiment of horror  which my situation could suggest —I considered  however  in the intervals of my despondence  that I must in some shape suit my expence to my calamitous circumstances  and with that view hired an apartment in a garret near St  Giles s  at the rate of nine pence per week —In this place I resolved   182 to perform my own cure  having first pawned three shirts to purchase medicines and support for the occasion     One day when I sat in this solitary retreat  musing upon the unhappiness of my fate  I was alarmed by a groan that issued from a chamber contiguous to mine  into which I immediately run  and sound a woman stretched on a miserable truckle bed  without any visible signs of life  Having applied a smelling bottle to her nose  the blood began to revisit her cheeks  and she opened her eyes  but  good heaven  what were the emotions of my soul  when I discovered her to be the same individual lady  who had triumphed over my heart  and to whose fate I had almost been inseparably joined  Her deplorable situation filled my breast with compassion  and every tender idea reviving in my imagination  I flew into her embrace  she knew me immediately  and straining me gently in her arms  shed a torrent of tears  which I could not help encreasing  At length  casting a languishing look at me  she pronounced with a feeble voice     Dear Mr  Random  I do not deserve this concern at your hands—I am a vile creature  who had a base design upon your person—suffer me to expiate that and all my other crimes by a miserable death  which will not fail to overtake me in a few hours  —  I encouraged her as much as I could  told her I forgave all the injury she had designed for me  and that although my circumstances were extremely low  I would share my last farthing with her —In the mean time  begged to know the immediate cause of that fit from which she had just recovered  and I would endeavour by my skill to prevent any more such attacks —   183 She seemed very much affected with what I said  took my hand and pressed it to her lips  saying    You are too generous  I wish I could live to express my gratitude—but alas  I perish for want  —  Then shutting her eyes  relapsed into another swoon —Such extremity of distress must have waked the most obdurate heart to sympathy and compassion  What effect then must it have on mine  that was naturally prone to every tender passion  I ran down stairs and sent my landlady to a chymist s shop for some cinnamon water  while I returning to this unfortunate creature s chamber  used all the means in my power to bring her to herself  which with much difficulty I accomplished  and made her drink a glass of the cordial to recruit her spirits  then I prepared a little mulled red wine and a toast  which having taken  she found herself thoroughly revived  and informed me  that she had not tasted food for eight and forty hours before —As I was impatient to know the occasion and nature of her calamity  she gave me to understand that she was a woman of the town by profession—that in the course of her adventures  she found herself dangerously infected with a distemper to which all of her class are particularly subject —that her malady gaining ground every day  she was become loathsome to herself as well as to every one else  when she resolved to retire to some obscure corner  where she might be cured with as little noise and expence as possible —that she had accordingly chosen this place of retreat  and put herself into the hands
