a just consideration of my end   —      231Lady Blandford  did you ever hear so dreadful a story —The barbarous—but let us not think of the monster—the bare idea of him curdles my very blood  and I shake with horror at the recollection of having written so much on so detestable a subject —  When Mrs  Dobson had done her story  every body endeavoured to shift the conversation  and none of us having yet felicitated Mr  Melmoth on his happy discovery of such a wife  and such a daughter  we took this opportunity of doing it very sincerely —The worthy man was all extasy  while the two ladies sat between Mrs  Mildmay and Louisa  enjoying a thousand exquisite feelings at so fortunate an event  and every now and then testifying their satisfaction with an expressive flood of tears —Mr  Melmoth  my dear lady Blandford  will be now quite another   232 creature —His temper has already undergone a total alteration  and you cannot think how pleased I am at the impatience which he manifests  if he is but a moment absent from his newfound happiness  He loves his wife with an excess of tenderness  and indeed well he may—for a more excellent  or a more lovely woman  of her age  I believe  is not to be found in England —His daughter too is as fine a young lady in person  as ever I saw  and has a mind that even adds a lustre to her external accomplishments —Well  and what do you think has been already done about her —why  her father offered fifty thousand pounds with her to colonel Mildmay  and old Mr  Mildmay is so heartily for the match  that he proposes to make a double wedding of it  the moment my brother arrives in town —Four and twenty hours ago  Mr  Mildmay would not have consented   233 so readily to his son s marriage with Miss Beauclerk —But Miss Melmoth s fortune has an irresistible charm  and fifty thousand pounds will be no trifling affair to support the coronet which he expects in his family —Yet I don t know but this reflection would be a little cruel to the good old man  if I was writing to any body but lady Blandford   Mr  Mildmay  his lady  and the colonel   for Mr  Melmoth deprived me of two visitors  were now in town about five days  when Bob arrived at my door  The father and son were looking through the parlour window  when he stopped  and both ran out good naturedly to meet him  and insisted he would make no apologies for what was past —Faults  they observed  had been on both sides  and since he had chastized that villain Hastings  they could forgive him every thing —Bob  lady   234 Blandford  was in a most elegant undress  and really looked charmingly —Louisa  who was prepared to expect him every hour  was not much alarmed when he was introduced  She and her mamma were sitting in the dining room  when he came up between Mr  Mildmay and the colonel —I led the van  and Alexander himself  in the midst of all his victories  I am pretty certain  never experienced one half of my satisfaction —You know how I love the recreant  and how I esteem the Mildmays —This happy reconciliation  therefore  almost overcame me—so that instead of saying any thing to Louisa on my entrance  I retired to a sopha in one corner of the room  and indulged myself in a delicious flood of tears —Bob  however  was all himself  with an air of the deepest respect  yet of the greatest manliness  he went up to the two ladies  and  falling on his knee    235 held a hand of each alternately to his lips  without once breaking out into any aukward excuses  which  as matters then stood  must have called back disagreeable images  and been little else  in fact  than so many insinuated affronts —Louisa was all sweetness and confusion—the mother  nothing but sensibility and joy—both  at length  however  insisted upon his rising  and he got up with such a grace—to be sure  lady Blandford  there is not a finer young fellow in the kingdom—and  as he is now in so fair a way of being good  you must allow me to speak of him with my utmost partiality  In the evening Mr  Melmoth came with his lady and daughter —How did my generous Bob— I will call him my Bob now  exult in the happiness of his friend  and how did that equally generous friend rejoice at the happiness of my brother —In short  all our hearts overflowed with   236 delight  and  to render this delight the more permanent  we fairly married the two couple at St  George s  Hanover Square  the very next morning   I have been so busy since the celebration of these weddings  that the writing of this letter has taken me up a whole week  and yet  long as it is now  and  fatigued as I am with drawing it up  I cannot conclude  without informing you of some farther particulars —Hastings s wound  blessed be God  is not mortal —A friend from Paris sends word  that it had a dangerous appearance at first  but that
