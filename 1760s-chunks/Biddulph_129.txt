absence of their gentle mistress  Oh  Cecilia  how exquisite are the pleasures and the pains that those of too nice feelings are liable to  You  whose sensibility is as strong as mine     know this  From what trifles do minds of such a turn derive both joy and grief  Our names  our virgin names  I find cut out on several of the old elm trees  this conjures up a thousand pleasing ideas  and brings back those days when we were inseparable  But you are no longer Rivers  nor I Bidulph  Then I think what I have suffered since I lost that name  and at how remote a distance you are from me  and I weep like a child—But away with such reflections  I am now happier  beyond comparison happier  I think  than I was before my afflictions overtook me  Mr Arnold’s recovered heart I prize infinitely more than I did when he first made me an offer of it  because I am sure he gives it now from a thorough conviction that I deserve it  and therefore I am certain never to have it alienated again   January 4  It is almost three years since I left this place  and the welcomes I have received from all our old neighbours and acquaintance  have given me more satisfaction than I can express  Mr Arnold is highly pleased with the marks of affection which he sees me daily receive from those who have known me from my infancy  I am the more delighted with it  as I think it gives me an additional value with him  ’Tis a proof at least that I never misbehaved during the long number of years that our former friends knew me  and we must needs be pleased to see the object of our love approved of by others  This I speak from my own experience  Mr Arnold is exceedingly caressed by all our friends  and seems equally delighted with them  you know we have some of the best people in the world amongst our old set of acquaintance  If you  my mother  and good Lady V——  were within my reach  I should think Sidney Castle a paradise   January 10  I have had two letters to day  one from Lady V——  the other from my dear mother  Lady V—— tells me her husband is bustling about for us  to put affairs in the best condition he can  She says  he has already got a purchase for the lease of our house in St James’s Street  and all the moveables in it  as they now stand  They have been valued at two thousand seven hundred pounds  As most of our plate is there  as well as our chariot and a pair of horses  this has fallen very short of our expectations  but Lady V—— says  she is sure there was not more allowed for the furniture than half their original value  though they have not been a great while in use  She tells me  that my lord has    employed a person to go down to Arnold Abbey  to dispose of the things there  but she fears we shall receive a very indifferent return from thence  as there is but part of the furniture of Mr Arnold’s putting in  the old goods going together with the house to the widow  My lord’s steward at V—— hall has instructions about South Park  he writes word to his lord that he believes the whole of what is there will not sell for more than four hundred pounds  the house indeed was but small  and the furniture not expensive  Mrs Gerrarde  he says  has had an attachment laid on her house by a person who built some bauble for her in her garden  for which he claims a debt of ninety pounds  though the steward says it is not worth thirty  ‘All things  however  my lady adds  shall be adjusted in the best manner we can  and my lord will not let Mr Arnold be distressed on account of any deficiency that may happen in those sales ’ What a jewel  my Cecilia  is an honest  warm friend   The contents of my mother’s letter are  That Sir George was married yesterday to Lady Sarah P——  She says  the bride was most extravagantly fine  but looked neither handsome nor genteel  This was much for my good mother to let drop from her pen  but I know she never liked Lady Sarah  nor did her ladyship ever treat her with the regard due to her character  and to the person of one who was to stand in the close and respectable degree of relationship to her  which my mother now does  But I believe I have before told you  that the blessings of good sense and good temper are bestowed but in a moderate degree on Lady Sarah  and for a woman of quality  Lady V—— tells me  for I have never seen her   that her breeding is not of the highest form  But you know a great fortune covers a multitude of imperfections in the eyes of most people  and I hope her love for my brother will make her a good wife   January 23  I am grown a perfect farmer’s wife  and have got a notable dairy  I am mistress of three cows  I assure you  which
