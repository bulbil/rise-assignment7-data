 and by way of proving how entirely he was satisfied  sent me three hundred pistoles by Don Raymond after dinner       CH  VI  The application of the three hundred pistoles  and Scipio s commission connected with them  Success of the state paper mentioned in the last chapter   THIS handsome present of the minister furnished Scipio with a new subject of congratulation  by reason of our second appearance at court  You may remark  said he  that fortune is preparing a load of aggrandizement to lay on your lordship s shoulders  Are you still sorry for having turned your back on solitude  May the Count of Olivarez live for ever  he is a very different sort of a master from his predecessor  The Duke of Lerma  with all your devotion to his service  left you to live upon suction for months without a pistole to bless yourself with  and the count has already made you a present which you could have had no reason to expect but after a course of long service   I should very much like  added he  that the lords of Leyva should be witnesses of your great success  or at least that they should be informed of it  It is high time indeed  answered I  and I meant to speak with you on that subject  They must doubtless be impatient to hear of my proceedings  but I waited till my fate was fixed  and till I could decide for certain whether I should stay at court or not  Now that I am sure of my destination  you have only to set out for Valencia whenever you please  and to acquaint those noblemen with my present situation  which I consider as their doing  since it is evident that  but for them  I should never have resolved on my journey to Madrid  My dear master  cried the son of Bohemian accident  what joy shall I communicate by relating what has happened to you  Why am I not already at the gates of Valencia  But I shall be there forthwith  Don Alphonso s two horses are ready in the stable  I shall take one of my lord s livery servants with me  Besides that company is pleasant on the road  you know very well the effect of official parade  in making impression on the natives of a provincial town   I could not help laughing at my secretary s foolish vanity  and yet  with vanity perhaps more than equal to his own  I left him to do as he pleased  Go about your business  said I  and make the best of your way back  for I have an other commission to give you  I mean to send you to the Asturias with some money for my mother  Through neglect I have suffered the time to elapse when I promised to remit her a hundred pistoles  and pledged you to make the payment in person  Such engagements ought to be held sacred by a son  and I reproach myself with inaccuracy in the observance of mine  Sir  answered Scipio  within six weeks I shall bring you an account of both your commissions  having opened my budget to the lords of Leyva  looked in at your country house  and taken a peep at the town of Oviedo  the recollection of which I cannot admit into my mind  without turning over three fourths of the inhabitants  and one half of the remaining quarter  to the corrective discipline of that infernal executioner  who is supposed to be kept on foot for the purpose of castigating sinners  I then counted down one hundred pistoles to that same son of a wandering mother for my honoured parents  annuity  and another hundred for himself  meaning that he should perform his long journey without grumbling on my account by the way   Some days after his departure his lordship sent our memorial to press  and it was no sooner published than it became the topic of conversation in every circle throughout Madrid  The people  enamoured of novelty  took up this well written statement of their own wretchedness with fond partiality  the derangement and exhaustion of the finances  painted with a mixture of truth and poetry  excited a strong feeling of popular indignation against the Duke of Lerma  and if these paper bullets of the brain  cast in the political armoury of a rival  failed to carry victory with them in the opinions of all mankind  they were at all events hailed with triumph by the most clamorous of our own partisans  As for the magnificent promises which the Count of Olivarez threw in  and among others that of keeping the machine of state in motion  by a system of economy  without adding to the public burdens  they were caught at with avidity by the citizens at large  and considered as pledges of an enlightened and patriotic policy  so that the whole city resounded with the acclamation of panegyric and congratulation on the opening of new prospects   The minister  delighted to have gained his end so easily  which in that publication had only been to draw popularity upon himself  was now determined to seize the substance as well as catch at the shadow  by an act of unquestionable credit with the subject  and high utility to the king s service  For that purpose  he had recourse to the emperor Galba s contrivance
