so I am informed  from the sluts and roughs   in the gallery of the Victoria theatre  In that theatre  but   nowhere else in London  Gustavus Vasa  so do times change  might   still be a taking play      It took in Brooke s time  but in a fashion very different from   that which he expected  After being accepted at Drury Lane    rehearsed for five weeks  and carried safely through all the troubles   of the green room  it was prohibited by the Lord Chamberlain  on   account of its political tendency      Such silly tyranny bore such fruit as we have seen it bear in our   own days  If the world might not see  at least the world could   read  Brooke published the play in self defence  and sold four   thousand at five shillings each  The Prince sent him a hundred   guineas  Chesterfield took forty copies  Dr  Johnson published  what   I am ashamed to say I have not seen  an ironic   Complete Vindi    cation of the Licensers of the Stage  from the malicious aspersions   of Mr  Brooke  author of Gustavus Vasa     and Brooke gained a   complete triumph  and a thousand guineas into the bargain   took   a villa at Twickenham  close to Pope s  sent to Ireland for his   family and his wife  who  so the Prince proposed  was to be foster    mother to the yet unborn George III   and set up in life  at the age   of thirty three  as a distinguished literary character  with all that   he needed both of   praise and pudding       If the charming and successful Irishman had but prospered   thenceforth  as most men prosper in the world  then we should   have had another great literary personage  possibly another great   parliamentary orator  but we should not have had  The Fool   of Quality   and Ireland probably would not have had the man   Henry Brooke  A course of chastening sorrow was appointed for   this man  all the more long and bitter  perhaps  because he was so   dear to Heaven    Whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth   was the   law ages since  and will be  perhaps  until the end  At least  it   was so with Henry Brooke  Far from poets and courtiers  and all   that was beginning to intoxicate  as it must have intoxicated  his   noble heart  he must sit through long years of ever growing   poverty and loneliness  watching the corpses of his dead children    dead joys  dead hopes  till he has learnt the golden secret  and   literary fame  and all fame which men can give  lies far behind him   and below him  for the glittering  poisonous earth fog which it is  and   his purified spirit rises into those pure heights which he only saw         PREFACE  xlvil     afar off  when he wrote his  Universal Beauty   as a lad of   twenty two  He shall return to his first love   but he shall return   by a strait gate and a narrow way      In 1740  in the very heyday of his success  he is taken alarmingly   ill  He must try his pure native air of Rantavan   and he tries it    and recovers  Once well again  he will of course return to London     all his great friends expect him  To their astonishment he sells   off his furniture at Twickenham  rids himself of his villa  and stays   at home        His wife   say the biographers    was afraid lest his zeal for the   Prince should get him into trouble   That may have been the   argument which she used in words   but what good woman has not   dumb instincts and forecastings deeper and wider than her   arguments  There may have been many reasons  and yet none   of them dishonourable to Brooke  for withdrawing the most   charming of husbands from a frivolous and profligate city  especially   when that husband s purse had a perennial tendency to empty as   fast as it filled  At least Henry Brooke was true lover and wise   man enough to obey   to give up London  fame and fashion   and   in the society of a woman whom he had loved from childhood  and   at whose death  at last  he pined away  henceforth to   drink water   out of his own spring     and a nobler act of self renunciation one   seldom meets with  It stamps the man at once as what he was     pure  wise  and good
