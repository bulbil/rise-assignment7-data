daughter  though meant ironically by him  was nevertheless literally just  for by espousing the cause of Gawky  the one obliged a valuable lodger  and the other acquired a husband at a juncture  when one was absolutely necessary  for the young lady finding the effects of her correspondence with Odonnel becoming plainer and plainer every day  insinuated herself so artfully into the affection of this new lodger  that in less than a fortnight  on pretence of going to a play  they drove away together to the Fleet  where they were coupled  from thence removed to a bagnio  where the marriage was consummated  and in the morning came home  where they asked her father s and mother s blessing —The prudent parents  notwithstanding the precipitation with which it was carried on  did not think fit to refuse their approbation  for the apothecary was not ill pleased to find his daughter married to a young man of a good prospect  who had not mentioned to him one syllable on the article of her dowry  and his wife was rejoiced at being rid of a rival in her gallants  and a spy upon her pleasures —Nor was I without self enjoyment at this event  when I reflected upon the revenge I had unwittingly taken upon my enemy  in making him a cuckold by anticipation —But I little dream d what a storm of mischief was brewing against me  whilst I thus indulged myself —Whatever face Gawkey put on the matter  my discovery of the adventure before related    176 and the reproaches I vented against him  had stung him to the soul  and cherished the seeds of emnity so strongly in his breast  that he  it seems  imparted his indignation to his wife  who being as desirous as he to compass the ruin of one that not only slighted her caresses  but was able on any occasion to discover particulars not at all advantageous to her character  readily joined in a conspiracy against me  which  had it taken effect as they expected  would infallibly have brought me to an ignominious death     My master having several times missed large quantities of medicines of which I could give no account  at last lost all patience  and in plain terms taxed me with having embezzled them for my own use  As I could only oppose my single asseveration to this suspicion  he told me one day     By gar  your vord not be give me de satisfaction—me find necessaire to chercher for my medicine  pardonnez moy—il faut chercher—me demand le clef of your coffre a cette heure  —  Then raising his voice to conceal the fright he was in  lest I should make any opposition  he went on    Oui  foutre  I charge you rendrer le clef of your coffre—moi—si  moi qui vous parle  —  I was fired with so much resentment and disdain at this accusation  that I burst into tears  which he took for a sign of guilt  and pulling out my key  told him he might satisfy himself immediately  though he would not find it so easy to satisfy me for the injury my reputation had suffered from his unjust suspicion —He took the key and mounted up to my chamber  attended by the whole family  saying    He bien  nous verrons—nous verrons  —  But what was my horror and amazement  when opening my   177 chest  I saw them pull out an handful of the very things that were missing  and heard him pronounce    Ah ha  vous etes bien venues—mardie  Mons  Roderique  you be fort innocent  —  I had not power to utter one word in my own vindication  but stood motionless and silent  while every body present made their respective remarks on what appeared against me —The servants said  they were sorry for my misfortune  and went away repeating    Who would have thought it    My mistress took occasion from this to rail against the practice of employing strangers in general  and Mrs  Gawky  after having observed that she never had a good opinion of my fidelity  proposed to have me carried before the justice and committed to Newgate immediately  Her husband was actually upon the stairs in his way for a constable  when Mr  Lavement  knowing the cost and trouble of a prosecution to which he must bind himself  and at the same time dreading lest some particulars of my confession might affect his practice  called out    Restez mon fils  restez  it be veritablement one grand crime wich dis pauvre diable have committed—bot peutetre de good God give him de penitence  and me vil not have upon mine head de blood of one sinner  —  The captain and his lady used all the christian arguments their zeal could suggest  to prevail on the apothecary to pursue me to destruction  and represented the injustice he did to the community of which he was a member  in letting a villain escape  who would not sail of doing more mischief in the world  when he should reflect on his coming off so easily now —but their eloquence made no impression on my master  who turning to me  said    Go  miserable  go from mine   178 house  quick  quick—and make reparation for your mauvaise actions  —
