received by the intendant and some of the best families of the place  in  consequence of his letters of recommendation  and  after a short stay  in that city  proceeded down the Rhone to Avignon  in what is called the  coche d eau  then visiting the principal towns of Dauphiny  Languedoc   and Provence  he returned to the delightful city of Marseilles  where he  and his fellow traveller were so much captivated by the serenity of the  air  the good nature and hospitality of the sprightly inhabitants  that  they never dreamed of changing their quarters during the whole winter  and part of the spring  here he acquired the acquaintance of the Marquis  d Argens  attorney general in the parliament of Aix  and of his eldest  son  who now makes so great a figure in the literary world  and when the  affair of Father Girard and Mademoiselle Cadiere began to make a noise   he accompanied these two gentlemen to Toulon  where the marquis was  ordered to take a precognition of the facts    On his return to Marseilles  he found a certain noble lord of great  fortune  under the direction of a Swiss governor  who had accommodated  him with two of his own relations  of the same country  by way of  companions  together with five servants in his train  They being  absolute strangers in the place  M  introduced them to the intendant   and several other good families  and had the good fortune to be so  agreeable to his lordship  that he proposed and even pressed him to live  with him in England as a friend and companion  and to take upon him the  superintendence of his affairs  in which case he would settle upon him  four hundred a year for life    This proposal was too advantageous to be slighted by a person of no  fortune  or fixed establishment  he therefore made no difficulty of  closing with it  but  as his lordship s departure was fixed to a short  day  and he urged him to accompany him to Paris  and from thence to  England  M   thought it would be improper and indecent to interfere with  the office of his governor  who might take umbrage at his favour  and  therefore excused himself from a compliance with his lordship s request   until his minority should be expired  as he was within a few months of  being of age  However  he repeated his importunities so earnestly  and  the governor joined in the request with such appearance of cordiality   that he was prevailed upon to comply with their joint desire  and in a  few days set out with them for Paris  by the way of Lyons  But  before  they had been three days in the city  M   perceived a total change  in the behaviour of the Swiss and his two relations  who  in all  probability  became jealous of his influence with his lordship  and he  no sooner made this discovery  than he resolved to withdraw himself from  such a disagreeable participation of that young nobleman s favour  He   therefore  in spite of all his lordship s entreaties and remonstrances   quitted him for the present  alleging  as a pretext  that he had a  longing desire to see Switzerland and the banks of the Rhine  and  promising to meet him again in England     6 22 15  3 45 PM    This his intention being made known to the governor and his friends   their countenances immediately cleared up  their courtesy and  complaisance returned  and they even furnished him with letters for  Geneva  Lausanne  Bern  and Soleures  in consequence of which he met  with unusual civilities at these places  Having made this tour with his  Scotch friend  who came up to him before he left Lyons  and visited the  most considerable towns on both sides of the Rhine  and the courts of  the electors Palatine  Mentz  and Cologne  he arrived in Holland  and  from thence  through the Netherlands  repaired to London  where he found  my lord just returned from Paris    His lordship received him with expressions of uncommon joy  would not  suffer him to stir from him for several days  and introduced him to his  relations  M   accompanied his lordship from London to his country seat   where he was indeed treated with great friendship and confidence  and  consulted in everything  but the noble peer never once made mention of  the annuity which he had promised to settle upon him  nor did M    remind him of it  because he conceived it was his affair to fulfil his  engagements of his own accord  M   being tired of the manner of living  at this place  made an excursion to Bath  where he stayed about a  fortnight  to partake of the diversions  and  upon his return  found his  lordship making dispositions for another journey to Paris    Surprised at this sudden resolution  he endeavoured to dissuade  him from it  but his remonstrances were rendered ineffectual by
