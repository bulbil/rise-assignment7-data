industrious people can be too populous       The northern swarms were compelled to leave their respective countries  not because those countries were unable to support them  but because they were too idle to cultivate the ground  they were a ferocious  ignorant  barbarous people  averse to labor  attached to war  and  like our American savages  believing every employment not relative to this favorite object  beneath the dignity of man       Their emigrations therefore were less owing to their populousness  than to their want of industry  and barbarous contempt of agriculture and every useful art       It is with pain I am compelled to say  the late spirit of encouraging the monopoly of farms  which  from a narrow short sighted policy  prevails amongst our landed men at home  and the alarming growth of celibacy amongst the peasantry which is its necessary consequence  to say nothing of the same ruinous increase of celibacy in higher ranks  threaten us with such a decrease of population  as will probably equal that caused by the ravages of those scourges of heaven  the sword  the famine  and the pestilence       If this selfish policy continues to extend itself  we shall in a few years be so far from being able to send emigrants to America  that we shall be reduced to solicit their return  and that of their posterity  to prevent England s becoming in its turn an uncultivated desart       But to return to Canada  this large acquisition of people is an invaluable treasure  if managed  as I doubt not it will be  to the best advantage  if they are won by the gentle arts of persuasion  and the gradual progress of knowledge  to adopt so much of our manners as tends to make them happier in themselves  and more useful members of the society to which they belong  if with our language  which they should by every means be induced to learn  they acquire the mild genius of our religion and laws  and that spirit of industry  enterprize  and commerce  to which we owe all our greatness       Amongst the various causes which concur to render France more populous than England  notwithstanding the disadvantage of a less gentle government  and a religion so very unfavorable to the increase of mankind  the cultivation of vineyards may be reckoned a principal one  as it employs a much greater number of hands than even agriculture itself  which has however infinite advantages in this respect above pasturage  the certain cause of a want of people wherever it prevails above its due proportion       Our climate denies us the advantages arising from the culture of vines  as well as many others which nature has accorded to France  a consideration which should awaken us from the lethargy into which the avarice of individuals has plunged us  and set us in earnest on improving every advantage we enjoy  in order to secure us by our native strength from so formidable a rival       The want of bread to eat  from the late false and cruel policy of laying small farms into great ones  and the general discouragement of tillage which is its consequence  is in my opinion much less to be apprehended than the want of people to eat it        In every country where the inhabitants are at once numerous and industrious  there will always be a proportionable cultivation       This evil is so very destructive and alarming  that  if the great have not virtue enough to remedy it  it is to be hoped it will in time  like most great evils  cure itself       Your Lordship enquires into the nature of this climate in respect to health  The air being uncommonly pure and serene  it is favorable to life beyond any I ever knew  the people live generally to a very advanced age  and are remarkably free from diseases of every kind  except consumptions  to which the younger part of the inhabitants are a good deal subject       It is however a circumstance one cannot help observing  that they begin to look old much sooner than the people in Europe  on which my daughter observes  that it is not very pleasant for women to come to reside in a country where people have a short youth  and a long old age       The diseases of cold countries are in general owing to want of perspiration  for which reason exercise  and even dissipation  are here the best medicines       The Indians therefore shewed their good sense in advising the French  on their first arrival  to use dancing  mirth  chearfulness  and content  as the best remedies against the inconveniences of the climate       I have already swelled this letter to such a length  that I must postpone to another time my account of the peculiar natural productions of Canada  only observing  that one would imagine heaven intended a social intercourse between the most distant nations  by giving them productions of the earth so very different each from the other  and each more than sufficient for itself  that the exchange might be the means of spreading the bond of society and brotherhood over the whole globe       In my opinion  the man who conveys  and causes to grow  in any country  a grain  a fruit  or even
