—Our new acquaintance asked us  if ever we had drank egg flip  to which we answering in the negative  he assured us of a regale  and ordered a quart to be prepared  calling for pipes and tobacco at the same time  We found this composition very palatable  and drank heartily  the conversation  which was introduced by the gentleman  turning upon the snares that young unexperienced people are exposed to in this metropolis —He described a thousand cheats that are daily practised upon the ignorant and unwary  and warned us of them with so much good nature and concern  that we blessed the opportunity which threw us into his way —After we had put the cann about for some time  our new friend began to yawn  telling us he had been up all night with a sick person  and proposed we should have recourse to some diversion to keep him awake —   Suppose  said he  we should take a hand at whist for pastime—But let me see  that won t do  there s only three of us  and I cannot play at any other game—The truth is  I seldom or never play  but out of complaisance    110 or at such a time as this  when I am in danger of falling asleep  —  Although I had no great inclination for gaming  I felt no aversion to pass an hour or two at cards with a friend  and knowing that Strap understood as much of the matter as I  made no scruple of saying    I wish we could find a fourth hand  —  While we were in this perplexity  the person whom we found at our entrance  overhearing our discourse  took the pipe from his mouth very gravely  and accosted us thus    Gentlemen  my pipe is out  you see   shaking the ashes into the fire  and rather than you should be baulked  I don t care if I take a hand with you  for a trifle —but remember I won t play for any thing of consequence  —  We accepted his profer with pleasure  and having cut for partners  it fell to my lot to play with him  against our friend and Strap  for three pence a game —We were so successful  that in a short time I was half a crown gainer  when the gentleman whom we had met in the street observing he had no luck to day  proposed to leave off  or change partners —By this time I was inflamed with my good fortune  and the expectation of improving it  as I perceived the two strangers plaid but indifferently  therefore I voted for giving him his revenge  with which he complied after some intreaty  and cutting again  Strap and I  to our mutual satisfaction  happened to be partners —My good fortune attended me still  and in less than an hour  we had got thirty shillings of their money  for as they lost  they grew the keener and doubled stakes every time  At last the inconstant goddess began to veer about  and we were very soon stript of all our gains  and about forty shillings   111 of our own money  This mortified me extremely  and had a visible effect on the muscles of Strap s face  which lengthened apace  but our antagonists perceiving our condition  kindly permitted us to retrieve our loss  and console ourselves with a new acquisition —Then my companion wisely suggested it was time to begone  upon which  the person who had joined us in the house began to curse the cards  and muttered that we were indebted to fortune only for what we had got  no part of our success being owing to our good play —This insinuation nettled me so much  that I challenged him to continue the game for a crown  and he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the invitation —This contest ended in less than an hour  to my inexpressible affliction  who lost every shilling of my own money  Strap absolutely refusing to supply me with a six pence —The gentleman  at whose request we had come in  perceiving by my disconsolate looks the situation of my heart  which well nigh bursted with grief and resentment  when the other stranger got up  and went away with my money  began in this manner    I am truly afflicted at your bad luck  and would willingly repair it  was it in my power —But what in the name of goodness could provoke you to tempt your fate so long  It is always a maxim with gamesters to pursue success as far as it will go  and to stop whenever fortune shifts about —You are a young man  and your passions too impetuous  you must learn to govern them better —However  there is no experience like that which is bought  you will be the better for this the longest day you have to live —As for the fellow who has got   112 your money  I don t half like him—Did not you observe me tip you the wink  to leave off in time  —  I answered  No    No   continued he  you was too eager to mind any thing but the game —But  harkee   said he  in a whisper  are you satisfied of that young man s honesty  his looks
