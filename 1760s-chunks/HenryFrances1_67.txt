Thinking  which is a Property  I apprehend they are mistaken in their Metaphysics  by ranking them under the same Class  And it was this Error  which  occurring   232 strongly to me at the Time I mention  made me hastily conclude  that  if there was any Mistake in Addison  it must be rather in his Words than his Sense   I was well pleased I had this Occasion of looking into Mr  Locke s Essay   which is a Book I had never read but once  when I was very young  because  upon this same Subject  he has affirmed a Thing which has provoked me extremely  and  if he has not been called to account for it before now  it would surprize me  but  as I never met any Thing written on this Head  I shall take the Liberty of answering him   In the first Chapter of his second Book he affirms  that the Soul does not always think  that Thinking is not Part of its Essence  but one of its Operations  i  e  Faculty or Power  in the diffusive Sense  This I deny  for  if we can suppose a Soul not to think for an Instant  we can suppose it not to think for a Day  a Month  a Year  and so for Eternity  Which is contrary to the Nature of a Soul  therefore impossible  For wherein does a Soul consist  if not in Thought and Reflection  He compares Thought to Motion  and says  A Body  tho  it sometimes moves  does not necessarily move  How imperfect is this Reasoning  and how weak all Illustrations of spiritual Operations  by referring them to sensible Acts  A Body does not move of itself  but either mediately or immediately by some Spirit  and is therefore dependent   233 on Spirit  for its Operations  But surely Spirit is independant on Matter  and self sufficient in its own Powers  and  as the several Qualities  Properties  or Faculties of the Soul  are not really distinct  but only philosophically divided  to give us a better or more formal Method of reasoning about them  as it is the whole Soul which thinks  reflects  reasons   c  then  should any of these Qualities or Faculties cease to operate but for an Instant  what should ever call them to Action again —except that Almighty Power  which first set them to work  And this would be equal to a new Creation of that  or any other Spirit  and to be repeated as often as it began to think  reflect  or reason  Which  as the Author of Nature acts always by the most simple Laws  we are not to suppose  without stronger Reasons than weak Men s mere Hypothesis  In short  if Thinking is not essential to a Soul  what are its essential Qualities  If it has no essential Qualities  then it exists not at all  Extension is essential to Matter  when Matter ceases to have Extension  it ceases to exist   Mr  Locke speaks against the Soul s essential Thought  to introduce his Reasoning against innate Ideas  but  as innate Ideas are one of the Proofs brought for the Being of a God  I will never give them up  upon any Reasoning less than Conviction  He shews us indeed how we may come by most of the Ideas we have  without   234 any previous Impression  but this does not prove  we have no such previous Impression  for the same Truth may be conveyed to us by different Ways  I grant him  that the Ideas of Colours  and of all sensible Objects  may be acquired by Experience  but  if Truth  Beauty  Harmony  or Order  were not originally impressed on our Souls  nothing in this World  not even the Objects themselves  could excite our Ideas of them  All the Ideas  we have in common with Brutes  I will allow we may acquire  as they do—but no farther   I am neither better or worse of my Cold  nor more or less affectionately and sincerely your s  my dear Fanny—which I shall continue as long as my innate Ideas of Truth  Beauty  Harmony  and Order shall exist   LETTER CXXIV   THE Pleasure I received from my dear Harry s last Letter  like the intuitive Converse he mentions  can only be imagined  not expressed  I care not how inconsistent you think me  provided you believe  that   Sorrow ne er can touch my Mind   Whilst you are well  and not unkind     Yet  notwithstanding that my every Word and Action prove  even against my Will  the Strength of my Affection for you  I cannot help earnestly desiring to put an End to the continual Anxiety  which my Attachment does  and   235 ever will produce  I still think  that Parting from what we love much dearer than ourselves  is far more dreadful  than the last sad Adieu  twixt Soul and Body  for  in general  the Soul is weary of its Confinement  and tired out with Pain  it longs to mingle with its kindred Spirits  to satisfy its boundless Thirst of Knowledge  to range thro
