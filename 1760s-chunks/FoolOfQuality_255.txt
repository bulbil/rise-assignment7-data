     And Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that   asked of him a king  And he said  This will be the manner of the   king that shall reign over you         He will take your sons and appoint them for himself  for his   chariots  and to be his horsemen  And some shall run before his   chariots  And he will appoint him captains over thousands  and   captains over fifties  and will set them to ear his ground and to reap   his harvest  And he will take your daughters to be confectioners    and cooks  and bakers  And he will take your fields  and your   vineyards  and your oliveyards  even the best of them  And he         270 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      will take your men servants  and your maid servants  and your   goodliest young men  and your asses  and put them to his work    and ye shall be his servants  And ye shall cry out in that day    because of your king which ye shall have chosen you   and the Lord   will not hear you in that day        Nevertheless  the people refused to obey the voice of the Lord   and of Samuel  and they said  Nay  but we will have a king   over us       And now  Harry  what do you gather from all these sacred   authorities  I gather  sir  answered Harry  from the express and   repeated declarations of holy writ  that whoever he be  whether   sovereign or subject  who doth not wish that all men should be   limited or restrained from doing injury to any  is a rebel to the will   of the God of Beneficence  and an enemy to the well being of   human kind      You have  exclaimed Mr  Fenton you have  in a few words    spoke the whole of the matter  On what you have said hang all   the law and the prophets      Again  my dear  continued Mr  Fenton  it is evident from the   history  that the Jews themselves did not pay the smallest regard   to the divine hereditary right of kingship  Both David and   Solomon  the second and third in succession  were established on the   throne in direct contradiction to such pretended right  And on   the succession of Kehoboam  the fourth king  ten of the twelve   tribes repented of their submission to an arbitrary monarchy  and   required the king to consent to a limitation of his authority  and to   enter into a contract with the people        And they spake unto Kehoboam  saying Thy father made our   yoke grievous   now  therefore  make thou the grievous service of   thy father  and his heavy yoke which he put upon us  lighter  and   we will serve thee       But when Kehoboam  by the advice of his sleek headed ministry    refused to covenant with the people  the ten tribes cried out     What portion have we in David   Neither have we inheritance in   the son of Jesse   to your tents  O Israel     And thus the ten   tribes revolted from the arbitrary domination of the houses of Saul   and David  For as the sacred text says   The cause was from the   Lord  11     Now when these ten tribes sent and called Jeroboam  the son of   Nebat  and made him king over Israel  it is most evident that they   obliged him to limit the regal authority  and to covenant with them   for the restoration and re establishment of their popular rights    For in the sixth succession  when Ahab sat upon the throne  the   regal prerogative had not yet so far usurped on the constitutional   rights of the people  as to entitle Ahab to deprive his subjects even   of a garden for herbs        And Ahab said unto Naboth  Give me thy vineyard  that I may   have it for a garden of herbs  because it is near unto my house  and   I will give thee for it a better vineyard   or  if it seems good to   thee  I will give thee the worth of it in money  But Naboth said   to Ahab  The Lord forbid that I should give the inheritance of my   fathers unto thee  So Ahab came to his house heavy displeased          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  271     because Naboth had said  I will not give to thee the inheritance of   my fathers   and he laid him down upon his
