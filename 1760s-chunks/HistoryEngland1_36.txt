behaved with paternal indulgence  perhaps his present hopes would not have been groundless  but a remembrance of his former ill usage repressed their loyalty  Instead of opening their gates to receive a conqueror  they sent forth an army to oppose his entry  Henry stopped his forces in a panic  and returned to meet the Earl of Leicester  who advanced with his army near Lewes in the county of Sussex   All hopes of reconciliation being now laid aside  nothing was thought of but the decision of the sword  The Earl  advancing with his army  drew up in order of battle near the King  who prepared  though with reluctance  to receive him  the fight was begun by Prince Edward  the King s son  who attacked the Londoners with great fury  and drove them off the field of battle  on the other hand  the King s body of forces were defeated  after a short resistance  by the Earl of Leicester  His Majesty  who commanded them in person  gave no instances of valour  but tamely suffered himself to be taken prisoner  which soon paved the way for the defeat of the whole army  and Prince Edward s surrendering at discretion   The King and the Prince being thus prisoners  the barons took all advantages that the most refined policy could suggest  They knew how to operate upon the King s pusillanimity  and obliged him to send letters to all the governors of the kingdom  to renounce their obedience  and surrender his castles to the conquerors  They who draw their sword against their King  says the proverb  should fling the scabbard away  The barons    106 with this in view  were resolved entirely to newmodel the constitution  for they now knew  that a composition with the royal captive was impossible  and at this period we must fix the date of English liberty  The privileges of the King  the barons  and the clergy  were but different modes of various usurpations  the commonalty had little or no share in the legislature  and only looked tamely on  or were led to slaughter without hopes of sharing the rewards of victory   The barons and clergy  however  now saw  that the government could not readily be transferred  without some greater power than they were at present possessed of  The dethroning a King  the resisting a Pope  were actions that they could not defend upon the principles of the times  they called in  therefore  an aid till now entirely unknown in the world  they called in the sanction of the people  The authority of the barons  clergy  and the people of England  were set to oppose the royal and papal authority  And here  my dear Charles  I cannot but admire the strange concurrence of circumstances which brought this first dawn of liberty into being  To effect this  it was first necessary that England should be possessed of a contested foreign dominion  that the King should have frequent necessities for money to preserve it  that this necessarily should produce a dependence upon the barons and clergy  and that this dependence should give them  in turn  a share of power  It was necessary  that the interests of the clergy should be separated from those of the crown  and should concur in the opposition  in short  it was necessary that the powers on both sides should be so exactly balanced  that so small   107 a weight as that of the people  as it was then considered  should be thrown in to turn the scale   A parliament was called  in which the King was obliged to give orders  that four Knights from each county should sit  in order to represent their respective shires  and deliberate for the general benefit of the people  This is the first rude outline of an English House of Commons  the people had been gaining some consideration since the diminution of the foeudal laws  and the establishment of corporation charters  by which men were  in some measure  rescued from the power of their masters  and permitted to improve a spirit of freedom in towns  As arts increased  the number of these little republics  if I may so call them  increased  and we find them  at the present period  of consequence enough to be adopted into a partnership of the legislation  But these privileges were granted by the barons  merely to confirm their own  and  could they have now agreed among themselves  they might have continued in possession of all the authority of the kingdom  and the constitution might thus settle into a confirmed aristocracy  but they grew jealous of each other s power  they began to fear the Earl of Leicester  who had abrogated kingly authority  and was intent only upon establishing despotism  This produced new struggles  and these ended once more in the restoration of the King and his family  the Earl of Leicester was defeated and slain upon the field of battle  Henry  who had been led about as a captive  and always exposed in the front of that army which had dethroned him  was once more set at liberty by his victorious son Edward  and though  to the end of life  he persevered in his former follies  yet the people retained that share of liberty   108 which they
