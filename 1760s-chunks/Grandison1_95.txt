 no  no  five or six times repeated  but could say no more at that 〈◊〉  holding up then both my disengaged hands for protection   The wicked man endeavoured to mussle me up again  and to force the handkerchief  which I had then got under my chin  over my mouth  and brutally cursed me   The gentleman would not be satisfied with Sir Hargrave s story  He would speak to me  Sir Hargrave called him impertinent  and other names  and asked  Who the devil he was  with rage and contempt —The gentleman  however  asked me  and with an air that promised deliverance  if I were Sir Hargrave s wife   No  no  no  no —I could only say   For my own part  I could have no scruple  distressed as I was  and made desperate  to throw myself into the protection  and even into the arms  of my deliverer  tho  a very fine young gentleman  It would have been very hard  had I fallen from bad to bad  had the sacred name of protector been abused by another Sir Hargrave  who  would have had the additional crime of betraying a confidence to answer for  But  however this had proved  an escape from the present evil was all I had in my head at the time   But you may better conceive  than I can express  the terror I was in  when Sir Hargrave drew his sword  and pushed at the gentleman with such words as denoted  for I could not look that way  he had done him mischief  But when I found my oppressor  my lowmeaning  and soon after low laid oppressor  pulled out of the chariot  by the brave  the gallant man  which   234 was done with such force  as made the chariot rock  and my protector safe  I was near fainting with joy  as before I had been with terror  I had shaken off the cloak  and united the handkerchief   He carried me in his arms  I could not walk  to his own chariot   I heard Sir Hargrave curse  swear  and threaten  I was glad however  he was not dead   Mind him not  madam  fear him not  said Sir Charles Grandison  You know his noble name  my Lucy▪  coachman  drive not over your master  Take care of your master  or some such words he said  as he lifted me into his own chariot  He came not in  but shut the chariot door  as soon as he had seated me   He just surveyed  as it were  the spot  and bid a servant let Sir Hargrave know who he was  and then came back to me   Partly thro  terror  partly thro  weakness  I had sunk to the bottom of the chariot  He opened the door  entered  and  with all the tenderness of a brother  soothed me  and lifted me on the seat once more  He ordered his coachman to drive back to Colnebrooke  In accents of kindness  he told me  that he had there at present the most virtuous and prudent of sisters  to whose care he would commit me  and then proceed on his journey to town   How irresistably welcome to me was his supporting arm  thrown round me  as we flew back  compared to that of the vile Sir Hargrave   Mr  Reeves has given you an account  from the angelic sister—O my Lucy  they are a pair of angels   I have written a long  long Letter  or rather five Letters in one  of my distresses  of my deliverance  And  when my heart is stronger  I will say more of the persons  as well as minds  of this excellent brother and his sister   But what shall I do with my gratitude  O my dear    235 I am overwhelmed with my gratitude  I can only express it in silence before them  Every look  if it be honest to my heart  however  tells it  Reverence mingles with my gratitude—Yet there is so much ease  so much sweetness  in the behaviour of both—O my Lucy  Did I not find that my veneration of both is equal  did I not  on examination  find  that the amiable sister is as dear to me  from her experienced tenderness  as her brother from his remembered bravery  which must needs mingle awe with my esteem   in short  that I love the sister  and revere the brother  I should be afraid of my gratitude   I have over written myself  I am tired  O my grandmamma  you have never yet  while I have been in London  sent me your over valued blessing under your own hand  Yet  I am sure I had it  and your blessings  my dear uncle and aunt Selby  and your prayers my Lucy  my Nancy  and all my Loves  else my deliverance had not perhaps followed my presumptuous folly  in going dressed out like the fantastic wretch I appeared to be  at a vile  a foolish masquerade —How often  throughout the several stages of my distress
