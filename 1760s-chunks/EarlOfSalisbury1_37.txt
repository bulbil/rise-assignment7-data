  thou hast undone me  Accursed be the slave who hath assisted thee to  betray me  But why do I think of thee  thou reptile  Come  lead me to  this Lady  let me dispel her maladies  let me give her peace  and leave  her         —Elinor started up  confounded and astonished at this mysterious  language  earnest for an explanation  yet too much awed and terrified  to speak her wishes  Raymond sternly repeated his orders  and in that  moment  the inhuman Grey  with all marks of haste and impatience  rushed  impetuously into the apartment   He had heard of the escape and return of the Countess  and of the flight  of Oswald  He had spurred on with wild speed to learn more particularly  the reason and purpose of these alarming events  his own conscious guilt  had raised dreadful presages in his mind  nor were these allayed by the  disorder in which he now found Lord Raymond  To him he addressed some  hasty and impersect questions  Raymond gazed on him for a while with an  aspect which plainly discovered an inward strife  and doubt whether to  accuse this man as his evil counsellor  or to entreat his assistance as  a faithful friend  At length  as if bowed down by violence of passion   he reclined on his arm  and was led away into another apartment  There  he distinctly recounted the advices he had received from Hubert  and the  jealousies expressed by the friends of the house of Salisbury  which  must now be enflamed and confirmed by the false Oswald  who had fled to  sanctuary with young William  He  spoke with pity and tenderness of the Countess whom his own cruelty had  driven from her castle  and whose flight had been prevented only by her  malady and weakness  He expressed his fears of detection and dishonour   that his unwarrantable usurpation  and attempt upon the constancy of  Ela  must now cover him with shame  he therefore declared himself  resolved to implore her forgiveness  and to retire  The coward heart of  Grey felt all the terrors that Raymond had expressed  with double force   He was instantly filled with the imagination of that power and  protection  which were soon to support the injured Countess  he trembled  at the recollection of his own share of guilt and oppression  he  commended the purpose of Lord Raymond  and urged him to resign his  pretensions without delay  But amidst all his fears  cunning had not yet  forsaken him  He secretly determined to make this resolution of his Lord  seem the effect of his own advice  in order to plead some merit with the  Countess  and  in some measure  to atone for his former insolence  He  therefore proposed to Raymond  to make him the messenger of his  design  to entrust him with the charge of acquainting Ela with his  penitence  and his resignation of all hopes or pretensions to her love  or fortune   An interview   said he         can only serve to enflame your fond passion  and to make a separation  doubly painful  No  trust not your eyes with the too powerful and  affecting object         Raymond consented  and Grey now prepared to summon Elinor  and to  desire admission to the Countess  when accidentally  he asked Lord  Raymond  who still dwelt upon the late events  to what place of  sanctuary Oswald had retired  The neighbouring monastery of Sarum was  no sooner mentioned  than  suddenly starting  as if a ray of comfort had  just shot thro  his soul  his eyes kindled  his cheeks glowed  his whole  aspect spoke surprize and triumph  he eagerly seized the hand of his  astonished Lord  he paused  their eyes encountered each other   Hope    said Grey       yet hope —I must depart this instant — But  by all your fond wishes  by  all your flattering prospects of love and greatness  I conjure you to  suspend your purpose  see not  speak not to this proud Countess  till my  return         Raymond demanded an explanation  but Grey only repeated his  injunctions  urged him to retire  and left him filled with astonishment  and expectation       END of VOL  I
