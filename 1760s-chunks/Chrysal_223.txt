       â  254 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     inform him that he was so constantly opposed in all his designs by   the English general  that it was impossible for him to do anything   of moment   wherefore he desired either that he might have leave   to resign his command  or have his authority freed from this vexa    tious and dangerous opposition  concluding his letter with these   remarkable words   â€”       Though in a multitude of counsellors there is said to be much   safety  yet  in the operations of war  if many are privy to the counsels   which direct them  there never can be that secrecy  agreement    a nd dispatch  which are indispensably necessary to success        The monarch  who was no stranger to the captious and unquiet   disposition of the English general  was sensible of the justice of the   German s complaint  and immediately removed the cause of it  by   giving him an unlimited power to carry on the war as it should   appear best to his own private judgment  without consulting v ith    or being liable to be opposed by any other person  It may be   thought that the entire removal of the English general would have   been a readier and more effectual method   but the nature of the   English government made this not quite so proper  as he was de    scended from one of the most illustrious and powerful families in   the kingdom  and a member of the senate  in which his talent for   speaking gave him such weight that it was judged best tb avoid   giving him cause for exerting his abilities in opposition to the   measures of the government  by removing him from an employment   which he had solicited with aJl his power and interest  especially   as the immense expense of this army began to make the people   uneasy  and ready to receive any impression against it  But the   event showed that this caution was ineffectual  and productive of   greater evils than that which it was made use of to avoid      Accordingly  from the time the German general received this   enlargement of his authority  he planned his schemes without ever   consultiug any person  or even communicating the least hint of   them  till the very moment of their being put in execution  when he   sent his orders with the peremptory precision of an absolute sover    eign  This was a severe stroke upon the English general  who had   been accustomed to canvass the very commands of his king  and    therefore  could badly brook such subordination to a person whom   he affected to hold in contempt  for the inferiority of his under    standing  However  as it was in vain to dispute  he obeyed in   sullen silence  resolving to seize the first opportunity of defeating   his measures  since he could no longer disconcert his councils  and to   take hold of the least miscarriage to attack him in the British senate   at the end of the campaign  where he doubted not but he should   be able to represent things in such a light as to get him removed   irom the command  which must  of course  devolve upon himself      This account my master received from a Jesuit the very night   he arrived at the camp  who  to ingratiate the society the more   effectually with the French king  and secure his interest and protec    tion  should any unforeseen accident defeat their design  had entered   into the service of the English general as his valet de chambre   for   the better opportunity of discovering the schemes of the allies    which he gave constant intelligence of to their enemies          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 265         CHAPTER XXX     A DEBP LAH  SCHEME DISCONCERTED BY AN ACCIDENTAL VICTORY â€”   TKBACHEKY FALLS INTO THE PIT IT HAD DUG EOK ANOTHER â€” THB   TRUE WAY TO SATISFY ENGLISH SOLDIERS â€” THE DISGRACED COM    MANDER S MOTIVES FOR APPEALING PROM THB WILL OF HIS SOVER    EIGN TO A PUBLIC TRIAL â€” HIS HOPES ARE AGAIN DISAPPOINTED    AND HE CONFIRMS HIS OWN RUIN     The very next morning after my master s arrival in the camp  an   event happened that astonished all Europe   The French army was   so greatly superior to that of the allies  that the general was obliged   to be entirely on the defensive   nor had his consummate experience   and indefatigable assiduity been able to prevent their taking several   advantages by their numbers  and forcing him to a retreat that   seemed to threaten the loss of the country he was to defend  But    through all these difficulties  he persisted steadily in
