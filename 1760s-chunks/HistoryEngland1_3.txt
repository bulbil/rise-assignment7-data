ill drawn  and vice and virtue be distributed without discernment or candour   What historian can render virtue so amiable as Xenophon  Who can interest the reader so much as Livy  Salust is an instance of the most delicate exactness  and Tacitus of the most solid reflexion  from a perfect acquaintance with these  the youthful student can acquire more knowlege of mankind  a more perfect acquaintance with antiquity  and a more just manner of thinking and expression  than  perhaps  from any others of any age or country  Other ancient historians may be read to advance your study in ancient learning  but these should be the ground work of all your researches  Without a previous acquaintance with these  you enter upon other writers improperly prepared  until these have placed you in a proper train of moralizing the incidents  other historians may  perhaps  injure  but will not improve you  Let me therefore  at present  my dear Charles  intreat you to bestow the proper care upon those treasures of antiquity  and by your letters  every post  communicate to your father  your friend  the result of your reflexions upon them  I am at a loss  whether I shall find more satisfaction in hearing your remarks  or communicating my own  However  in which soever of them I shall be employed  it will make my highest amusement  amusement is   7 all that I can now expect in this life  for ambition has long forsaken me  and  perhaps  my child  after all  that what your noble ancestor observed is most true    When all is done  human life is  at the greatest and the best  but like a froward child  that must be played with and humoured a little to keep it quiet till it falls asleep  and then the care is over  I am  my dear boy  your most tender friend and affectionate father                    LETTER II   Dear Charles   IENTIRELY acquiesce in your sentiments  that universal history is a subject too extensive for human comprehension  and that he who would really reap its advantages must be contented to bound his views  Satisfied with being superficially acquainted with the transactions of many countries  he should place his attention only on a few  Your remarks on the Greek and Roman republics far surpass my expectations  you have justly characterized them as the finest instances of political society  that could be founded on the basis of a false religion  Where religion is imperfect  political society  and all laws enacted for its improvement  must be imperfect also  religion is but philosophy refined  and no man could ever boast an excellence in politics  whose mind had not been previously opened and enlarged by the institutions of theology  an error in religion ever producing defects in legislation   Forgive me  dear Charles  if I once more congratulate myself upon the pleasure I expect from   8 your future eminence  you are now tinctured with universal history  and are thoroughly conversant with that of Greece and Rome  but there is another department of history still remaining  and that much more important than any I have yet mentioned  I mean the HISTORY OF ENGLAND  The history of this country is the proper study of an Englishman  however  it peculiarly concerns those who may  like you  probably one day have such an important character to support in its administration  and whose name  perhaps  may find a place in the historic   All who are inamoured of the liberty and the happiness which they  peculiarly enjoy  in this happy region  must surely be desirous of knowing the methods by which such advantages were acquired  the progressive steps from barbarity to social refinement  from society to the highest pitch of well constituted freedom  All Europe stands in astonisnment at the wisdom of our constitution  and it would argue the highest degree of insensibility in a native of this country  and one too who from his birth enjoys peculiar privileges  to be ignorant of what others so much admire   I shall not insist upon a principal use  to which some apply the English history  I mean that of making it the topic of common conversation  yet  even from such a motive  though in itself trifling  no well bred man can plead ignorance  its greatest advantage  however  is  that a knowledge of the past enables the attentive mind to understand the present  our laws  customs  liberties  abuse of liberty can scarcely be understood without tracing them to their source  and history is the only channel by which we can arrive at what we so eagerly pursue     9 But were I to compare the history of our own country  in point of amusement  with that of others  I know of none  either ancient or modern  that can vie with it in this respect  in other histories  remote and extensive connexions interrupt the reader s interest  and destroy the simplicity of the plan  the history of Greece may be easily divided into seven different histories  and into so many it has actually been  the history of Rome  from the time it begins to be authentic  is little else than an account
