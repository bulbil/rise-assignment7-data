 this is Mr  Bragwell—Mr  Banter  Sir—Mr  Chatter—my friend Mr  Slyboot  and Mr  Ranter  Sir  —  I saluted each of them in order  and when I came to take Mr  Slyboot by the hand  I perceived him thrust his tongue in his cheek  to the no small entertainment of the company  but I did not think proper to take any notice of it  on this occasion —Mr  Ranter too   who I afterwards learned was a player  displayed his talents  by mimicking my air  features and voice  while he returned my compliment —This I should not have been so sensible of  had I not seen him behave in the same manner  to my friend Wagtail  when he made up to them at first —But for once I let him enjoy the fruits of his dexterity without question or controul  resolved however  to chastize his insolence at a more convenient opportunity —Mr  Slyboot guessing I was a stranger  asked if I had been lately in France  and when I answered in the affirmative  enquired if I had seen the Luxemburg gallery  I told him  I had considered it more than once  with great attention  Upon this a conversation ensued  in which I discovered him to be a painter —While we were discoursing upon the particular pieces of this famous collection  I overheard Banter ask Dr  Wagtail  where he had picked up this Mr  Random —To which question the physician answered    Upon   101 my word  a mighty pretty sort of a gentleman—a man of fortune  Sir—he has made the grand tour—and seen the best company in Europe  Sir  —   What  he told you so  I suppose   said the other  I take him to be neither more nor less than a French valet de chambre  —   Oh  barbarous  barbarous   cried the doctor  this is actually  upon my word  altogether unaccountable —I know all his family perfectly well  Sir—He s of the Randoms in the north—a very ancient house  Sir  and a distant relation of mine  —  I was extremely nettled at the conjecture of Mr  Banter  and began to entertain a very indifferent opinion of my company in general  but as I might possibly  by their means  acquire a more extensive and agreeable acquaintance  I determined to bear these little mortifications as long as I could  without injuring the dignity of my character —After having talked for some time on the weather  plays  politicks  and other coffee house subjects  it was proposed that we should spend the evening at a noted tavern in the neighbourhood  whither we repaired in a body —Having taken possession of a room  called for French wine  and bespoke supper  the glass went about pretty freely  and the characters of my associates opened upon me more and more —It soon appeared that the doctor was entertained as a butt for the painter and player to exercise their wit upon  for the diversion of the company  Mr  Ranter began the game  by asking him what was good for a hoarseness  lowness of spirits and indigestion  he being troubled with all these complaints to a very great degree —Wagtail immediately undertook to explain the nature of his case  and in a very prolix manner  harrangued   102 upon prognostics  diagnostics  symptomatics  therapeutics  inanition  and repletion  then calculated the force of the stomach and lungs in their respective operations  ascribed the player s malady to a disorder in these organs  proceeding from hard drinking and vociferation  and prescribed a course of stomachics  with abstinence from venery  wine  and loud speaking  laughing  singing  coughing  sneezing or hollowing —   Pah  pah   cried Ranter  interrupting him  the remedy is worse than the disease—I wish I knew where to find some tinder water  —   Tinder water   said the doctor  upon my word I don t apprehend you  Mr  Ranter  —   Water extracted from tinder  replied the other  an universal specific for all distempers incident to man —It was invented by a learned German monk  who  for a valuable consideration  imparted the secret to Paracelsus  —   Pardon me  cried the painter  it was first used by Solomon  as appears by a Greek manuscript  in his own hand writing  lately found at the foot of mount Lebanon  by a peasant who was digging for potatoes  —   Well   said Wagtail  in all my vast reading  I never met with such a preparation  neither did I know till this minute  that Solomon understood Greek  or that potatoes grew in Palestine  —  Here Banter interposed  saying  he was surprized that doctor Wagtail should make the least doubt of Solomon s understanding Greek  when he is represented to us as the wisest and best educated prince in the world  and as for potatoes  they were transplanted thither from Ireland  in the time of the Crusades  by some knights of that country —   I profess  said the doctor  there is   103 nothing more likely—I would actually give a vast sum for a sight of that manuscript  which must be inestimable—and if I understood the process
