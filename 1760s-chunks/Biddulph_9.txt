no prepossessions  and as this is as handsome an offer as can possibly be made  I have no    objections  if you have none  my dear  to admit Mr Faulkland upon the terms he proposes   What answer ought I to have made  Cecilia  Why  to be sure  just the one I did make—I have no prepossessions  madam  looking down and blushing  till it actually pained me  for I was really startled  My Cecilia knows I am not a prude   My dear  cry’d my mother  and took me by the hand—  Poor Sidney  said Sir George  how you are to be pitied  Mr Faulkland purposes waiting on you in the afternoon  if he is not forbid  and he looked so teazingly sly  that my mother bid him leave off his pranks   The day is ever—Mr Faulkland spent the evening with us  no other company but our own family  My mother likes him better even than before—Thy mother—disingenuous girl  why dost thou not speak thy own sentiments   There is an apostrophe for thy use  my Cecilia   Well then  my sentiments you shall have  you have an undoubted right to know them on all subjects  but particularly on this interesting one   I do think Mr Faulkland the most amiable of men  and if my heart were  happily for me it is not  very susceptible of tender impressions  I really believe I should in time be absolutely in love with him  This confession will not satisfy you  may be it is not enough—yet  in truth  Cecilia  it is all that at present I can afford you   The thoughts of the aukward figure I should make in the evening visit  sat heavy on my spirits all day —Can you conceive any thing more distressing than the situation of a poor girl  receiving the visit of a man  who  for the first time  comes professedly as her admirer  I had conceived a frightful idea of such an interview  having formed my notions of it only from romances  where set speeches of an ell long are made by the lover  and answers of a proportionable size are returned in form by the lady  But Mr Faulkland soon delivered me from my anxiety  His easy  but incomparably polite and sensible freedom of address  quickly made me lose my ridiculous fears —He made no other use of this visit  than to recommend himself more strongly to our esteem  by such means as proved how well he deserved it  If he was particular to me  either in his looks or manner  it was under the regulation of such a nice decorum  that I  who supposed I must have sunk with downright confusion  was hardly disconcerted during the whole visit     June 10  I do really think my good mother grows so fond of Mr Faulkland  that if he goes on at this rate  he will get the start even of Sir George in her affections—‘Mr Faulkland said so and so  Mr Faulkland is of opinion  and I am sure you will allow Mr Faulkland to be a good judge of such and such things ’  To say the truth  the man improves upon you every hour you know him  And yet I have discovered in him some of those little  and they are but little  alloys to his many good qualities  which Sir George at first told me of  The interest I may one day have in him makes me a closer observer than I should otherwise be  There is that sly turn to ridicule which my brother mentioned  yet  to do him justice  he never employs it  but where it is deserved  and then too with so much vivacity and good humour  that one cannot be angry with him   We had a good deal of company at dinner with us to day  amongst the rest  young Sayers  who is just returned from his travels  as he calls it  You remember he went away a good humoured  inoffensive  quiet fool  he has brought no one ingredient of that character back with him but the last  for such a stiff  conceited  overbearing  talkative  impertinent coxcomb  does not now exist  His mother  who  poor woman  you know originally made a simpleton of the boy  contributes now all in her power to finish the sop  and she carries him about with her everywhere for a show  We were assembled in the drawing room before dinner  in burst  for it was not a common entry  Master Sayers  and his mamma  the cub handing in the old lady—So stiff  and so aukward  and so ungraceful  and so very unlike Mr Faulkland  that I pitied the poor thing  who thought that every body would admire him as much as his mother did  After he had been presented to the ladies  for it was the first time we had seen him since he came home   he took a turn or two about the room  to exhibit his person  then applying himself to a picture which hung over the door  a fine landscape of Claude Lorrain  which Mr Faulkland himself had brought over and given to Sir George   he asked my brother  in a tone scarce
