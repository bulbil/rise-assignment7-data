I went to town  and took every private method to discover her retreat  but in vain  till near a year after  when  being in London  with a friend of my mother s  a servant  who had lived with my Sophia  saw me in the street  and knew me  by her means  I discovered that she was in distress  abandoned by her lover  in that moment when his tenderness was most necessary        I flew to her  and found her in a miserable apartment  in which nothing but an extreme neatness would have made me suppose she had ever seen happier days  the servant who brought me to her attended her        She was in bed  pale  emaciated  the lovely babe you saw with me in her arms        Though prepared for my visit  she was unable to bear the shock of seeing me  I ran to her  she raised herself in the bed  and  throwing her feeble arms round my neck  could only say   My Fanny  is this possible   and fainted away        Our cares having recovered her  she endeavored to compose herself  her eyes were fixed tenderly on me  she pressed my hand between hers  the tears stole silently down her cheeks  she looked at her child  then at me  she would have spoke  but the feelings of her heart were too strong for expression        I begged her to be calm  and promised to spend the day with her  I did not yet dare  lest the emotion should be too much for her weak state  to tell her we would part no more        I took a room in the house  and determined to give all my attention to the restoration of her health  after which  I hoped to contrive to make my little fortune  with industry  support us both        I sat up with her that night  she got a little rest  she seemed better in the morning  she told me the particulars I have already related  she  however  endeavored to soften the cruel behaviour of the wretch  whose name I could not hear without horror        She had in the afternoon a little fever  I sent for a physician  he thought her in danger  what did not my heart feel from this information  she grew worse  I never left her one moment        The next morning she called me to her  she took my hand  and looking at me with a tenderness no language can describe         My dear  my only friend  said she  I am dying  you are come to receive the last breath of your unhappy Sophia  I wish with ardor for my father s blessing and forgiveness  but dare not ask them        The weakness of my heart has undone me  I am lost  abandoned by him on whom my soul doated  by him  for whom I would have sacrificed a thousand lives  he has left me with my babe to perish  yet I still love him with unabated fondness  the pang of losing him sinks me to the grave         Her speech here failed her for a time  but recovering  she proceeded        Hard as this request may seem  and to whatever miseries it may expose my angel friend  I adjure you not to desert my child  save him from the wretchedness that threatens him  let him find in you a mother not less tender  but more virtuous  than his own        I know  my Fanny  I undo you by this cruel confidence  but who else will have mercy on this innocent         Unable to answer  my heart torn with unutterable anguish  I snatched the lovely babe to my bosom  I kissed him  I bathed him with my tears        She understood me  a gleam of pleasure brightened her dying eyes  the child was still pressed to my heart  she gazed on us both with a look of wild affection  then  clasping her hands together  and breathing a fervent prayer to heaven  sunk down  and expired without a groan        To you  Madam  I need not say the rest        The eloquence of angels could not paint my distress  I saw the friend of my soul  the best and most gentle of her sex  a breathless corse before me  her heart broke by the ingratitude of the man she loved  her honor the sport of fools  her guiltless child a sharer in her shame         And all this ruin brought on by a sensibility of which the best minds alone are susceptible  by that noble integrity of soul which made it impossible for her to suspect another        Distracted with grief  I kissed my Sophia s pale lips  talked to her lifeless form  I promised to protect the sweet babe  who smiled on me  and with his little hand pressed mine  as if sensible of what I said        As soon as my grief was enough calmed to render me capable of
