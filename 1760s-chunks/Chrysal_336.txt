some parts of his own tale  which he was not   altogether so certain of before  He arose  therefore  and reconcil    ing himself to the faith of his tutor  by the strongest and most full   professions  dedicated the remainder of the night with him to   prayer and pious conversation      In the first heat of his devotion  he was for making the whole   affair public  and openly joining himself to that religion  whose   truth was thus confirmed to him  But his tutor moderated the   fervency of his zeal  sensible that such a step would not only defeat   the political designs of his friends  which must be carried on under   a mask  and in whose success his own wishes were most warmly   interested   but also overturn his own hopes of being well rewarded   for the care of his education  by a church Uving of great revenue    that was in the gift of one of his pupil s relations  who had promised   it to him  as soon as the incumbent  then sinking under all the in    firmities of extreme old age  should die   for his religious principles   never interfered with his interest  Tor these most weighty reasons    though  as you may imagine  he communicated only the former    he prevailed upon his convert to be content with the private practice    without the profession of his new faith  till he should  in the fulness   of time  be so happy as to contribute his assistance to the great   event  which should establish it in his own country      Such an argument could not fail of effect upon one who found   the fervour of his devotion cool so fast  that in a few days the whole   matter was entirely reversed  and his practice as libertine as ever     though fear of seeing any more spectres restrained his professions   within more decent bounds  For  so deeply was the dread of them   imprinted on his mind  that to this day he dares not to sleep by   himself  or be a moment alone in the dark   though his tutor  soon   after his ret im home  divulged the whole affair  as far as it affected   not himself  with the addition of many circumstances  if possible    still more contemptibly ridiculous than the true  to revenge his   procuring the living for one of his raking companions  and ingratiate   himself with a particular enemy of his  from whom he expected a   recompense for so pleasing a piece of scandal   to invalidate which   was one of his pupil s motives for instituting this society          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 401         CHAPTER XXVI     AOCOtTNT OF THE MEMBERS  CONTINUED   HISTOEY OF ONE WHO   arCTRNED LIBERTINE IN SPBCITLATIOlir  AFTER HE HAD LOST THE   POWER OF BEING SO IN PRACTICE â€” HOW THIS HAPPENED   THE   FORCE OF LITBRABT VANITY   AND THE REASON WHY IT 13   STRONGER THAN ANT OTHER â€” INSTANCES OF THE ADVANTAGES   REAPED FROM ENCOURAGING GENIUS â€” A NEW METHOD OF FLATTERY   IS SUCCESSFUL WHERE ALL OTHERS HAD FAILED   AND BY A   MASTER STROKE MAKES VANITY GAIN A SIGNAL TRIUMPH OVER   VIRTUE     At the riglit hand of the superior you see one    whose example   should be a warning to mankind never to be off their guard against   the allurements of vice  while there is any possibility  however   remote and improbable  of their falling into it  While youth might   have been pleaded in excuse of passion   and the busy application   of manhood extenuated any speculative errors in opinion  his   conduct had been regulated by the strictest regard to the prin    ciples of moral virtue  and the precepts of religion  But in the   evening of his days  when all that heat and hurry gave place to   cool reflection  and the serenity of the prospect more than com    pensates for its approaching close  the whole scene was wretchedly   reversed  and his setting sun overcast with a cloud of vices most   blameable in any stage of life  but aggravated ten thousandfold in   his  to which they were unnatural      I have told you before that vanity was the cause of a fall so   reproachful to humanity   the manner  though  of its operating   upon one who seemed to be removed so far beyond its reach is   worthy of attention  In no instance is the power of vanity so   tyrannically exerted over the human heart as when it arises from   an opinion of literary merit  The reason is obvious  Real learn    ing is the most efEectual check to vanity  as it shows the instability   of its foundation  When  therefore
