nature  They are only to be acquired by degrees  and generally are born from chagrin and disappointment  a wicked character is a depraved one       What must this unhappy girl have suffered  no misery can equal the struggles of a virtuous mind wishing to act in a manner becoming its own dignity  yet carried by passions to do otherwise   One o clock       I have been at Sir William Verville s  who is at Bath  I will write  and inclose the letter to him this evening  you shall have his answer the moment I receive it       We are going to dine at Richmond with Lord H—        Adieu  my dear Rivers  Bell complains you have never answered her letter  I own  I thought you a man of more gallantry than to neglect a lady       Adieu   Your faithful  J  FITZGERALD     LETTER CCIX   209   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Oct  30   I AM very impatient  my dear friend  till you hear from Sir William  though I have no doubt of his acting as he ought  our cottagers shall not leave us till their fate is determined  I have not told Miss Williams the step I have taken       Emily is more and more pleased with this amiable girl  I wish extremely to be able to keep her here  as an agreable companion of her own age and sex  whose ideas are similar  and who  from being in the same season of life  sees things in the same point of view  is all that is wanting to Emily s happiness        Tis impossible to mention similarity of ideas  without observing how exactly ours coincide  in all my acquaintance with mankind  I never yet met a mind so nearly resembling my own  a tie of affection much stronger than all your merit would be without that similarity       I agree with you  that mankind are born virtuous  and that it is education and example which make them otherwise       The believing other men knaves is not only the way to make them so  but is also an infallible method of becoming such ourselves       A false and ill judged method of instruction  by which we imbibe prejudices instead of truths  makes us regard the human race as beasts of prey  not as brothers  united by one common bond  and promoting the general interest by pursuing our own particular one       There is nothing of which I am more convinced than that     True self love and social are the same           That those passions which make the happiness of individuals tend directly to the general good of the species       The beneficent Author of nature has made public and private happiness the same  man has in vain endeavored to divide them  but in the endeavor he has almost destroyed both        Tis with pain I say  that the business of legislation in most countries seems to have been to counter work this wise order of providence  which has ordained  that we shall make others happy in being so ourselves       This is in nothing so glaring as in the point on which not only the happiness  but the virtue of almost the whole human race is concerned  I mean marriage  the restraints on which  in almost every country  not only tend to encourage celibacy  and a destructive libertinism the consequence of it  to give fresh strength to domestic tyranny  and subject the generous affections of uncorrupted youth to the guidance of those in whom every motive to action but avarice is dead  to condemn the blameless victims of duty to a life of indifference  of disgust  and possibly of guilt  but  by opposing the very spirit of our constitution  throwing property into a few hands  and favoring that excessive inequality  which renders one part of the species wretched  without adding to the happiness of the other  to destroy at once the domestic felicity of individuals  contradict the will of the Supreme Being  as clearly wrote in the book of nature  and sap the very foundations of the most perfect form of government on earth       A pretty long winded period this  Bell would call it true Ciceronian  and quote    — Rivers for a period of a mile           But to proceed  The only equality to which parents in general attend  is that of fortune  whereas a resemblance in age  in temper  in personal attractions  in birth  in education  understanding  and sentiment  are the only foundations of that lively taste  that tender friendship  without which no union deserves the sacred name of marriage       Timid  compliant youth may be forced into the arms of age and disease  a lord may invite a citizen s daughter he despises to his bed  to repair a shattered fortune  and she may accept him  allured by the rays of a coronet  but such conjunctions are only a more shameful species of prostitution       Men who marry from interested motives are inexcusable  but the very modesty of women makes against their happiness in this point  by giving them a
