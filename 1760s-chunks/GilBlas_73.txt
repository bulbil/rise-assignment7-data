me  less grieved at having drawn a blank in the lottery of love  than rejoiced at getting my neck out of an halter  I returned to my master s  where I passed the remainder of the night in moralizing on the scene I had left  For some time  I was in doubt whether to keep my appointment on the following evening  I thought it was a foolish business from first to last  but the devil  who is always lurking for his prey  or rather taking possession of us as his lawful property  whispered in my ear that I should be a great fool to pack up my alls when the prize was falling into my hands  Mergelina too with opening and unfathomable charms  The exquisite pleasures that awaited me  I determined to stick to my text  and promising myself a larger share of self possession  took my station the next evening at the doctor s door  between eleven and twelve  in a most spirit  stirring humour  The heavens were completely darkened  not a star to prate of my whereabout  I mewed twice or thrice to give warning of my being in the street  and  as no one answered my signal  I was not satisfied with going over the old ground  but ran up and down the cat s gamut from bass to treble  and from treble to bass  just as I used to sol fa with a shepherd of Olm√©do  I tuned my fundamental bass so musically  that a neighbour  on his return home  taking me for one of those animals whose mewings I counterfeited  picked up an unlucky flint lying at his feet  and threw it at me with all his force  saying    The devil fetch that tom cat  I received the blow on my head  and was so stunned for the moment  that I was very near falling backwards  I found the skin was broken  This was enough in all conscience to give me a surfeit of gallantry  so that  my passion oozing out with my blood  I made the best of my way homewards  where I rendered night hideous by my howling  and knocked all the family up  My master probed my wound  and played the true surgeon on it  he pronounced the consequences to be uncertain  He did all he could to make them certain  but flesh will heal in spite of the faculty  and there was not a scar remaining in three weeks  During all this time  I heard not a word from Mergelina  The probability is that Dame Melancia  to wean her impure thoughts from me  engaged her in some better sport  However  I did not concern myself about the matter  but left Madrid to continue my tour of Spain  as soon as I found myself perfectly recovered       CH  VIII     The meeting of Gil Blas and his companion with a man soaking crusts of bread at a spring  and the particulars of their conversation   SIGNOR Diego de la Fuenta related some other adventures which had since happened to him  but they were so little worthy of preservation  that I shall pass them by in silence  Yet there was no getting rid of the recital  which was tedious enough  it lasted as far as Ponte de Duero  We halted in that town the remainder of the day  Our commons at the inn consisted of a vegetable soup and a roast hare  whose genus and species we took especial pains to verify  At daybreak on the following morning we resumed our journey  after having replenished our flask with some very tolerable wine  and our wallet with some pieces of bread  and half the hare we had left at supper   When we had gone about two leagues we waxed hungry  and  espying at about two hundred yards from the high road some spreading trees  which threw an agreeable shade over the plain  we made up to the spot  and rested on our arms  There we met with a man from seven to eight and twenty  who was dipping crusts of bread into a spring  He had a long sword lying by him on the grass  with a soldier s knapsack  of which he had eased his shoulders  We thought his air and person better than his attire  We accosted him with civility  and he returned our salutation  He then offered us his crusts  and asked with a smile if we would take potluck with him  We answered in the affirmative  provided he had no objection to our clubbing our own breakfast  by way of making the meal more substantial  He agreed to it with the utmost readiness  and we immediately produced our provisions  which were not unacceptable to the stranger  What is all this  gentlemen  exclaimed he in a transport of joy  here is ammunition for an army  By your forecast  you must be commissaries or quartermasters  I do not travel with so much contrivance  for my part  but depend a good deal on the chances of the road  At the same time  though appearances may be against me  I can say  without vanity  that I sometimes make a very brilliant figure in the world  Would you believe that princely honours are commonly bestowed on me  and that I
