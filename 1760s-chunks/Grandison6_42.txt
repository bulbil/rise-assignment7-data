 said he—Greville  you keep no guard—He put by his pass with his sword  and  without making a push  closed in with him  twisted his sword out of his hand  and  pointing his own to his breast  You see my power  Sir—Take your life  and your sword —But if you are either wise  or would be thought a man of honour  tempt not again your fate   And am I again master of my sword  and unhurt   Tis generous—The evening  you say   Still I say  I will be yours in the evening  either at your own house  or at my inn  but not as a Duellist  Sir  You know my principles   How can this be  and he swore—How was it done  Expose me not at Selby house  How the devil could this be —I expect you in the evening here   And he went off a back way  Sir Charles  instead of going directly into his chariot  went up to his apartment  wrote his Billet to my aunt to excuse himself  finding it full late to get hither in time  and being somewhat discomposed in his temper  as he owned to us  And then he took an airing in his chariot  till he came hither to dine     105 But how should we have been alarmed  had we known that Sir Charles declined supping here  in order to meet the violent man again at his inn  And how did we again blame ourselves for taking amiss his not supping with us   Mr  Fenwick says  that Mr  Greville got him to accompany him to the George   Sir Charles apologized  with great civility  to Mr  Greville  for making him wait for him  Mr  Greville  had he been disposed for mischief  had no use of his right arm  It was sprained by the twisting of his sword from it  and in a sling   Sir Charles behaved to them both with great politeness  and Mr  Greville owned  that he had acted nobly by him  in returning his sword  even before his passion was calmed  and in not using his own  But it was some time  it seems  before he was brought into this temper  And what a good deal contributed to it  was  Sir Charles s acquainting him  that he had not given particulars at Selby house  or to any body  of the fray between them  but referred it to himself to give them  as he should think proper  This forbearance he highly applauded  and was even thankful for it  Fenwick shall  in confidence  said he  report this matter to your honour  and my own mortification  as the truth requires  at Selby house  Let me not be hated by Miss Byron  on this account  My passion gave me disadvantage  I will try to honour you  Sir Charles  But I must hate you  if you succeed  One condition  however  I make  That you reconcile me to the Selbys  and Miss Byron  and if you are likely to be successful  let me have the credit of reporting  that it is by my consent   They parted with civility  but not  it seems  till a late hour  Sir Charles  as Mr  Beauchamp and Dr  Bartlett have told us  was always happy in making  by his equanimity  generosity  and forgiveingness  fast   106 friends of inveterate enemies  Thank God  the issue was not unhappy   Mr  Fenwick says  that the rencounter is very little guessed at  or talked of  Thank God for that too    and to those few  who have enquired of Mr  Greville or Mr  Fenwick about it  it has been denied  and now Greville  as Mr  Fenwick had done before  declares he will give out  that he yields up all his hopes of Miss Byron  but says  that Sir Charles Grandison  of whose address every body already talks  is the only man in England to whom he could resign his pretensions   He insists upon Sir Charles s dining with him tomorrow  Mr  Fenwick s also  Sir Charles is so desirous that the neighbourhood should conclude  that he and these gentlemen are on a foot of good understanding  that he made the less scruple  for every one s sake  to accept of his invitation   I am very  very thankful  my dearest Lady G  that the constant blusterings of this violent man  for so many months past  are so happily overblown   Mr  Fenwick  as I guessed he would  made proposals to my aunt and me for my Lucy  Lucy has a fine fortune  But if she had not  he shall not have her  Indeed he is not worthy of Lucy s mind  He must be related to me  he said  But I answered  No man must call Lucy Selby his  who can have any other motive for his wishes but her merit   We hourly expect your brother  The new danger he has been in  on my account  endears him still more to us all  How  how will you forbear
