 enjoyed the pleasure we all had  Mine tossed up his head  and seemed to snuff the wind  And yet  my dear Lady L  there was nothing so very extraordinary said  but the manner was the thing  which shewed a meaning  that left language behind it   My brother is absolutely passive as to the oeconomy of the approaching solemnity  Mrs  Shirley  Mrs  Selby  Lady W  your Charlotte  and Lucy  are the council appointed  but uncle Selby will put in  to marshal this happy proceeding  What a pize  he says  is not Harriet his daughter  Will it not be his Day   Mrs Selby tries to smile off his oddity  but now and then we see her good naturedly redden at it  as if for his sake  Lucy looks at her uncle as if she could hardly away with his particularities  but Mrs  Shirley has always something to say for him  She enters into his character  She knows the honesty  as well as generosity  of his heart  That it all proceeds from joy and love  and always allows for him—As I would have my friends allow for me  And  to say truth  I  for my own part  like him the better for wanting allowances  because his case  in that respect  is mine  Ah  my dear  it is the thoughtful  half asleep  half awake  blinking cat  that catches the mouse  Such as your Charlotte  with their kittenish tricks  do but fright away the prey  and  if they could catch it  had rather play with it  than kill it   Harriet is with her virgins  Her dress is left to her own choice  I stept in just now—She met me at her dressing room door  and looked so lovely  so silly  and so full of unmeaning meaningness  Do you understand me  Lady L   She sighed—What would my Harriet say to me  said I  taking her hand —I don t know  again sighed—But love me  Lady G —Can I help it  said I  and  putting my arms about her  kissed her cheek     312 Uncle Selby has provided seven gentlemen of the neighbourhood  to match the number of the Ladies  for there will be sixteen of us  Mr  Godsrey  Mr  Steele  Mr  Falconbridge  three agreeable young men  sons of gentlemen in the neighbourhood  Mr  Selby s chosen friends and companions in his field sports  his cousin Holles  brother to the Miss Holles s  an admirer of Miss Nedham  young Mr  Roberts  an admirer of Miss Barclay  Mr  Allestree  a nephew of Sir John  a young man of sine qualities engaged to Miss Dolly Nedham  and Lord Reresby of Ireland  related to Mr  Selby s favourite Sir Thomas Falconbridge   a young nobleman of shining parts  great modesty  good nature  and  what is worth them all  Mrs  Shirley says  a man of virtue   Lord W  was very desirous of giving so rich a jewel as Harriet to his nephew  in return  as he said  for as rich a jewel which he had presented to him  but Mr  Selby would not admit of that  I told him  on his appeal to me  that he was right  once in his life   Mr  Selby talks much of the music he has provided for to morrow  He speaks of it as a band  I assure you   WE have had a most agreeable evening  My brother was the Soul of the company  His address to his Harriet was respectfully affectionate  yet  for her sake  not very peculiar  Every body  in turn  had his kindest notice  and were happy in it  The next day s solemnity was osten hinted at by Mr  Selby  and even by my flippant Lord—But Sir Charles always insensibly led to more general subjects  and this supported the spirits of the too thoughtful Harriet  and she behaved  on the whole  very prettily  His joy visibly was joy  but it seemed to be joy of so familiar and easy a nature  as if it would last   He once occasionally told the happy commencement   313 of his acquaintance with Miss Byron  on purpose  I saw  to remind her  that he ought not to be thought of as a stranger to her  and to engage her in an easy familiarity  But there was a delicacy observed by him in the remembered commencement  He put it not from the time that he rescued her from Sir Hargrave  but from the first visit she made me in St  James s Square  tho  she  with great gratitude  carried it back to its real commencement   Mrs  Shirley retired soon  as is her custom  her Harriet attending her  The old Lady is lame  and infirm  but  as she sits  is a very fine woman  and every body sees that she was once a beauty  I thought I never saw beauty in full bloom so beautiful as when it supported beauty in ruins  on the old Lady s retiring with a face so happy  leaning one arm
