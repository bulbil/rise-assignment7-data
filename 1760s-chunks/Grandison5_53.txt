 132 precaution  But who shall instruct you in such delicate points as these  One thing  however  permit me  Sir  to observe  I have often known young Ladies go on courageously with a Lover  while the end in view has been distant  or there have been difficulties to encounter with  but when these difficulties are overcome  and they have ascended the hill they toiled up  they have turned round  and looked about them  with fear as strong as their hopes   What the conditions may be—  But the Count of Belvedere is come   Ten o clock   THE Count accosted me  in return for the kindest reception I could give him  with an air of coldness and displeasure  I was surprised at a behaviour so different from his usual politeness  and the kindness he had ever shewn me  I took notice to him of it  He asked me  If I would tell him faithfully what my present situation was with Lady Clementina   I will  my Lord  if I tell you any thing of it  But the temper of mind you seem to be in  may not  perhaps  for your own sake  any more than mine  make it prudent for me to comply with your expectations   You need not give me any other answer  replied he  You seem to be sure of the Lady  But she must not  she shall not  be yours  while I am living   It is not for me  my Lord  who have met with many amazing turns and incidents which I have not either invited or provoked  to be surprised at any thing  But if your Lordship has any expectations  any demands  to make on this subject  it must be from the family of the Marchese della Porretta  and not from me   Do you think  Sir  that I feel not the sting of this reference  And yet all the family  but one  are in my interest in their hearts  every consideration is on my side  not one  but the plausibility of your generosity  Page  133 and the speciousness of your person and manners  on yours   A man  my Lord  should not be reproached for qualities  upon which  whether he has them or not  he values not himself  But  let me ask you  Were my pretensions out of the question  has your Lordship any hope of an interest in the affections of Lady Clementina   While she is unmarried  I may hope  Had you not come over to us  I make no doubt but I might in time  have called her mine  You cannot but know  that her absence of mind was no obstacle with me   I am wholly satisfied in my own conduct  replied I  That  my Lord  is a great point with me  I am not accountable for it to any man on earth  Yet  if you have any doubts about it  propose them  I have a high opinion of the Count of Belvedere  and wish to have him think well of me   Tell me  Chevalier  what your present situation is with Lady Clementina  What is concluded upon between the family and you  And whether Clementina herself has declared for you   She has not yet declared herself to me  I repeat  that I have a value for the Count of Belvedere  and will therefore acquaint him with more than he has reason to expect from the humour which seems to have governed him in this visit —I am to attend her this afternoon  by appointment  Her family and I understand one another  I have been willing to consider the natural impulses of a spirit so pure  tho  disturbed  as the finger of Providence  I have hitherto been absolutely passive  In honour I cannot now be so  This afternoon  my Lord—     This afternoon    trembling  What  this afternoon —    Will my destiny  as to Lady Clementina  be determined   I am distracted  If her friends are determined in Page  134 your favour  it is from necessity  rather than choice  But if the Lady is left to her own determination  I am a lost man   You have given a reason  my Lord  for your acquiescence  should Lady Clementina determine in my favour—But it cannot be a happy circumstance for me  if  as you hint  I am to enter into the family of Porretta as an unwelcome relation to any of them  and still less  if my good fortune shall make a man  justly valued by all who know him  unhappy   And are you  this afternoon  Chevalier  to see Clementina for the purpose you intimate  This very afternoon —And are you then to change your passive conduct towards her  And will you court  will you urge her to consent to be yours  Religion  Country—Let me tell you  Sir —I must take resolutions  With infinite regret I tell you  that I must  You will not refuse to meet me  The consent is not yet given  You shall not rob Italy of such a prize  Favour me  Sir  this moment  without the city gates
