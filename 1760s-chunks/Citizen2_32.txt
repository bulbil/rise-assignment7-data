The Russians are now at that period between refinement and barbarity  which seems most adapted to military atchievement  and if once they happen   96 to get footing in the western parts of Europe  it is not the feeble efforts of the sons of effeminacy and dissention  that can serve to remove them  The fertile valley and soft climate will ever be sufficient inducements to draw whole myriads from their native desarts  the trackless wild  or snowy mountain   History  experience  reason  nature  expand the book of wisdom before the eyes of mankind  but they will not read  We have seen with terror a winged phalanx of famished locusts each singly contemptible  but from multitude become hideous  cover  like clouds  the face of day  and threaten the whole world with ruin  We have seen them settling on the fertile plains of India and Egypt  destroying in an instant the labours and the hopes of nations  sparing neither the fruit of the earth nor the verdure of the fields  and changing into a frightful desert landscapes of once luxuriant beauty  We have seen myriads of ants issuing together from the southern desert  like a torrent whose source was inexhaustible  succeeding each other without end  and renewing their destroyed forces  with unwearied perseverance  bringing desolation wherever they came  banishing men and animals  and  when destitute of all subsistence  in heaps infecting the wilderness which they had made  Like these have been the migrations of men  When as yet savage  and almost resembling their brute partners in the forest  subject like them only to the instincts of nature  and directed by hunger alone in the choice of an abode  how have we seen whole armies starting wild at once from their forests and their dens  Goths  Huns  Vandals  Saracens  Turks  Tartars  myriads of men    97 animals in human form  without country  without name  without laws  out powering by numbers all opposition  ravaging cities  overturning empires  and  after having destroyed whole nations  and spread extensive desolation  how have we seen them sink oppressed by some new enemy  more barbarous and even more unknown than they   Adieu   LETTER LXXXV  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy  at Pekin  in China   AS the instruction of the fair sex in this country is entirely committed to the care of foreigners  as their language masters  music masters  hair frizzers  and governesses  are all from abroad  I had some intentions of opening a female academy myself  and made no doubt  as I was quite a foreigner  of meeting a favourable reception   In this I intended to instruct the ladies in all the conjugal mysteries  wives should be taught the art of managing husbands  and maids the skill of properly chusing them  I would teach a wife how far she might venture to be sick without giving disgust  she should be acquainted with the great benefits of the cholic in the stomach  and all the thorough bred insolence of fashion  maids should learn the secret of nicely distinguishing every competitor  they should be able to know the difference between a pedant and a scholar  a citizen and a prig  a squire and his horse  a beau and his   98 monkey  but chiefly they should be taught the art of managing their smiles  from the contemptuous simper to the long laborious laugh   But I have discontinued the project  for what would signify teaching ladies the manner of governing or chusing husbands  when marriage is at present so much out of fashion  that a lady is very well off  who can get any husband at all  Celibacy now prevails in every rank of life  the streets are crouded with old bachelors  and the houses with ladies who have refused good offers  and are never likely to receive any for the future   The only advice  therefore  I could give the fair sex  as things stand at present  is to get husbands as fast as they can  There is certainly nothing in the whole creation  not even Babylon in ruins  more truly deplorable than a lady in the virgin bloom of sixty three  or a battered unmarried beau  who squibs about from place to place  shewing his pig tail wig and his ears  The one appears to my imagination in the form of a double nightcap  or a roll of pomatum  the other in the shape of an electuary  or a box of pills   I would once more therefore advise the ladies to get husbands  I would desire them not to discard an old lover without very sufficient reasons  nor treat the new with ill nature till they know him false  let not prudes alledge the falseness of the sex  coquets the pleasures of long courtship  or parents  the necessary preliminaries of penny for penny  I have reasons that would silence even a casuist in this particular  In the first place  therefore  I divide the subject into fifteen heads    99 and then sic argumentor—but not to give you and myself the spleen  be contented at present with an Indian tale   In a winding of the river Amidar  just before it falls into the Caspian sea  there lies an island
