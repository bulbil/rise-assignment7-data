 I doubt not  my lord  but you must have a bad opinion of a woman who  without the slightest acquaintance  beckons you out of the street  but you will perhaps judge more favourably of me when you shall know that I do not pay that compliment promiscuously  You look like a man of fashion  You are perfectly in the right  my old girl  interrupted I  stretching out my right leg  and throwing the weight of my body on my left hip  mine is  vanity apart  one of the best families in Spain  It must be so by your looks  replied she  and I will fairly own that I delight in doing a kindness to people of quality  that is my weak side  I watched you through my window  You looked very earnestly at a lady who has just left me  Perhaps you may have taken a fancy to her  tell me so plainly  By the honour of my house  answered I  she has shot me through the heart  I never saw anything so tempting  a most divine creature  Do bring us acquainted  my dear  and rely on my gratitude  It is worth while to do these little offices for us of the beau monde  they are better paid than our bills   I have told you once for all  replied the old woman  I am entirely devoted to people of condition  it is my passion to be useful to them  I receive here  for example  a certain class of ladies  whom appearances prevent from seeing their favourites at home  I lend them my house  and thus the warmth of their constitutions is indulged  without risk to their characters  Vastly well  quoth I  and you have just done that kindness to the lady in question  No  answered she  this is a young widow of quality  in want of an admirer  but so difficult in her choice  that I do not know whether you will do for her  however great your requisites may be  I have already introduced to her three well furnished gallants  but she turned up her nose at them  Oh  egad  my life  exclaimed I confidently  you have only to stick me in her skirts  I will give you a good account of her  take my word for it  I long to have a grapple with a beauty of such peremptory demands  they have not yet fallen in my way  Well  then  said the old woman  you have only to come hither to morrow at the same hour  your curiosity shall be satisfied  I will not fail  rejoined I  we shall see whether a young nobleman can miss a conquest   I returned to the little barber s without looking for other adventures  but deeply interested in the event of this  Therefore  on the following day  I went  in splendid attire  to the old woman s an hour sooner than the time  My lord  said she  you are punctual  and I take it kindly  To be sure the game is worth the chase  I have seen our young widow  and we have had a good deal of talk about you  Not a word was to be said  but I have taken such a liking to you that I cannot hold my tongue  You have made yourself agreeable  and will soon be a happy man  Between ourselves  the lady is a relishing morsel  her husband did not live long with her  he glided away like a shadow  she has all the merit of an absolute girl  The good old lady  no doubt  meant one of those clever girls  who contrive not to live single  though they live unmarried   The heroine of the assignation came soon in an hired carriage  as on the day before  dressed very magnificently  As soon as she came into the room  I led off with five or six coxcombical bows  accompanied by the most fashionable grimaces  After this  I went up to her with a very familiar air  and said    My adored angel  you behold a gentleman of no mean rank  whom your charms have undone  Your image  since yesterday  has taken complete possession of my fancy  you have turned a duchess neck and heels out of my heart  who was beginning to establish a footing there  The triumph is too glorious for me  answered she  throwing off her veil  but still my transports are not without alloy  Young men of fashion love variety  and their hearts are  they say  bandied about from one to the other like a piece of base money  Ah  my sovereign mistress  replied I  let us leave the future to shift for itself  and think only of the present  You are lovely  I am in love  If my passion is not hateful to you  let it take its course at random  We will embark like true sailors  set the storms and shipwreck of a long voyage at defiance  and only take the fair weather of the time present into the account   In finishing this speech  I threw myself in raptures at the feet of my nymph  and the better to hit off my assumed character
