an illness which seized her on her first hearing the news of my misfortune  Poor girl  My mother tells me she went so far as to express her apprehensions on my being again single  but my mother quieted her fears on that head  not without a soft reprimand for her doubting   by putting her in mind  that besides the circumstances not being altered in regard to her  she had received my solemn promise  that  whenever it was in my power  I would use my whole influence  whatever that might be  in her favour  I did make her such a promise  and shall fulfil it to the utmost   Mr Faulkland’s absence from the kingdom hitherto put it out of my power  nor would I  without my beloved Mr Arnold’s participation  have ever attempted it  Had he lived  fully restored as I was to his confidence and good opinion  I should have ventured to disclose the secret to him  and got him to join with me in such measures  as I should have thought best for Miss Burchell’s happiness  It now rests upon myself alone  and I will leave nothing unattempted to serve her   June 22  You will be surprized perhaps  my Cecilia  when I tell you that Mr Faulkland is now in England  Miss Burchell told me so this day  She mentioned it in a careless manner  rather directing her discourse to    my mother  She had too much delicacy to hint at consequences of any kind from this circumstance  and quickly turned from the subject  My mother asked her impatiently  when he came  where he was  and several other questions  to none of which she could give any answer  but that she heard he had been returned above three months and was at his seat in Hertfordshire  I am surprized Sir George never mentioned this to me  to be sure he knew it  he is not extremely nice in his notions  however  this is a decorum for which I am obliged to him  Lady V—— doubtless was ignorant of it  or she would have told me   There is nothing now to prevent me from warmly interfering for Miss Burchell  Charming young woman  how is she to be pitied  The tedious years of suspence  of almost hopeless love  that she has passed  deserve a recompence  and her little boy  my mother tells me  is a lovely creature  Miss Burchell brought him once to see my mother  Mr Faulkland’s former house keeper visits the child often  and has brought his mother frequent and large supplies for his use   I told Miss Burchell  at parting to day  that I had not forgot my promise  and that  as soon as decency would permit  nothing should hinder me from being a most strenuous advocate for her  She squeezed my hand  and whispered  dear madam  my fate is in your power   I would it were  then should she soon be happy  But I will acquit myself as far as I am able   June 23  I was prevailed on to dine at my brother’s to day  the first time that I have been abroad ever since I came to town  I had no mind to go  but my mother  not being well  had excused herself  and she said  it would be taken amiss if I did so too  lady Sarah herself having made the invitation  Her ladyship said  I need not be fearful of meeting strangers at her house  as it was to be a private day  So much the better  thought I  nothing else should induce me to go   It was the first time I ever was in Sir George’s house  which is a very magnificent one  within a door or two of Mr Faulkland’s  in St James’s Square  as lady Sarah did not approve of that which he had before  But  my dear  the ostentation of this woman made me sick  such a parade of grandeur  such an unnecessary display of state and splendor  I thought  looked like an insult upon me  I was carried into a most sumptuous drawing room  but as this was a private day  as she    called it  the furniture was all covered up with body cloths  and the room  having been newly washed  felt extremely cold   I was told her ladyship was dressing  though it was then  as I imagined  her dinner time  After I had shivered here for about half an hour  lady Sarah’s woman came to desire me to walk up stairs  As the woman did not know me  and  from the little ceremony she saw me treated with  concluded I was some humble visitor  she took me up the back stairs to her lady’s dressing room  where I found lady Sarah  who was not yet half dressed  in consultation with her millener  The woman was trying some head dresses on her before the glass  She made me a very slight apology for having kept me waiting so long  and  to mend the matter  told me  as she was not near ready  if I chose looking at the house  I should have time enough to do it before dinner  I thanked her
