are not already too deeply        engaged this evening  would beg the favour of you to share with me        in the proposed diversion  we shall have two young gentlemen of        rank for our conductors and protectors  but I flatter myself you        will make no scruple to go any where with her who is  with the        most perfect amity  dear Miss Betsy  your most humble  and most        obedient servant            A  AIRISH            P S  Let me know whether I can be so happy as to have you with me         and if so  I will call on you about five  and drink tea  for we        shall not go to the assembly  till eight        This proposal put Miss Betsy out of all her serious reflections  and she   returned for answer to the lady  that she would not fail to be at home    and ready to attend her at the appointed hour       Accordingly  as soon as ever dinner was over  she went to dress  and   thought of nothing but how to make as brilliant a figure as any she   should meet with at the assembly  Miss Airish came somewhat before the   hour she had mentioned in her letter  accompanied by two rakes of   quality  whom Miss Betsy had seen two or three times before with her and   her sister  and by one of whom she had once been treated with some   familiarities  which had made her ever since very cautious of giving him   any opportunity to attempt the like       As much  therefore  as she had pleased herself with the idea of this   evening s pleasures  she no sooner saw who were to be their conductors    than she resolved not to put herself in their powers  yet knew not how    without affronting Miss Airish  to avoid complying with the promises she   had made of accompanying her       They all came singing and romping into the room  but the perplexity of   Miss Betsy s mind made her receive them with a very serious air  The men   accosted her with a freedom conformable enough to their own characters    but not very agreeable to one of hers  and she rebuffed  with a good   deal of contempt  him with whom she had most reason to be offended        Lord  How grave you look   said Miss Airish  observing her countenance     pr ythee  my dear creature  put on a more chearful aspect  this is to   be a night of all spirit  all mirth  all gaiety     I am sorry I cannot   be a partaker of it   said Miss Betsy  who  by this time  had contrived   an excuse   Lord  What do you mean  not partake of it   cried Miss   Airish hastily   sure you would not offer to disappoint us     Not   willingly   replied Miss Betsy   but I was just going to send to let you   know I have received a message from my elder brother  to come to his   house  in order to meet some persons there on very extraordinary   business  but  I hope   added she   that my not going will be no   hindrance to the diversion you propose         It would have been none  Madam   said one of the gallants   if this   assembly were like others  but we are only a select company of gay young   fellows  who resolve to try how far nature may be exhilarated by   regaling every sense at once  to prevent all quarrels  every man is to   bring a lady with him  who is to be his partner in singing  dancing    playing  or whatever they two shall agree upon  We two   continued he     pitched upon the two Miss Airishes  but one of them being gone another   way  we thought of you  otherwise we could have found ladies who would   have obliged us         Very likely   replied Miss Betsy   and I suppose it may not be too late   to seek them     But I had rather have you than all the world   cried he   whom Miss Betsy was most apprehensive of   you know I have always shewn   a particular tendre for you  therefore  pr ythee   continued he    catching her in his arms  and eagerly kissing her   my dear girl
