their lust  or make such a provision for her as would entirely  screen her from the necessity of seeking a livelihood by becoming a common prostitute  or else be condemned to immediate death  after lawful conviction of the crime   It may be objected that many would do this  but through indigence of circumstances   172 are incapable of it  Let them consider before hand  for in this case nothing ought to shelter them from the punishment they incur by thus effecting the ruin of an innocent young woman  If this proceeding were once adopted  how many women  who at present are a scandal to their sex  would then live ornaments to human society  and their beauty and virtue would be revered by all who are any way connected with them   The other class of unhappy women is composed of such who are so by their own choice  and even some of these are inbebted for their first introduction to wickedness  to the traitor man  Others there are indeed  who have been the first to solicit our sex to ruin them  But let these reflect  that conscience is the faithful register of all our actions  the unbiassed witness of our conduct  and the equitable judge of all we do  When conscience approves of our actions  we find in it a resource in all our afflictions  we are helped by it to support under the weight of misfortunes  and we are thereby assured of   173 one day being admitted to a participation of eternal joys   On the contrary  when conscience condemns us  the sentence is followed by remorse  by punishments  by despair  which will inevitably plunge us  at the last day  into an abyss of endless misery  where  as the poet Tibullus beautifully expresses it   —Prolixa jacet sedes in nocte profunda   Abdita  quacircum  flumina nigra sonant   Or  as Horace says   — Hic murus aheneus esto   Nil conscire sibi  nulla pal•e•ce•e culpa   We ought not therefore to judge of the rectitude or depravity of our actions  by the dictamen of our unbridled passions  but submit them to the decision of conscience  The supreme beings  creator of all things  has given us it  as the infallible rule whereby we are to regulate our lives   This being therefore the case  how great must be the inward torment of such women as are ingulphed in this fathomless sea of wickedness  What would they not give    174 to enjoy one hour s tranquillity of mind  But this is denied them  and the only resource they have left is to have recourse ro strong liquors  as often as those thoughts enter their minds  in order to drown the remembrance of what would infallibly make them run mad  did they suffer themselves to think coolly on it   Although they were to suffer nothing in the next world  although their souls were not immortal  yet the miseries which attend them  would be sufficient  one would imagine  to deter them from continuing in their present wicked course  How often are they obliged to walk the streets all the night  subject to the inclemency of the season  destitute of a lodging  nor having money to procure one  hungry and cold  without hopes of relief  kicked by any drunken rake who shall think fit to treat them in that barbarous manner  How many of them rot in an hospital  Some even turned out from those receptacles of the indisposed  at last have finished their days on a dunghill  What horrors of 〈◊〉 must they experience in their 〈◊◊〉  when their guilty consciences   175 reproach them with all their wickedness  What indignation must they not conceive against themselves for having brought so many ills on their own heads  How bitter the reflection of having curtailed their own life by incontinency  How will they curse the hour in which they first prostituted their lovely bodies  designed for the enjoyment of the chaste joys of holy matrimony  In short those only who have been in this unhappy state can form a just idea of it   Since therefore the life of a woman of this character is so replete with misfortune  whether she be such by choice or necessity  take warning ye unguarded fair  Listen not to the false persuasive voice of those would lead you to ruin  Be deaf to all their protestations of love  pay no regard to their oaths and imprecations  much less to their promises of marrying you  after they enjoy your persons  for you may be certain they will deceive you  They only do this to deceive you  for they never  or at least very rarely happens  will consent to take her for a wife  who could so easily consent to their embraces  before   176 marriage  They cannot be induced to believe that a woman will ever be faithful to them after such a step  and even some despise the poor deluded fair  who rashly complied with their desires  Man is in some sense the most rational of the creation  Few are able to curb the impetuosity of the sensual appetite which is common to them with brutes  and they may be said to be lions  who go up and down seeking whom they may devour   Consider  ye deluded fair  the shortness of your Life
