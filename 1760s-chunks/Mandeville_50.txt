dinner  when he treated me with a distant civility  the meaning of which was easily understood  He apologized  with an air of ceremony  on his being forced to go for a fortnight to Scarborough  with a party  who  being all strangers  he was afraid would not be agreeable to me  but  at his return  he should be glad of the honor of seeing me again  I bowed coldly  and took no other notice of what he said  than to order my chaise immediately  on which he pressed my stay to night  but in vain  The servants leaving the room  he was a little disconcerted  but observed  He was sorry for me  my case was really hard  he always thought my fortune much larger  wondered at my father s indiscretion in educating me so improperly    People ought to consider their circumstances    It was pity I had no friend    Lord Belmont  if he pleased  but he was so absurdly fond of his independence            2 20          During his harangue  I entirely recovered my presence of mind  and  with an air of great ease and unconcern  told his Lordship  I was much obliged to him for curing me of a pursuit so improper for a man of my temper  that the liberal offers of service he had formerly made me at Rome had betrayed me into a false opinion of the friendship of great men  but that I was now convinced of what value such professions are  and that they are only made where it seems certain they will never be accepted  That it was impossible his Lordship could judge properly of the conduct of a man of my father s character  that I was proud of being son to the most exalted and generous of mankind  and would not give up that honor to be first minister to the first prince on earth  That I never so strongly felt the value of independence as at that moment  and did not wonder at the value Lord Belmont set on so inestimable a blessing            2 21          I came away without waiting for an answer  and stopped at an inn about ten miles off  where I am now waiting for one of my servants  whom I left behind to bring me a letter I expect to day from Lady Anne Wilmot        And now  my dear Mordaunt  what will become of your unhappy friend  The flattering hopes I fondly entertained are dispersing like a flitting cloud  Lord T     s behaviour has removed the veil which love had spread over the wildness of my design  and convinced me that success is impossible  Where or to whom shall I now apply  Lord T    was him on whose friendship I most depended  whose power to serve me was greatest  and whose professions gave me most right to expect his services        I here for ever give up all views    Can I then calmly give up the hopes of Lady          2 22       Julia  I will go back  confess my passion to Lord Belmont  and throw myself on that goodness whose first delight is that of making others happy  Yet can I hope he will give his daughter  the heiress of such affluence    Disinterested and noble as he is  the false maxims of the world    Mordaunt  I am born to wretchedness    What have I gained by inspiring the most angelic of women with pity  I have doomed to misery her for whose happiness I would sacrifise my life      The servant I left at Lord T     s is this moment arrived  he has brought me a letter    I know not why  but my hand trembles  I have scarce power to break the seal            2 23         To Henry Mandeville  Esq      SUMMON all your resolution  my dear Mr  Mandeville    Sure my fears were prophetic    do not be too much alarmed    Lady Julia is well  she is in tears by me  she disapproves her father s views  she begs me to assure you her heart is not less sensible than ours will be to so cruel a stroke  begs you not to return yet to Belmont  but to depend on her affection  and leave your fate in her hands        The inclosed letters will acquaint you with what I have been for some time in apprehension of  With such a design for his daughter  why did my Lord bring you to Belmont  So formed to inspire love as you both are  why did he expose you to danger it was scarce possible for you to escape            2 24          But it is now too late
