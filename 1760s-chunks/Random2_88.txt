both in good health  and only in pain for you  especially  as it will be impracticable for you to convey any message or letter to the place of our confinement—for which reason  pray desist from the attempt  that by miscarrying must prolong our captivity   N—   This kind letter afforded me great consolation  I communicated it to Banter  and at the same time  shewed him her picture  He approved her beauty and good sense  and could not help owning  that my neglect of Miss Snapper was excusable  when such a fine creature engrossed my attention   I began to be reconciled to my fate  and imagined  that if I could contrive means of subsisting until my uncle should arrive  in case he was not already at home  that he would enable me to do something effectual in behalf of my love and fortune—I therefore consulted Banter about a present supply  who no sooner understood that I had credit with a taylor  than he advised me to take off two or three suits of   264 rich cloaths and convert them into cash  by selling them at half price to a salesman in Monmouth street —I was a little startled at his proposal  which I thought savoured a little of fraud  but he rendered it palatable  by observing  that in a few months  I might be in a condition to do every body justice  and in the mean time  I was acquitted by the honesty of my intention—I suffered myself to be persuaded by his salvo  by which my necessity  rather than my judgment  was convinced  and when I found there were no accounts of the ship in which my uncle embarked  actually put the scheme in practice  and raised by it  five and twenty guineas  paying him for his advice with the odd five     265  CHAP  LXI    I am arrested—carried to the Marshalsea—find my old acquaintance beau Jackson in that jail—he informs me of his adventures—Strap arrives  and with difficulty is comforted—Jackson introduces me to a poet—I admire his conversation and capacity—am deeply affected with my misfortune—Strap hires himself as a journeyman barber   BUT this expedient was in a few weeks attended with a consequence I did not foresee  a player having purchased one of the suits which were exposed to sale  appeared in it on the stage one night  while my taylor unfortunately happened to be present —He knew it immediately  and enquiring minutely into the affair  discovered my whole contrivance  upon which he came to my lodgings  and telling me that he was very much straitened for want of money  presented his bill  which amounted to 50l —Surprized at this unexpected address  I affected to treat him cavalierly  swore some oaths  asked if he doubted my honour  and  telling him I should take care who I dealt with for the future  bid him come again in three days —He obeyed me punctually  demanded his money  and finding himself amused with bare promises  arrested me that very day in the street —I was not much shocked at this adventure  which  indeed  rescued me from a horrible   266 suspence in which I had lived since his first visit  I refused to go to a spunging house  where I had heard there was nothing but the most flagrant imposition  and a coach being called  I was carried to the Marshalsea  attended by a bailiff and his follower  who were very much disappointed and chagrined at my resolution   The turnkey guessing  from my appearance  that I had got money in my pocket  received me with the repetition of the Latin word depone  and gave me to understand  that I must pay before hand for the apartment I should chuse to dwell in —s desired to see his conveniencies  and hired a small  paultry bed chamber  for a crown a week  which  in any other place  would not have let at eighteen pence —Having taken possession of this dismal habitation  I sent for Strap  and my thoughts were busied in collecting matter of consolation to that faithful squire  when somebody knocked at my door  which I no sooner opened  than a young fellow entered  in very shabby cloaths and marvellous foul linnen  After a low bow  he called me by my name  and asked if I had forgot him  His voice assisted me in recollecting this person  whom I soon recognized to be my old acquaintance beau Jackson  of whom mention is made in the first part of my memoirs —I saluted him  expressed my satisfaction at finding him alive  and condoled with him on his present situation  which  however  did not seem to affect him much  for he laughed very heartily at the occasion of our meeting so unexpectedly in this place  After our mutual compliments were over  I enquired about his amour with the lady of fortune  which seem d to be so near an happy conclusion when I had the   267 pleasure of seeing him last  and after an immoderate fit of laughter  he gave me to understand  that he had been egregiously bit in that affair —   You must know   said she  that a few days after our adventure with the bawd and her b—ches  I found means to be married to that same fine lady you speak
