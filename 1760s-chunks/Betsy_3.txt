having placed his daughter   where she was so likely to improve in all the accomplishments befitting   her sex  that he never suffered her to come home  even at breaking up   times  when most of the other young ladies did so  but as the school was   not above seven or eight miles from his seat  he seldom failed calling   to see her once or twice a week       Miss Betsy  who had a great deal of good nature  and somewhat extremely   engaging in her manner of behaviour  soon gained the affection not only   of the governess  but of all the young ladies  but as girls  as well as   women  have their favourites  to whom they may communicate their little   secrets  there was one who above all the others was distinguished by   her  Miss Forward  for so she was called  was also very fond of Miss   Betsy  This intimacy beginning but in trivial things  and such as suited   their age  continued as they advanced nearer to maturity  Miss Forward    however  had two years the advantage of her friend  yet did not disdain   to make her the confidante of a kind of amorous intrigue she had entered   into with a young lad  called Master Sparkish  the son of a neighbouring   gentleman  he had fallen in love with her at church  and had taken all   opportunities to convince her of his passion  she  proud of being looked   upon as a woman  encouraged it  Frequent letters passed between them    for she never failed to answer those she received from him  both which   were shewn to Miss Betsy  and this gave her an early light into the art   and mystery of courtship  and consequently a relish for admiration  The   young lover calling his mistress angel and goddess  made her long to be   in her teens  that she might have the same things said to her       This correspondence being by some accident discovered  the governess   found it behoved her to keep a strict eye upon Miss Forward  all the   servants were examined concerning the conveying any letters  either to   or from her  but none of them knew any thing of the matter  it was a   secret to all but Miss Betsy  who kept it inviolably  It is fit    however  the reader should not remain in ignorance       Master Sparkish had read the story of Pyramus and Thisbe  he told his   mistress of it  and in imitation of those lovers of antiquity  stuck his   letters into a little crevice he found in the garden wall  whence she   pulled them out every day  and returned her answers by the same friendly   breach  which he very gallantly told her in one of his epistles  had   been made by the God of Love himself  in order to favour his suit  so   that all the governess s circumspection could not hinder this amour from   going on without interruption  and could they have contented themselves   with barely writing to each other  they might probably have done so till   they both had been weary  but though I will not pretend to say that   either of them had any thing in their inclinations that was not   perfectly consistent with innocence  yet it is certain they both   languished for a nearer conversation  which the fertile brain of Miss   Forward at last brought about       She pretended  one Sunday in the afternoon  to have so violent a pain in   her head  that she could not go to church  Miss Betsy begged leave to   stay and keep her company  and told the governess she would read a   sermon or some other good book to her  the good old gentlewoman  little   suspecting the plot concerted between them  readily consented       Nobody being left in the house but themselves  and one maid servant    young Sparkish  who had previous notice at what hour to come  was let in   at the garden door  the key being always in it  Miss Betsy left the   lovers in an arbour  and went into the kitchen  telling the maid she had   read Miss Forward to sleep  and hoped she would be better when she   waked  She amused the wench with one little chat or other  till she   thought divine service was near over  then returned into the garden to   give her friends warning it was time to separate       They had after this many private interviews  through the contrivance and   assistance of Miss Betsy  who  quite charmed with being made the   confidante of a person older than herself  set all her wits to work to   render herself worthy of the trust reposed in her  Sometimes she made   pretences of going to the milliner  the mantua
