level hills  or to force and distort nature  but to help it  as he finds it  without letting art be seen in his works  where he can possibly avoid it  For he says  He would rather let a stranger be pleased with what he sees  as if it were always so  than to obtain comparative praise by informing him what it was in its former situation   As he is to be a suitor for Lord W  before he returns  he will not  perhaps  be with us  while I am here  He may court for others  He has had very little trouble of that sort for himself  I find   A very disturbing thought is just come into my head  Sir Charles being himself in suspense  as to the catastrophe of this knotty affair  did not intend to let us know it till all was over—As sure as you are alive  Lucy  he had seen my regard for him thro  the thin veil that covered it  and began to be apprehensive  generously apprehensive  for the heart of the poor fool  and so has suffered Dr  Bartlett to transcribe the particulars of the story  that they may serve for a check to the over forward passion of your Harriet     235This thought excites my pride  and that my contempt of myself  Near borderers  Lucy  What a little creature does it make me  in my own eyes —O Dr  Bartlett  your kindly intended transcripts shall cure me  Indeed they shall   But now this subject is got uppermost again  What  Lucy  can I do with it   Miss Grandison says  that I shall be with her every day when I go to town  I can have no exception  she says  when her brother is absent —Nor when he is present  I begin now to think   Lord help me  my dear  I must be so very careful of my ponctilio —No  thought I  in the true spirit of prudery  I will not go to Sir Charles s house for the world  And why  Because he is a single man  and because I think of something—that he perhaps has no notion of  But now I may go and visit his sister without scruple  may I not  For he perhaps thinks only of his Clementina—And is not this a charming difficulty got over  Lucy —But  as I said  I will soon be with you   I told Miss Grandison that I would  just now—Lovers  said she  are the weakest people in the world  and people of punctilio the most un  punctilious—You have not talked till now of going in such an hurry  Would you have it thought that you stayed in town for a particular reason  and  when that ceased  valued nobody else  She held up her finger—Consider  said she   There is something in this  Lucy  Yet what can I do   But Dr  Bartlett says  he shall soon give me another Letter   Farewel  my Dear     236  LETTER XXIV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Wednesday  Mar  29   SIR Charles came hither this morning  time enough to breakfast with us   Lady L  is not an early riser  I am sure this brother of hers is  So is Miss Grandison  If I say I am  my Lucy  I will not allow you to call it boasting  because you will  by so calling it  acknowlege Early rising to be a virtue  and if you thought it such  I am sure you would distinguish it by your practice  Forgive me  my dear  This is the only point in which you and I have differed—And why have I in the main so patiently suffered this difference  and not tried to teaze you out of it  Because my Lucy always so well employs her time when she is alive  But would not one the more wish that well employed life to be made as long as possible   I endeavoured to be very chearful at breakfast  but I believe my behaviour was aukward  and affected  After Sir Charles was gone  on my putting the question to the two sisters  Whether it was not so  they acquitted me—Yet my heart  when in his company  laboured with a sense of constraint   My pride made me want to find out pity for me in his looks and behaviour  on purpose to quarrel with him in my mind  for I could not get out of my head that degrading surmise  that he had permitted Dr  Bartlett to hasten to me the history of Clementina  in order generously to check any hopes that I might entertain  before they had too strongly taken hold of my foolish heart   But nothing of this was discoverable  Respect  tender respect  appeared  as the Ladies afterwards took   237 notice  in every word  when he addressed himself to me  in every look that he cast upon me   He studiously avoided speaking of the Bologna family  We were not indeed any of us fond of leading to the subject   I am sure  I pitied him   Pity  my dear  is a softer passion  I dare say
