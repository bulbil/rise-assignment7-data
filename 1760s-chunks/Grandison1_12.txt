she supposes he will  now he has married Ellen  as soon as a good Inn offers  James may supply Oliver s place  and the new servant may continue mine instead of James   And now that I have gone so low  don t you wish me to put an end to this Letter —I believe you do   Well then  with Duty and Love  ever remembred where so justly due  believe me to be  my dear Lucy   Your truly affectionate HARRIET BYRON   I will write separately to what you say of Mr  Greville  Mr  Fenwick  and Miss Orme  yet hope to be time enough for the post   LETTER VI  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Sat  Jan  28   AS to what you say of Mr  Greville s concern on my absence  and  I think  with a little too much feeling for him  and of his declaring himself unable to live without seeing me  I have but one fear about it  which is  that he is forming a pretence from his Violent Love  to come up after me  And if he does  I will not see him  if I can help it   And do you indeed believe him to be so much in Love  By your seriousness on the occasion  you seem to think he is  O my Lucy  What a good heart you have  And did he not weep when he told you so  Did he not turn his head away  and pull out his handkerchief —O these dissemblers  The hyaena  my dear  was a male devourer  The men in malice  and to extenuate their own guilt  made the creature   26 a female  And yet there may be male and female of this species of monsters  But as women have more to lose with regard to reputation than men  the male hyaena must be infinitely the more dangerous creature of the two  since he will come to us  even into our very houses  fawning  cringing  weeping  licking our hands  while the den of the female is by the highwayside  and wretched youths must enter into it  to put it in her power to devour them   Let me tell you  my dear  that if there be an artful man in England  with regard to us women  artful equally in his free speaking  and in his sycophancies  Mr  Greville is the man  And he intends to be so too  and values himself upon his art  Does he not as boldly as constantly insinuate  That flattery is dearer to a woman than her food  Yet who so gross a flatterer as himself  when the humour is upon him  And yet at times he wants to build up a merit for sincerity or plain dealing  by saying free things   It is not difficult  my dear  to find out these men  were we earnest to detect them  Their chief strength lies in our weakness  But however weak we are  I think we should not add to the triumph of those who make our weakness the general subject of their satire  We should not prove the justice of their ridicule by our own indiscretions  But the traitor is within us  If we guard against ourselves  we may bid defiance to all the arts of man   You know  that my great objection to Mr  Greville is for his immoralities  A man of free principles  shewn by practices as free  can hardly make a tender husband  were a woman able to get over considerations that she ought not to get over  Who shall trust for the performance of his second duties  the man who avowedly despises his first  Mr  Greville had a good education  He must have taken pains to render vain the pious precepts of his worthy father  and still more  to make a jest of them     27 Three of his women we have heard of  besides her whom he brought with him from Wales  You know he has only affected to appear decent  since he has cast his eyes upon me  The man  my dear  must be an abandoned man  and must have a very hard heart  who can pass from woman to woman  without any remorse for a former  whom  as may be supposed  he has by the most solemn vows seduced  And whose leavings is it  my dear  that a virtuous woman takes  who marries a profligate   Is it not reported  that his Welshwoman  to whom  at parting  he gave not sufficient for a twelvemonth s scanty subsistence  is now upon the town  Vile man  He thinks it to his credit  I have heard  to own it a seduction  and that she was not a vicious creature till he made her so   One only merit has Mr  Greville to plead in this black transaction  It is  That he has  by his whole conduct in it  added a warning to our Sex  And shall I  despising the warning  marry a man  who  specious as he is in his temper  and lively in his conversation  has shewn so bad a nature   His fortune  as
