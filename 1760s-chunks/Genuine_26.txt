 from some gentlemen  requesting his company at a neighbouring tavern  where they were in company with some young ladies of Covent Garden  with whom they intended to pass the night  His lordship obeyed the summons  and gave the maid half a guinea  telling her not to mention to any one what she had seen pass between Miss ELLIOT and him   The all prevailing metal  had not however sufficient influence over her  to make her observe his lordship s injunctions  She could not help telling what she had seen as a secret to a fellow servant  who told it to another  and thus in a few days  it was known to all the domestics of his lordship s family     124His lordship had  not long before  ordered one of his footmen to be discharged for a trivial offence  of which in reality he had not been guilty  but which  through the malice of the steward  had been laid to his charge  This fellow  who now went to the house where his former master lived  hearing of the affair  resolved  out of a principle of revenge  to acquaint his lady with it  which he found means to do by her woman  who informed her lady with all the particulars  This account was far from being pleasing to her  however  that she might not be thought to credit a false report  she resolved to watch his lordship s motions very narrowly  and had her spies abroad  who kept a constant eye on all his proceedings   One day her spies brought her word  that her lord was engaged with some company to go to Ranelagh  she took the hint  and disguising herself  went thither also  She had not been long there before she saw her husband in an arbour with Miss ELLIOT  and placing herself in a convenient spot  where she could see all that passed without being perceived  she beheld   125 them in a posture which soon convinced her that she had no reason to discredit the report she had heard  She instantly quitted the gardens  and returned home  firmly resolved to let his lordship know  that she was not unacquainted with his dishonourable treatment of her   She was  however  mistaken in the execution of her design  as he did not come home till three days after  having been all that time at a bagnio with his mistress  whose other lover happened to be gone for a fortnight into the country for his health  having lately been ill of a fever   When his lordship returned  his lady received him very coolly  at which  being unable to guess the cause  he was greatly surprised  He seemed  however  not to take any notice   till the time of retiring to rest being come  her ladyship refused to lie with him  and it was some time before she would consent to tell him the reason of her acting in that manner  She at last discovered to him all she knew of his intrigue with Miss ELLIOT  and how she had ocular proof of their intimacy   126 from what she had seen in Ranelagh gardens  She then reproached him in the severest terms for his meanness of soul  which had suffered him to abandon his wife  who was a lady of quality  for the embraces of a harlot  with many other things of the like sort   His lordship after having in vain endeavoured to extenuate his crime  frankly owned his guilt  on condition that his lady should never reproach him for it  this she generously promised  provided he also promised never to see Miss ELLIOT more  to which he gave his word of honour he never would  and his future conduct plainly shewed that he spoke truth   N—nois  who had never received the least item of Miss ELLIOT s amour with the lord H—h  grew every day more and more fond of her  He lavished away so much money on her  that she was reckoned one of the richest of all the trading ladies in London  She continued to pay her sister s pension very constantly  and having informed her keeper of her sister s former state of indigence    127 and of the allowance she gave her  he out of his generosity settled fifty pound a year more on her during life  which made her income an hundred pounds a year  which  as she was in a cheap country enabled her to live like a woman of rank and fortune   The duke now received orders from his court to depart from England  where he had been minister plenipotentiary for several years  He proposed to our heroine to go along with him  which she complied with  and Paris opened to her a new scene of adventures  which were at the same time both serious and comical  tho  she never embarked  as has been already observed  in any intrigue so as to leave her keeper  with whom she continued till his death  which happened about a year after he was recalled to his native country   The first adventures she met with was in the Thuilleries  where she one day  soon after her arrival  met with a German count  named CZATORISKI  He very politely saluted her  and seeing she was a stranger  desired leave to accompany
