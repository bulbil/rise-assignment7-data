him with the terms to which he had subscribed the preceding year  in all respects less honourable and advantageous to his country  Inconsistencies equally glaring and absurd he had often crammed down the throats of the multitude  but they would not go down with this assembly of the people  which  in spite of his flannel  his night caps  his crutches  and his groans  confirmed the treaty of peace by a great majority  Not that they had any great reason to applaud the peace makers  who might have dictated their own terms  had they proceeded with more sagacity and less precipitation  But Fokh sirokhu   146 and his brother undertakers  having the treasure of Japan at their command  had anointed the greatest part of the assembly with a certain precious salve  which preserved them effectually from the fascinating arts of Taycho   This Orator  incensed at his bad success within doors  renewed and redoubled his operations without  He exasperated Legion aganst Yak strot to such a pitch of rage  that the monster could not hear the Cuboy s name three times pronounced without falling into fits  His confederate Lob kob  in the course of his researches  found out two originals admirably calculated for executing his vengeance against the Ximian favourite  One of them  called Llurchir  a profligate Bonze  degraded for his lewd life  possessed a wonderful talent of exciting different passions in the blatant beast  by dint   147 of quaint rhimes  which were said to be inspirations of the daemon of obloquy  to whom he had sold his soul  These oracles not only commanded the passions  but even influenced the organs of the beast in such a manner  as to occasion an evacuation either upwards or downwards  at the pleasure of the operator  The other  known by the name of Jan ki dtzin  was counted the best marksman in Japan in the art and mystery of dirt throwing  He possessed the art of making balls of filth  which were famous for sticking and stinking  and these he threw with such dexterity  that they very seldom missed their aim  Being reduced to a low ebb of fortune by his debaucheries  he had made advances to the new Cuboy  who had rejected his proffered services  on account of his immoral character  a prudish punctilio  which but ill became Yak strot  who had payed very little regard   148 to reputation in choosing some of the colleagues he had associated in his administration  Be that as it may  he no sooner understood that Mr  Orator Taycho was busy in preparing for an active campaign  than he likewise began to put himself in a posture of defence  He hired a body of mercenaries  and provided some dirt men and rhymers  Then  taking the field  a sharp contest and pelting match ensued  but the dispute was soon terminated  Yak strot s versifiers turned out no great conjurers  on the trial  They were not such favourites of the daemon as Llur chir  The rhimes they used  produced no other effect upon Legion  but that of setting it a braying  The Cuboy s dirt men  however  played their parts tolerably well  Though their balls were inferior in point of composition to those of Jan ki dtzin  they did not fail to discompose Orator Taycho and   149 his friend Lob kob  whose eyes were seen to water with the smart occasioned by those missiles  but these last had a great advantage over their adversaries  in the zeal and attachment of Legion  whose numerous tongues were always ready to lick off the ordure that stuck to any part of their leaders  and this they did with such signs of satisfaction  as seemed to indicate an appetite for all manner of filth   Yak strot having suffered wosully in his own person  and seeing his partisans in confusion  thought proper to retreat  Yet  although discomfited  he was not discouraged  On the contrary  having at bottom a fund of fanaticism which  like camomile  grows the faster for being trod upon  he became more obstinately bent than ever upon prosecuting his own schemes for the good of the people in their own despite  His   150 vanity was likewise buoyed up by the flattery of his creatures  who extolled the passive courage he had shewn in the late engagement  Tho  every part of him still tingled and stunk from the balls of the enemy  he persuaded himself that not one of their missiles had taken place  and of consequence  that there was something of divinity in his person  Full of this notion  he discarded his rhymsters and his dirt casters as unnecessary  and resolved to bear the brunt of the battle in his own individual   Fokh si rokhu advised him  nevertheless  to fill his trowsers with gold Obans  which he might throw at Legion in case of necessity  assuring him that this was the only ammunition which the monster could not withstand  The advice was good  and the Cuboy might have followed it  without being obliged to the treasury of Japan  for he was by this   151 time become immensely rich  in consequence of having found a hoard in digging his garden  but this was an expedient which Yak strot could never be prevailed upon to use  either on this or any other occasion  Indeed  he was
