22 15  3 45 PM   an explanation from you  sir  or  by hell and brimstone  I shall expect  other sort of satisfaction   Peregrine  whose blood by this time boiled  within him  answered without hesitation   Far from thinking your demand  unreasonable  I will immediately explain myself without reserve  and  tell you  that  upon unquestionable authority  I believe you to be an  impudent rascal and common cheat    The Hector was so amazed and confounded at the freedom of this  declaration  which he thought no man on earth would venture to make in  his presence  that  for some minutes  he could not recollect himself   but at length whispered a challenge in the ear of our hero  which was  accordingly accepted  When they arrived next morning upon the field  the  gamester  arming his countenance with all its terrors  advanced with a  sword of a monstrous length  and  putting himself in a posture  called  out aloud in a most terrific voice   Draw  d  n ye  draw  I will this  instant send you to your fathers   The youth was not slow in complying  with his desire  his weapon was unsheathed in a moment  and he began  the attack with such unexpected spirit and address  that his adversary   having made shift with great difficulty to parry the first pass   retreated a few paces  and demanded a parley  in which he endeavoured  to persuade the young man  that to lay a man of his character under  the necessity of chastising his insolence  was the most rash and  inconsiderate step that he could possibly have taken  but that he had  compassion upon his youth  and was willing to spare him if he would  surrender his sword  and promise to ask pardon in public for the offence  he had given  Pickle was so much exasperated at this unparalleled  effrontery  that  without deigning to make the least reply  he flung  his own hat in the proposer s face  and renewed the charge with such  undaunted agility  that the gamester  finding himself in manifest  hazard of his life  betook himself to his heels  and fled homewards  with incredible speed  being closely pursued by Peregrine  who  having  sheathed his sword  pelted him with stones as he ran  and compelled him  to go  that same day  into banishment from Bath  where he had domineered  so long   By this achievement  which was the subject of astonishment to all the  company  who had looked upon the fugitive as a person of heroic  courage  our adventurer s reputation was rendered formidable in all  its circumstances  although he thereby disobliged a good many people of  fashion  who had contracted an intimacy of friendship with the exile   and who resented his disgrace  as if it had been the misfortune of  a worthy man  These generous patrons  however  bore a very small  proportion to those who were pleased with the event of the duel   because  in the course of their residence at Bath  they had either been  insulted or defrauded by the challenger  Nor was this instance of our  hero s courage unacceptable to the ladies  few of whom could now resist  the united force of such accomplishments  Indeed  neither he nor  his friend Godfrey would have found much difficulty in picking up an  agreeable companion for life  but Gauntlet s heart was pre engaged  to Sophy  and Pickle  exclusive of his attachment to Emily  which was  stronger than he himself imagined  possessed such a share of ambition  as could not be satisfied with the conquest of any female he beheld at  Bath   His visits were  therefore  promiscuous  without any other view than  that of amusement  and though his pride was flattered by the advances  of the fair  whom he had captivated  he never harboured one thought of    6 22 15  3 45 PM   proceeding beyond the limits of common gallantry  and carefully avoided  all particular explanations  But  what above all other enjoyments  yielded him the most agreeable entertainment  was the secret history of  characters  which he learned from a very extraordinary person  with whom  he became acquainted in this manner   Being at the house of a certain lady on a visiting day  he was struck  with the appearance of an old man  who no sooner entered the room than  the mistress of the house very kindly desired one of the wits present to  roast the old put  This petit maitre  proud of the employment  went up  to the senior  who had something extremely peculiar and significant  in his countenance  and saluting him with divers fashionable congees   accosted him in these words   Your servant  you old rascal  I hope to  have the honour of seeing you hanged  I vow to Gad  you look extremely  shocking  with these gummy eyes  lanthorn jaws  and toothless chaps   What  you squint at the ladies  you old rotten medlar  Yes  yes  we
