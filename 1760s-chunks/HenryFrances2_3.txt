 I had one comfortable Reflection  which will henceforward take off greatly from the Shock  which Executions of this Kind give to the humane Mind  That few of such Creatures ever reclaim of themselves  but  proceeding in a Series of Iniquities  die without Repentance  In this the executed Malefactor has a great Advantage above the Rogue who escapes  The condemned Man has that Benefit which the Psalmist prays for so emphatically    Teach me  O Lord  so to number my Days  that I may apply my Heart unto Wisdom   And I think  that the highest Crimes  sincerely repented of  shall meet more Favour in the next World  than lesser Offences  unattoned by Sorrow and Contrition  I shall pursue these Gallows Meditations no farther  but only observe to you  the powerful Effect of this great Salvo of Repentance  towards the perfect Quietism of a Mind  the least imbued with Religion  though untutored by Philosophy  in the Instance of Johnson  this Day  who  just before he mounted the Ladder  declared he would not change his present Situation with any Man in the World     I am   my dearest Fanny   Sincerely your s   Page  10  LETTER CLXXXIV   Dear FANNY   I AM  at present  sitting in the midst of a large Field of Barley  which I reaped the other Day  and am taking Care of the Binders and Stackers  There are forty seven Women  and fourteen Men  at Work round about me  while I am reading Pliny  and writing to you   I think Lord Orrery s Comment upon the seventh Epistle is extremely fine  The eighth Epistle of Pliny has a great Nobleness of Sentiment  and a particular Justness of Thought  I love the fine Struggle between natural Vanity  and the Contempt of Praise  which is obvious through the whole Letter  It may be Stoicism  if you please  but I never will admit any Pretence to Virtue to be true Heroism  which seems to be above human Nature   till it has first shewn its Strife with the Frailties of it  The ninth Epistle was always a Favourite of mine  But there was a Note I expected from Lord Orrery upon this Passage    Thou art almost preferable    c  There is no Doubt but Pliny  if he had consulted his own Taste and Inclinations  would have left out that Adverb  and put in omnino  or altogether  But the Philosophers Page  11 were obliged to speak of the tranquil Joys of retired Contemplation  and learned Leisure  with some Caution and Reserve  either because the Antients had so often spoken  and written  in such Raptures of these Pleasures  that the World had got into a Kind of Enthusiasm  which alarmed Governments and States  and the more particularly for this Reason  that those Men  who are fittest for the World  are most fond of retiring from it  or else Pliny moderated his ecstatic Soliloquy  because he could not think a Man  who was retired from all Business  could be quite so virtuous  or  at least  capable of exercising so much Virtue  as one who employed himself in the Affairs of this World  for some Part of the Duty of a Man  born a social Creature  must be neglected     In the Comment upon the tenth Epistle  there is poetical Wit in the Allusion to Ajax s Shield  There is an Expression in the same Comment  which I think exceptionable  Speaking of the young Men among the Romans  he calls them Gentlemen  which  being a modern Phrase  is improperly applied  when we are speaking of the Antients   The Observations upon the eleventh Epistle are very pretty  and very just  and please me particularly  because they flatter me about a Sentiment you may remember of mine  that   Page  12 Absence to Friends  like Death to Enemies  buries every Fault  and enlivens every Virtue     In the last Paragraph of the Comment upon the 20th Epistle  there is a good deal of Wit and Justness in the Simile of Lightning  There is also something extremely pretty in the Annotation to the second Epistle of the second Book  in the Allusion to the Flux and Reflux of the Sea  The sixth Epistle of the same Book pleases me much  I have been always offended  when I have seen such improper and paltry Distinctions at very good Tables  which I have often done  and always made it a Rule with myself  to take Part with the despised Guest  which has sometimes had the proper Effect upon the Entertainer   I received your Letter  with Lady — s inclosed  and am much obliged to her for remembering me  which it seems she does  by mentioning Lord —  I know already  that I am not to expect any thing from her Kindness  in that Particular  for I mentioned to you before Mr  — s Answer to my Letter  on that Head  Now  as I have a Way of profiting something from every Disappointment in Life  I shall  from this  have the Satisfaction of feeling the grateful Sense of Lady — s Patronage  pure and unmixed  for the Friendship she
