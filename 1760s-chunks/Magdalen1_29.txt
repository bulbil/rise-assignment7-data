greatly culpable  and it is with infinite concern I reflect on the anxiety which my misbehaviour has already produced—What more can I either say or do  An altercation between you and I is much more likely to encrease the general unhappiness of our friends than to remove it  You know  that  should it even be my lot to fall in this altercation  neither your house nor your sister can be benefitted by that circumstance  whereas  on the contrary  should you be unsuccessful  both must naturally experience an   173 addition of the most exquisite distress —Do me the justice  colonel Mildmay  to believe  that this expostulation is not the result of timidity—I have already injured your house  and it must be the most pressing necessity indeed which can oblige me to run even the hazard of aggravating my fault —Do not  therefore  by indulging an injudicious warmth  either prevent me from the possibility of making a reparation  or expose your family to the hazard of new misfortunes  Happiness is yet within our reach  and it must be very much your fault if it is snatched from our hands     This long harangue  Charles  I pronounced with an uncommon degree of temper  but I could easily see that it had little effect upon colonel Mildmay  full of that ridiculous sort of honour which is above listening to reason  he   174 endeavoured to break in upon me several times  and  when I had done  instead of moderating his passion  he rather seemed to give it an additional force  swearing that  though a cool hypocritical speech might silence the resentment of his sister  he was not to be duped from his purpose by the most specious plausibilities  but would vindicate the honour of his family  and proceed instantly to the necessary means of redress    And pray  colonel   says I    how do you purpose to obtain this redress    Purpose   returned he shortly   as a man of honour—Be pleased to stay for me but two minutes and you shall be more fully satisfied   So saying  he ran down stairs to his chariot  which was all the time waiting at the door  and took out a case of pistols   for I could see every thing distinctly through the window   These   175 he concealed under a surtout  which he had on  and coming up with a lightning like expedition  to the room in which he left me  entered and bolted the door  Having done thus  he marched up directly to me  and swore  with a determined energy of execration  that  unless I instantly accepted of one  and stood upon my defence  he would  without any farther ceremony  shoot me through the head  All this time  Charles  I kept my temper with a stoicism that that was really astonishing— Colonel   says I  as he pronounced the last menace   consider that you have a man before you who is not easily intimidated  but who  as he wishes to repair  instead of aggravating injuries  is willing to overlook the insults which you have offered him  and to embrace you as a brother and a friend —For your sister s sake  Sir  consider   — Damnation seize my sister   interrupted   176 he  wildly   it is not her honour which I want to vindicate  but my own—She is an infamous strumpet  and you are a cowardly  hypocritical scoundrel—take the pistol  Sir —this moment take it and defend yourself  for  by all that s holy  if you hesitate another instant  I will anticipate the justice of the gibbet  and rid the world of as great a villain as ever dishonoured it   This language  Charles  was no longer to be borne  the scandalous epithet with which he had branded poor Louisa  and the brutality of insolence with which he treated all my concessions  entirely destroyed my fortitude  so that now forgetting every consideration  I snatched the pistol out of his hand  and retiring to a space  which he himself had pointed out  I fired  and wounded him so dangerously in the groin  that he instantly fell upon the floor  discharging his pistol  however  as he fell  the contents   177 of which just drew a little blood from my ear  but did me no farther injury  unless burning a curl of the side hair may be termed an injury to a fellow so fond of dressing as your humble servant     I ran to the colonel the moment I saw him down  and offered him every assistance in my power  but he was now in a manner frantic  the anguish of his wound  and the mortification of finding I had come off so easily  threw him into an extravagant passion  and he raved at me  his sister  and his own unexecuting hand  with all the fury of an implacable resentment  and a disappointed revenge  disclaiming every consolation which I was capable of offering  and swearing he would still pursue me to the utmost confines of the world till he had sacrificed me to the manes of his murdered reputation  Finding him in this temper    178 and knowing that the sooner I provided for my own safety the
