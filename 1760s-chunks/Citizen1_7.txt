  WHETHER sporting on the flowery banks of the river Irtis  or scaling the steepy mountains of Douchenour  Whether traversing the black deserts of Kobi  or giving lessons of politeness to the savage inhabitants of Europe  In whatever country  whatever climate  and whatever circumstances  all hail  May Tien  the universal soul  take you under his protection  and inspire you with a superior portion of himself   How long  my friend  shall an enthusiasm for knowlege continue to obstruct your happiness  and tear you from all the connexions that make life pleasing  How long will you continue to rove from climate to climate  circled by thousands  and yet without a friend  feeling all the inconveniencies of a croud  and all the anxiety of being alone   I know you will reply  that the refined pleasure of growing every day wiser  is a sufficient recompence for every inconvenience  I know you will talk of the vulgar satisfaction of soliciting happiness from sensual enjoyment only  and probably enlarge upon the exquisite raptures of sentimental bliss  Yet  believe me  friend  you are deceived  all our pleasures  though seemingly never so remote from sense  derive their origin from some one of the senses  The most exquisite demonstration in mathematics  or the most pleasing disquisition in metaphysics  if it does not ultimately tend to   21•ncrease some sensual satisfaction  is delightful only •o fools  or to men who have by long habit con•racted a false idea of pleasure  and he who sepa•ates sensual and sentimental enjoyments  seeking •appiness from mind alone  is in fact as wretched •s the naked inhabitant of the forest  who places •ll happiness in the first  regardless of the latter  There are two extremes in this respect  the sa•age who swallows down the draught of pleasure without staying to reflect on his happiness  and •he sage who passeth the cup while he reflects on •he conveniencies of drinking   IT is with an heart full of sorrow  my dear Altangi  that I must inform you that what the world calls happiness must now be yours no longer  Our great emperor s displeasure at your leaving China  contrary to the rules of our government  and the immemorial custom of the empire  has produced the most terrible effects  Your wife  daughter  and the rest of your family have been seized by his order  and appropriated to his use  all except your son are now the peculiar property of him who possesses all  him I have hidden from the officers employed for this purpose  and even at the hazard of my life I have concealed him  The youth seems obstinately bent on finding you out  whereever you are  he is determined to face every danger that opposes his pursuit  Though yet but fifteen  all his father s virtues and obstinacy sparkle in his eyes  and mark him as one destined to no mediocrity of fortune   You see  my dearest friend  what imprudence has brought thee to  from opulence  a tender family  surrounding friends  and your master s esteem  it has reduced thee to want  persecution    22 and still worse  to our mighty monarch s displeasure  Want of prudence is too frequently the want of virtue  nor is there on earth a more powerful advocate for vice than poverty  As I shall endeavour to guard thee from the one  so guard thyself from the other  and still think of me with affection and esteem  Farewell   LETTER VII  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   The Editor thinks proper to acquaint the reader  that the greatest part of the following letter seems to him to be little more than a rhapsody of sentences borrowed from Confucius  the Chinese philosopher   A Wife  a daughter carried into captivity to expiate my offence  a son scarce yet arrived at maturity  resolving to encounter every danger in the pious pursuit of one who has undone him  these indeed are circumstances of distress  tho  my tears were more precious than the gem of Golconda  yet would they fall upon such an occasion   But I submit to the stroke of heaven  I hold the volume of Confucius in my hand  and as I read grow humble and patient  and wise  We should feel sorrow  says he  but not sink under its oppression  the heart of a wise man should resemble a mirrour  which reflects every object without being sullied by any  The wheel of fortune turns incessantly round  and who can say within himself I shall to day be uppermost  We should hold the immutable mean that lies between insensibility and   23 anguish  our attempts should be not to extinguish nature  but to repress it  not to stand unmoved at distress  but endeavour to turn every disaster to our own advantage  Our greatest glory is  not in never falling  but in rising every time we fall   I fancy myself at present  O thou reverend disciple of Tao  more than a match for all that can happen  the chief business of my life has been to procure wisdom  and the chief object of that wisdom was to be happy  My attendance on your lectures  my conferences with the missionaries of Europe
