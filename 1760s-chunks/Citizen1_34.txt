first entrance into the busy and insidious world  one of those gladiators who were exposed without armour in the amphitheatre at Rome  My father  however  who had only seen the world on one side  seemed to triumph in my superior discernment  though my whole stock of wisdom consisted in being able to talk like himself upon subjects that once were useful  because they were then topics of the busy world  but that now were utterly useless  because connected with the busy world no longer   The first opportunity he had of finding his expectations disappointed  was at the very middling figure I made in the university  he had flattered himself that he should soon see me rising into the foremost rank in literary reputation  but was mortified to find me utterly unnoticed and unknown  His disappointment might have been partly ascribed to his having over rated my talents  and partly to my dislike of mathematical reasonings at a time  when my imagination and memory yet unsatisfied  were more eager after new objects  than desirous of reasoning upon those I knew  This did not  however  please my tutors  who observed  indeed  that I was a little dull  but at the same time allowed  that I seemed to be very good natured  and had no harm in me     106After I had resided at college seven years  my father died  and left me—his blessing  Thus shoved from shore without ill nature to protect  or cunning to guide  or proper stores to subsist me in so dangerous a voyage  I was obliged to embark in the wide world at twenty two But  in order to settle in life  my friends advised  for they always advise when they begin to despise us  they advised me  I say  to go into orders   To be obliged to wear a long wig  when I liked a short one  or a black coat  when I generally dressed in brown  I thought was such a restraint upon my liberty  that I absolutely rejected the proposal  A priest in England  is not the same mortified creature with a bonze in China  with us  not he that fasts best  but eats best  is reckoned the best liver  yet I rejected a life of luxury  indolence  and ease  from no no other consideration but that boyish one of dress  So that my friends were now perfectly satisfied I was undone  and yet they thought it a pity for one who had not the least harm in him  and was so very good natured   Poverty naturally begets dependance  and I was admitted as flatterer to a great man  At first I was surprised  that the situation of a flatterer at a great man s table could be thought disagreeable  there was no great trouble in listening attentively when his lordship spoke  and laughing when he looked round for applause  This even good manners might have obliged me to perform  I found  however  too soon  that his lordship was a greater dunce than myself  and from that very moment my power of flattery was   107 at an end  I now rather aimed at setting him right  than at receiving his absurdities with submission  to flatter those we do not know is an easy task  but to flatter our intimate acquaintances  all whose foibles are strongly in our eye  is drudgery insupportable  Every time I now opened my lips in praise  my falshood went to my conscience  his lordship soon perceived me to be unfit for service  I was therefore discharged  my patron at the same time being graciously pleased to observe  that he believed I was tolerably good natured  and had not the least harm in me   Disappointed in ambition I had recourse to love  A young lady  who lived with her aunt  and was possessed of a pretty fortune in her own disposal  had given me  as I fancied  some reasons to expect success  The symptoms by which I was guided were striking  she had always laughed with me at her aukward acquaintance  and at her aunt among the number  she always observed  that a man of sense would make a better husband than a fool  and I as constantly applied the observation in my own favour  She continually talked in my company of friendship and the beauties of the mind  and spoke of Mr  Shrimp my rival s high heel d shoes with detestation  These were circumstances which I thought strongly in my favour  so after resolving  and re resolving  I had courage enough to tell her my mind  Miss heard my proposal with serenity  seeming at the same time to study the figures of her fan  Out at last it came  There was but one small objection to complete our happiness  which was no more  than—that   108 she was married three months before to Mr▪ Shrimp with high heel d shoes  By way of consolation however she observed  that tho  I was disappointed in her  my addresses to her aunt would probably kindle her into sensibility  as the old lady always allowed me to be very good natured  and not to have the least share of harm in me   Yet still I had friends  numerous friends  and to them I was resolved to apply
