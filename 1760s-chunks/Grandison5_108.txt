an adventure—A prisoner to a Lady in her castle —She is certainly one of the most enterprising women in Italy  and her temper is too well seconded by her power  She would not  however  in that case  have had recourse to fatal acts of violence  Once  you know  she had thoughts of exciting against me the Holy Tribunal  But I was upon such a foot  as a traveller  and as an English Protestant  tho  avowed  not behaving indiscreetly  that I had friends enow  even in the Sacred College  to have rendered ineffectual any steps of that sort  And after all  her machinations were but transitory ones  and  the moment she saw me  given over   My first enquiry  after my arrival here  was after my poor cousin Grandison  My poor cousin  indeed  What a spiritless figure does he make  I remember you once said  That it was more difficult for a man to behave well in prosperity  than in adversity  But the man who will prove the observation to be true  must not be one  who  by his own extravagance and vice  has reduced himself  from an affluence to which he was born  to penury  at least to a state of obligation and dependence  Good God  that a man should be so infatuated  as to put on the cast of a dye  the estate of which he is in unquestioned possession from his ancestors  Yet who will say  that he who hopes to win what belongs to another  does not deserve to lose his own   I soothed my cousin in the best manner I could  consistently with justice  Yet I told him  that his repentance must arise from his judgment  as well as from his sufferings  and that he would have less reason for regretting Page  270 the unhappy situation to which he had reduced himself  if the latter brought him to a right sense of his errors  I was solicitous  Dr  Bartlett  for the sake of his own peace of mind  that he should fall into a proper train of thinking  But I told him  that preachment was no more my intention  than recrimination   I have two hands to one tongue  my cousin  said I  and the latter I use not but to tell you  that both the former are cordially at your service  You have considered this matter well  no doubt  added I  Can you propose to me any means of retrieving your affairs   There is  said he  one way  It would do everything for me  But I am afraid of mentioning it to you   If it be a just way  fear not  If it be any thing I can do for you  out of my own single purse  without asking any second or third person to contribute to it  command me—He hesitated   If it be any thing  my cousin  said I  that you think I ought not  in justice  in honour  to comply with  do not  for your own sake  mention it  Let me see that your calamity has had a proper effect upon you  Let not the just man be sunk in the man in adversity  and then open your mind freely to me   He could not  he said  trust the mention of the expedient to me  till he had given it a further consideration   Well  Sir  be pleased to remember  that I will never ask you to mention it  because I cannot doubt but you will  if  on consideration  you think it a proper expedient   When some friends  who came to visit me on my arrival  were gone  my cousin resumed the former subject  But he offered not to mention his expedient  I hope it was not  that he had a view to my Emily  I am very jealous for my Emily  If I thought poor Everard had but an imagination of retrieving his affairs Page  271 by her fortune  nothing but his present calamity should hinder me from reneuncing for ever my cousin   I enquired particularly into the situation he was in  and if there were a likelihood of doing any thing with the gamesters  But he could not give me room for such an expectation  I find he has lost all his estate to them  Dunton farm excepted  which  having been much out of repair  is now fitting up for a new tenant  and will not  for three or four years to come  bring him in a clear fifty pounds a year   I have known more men than one  who could not live upon fifteen hundred a year  bring themselves to be contented with fifty  But Mr  Grandison is so fallen in spirit  that he never will be able to survive such a change of fortune  if I do not befriend him  Poor man  he is but the shadow of what he was  The first formerly in the fashion  In body and face so erect  his steps so firm  gait so assured  air so genteel  eye so lively—But now  in so few months  gaunt sides  his half worn tarnish d laced coat  big enough to lap over
