a certain person  not one   word of which is now mentioned  and upon my being in that strange manner   run away with  and still kept here a miserable prisoner  do you think    sir   pardon your poor servant s freedom  my fears make me bold  do you   think  I say   that your general assurances of honour to me  can have   the effect upon me  that  were it not for these things  all your words   ought to have   O  good sir  I too much apprehend that your notions of   honour and mine are very different from one another  and I have no other   hopes but in your continued absence  If you have any proposals to make   me  that are consistent with your honourable professions  in my humble   sense of the word  a few lines will communicate them to me  and I will   return such an answer as befits me  But  oh  What proposals can one in   your high station have to make to one in my low one  I know what belongs   to your degree too well  to imagine  that any thing can be expected but   sad temptations  and utter distress  if you come down  and you know not    sir  when I am made desperate  what the wretched Pamela dares to do        Whatever rashness you may impute to me  I cannot help it  but I wish   I may not be forced upon any  that otherwise would never enter into my   thoughts  Forgive me  sir  my plainness  I should be loath to behave to   my master unbecomingly  but I must needs say  sir  my innocence is so   dear to me  that all other considerations are  and  I hope  shall ever   be  treated by me as niceties  that ought  for that  to be dispensed   with  If you mean honourably  why  sir  should you not let me know it   plainly  Why is it necessary to imprison me  to convince me of it  And   why must I be close watched  and attended  hindered from stirring out    from speaking to any body  from going so much as to church to pray for   you  who have been  till of late  so generous a benefactor to me  Why    sir  I humbly ask  why all this  if you mean honourably   It is not for   me to expostulate so freely  but in a case so near to me  with you  sir    so greatly my superior  Pardon me  I hope you will  but as to seeing   you  I cannot bear the dreadful apprehension  Whatever you have to   propose  whatever you intend by me  let my assent be that of a free   person  mean as I am  and not of a sordid slave  who is to be threatened   and frightened into a compliance with measures  which your conduct to   her seems to imply would be otherwise abhorred by her   My restraint is   indeed hard upon me  I am very uneasy under it  Shorten it  I beseech   you  or  but I will not dare to say more  than that I am                                     Your greatly oppressed unhappy servant           After I had taken a copy of this  I folded it up  and Mrs  Jewkes    coming just as I had done  sat down by me  and said  when she saw me   direct it  I wish you would tell me if you have taken my advice  and   consented to my master s coming down  If it will oblige you  said I    I will read it to you  That s good  said she  then I ll love you   dearly   Said I  Then you must not offer to alter one word  I won t    replied she  So I read it to her  and she praised me much for my wording   it  but said she thought I pushed the matter very close  and it would   better bear talking of  than writing about  She wanted an explanation   or two  as about the proposal to a certain person  but I said  she   must take it as she heard it  Well  well  said she  I make no doubt you   understand one another  and will do so more and more  I sealed up the   letter  and she undertook to convey it          Sunday       For my part  I knew it in vain to expect to have leave to go
