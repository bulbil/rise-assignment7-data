stages of my happiness  because it will sink the   impression still deeper  and I shall have recourse to them for my better   regulation  as often as I shall mistrust my memory       Let me see  What are the rules I am to observe from this awful lecture    Why these          1  That I must not  when he is in great wrath with any body  break in   upon him without his leave  Well  I ll remember it  I warrant  But yet I   think this rule is almost peculiar to himself       2  That I must think his displeasure the heaviest thing that can befall   me  To be sure I shall       3  And so that I must not wish to incur it  to save any body else  I ll   be further if I do       4  That I must never make a compliment to any body at his expense       5  That I must not be guilty of any acts of wilful meanness  There is   a great deal meant in this  and I ll endeavour to observe it all  To be   sure  the occasion on which he mentions this  explains it  that I must   say nothing  though in anger  that is spiteful or malicious  that is   disrespectful or undutiful  and such like       6  That I must bear with him  even when I find him in the wrong  This is   a little hard  as the case may be       I wonder whether poor Miss Sally Godfrey be living or dead       7  That I must be as flexible as the reed in the fable  lest  by   resisting the tempest  like the oak  I be torn up by the roots  Well    I ll do the best I can   There is no great likelihood  I hope  that   I should be too perverse  yet sure  the tempest will not lay me quite   level with the ground  neither       8  That the education of young people of condition is generally wrong    Memorandum  That if any part of children s education fall to my lot  I   never indulge and humour them in things that they ought to be restrained   in       9  That I accustom them to bear disappointments and control       10  That I suffer them not to be too much indulged in their infancy       11  Nor at school       12  Nor spoil them when they come home       13  For that children generally extend their perverseness from the nurse   to the schoolmaster  from the schoolmaster to the parents       14  And  in their next step  as a proper punishment for all  make their   ownselves unhappy       15  That undutiful and perverse children make bad husbands and wives    And  collaterally  bad masters and mistresses       16  That  not being subject to be controlled early  they cannot  when   married  bear one another       17  That the fault lying deep  and in the minds of each other  neither   will mend it       18  Whence follow misunderstandings  quarrels  appeals  ineffectual   reconciliations  separations  elopements  or  at best  indifference    perhaps  aversion   Memorandum  A good image of unhappy wedlock  in the   words YAWNING HUSBAND  and VAPOURISH WIFE  when together  But separate    both quite alive       19  Few married persons behave as he likes  Let me ponder this with awe   and improvement       20  Some gentlemen can compromise with their wives  for quietness sake    but he can t  Indeed I believe that s true  I don t desire he should       21  That love before marriage is absolutely necessary       22  That there are fewer instances of men s than women s loving better   after marriage  But why so  I wish he had given his reasons for this  I   fancy they would not have been to the advantage of his own sex       23  That a woman give her husband reason to think she prefers him before   all men  Well  to be sure this should be so       24  That if she would overcome  it must be by sweetness and   complaisance  that is  by yielding  he means  no doubt       25  Yet not such a slavish one neither  as should
