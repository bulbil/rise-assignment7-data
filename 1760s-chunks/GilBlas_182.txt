dinners more reduced it to that ignoble negative of number  We were each of us thinking  as the deuce would have it  of our mutual pleasures  without profiting in the least by those happy dispositions of ours for living at the expense of other folks  Want at last gave a keener edge to our wits  which indulgence had blunted  My dear Raphael  said Camilla  let us carry the war into the enemy s quarters  if you love me  for while we are as faithful as turtles  we are as foolish  and fall into our own snare  instead of laying it for the unwary  You may get into the head and heart of a rich widow  I may conjure myself into the good graces of some old nobleman  but as for this ridiculous fidelity  it brings no grist to the mill  Excellent Camilla  answered I  you are beforehand with me  I was going to make the very same proposal  It exactly meets my ideas  thou paragon of morality  Yes  the better to maintain our mutual fire  let us forage for substantial fuel  As good may always be extracted out of evil  those infidelities which are the bane of other loves  shall be the triumph of ours   On the basis of this treaty we took the field  At first  there was much cry but little wool  for we had no luck at finding cullies  Camilla met with no thing but pretty fellows  with vanity in their hearts  tinsel on their backs  and not a maravedi in their pockets  my ladies were all of a kidney to levy  rather than to pay contributions  As love left us in the lurch  we paid our devotions at the shrine of knavery  With the zeal of martyrs to a new religion  did we encounter the frowns of the civil power  whose myrmidons  as like the devil in their nature as their office  were ordered on the look out after us  but the alguazil  with all the good qualities of which the corregidor inherited the contraries  gave us time to make our escape out of Madrid  for the good of the trade and a small sum of money  We took the road to Valladolid  meaning to set up in that town  I rented a house for myself and Camilla  who passed for my sister  to avoid evil tongues  At first we kept a tight rein over our speculative talents  and began by reconnoitring the ground before we determined on our plan of operations   One day a man accosted me in the street  with a very civil salutation  to this effect    Signor Don Raphael  do you recollect my face  I answered in the negative  Then I have the advantage of you  replied he  for yours is perfectly familiar to me  I have seen you at the court of Tuscany  where I was then in the grand duke s guards  It is some months since I quitted that prince s service  I came into Spain with an Italian  who will not discredit the politics of his country  we have been at Valladolid these three weeks  Our residence is with a Castilian and a Galician  who are  without dispute  two of the best creatures in the world  We live together by the sweat of our brows  and the labour of our hands  Our fare is not abstemious  nor have we made any vow against the temptations of a life about the court If you will make one of our party  my brethren will be glad of your company  for you always seemed to me a man of spirit  above all vulgar prejudices  in short  a monk of our order   Such frankness from this arch scoundrel was met half way by mine  Since you talk to me with so winning a candour  said I  you deserve that I should be equally explicit with you  In good truth I am no novice in your ritual  and if my modesty would allow me to be the hero of my own tale  you would be convinced that your compliments were not lavished on an unworthy subject  But enough of my own commendations  proceed we to the point in question  With all possible desire to become a member of your body  I shall neglect no opportunity of proving my title to that distinction  I had no sooner told this sharper at all points  that I would agree to swell the number of his gang  than he conducted me to their place of meeting  and introduced me in proper form  It was on this occasion that I first saw the renowned Ambrose de Lamela  These gentlemen catechised me in the religion of coveting my neighbour s goods  and doing as I would not be done by  They wanted to discern whether I played the villain on principle  or had only some little practical dexterity  but I shewed them tricks which they did not know to be on the cards  and yet acknowledged to be better than their own  They were still deeper lost in admiration  when in cool disdain of manual artifice  as an every day effort of ingenuity  I maintained my prowess in such combinations of roguery as require an inventive brain and a solid judgment to support them  In proof of these pretensions  I related
