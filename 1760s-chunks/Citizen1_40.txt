back into my own hands unopened    To the devil I pitch all the nobility  cries a little man  in a peculiar accent  I am sure they have of late used me most scurvily  You must know  gentlemen  some time ago  upon the arrival of a certain noble duke from his travels  I set myself down  and vamped up a fine flaunting  poetical panegyric  which I had written in such a   124 strain  that I fancied it would have even wheedled milk from a mouse  In this I represented the whole kingdom welcoming his grace to his native soil  not forgetting the loss France and Italy would sustain in their arts by his departure  I expected to touch for a bank bill at least  so folding up my verses in gilt paper  I gave my last half crown to a genteel servant to be the bearer  My letter was safely conveyed to his grace  and the servant after four hours absence  during which time I led the life of a fiend  returned with a letter four times as big as mine  Guess my extasy at the prospect of so fine a return  I eagerly took the pacquet into my hands  that trembled to receive it  I kept it some time unopened before me  brooding over the expected treasure it contained  when opening it  as I hope to be saved  gentlemen  his grace had sent me in payment for my poem no Bank bills  but six copies of verse  each longer than mine  addressed to him upon the same occasion     A nobleman  cries a member  who had hitherto been silent  is created as much for the confusion of us authors as the catch pole  I ll tell you a story  gentlemen  which is as true as that this pipe is made of clay  When I was delivered of my first book  I owed my taylor for a suit of cloaths  but that is nothing new  you know  and may be any man s case as well as mine  Well  owing him for a suit of cloaths  and hearing that my book took very well  he sent for his money  and insisted upon being paid immediately  though I was at that time rich in fame  for my book run like wild fire  yet I was very short in money  and being unable to satisfy his demand  prudently resolved to keep my chamber  preferring a prison of my own chusing   125 at home  to one of my taylor s chusing abroad  In vain the bailiffs used all their arts to decoy me from my citadel  in vain they sent to let me know that a gentleman wanted to speak with me at the next tavern  in vain they came with an urgent message from my aunt in the country  in vain I was told that a particular friend was at the point death  and desired to take his last farewell  I was deaf  insensible  rock  adamant  the bailiffs could make no impression on my hard heart  for I effectually kept my liberty by never stirring out of the room    This was very well for a fortnight  when one morning I received a most splendid message from the earl of Doomsday  importing  that he had read my book  and was in raptures with every line of it  he impatiently longed to see the author  and had some designs which might turn out greatly to my advantage  I paused upon the contents of this message  and found there could be no deceit  for the card was gilt at the edges  and the bearer  I was told  had quite the looks of a gentleman  Witness ye powers  how my heart triumphed at my own importance  I saw a long perspective of felicity before me  I applauded the taste of the times  which never saw genius forsaken  I had prepared a set introductory speech for the occasion  five glaring compliments for his lordship  and two more modest for myself  The next morning  therefore  in order to be punctual to my appointment  I took coach  and ordered the fellow to drive to the street and house mentioned in his lordship s address  I had the precaution to pull up the windows as I went along to keep off the busy part of mankind  and  big with expectation  fancied the   126 coach never went fast enough  At length  however  the wish d for moment of its stopping arrived  this for some time I impatiently expected  and letting down the door in a transport  in order to take a previous view of his lordship s magnificent palace and situation  I found poison to my sight  I found myself  not in an elegant street  but a paltry lane  not at a nobleman s door  but the door of a spunging house  I found the coachman had all this while been driving me to jail  and I saw the bailiff with a devil s face  coming out to secure me   To a philosopher  no circumstance  however trifling  is too minute  he finds instruction and entertainment in occurrences  which are passed over by the rest of mankind as low  trite  and indifferent  it is from the number of these particulars
