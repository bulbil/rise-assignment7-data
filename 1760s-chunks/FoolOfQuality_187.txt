cheek    c      Ah   how affectingly did her instrument answer to her voice  while   she gently turned her sighs to the soft and melancholy cadences    My breast was so swelled by a mixture of anguish and compassion    that I could no longer wholly suppress a rising groan  Hereat   she started and turned   and rising suddenly  her eyes shot fire  and   her face glowed with indignation and resentment  But  observing   the tears that still trickled down my cheeks  her countenance was   as suddenly changed into kindness  and she cast upon me a look   of inexpressible complacence          188 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Ah  Mr  Harry   says she  I see  I see that you have a gentle   and a kindred kind of heart   and that  if ever you happen to love    you will love with great tenderness  Have you ever loved    Mr  Harry  Indeed  madam  I cannot say  my commerce has   been very little among the ladies  If I met love on my way  or   even found it in my heart  perhaps I should not rightly know   what to make of it  But  my Matilda  my charming sister  your   father has honoured me with the privilege of calling you by that   dear  that tender name   why will you not intrust your best  your   truest friend with the secret of your disquiet   Whoever the object   of your esteem may be  I here solemnly engage  at the risk of my   life and the loss of my fortune  to bring him voluntarily to pay his   vows at your feet  O  my sister   I would to heaven that he had   now been present  as I have been present  to have his soul melted   and minted as mine has been   his heart must have been harder   than the stones of Thebes  if you did not attract it and move it at   pleasure  by the touch of those fingers  and the bewitchment of   those accents  Ah  you flatterer  she cried  with a voice tuned   to harmony  and a face formed of smiles  you almost tempt me to   tell you what  for the world  I would not wish that any one in the   world should know  But I must snatch myself from the danger    So saying  and casting at me a vanishing glance  she was out of   sight in an instant      As our suitors had now been dismissed  and our assemblies dis    continued  Miss Golding seemed quite pleased with our domestic   quiet   it gave us frequent occasions of being together   and I   endeavoured  by a variety of tender offices and little amusements    to dispel or divert the melancholy under which I thought she   laboured  I was greatly surprised at my own success on this   occasion  her cheerfulness returned  she discovered new and   striking graces in her manners and conversation  and in a little   time did not appear to want any consolation      One day  being on the Exchange  I was accosted by a Jew  who   told me that he wanted a sum of money  and would either sell or   pawn to me a jewel of great price   it was a solitaire  composed of   oriental pearls  with a diamond of the first water and magnitude   in the centre  After some chaffering  we agreed for three   thousand pieces  and I put it into my pocket book  As my   business detained me on the Exchange till it was late  I dined   with two or three acquaintances at the chop house  and did not   return till the evening was advanced      On my entering I was told that Mr  Golding was abroad  and   that Miss Matilda had just ordered coffee for some ladies in her   dressing room  Immediately I ran up and opened the door without   ceremony  but was instantly struck with the look which she turned   towards me a look that at once intimated dejection and disgust    During coffee I endeavoured to behave with my usual unconcern    but found it impossible to avoid sharing in that constraint under   which Miss Matilda most evidently laboured  in short  a gloomy   stifihess spread through the whole conversation  and I believe no   two persons in company were rightly satisfied with each other      As soon as the cups were removed  the fair visitants got up          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  189     and as Miss Golding pressed them to stay  in a manner that rather   denoted her desire of their absence  they feigned a further engage
