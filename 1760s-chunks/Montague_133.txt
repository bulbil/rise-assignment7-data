tenderest part of love and friendship  the soul here discovers a kind of elasticity  and  being forced back  returns with an additional violence        Who would not quarrel for the pleasure of reconciliation  I shall be very angry with Fitzgerald if he goes on in this mild way       Tell your sister  she cannot be more mortified than I am  that it is impossible for me to be at her masquerade       Adieu  Your affectionate  A  FITZGERALD       Don t you think  my dear Rivers  that marriage  on prudent principles  is a horrid sort of an affair  It is really cruel of papas and mammas to shut up two poor innocent creatures in a house together  to plague and torment one another  who might have been very happy separate       Where people take their own time  and chuse for themselves  it is another affair  and I begin to think it possible affection may last through life       I sometimes fancy to myself Fitzgerald and I loving on  from the impassioned hour when I first honored him with my hand  to that tranquil one  when we shall take our afternoon s nap vis a vis in two arm chairs  by the fire side  he a grave country justice  and I his worship s good sort of a wife  the Lady Bountiful of the parish       I have a notion there is nothing so very shocking in being an oldish gentlewoman  what one loses in charms  is made up in the happy liberty of doing and saying whatever one pleases  Adieu     LETTER CCXVII   217   To Captain FITZGERALD   Bellfield  Nov  16   MY relation  Colonel Willmott  is just arrived from the East Indies  rich  and full of the project of marrying his daughter to me        My mother has this morning received a letter from him  pressing the affair with an earnestness which rather makes me feel for his disappointment  and wish to break it to him as gently as possible       He talks of being at Bellfield on Wednesday evening  which is Temple s masquerade  I shall stay behind at Bellfield  to receive him  have a domino ready  and take him to Temple house       He seems to know nothing of my marriage or my sister s  and I wish him not to know of the former till he has seen Emily       The best apology I can make for declining his offer  is to shew him the lovely cause       I will contrive they shall converse together at the masquerade  and that he shall sit next her at supper  without their knowing any thing of each other       If he sees her  if he talks with her  without that prejudice which the knowledge of her being the cause of his disappointment might give  he cannot fail of having for her that admiration which I never yet met with a mind savage enough to refuse her       His daughter has been educated abroad  which is a circumstance I am pleased with  as it gives me the power of refusing her without wounding either her vanity  or her father s  which  had we been acquainted  might have been piqued at my giving the preference to another       She is not in England  but is hourly expected  the moment she arrives  Lucy and I will fetch her to Temple house  I shall be anxious to see her married to a man who deserves her  Colonel Willmott tells me  she is very amiable  at least as he is told  for he has never seen her       I could wish it were possible to conceal this offer for ever from Emily  my delicacy is hurt at the idea of her knowing it  at least from me or my family       My mother behaves like an angel on this occasion  expresses herself perfectly happy in my having consulted my heart alone in marrying  and speaks of Emily s tenderness as a treasure above all price       She does not even hint a wish to see me richer than I am       Had I never seen Emily  I would not have married this lady unless love had united us       Do not  however  suppose I have that romantic contempt for fortune  which is so pardonable  I had almost said so becoming  at nineteen       I have seen more of the world than most men of my age  and I have seen the advantages of affluence in their strongest light       I think a worthy man not only may have  but ought to have  an attention to making his way in the world  and improving his situation in it  by every means consistent with probity and honor  and with his own real happiness       I have ever had this attention  and ever will  but not by base means  and  in my opinion  the very basest is that of selling one s hand in marriage       With what horror do we regard a man who is kept  and a man who marries from interested views alone  is kept in the strongest sense of the word       He is equally a
