seeing me here in my deplorable   bondage  can give me the least ray of hope        Don t  I beseech you  drive the poor distressed Pamela upon a rock    that may be the destruction both of her soul and body  You don t know    sir  how dreadfully I dare  weak as I am of mind and intellect  when my   virtue is in danger  And  O  hasten my deliverance  that a poor unworthy   creature  below the notice of such a gentleman as you  may not be made   the sport of a high condition  for no reason in the world  but because   she is not able to defend herself  nor has a friend that can right her        I have  sir  in part to shew my obedience to you  but indeed  I own    more to give ease to the minds of my poor distressed parents  whose   poverty  one would think  should screen them from violences of this   sort  as well as their poor daughter  followed pretty much the form   you have prescribed for me  in the letter to Mrs  Jervis  and the   alterations I have made  for I could not help a few  are of such a   nature  as  though they shew my concern a little  yet must answer the   end you are pleased to say you propose by this letter        For God s sake  good sir  pity my lowly condition  and my present great   misery  and let me join with all the rest of your servants to bless that   goodness  which you have extended to every one but the poor afflicted    heart broken  PAMELA           I thought  when I had written this letter  and that which he had   prescribed  it would look like placing a confidence in Mrs  Jewkes  to   shew them to her  and I shewed her  at the same time  my master s letter   to me  for I believed the value he expressed for me  would give me   credit with one who professed in every thing to serve him  right or   wrong  though I had so little reason  I fear  to pride myself in it  and   I was not mistaken  for it has seemed to influence her not a little  and   she is at present mighty obliging  and runs over in my praises  but   is the less to be minded  because she praises as much the author of my   miseries  and his honourable intentions  as she calls them  for I see    that she is capable of thinking  as I fear he does  that every thing   that makes for his wicked will is honourable  though to the ruin of the   innocent  Pray God I may find it otherwise  Though  I hope  whatever   the wicked gentleman may intend  that I shall be at last rid of her   impertinent bold way of talk  when she seems to think  from his letter    that he means honourably          I am now come to MONDAY  the 5th Day of my Bondage and Misery       I was in hope to have an opportunity to see John  and have a little   private talk with him  before he went away  but it could not be  The   poor man s excessive sorrow made Mrs  Jewkes take it into her head  to   think he loved me  and so she brought up a message to me from him this   morning that he was going  I desired he might come up to my closet  as I   called it  and she came with him  The honest man  as I thought him    was as full of concern as before  at taking leave and I gave him two   letters  the one for Mrs  Jervis  enclosed in another for my master  but   Mrs  Jewkes would see me seal them up  lest I should enclose any thing   else   I was surprised  at the man s going away  to see him drop a bit   of paper  just at the head of the stairs  which I took up without being   observed by Mrs  Jewkes  but I was a thousand times more surprised  when   I returned to my closet  and opening it read as follows           GOOD MRS  PAMELA        I am grieved to tell you how much you have been deceived and betrayed    and that by such a vile dog as I  Little did I think it would come to   this  But I must say  if ever there was a rogue in the world  it is me    I have all along shewed your
