Ah   were you authors to know the thousandth   part of the liberties that are taken behind your backs  you would   learn to bear with more humility a gentle admonition  though   uttered to your faces  Few  indeed  have the generosity  or even   humanity  to intimate what they themselves think  or what the   world speaks of you  We are seldom over forward to say any   thing that might give displeasure to others  because we like that   others should be pleased with ourselves   but in your absence   we pay ourselves largely for our taciturnity in your presence    and I have often been in company where the intimates and   confidants of you authors have depreciated and ridiculed the   very same passages which they applauded with cries and claps   in your closets  The world  my friend  has substituted good   manners in the place of good nature   whoever conforms to the   former is dispensed with from any observance of the latter    Shall I add  for the misfortune of you authors   that there is a   set of men who at once dispense with common manners and   common humanity   They go under the name of critics   and   must be men of wealth  that the deference paid to fortune may   give a sort of stamp and currency to the dross of their erudition    In the strictest sense  indeed  they may be called men of letters    their study as well as capacity being nearly confined to a just or   orthographical disposition of the alphabet  Their business is to   reconnoitre the out works of genius  as they have no key to the   gates of nature or sentiment  They snuff faults from afar  as   crows scent carrion  and delight to pick  and to prey  and to dwell   upon them  They enter like wasps upon the gardens of litera    ture  not to relish any fragrance  or select any sweets  but to   pamper their malevolence with every thing that savours of rank    ness or oifence  Happily for them  their sagacity does not tend   to the discovery of merit   in such a case  a work of genius would   give them the spleen for a month  or possibly depress their spirits   beyond recovery      To these high and dreaded lords justiciaries  the critics  authors   deem it incumbent to submit the products of their lucubrations     not in the prospect of any advantage from their advice or animad    versions  neither in the hopes of acquiring their friendship or   patronage   but merely to soothe and deprecate the effects of their   malignity  Accordingly  I have been present when some of these   dictators have been presented with a manuscript as with an humble   petition   they have thereupon assumed the chair  as a judge assumes   the bench when a criminal is called before him  not in order to   trial or hearing  but to sentence and condemnation  To what   scenes of mortification have I been witness on such occasions   to   what a state of abatement  of abasement  of annihilation  have these   entertainers of the public been depressed     I am sorry  sir  to   tell you that this will not do a few attempts here and there  but   that will not compensate  Here again  how injudicious  absurd    unpardonable  Good sir  you should have considered that when   a man sits down to write for the public  the least compliment they   expect from him is  that he should think Here  my friend  I have   seen enough   I cannot affront my judgment so much  as either to         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  69     recommend or patronize your performance   all I can do for you   is to be silent on the subject  and permit fools to approve who have     not sense to discern   Thus do these critics paramount  with     the delicacy and compassion of the torturers of the Inquisition    search out all the seats of sensibility and self complacence  in order   to sting with the more quick and killing poignancy      Now  my dear friend  as you have not applied for the favour of   these established arbitrators of genius and literature  you are not   to expect the least mercy from them   and I am also free to tell   you  that I know of no writer who lies more open to their attacks    You are excessively incorrect  Your works  on the one hand  have   not the least appearance of the Limse  labor   nor  on the other    have they that ease which ought to attend the haste with which   they seem to be written  Again
