away  for I seldom go down into   the kitchen  and I heard the butler say  Why  Jane  nobody has your good   word  What has Mrs  Pamela done to you  I am sure she offends nobody    And what  said the peevish wench  have I said to her  foolatum  but that   she was pretty  They quarrelled afterwards  I heard  I was sorry for it    but troubled myself no more about it  Forgive this silly prattle  from                                                  Your dutiful DAUGHTER       Oh  I forgot to say  that I would stay to finish the waistcoat  if I   might with safety  Mrs  Jervis tells me I certainly may  I never did a   prettier piece of work  and I am up early and late to get it over  for I   long to be with you                LETTER XX         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I did not send my last letters so soon as I hoped  because John  whether   my master mistrusts or no  I can t say  had been sent to Lady Davers s   instead of Isaac  who used to go  and I could not be so free with  nor   so well trust Isaac  though he is very civil to me too  So I was forced   to stay till John returned       As I may not have opportunity to send again soon  and yet  as I know you   keep my letters  and read them over and over   so John told me   when   you have done work   so much does your kindness make you love all that   comes from your poor daughter   and as it may be some little pleasure to   me  perhaps  to read them myself  when I am come to you  to remind me of   what I have gone through  and how great God s goodness has been to me     which  I hope  will further strengthen my good resolutions  that I may   not hereafter  from my bad conduct  have reason to condemn myself from   my own hand as it were   For all these reasons  I say  I will write as I   have time  and as matters happen  and send the scribble to you as I have   opportunity  and if I don t every time  in form  subscribe as I ought    I am sure you will always believe  that it is not for want of duty  So I   will begin where I left off  about the talk between Mrs  Jervis and me    for me to ask to stay       Unknown to Mrs  Jervis  I put a project  as I may call it  in practice    I thought with myself some days ago  Here I shall go home to my poor   father and mother  and have nothing on my back  that will be fit for   my condition  for how should your poor daughter look with a silk   night gown  silken petticoats  cambric head clothes  fine holland linen    laced shoes that were my lady s  and fine stockings  And how in a little   while must these have looked  like old cast offs  indeed  and I looked   so for wearing them  And people would have said   for poor folks are   envious as well as rich   See there Goody Andrews s daughter  turned   home from her fine place  What a tawdry figure she makes  And how well   that garb becomes her poor parents  circumstances   And how would   they look upon me  thought I to myself  when they should come to be   threadbare and worn out  And how should I look  even if I could purchase   homespun clothes  to dwindle into them one by one  as I got them   May   be  an old silk gown  and a linsey woolsey petticoat  and the like  So    thought I  I had better get myself at once equipped in the dress that   will become my condition  and though it may look but poor to what I have   been used to wear of late days  yet it will serve me  when I am with   you  for a good holiday and Sunday suit  and what  by a blessing on my   industry  I may  perhaps  make shift to keep up to       So  as I was saying  unknown to any body  I bought of farmer Nichols
