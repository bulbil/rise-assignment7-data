is my heart so wholly attached  that I cannot think it just to give the least encouragement to any other proposal   You are an excellent young woman  But  my dear  if Charles Grandison is engaged—your mind will  it  must change  Few women marry their first loves  Your heart—  O madam  it is already a wedded heart  It is wedded to his merits  his merits will be always the object of my esteem  I can never think of any other  as I ought to think of the man to whom I give my hand   Like merits  my dear  as person is not the principal motive  may produce like attachments  My Lord D  will be  in your hands  another Sir Charles Grandison   How good you are  my dear Lady D   But allow me to repeat  as the strongest expression I can use  because   45 I mean it to carry in it all the force that can be given it  That my heart is already a wedded heart   You have spoken with great force  God bless you  my dear  as I love you  The matter shall take its course  If my Lord should happen to be a single man some time hence  and  I can tell you  that your excellencies will make our choice difficult   and if your mind  from any accident  or from persuasion of friends  should then have received alteration  you may still be happy in each other  I will therefore only thank you for that openness of heart▪ which must set free the heart of my son—Had you had the least lurking inclination to coquetry  and could have taken pride in conquests  he might have been an undone man —We will return to the company—But spare him  my dear  You must not talk much  He will love you  if you do  too fervently for his own peace  Try to be a little aukward—I am afraid for him  Indeed I am  O that you had never seen Sir Charles Grandison   I could not answer one word  She took my hand  and led me into the company   Had I been silent  when my Lord directed his discourse to me  or answer d only No  or Yes  the Countess would have thought me very vain  and  that I ascribed to myself the consequence she so generously gave me  with respect to my Lord  I therefore behaved and answered unaffectedly  but avoided such a promptness of speech  as would have looked like making pretensions to knowlege and opinion  though some of my Lord s questions were apparently design d to engage me into freedom of discourse  The Countess observed me narrowly  She whispered to me  that she did  and made me a very high compliment on my behaviour  How much  Lucy  do I love and reverence her   My Lord was spoken too slightly of  by Miss Grandison  in a former conversation He is really a fine gentleman  Any woman who is not engaged in her   46 affections  may think herself very happy with him  His conversation was easy and polite  and he said nothing that was low or trifling  Indeed  Lucy  I think Mr  Greville and Mr  Fenwick are as greatly inferior to Lord D  as Lord D  is to Sir Charles Grandison  At parting  he requested of me  to be allowed to repeat his visits   My Lord  said the Countess  before I could answer  you must not expect a mere stiff maiden answer from Miss Byron  She is above all vulgar forms  She and her cousins have too much politeness  and  I will venture to say  discernment  not to be glad of your acquaintance  as an acquaintance—But  for the rest  you must look to your heart   I shall be afraid▪ said he▪ turning to the Countess  to ask your Lordship for an explanation  Miss Byron  I hope  Sir  addressing himself to Mr  Reeves  will not refuse me her company  when I pay you my compliments  Then turning to me  I hope  madam  I shall not be punished for admiring you   My Lord D  replied I  will be intitled to every civility  I had said more  had he not snatched my hand a little too eagerly  and kissed it   And thus much for the visit of the Countess of D  and the Earl   DID I tell you in my former letter  that Emily is with me half her time  She is a most engaging young creature  Her manners are so pure  Her heart is so sincere and open —O Lucy  you would dearly love her  I wish I may be asked to carry her down with me  Yet she adores her guardian  But her reverence for him will not allow of the innocent familiarity in thinking of him  that—I don t know what I would say  But to love with an ardor  that would be dangerous to one s peace  one must have more tenderness than reverence for the object  Don t you think so  Lucy     47 Miss Grandison made me one of her flying visits  as she calls them  soon
