  A man there was at this time attendant on the court  whom the crasty  minister had frequently made the agent of his oppression and unjustice   He had often times sent him out to harrass the land by severe and  fraudulent exactions  and had suffered him to be enriched by a share of  the spoil  Tyrrel  so was he named  lived but by the favour of Hubert   who reserved him for his wicked purposes  yet might at once take away  his life with a fair semblance of public justice  should he at any time  rebel against his sovereign pleasure  This man was now summoned before  him  and  with a brow of care and anxiety  as if some design of moment  possessed his mind  Hubert commanded him instantly to repair to his  house  which lay near the road Lord William was to take  to invite this  Lord  to entertain him with all nospitable rites  and  in some other  matters which should hereafter be explained more fully  to submit  entirely to the guidance of a Monk whom he should speecily send to him   and whom he was also to entertain  Tyrrel was alarmed at this mysterious  language  he knew the desperate unrelenting spirit of his master  and  suspected that some bloody design was now to be executed  and that his  house was to be the fatal scene of violence or treachery  He trembled  and hesitated  for he was not yet consummate in villainy  but Hubert  thundered in his ears the most terrible denunciations of vengeance and  utter destruction  should he betray the least reluctance  the smallest  defect of zeal and alacrity in executing his orders  Tyrrel bowed before  him with a slavish submission  and promised full obedience     Still he had to practice with Reginhald  but here he expected  and  indeed found an easy task  The Monk  was again summoned to his presence  The distinction and apparent  confidence with which he was treated  served to intoxicate his base  mind  and to prepare him for some deed of violence or mischief  Hubert  artfully commended his fidelity  and promised to reward it  but lamented  the danger in which Raymond and all his adherents were now to be  involved  Lord William  he observed  must soon reach his castle  the  shame of disappointment and the violence of hatred and revenge must soon  fall on Raymond  and the zeal of his faithful friends must appear odious  and criminal  Then  with well affected perplexity and terror addressing  himself earnestly to the Monk  he desired his sage counsel in this  dangerous emergency  Reginhald  with an awkward and abject abasement   declared that he was totally unable to advise  but ready to follow the  directions of Lord Hubert with implicit submission  The subtle courtier  seized him by the hand  applauded his zeal  and lavished the amplest  promises upon him   Be bold   said he         and be happy —There is but one way—Let us prevent the attempts of our  common enemy—by destroying him         —Reginhald took fire at this propofal  he at once freely offered  himself to be the agent  and seemed impatient to learn the means of  executing a design so suited to a heart that never felt humanity or  remorse   Hubert hastily produced a phial filled with a deadly poison   Behold    said he         the sure means of destroying our enemy  Let it be thy care to present  Lord William with this fatal draught  and name the reward of so great a  service         —And now he proceeded to explain his fell purpose to the Monk more  particularly  He dismissed him fully instructed  and impatient for the  execution  Reginhald was received by the abject creature of Hubert  and  invested with absolute authority over his domestics  Tyrrel watched the  approach of Lord William  this Lord accepted his insidious invitation   and the Monk was brought before him  as a person from whom he was to  receive some particular intelligence of his Countess  The Earl  was earnest in his enquiries  and Reginhald prompt in his false  assurances  He declared  as he had been instructed by Hubert  that he  had for some time resided in the castle of Salisbury  employed in  administring spiritual consolation to a domestic of the Countess  that  he had frequently seen this Lady  been witness of the melancholy of her  widowed state  and of the affection with which she cherished the memory  of her Lord  A suitor indeed had visited her  but she had obstinately  shut her ears against all his sollicitations  and Lord Raymond was long  since retired in despair   These studied falsehoods had all the effect for which they were  intended  The heart of William was dilated with joy  he embraced his  friends with that warmth of affection which sudden good fortune  naturally excites  then  turning again to Reginhald  repeated his  eager enquiries about his wife  his son  his house  and received
