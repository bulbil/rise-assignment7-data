 for anything else  because the best man in the land might love you    so she was pleased to say  She wished it was in her power to live   independent  then she would take a little private house  and I should   live with her like her daughter       And so  as you ordered me to take her advice  I resolved to tarry to see   how things went  except he was to turn me away  although  in your first   letter  you ordered me to come away the moment I had any reason to be   apprehensive  So  dear father and mother  it is not disobedience  I   hope  that I stay  for I could not expect a blessing  or the good fruits   of your prayers for me  if I was disobedient       All the next day I was very sad  and began my long letter  He saw me   writing  and said  as I mentioned  to Mrs  Jervis  That girl is always   scribbling  methinks she might find something else to do  or to that   purpose  And when I had finished my letter  I put it under the toilet in   my late lady s dressing room  whither nobody comes but myself and Mrs    Jervis  besides my master  but when I came up again to seal it  to my   great concern  it was gone  and Mrs  Jervis knew nothing of it  and   nobody knew of my master s having been near the place in the time  so I   have been sadly troubled about it  But Mrs  Jervis  as well as I  thinks   he has it  some how or other  and he appears cross and angry  and seems   to shun me  as much as he said I did him  It had better be so than   worse       But he has ordered Mrs  Jervis to bid me not pass so much time in   writing  which is a poor matter for such a gentleman as he to take   notice of  as I am not idle other ways  if he did not resent what he   thought I wrote upon  And this has no very good look       But I am a good deal easier since I lie with Mrs  Jervis  though  after   all  the fears I live in on one side  and his frowning and displeasure   at what I do on the other  make me more miserable than enough       O that I had never left my little bed in the loft  to be thus exposed   to temptations on one hand  or disgusts on the other  How happy was I   awhile ago  How contrary now   Pity and pray for                                               Your afflicted                                                     PAMELA                LETTER XIII         My DEAREST CHILD       Our hearts bleed for your distress  and the temptations you are exposed   to  You have our hourly prayers  and we would have you flee this evil   great house and man  if you find he renews his attempts  You ought to   have done it at first  had you not had Mrs  Jervis to advise with  We   can find no fault in your conduct hitherto  But it makes our hearts ache   for fear of the worst  O my child  temptations are sore things   but   yet  without them  we know not ourselves  nor what we are able to do       Your danger is very great  for you have riches  youth  and a fine   gentleman  as the world reckons him  to withstand  but how great will be   your honour to withstand them  And when we consider your past conduct    and your virtuous education  and that you have been bred to be more   ashamed of dishonesty than poverty  we trust in God  that He will enable   you to overcome  Yet  as we can t see but your life must be a burthen to   you  through the great apprehensions always upon you  and that it may be   presumptuous to trust too much to our own strength  and that you are   but very young  and the devil may put it into his heart to use some   stratagem  of which great men
