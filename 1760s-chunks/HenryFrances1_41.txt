Request of yours  After the Sacrifice I have lately made  you could have no Reason to doubt of my Compliance in this Particular  or that I should refuse you the Shadow of that Substance  which  while it shall be enlivened with a Spirit of Sense  Reflection  or Gratitude  must be ever your s  Constant Lovers need only the Exchange of Hearts  but fickle ones have need of Tokens  Accept then of this  as it is the only Way  I fear  is left me  of restoring my Image to you  And having already  Fortune de l Amour  lost what I loved as well  and liked infinitely better than myself  I shall find no Difficulty in parting thus from that same self  since you are pleased to act a Part in Aesop s Fables  to quit the Substance  and embrace the Shadow   You see  I am resolved the Correspondence shall not drop on my Side  and indeed I shall  with real Transport  take Advantage of every Occasion  which will not appear Presumption on my former Happiness  of assuring you  that  I am  with Sincerity  Truth  and Constancy  Your s Henry     137  LETTER LXXX  HENRY to FRANCES   I RECEIVED your Letter  and shall continue the Corespondence  while you will give me Leave  Indeed I find something which pleases  and flatters me too much in any Engagement with you  to be easily discouraged  for I sincerely think that  vain as you are  you do not know your own Merit  or Value  Your Writing  particularly  I really do not know any Thing in English equal to  for Delicacy of Sentiment  or Turn of Expression  There are some faint Traces of your Point  and Stile  in a few of the polite French Authors  almost to persuade one they were Imitations  if there were not such strong Lines  in yours  of an Original   You say   here ends my Palinode   but pray  Where did it begin  What Recantation have you made of your Mistake  or unkind and unjust Abuse of me  What Answer have you given yet to a late Letter of mine  where  giving you the full Force of your Argument against me  I will hazard my Defence  in this World  or the next  upon my Justification there made  where I was no more culpable  than if I had lent you a Horse  which  by starting accidentally  had broke your Leg  But  tho  it   138 gave you no just Cause for your unkind Treatment of me  I own it afforded you a plausible Occasion  being already determined  Now  as your Author Rochfaucault says  a Woman never quits her first Love   till she has engaged in a Second  I shall be therefore much obliged  if you will trust my Confidence so far  as to let me know  who my Rival is  Nor have you any Thing to fear for him  in this  from a Wretch as impotent in Means  as I have ever been in Will  to be malicious  And indeed it would be Madness in me to make my Rivals in your Love my Enemies  for I am vain enough to think myself able to stand against a Multitude   You have often unjustly charged me with seeking an Opportunity of breaking with you  on whom  I pray  does that Charge  ungenerous as it is  fall with the greatest Justice  at present  You have yourself presented that fair Occasion  and yet see the Obstinacy of my Attachments to you  and indeed the only Malice of the rest of my Life towards you shall be to convince you  and you only  how unkind and unjust so base a Sentiment was of me   I am  my dearest Fanny  your very sincere and constant Lover and Friend   P  S  I found the Inclosed   after I wrote to you last  and send it kindly to you  as it will help to hide even my Shadow from you     139  LETTER LXXXI   SIR   I CANNOT recollect any Period of my Life  wherein I found myself more embarrassed  than at this Moment  As there is nothing I wish more earnestly to avoid  than a Repetition of what now appears the most   assured Weakness   I ever did  or can commit —addressing you by Letter —    At the same Time  the Complaisance  you have shewn to my Requests  obliges me to think   tho   my Thanks can hardly be deemed an Acknowledgment for your late Favours  it must appear like Ingratitude  not to offer them   Accept then of the poor  but only return  that is in my Power to make  and let me add my sincere Wishes  that I may be able to preserve the Picture you have sent  much longer  than you suffered me to do that  which I  unskilful  had drawn of you   You say    I have quitted the Substance  for the Shadow   I think you are deceived  for I am sure there is more Stability and Truth in this miniature Mimickry  than
