she is a creature whom I cannot help loving in spite of my senses  so that the sacrifice she demands must be made  and that sacrifice is no less than your dismission  I lament it very much  my poor dear Gil Blas  and if that will be any satisfaction to you  my consent was wrung from me most unwillingly  but there was no saying nay  With one thing  however  you may comfort yourself  you shall not be sent away with empty pockets  Nay  more  I mean to turn you over to a lady of my acquaintance  where you will live to your liking   I was not a little mortified to find all my noble acts and motives end in my own confusion  I gave a left handed blessing to Euphrasia  and wept over the weakness of Don Gonzales  to be so foolishly infatuated by her  The kind hearted old gentleman felt within himself that in turning me adrift at the peremptory demand of his mistress  he was not performing the most manly action of his life  For this reason  as a set off against his hen pecked cowardice  and that I might the more easily swallow this bitter dose  he gave me fifty ducats  and took me with him next morning to the Marchioness of Chaves  telling that lady before my face  that I was a young man of unexceptionably good character  and very high in his good graces  but that as certain family reasons prevented him from continuing me on his own establishment  he should esteem it as a favour if she would take me on hers  After such an introduction  I was retained at once as her appendage  and found myself  I scarcely knew how  established in another household       CH  VIII     The Marchioness of Chaves  her character  and that of her company   THE Marchioness of Chaves was a widow of five and thirty  tall  handsome  and well proportioned  She enjoyed an income of ten thousand ducats  without the incumbrance of a nursery  I never met with a lady of fewer words  nor one of a more solemn aspect  Yet this exterior did not prevent her from being set up as the cleverest woman in all Madrid  Her great assemblies  attended by people of the first quality  and by men of letters who made a coffee house of her apartments  contributed perhaps more than anything she said to give her the reputation she had acquired  But this is a point on which it is not my province to decide  I have only to relate  as her historian  that her name carried with it the idea of superior genius  and that her house was called  to distinguish it from the ordinary societies in town  The Fashionable Institution for Literature  Taste  and Science   In point of fact  not a day passed  but there were readings there  sometimes of dramatic pieces  and sometimes in other branches of poetry  But the subjects were always selected from the graver muses  wit and humour were held in the most sovereign contempt  Comedy  however spirited  a novel  however pointed in its satire or ingenious in its fable  such light productions as these were treated as weak efforts of the brain without the slightest claim to patronage  whereas on the contrary the most microscopical work in the serious style  whether ode  pastoral  or sonnet  was trumpeted to the skies as the most illustrious effort of a learned and poetical age  It not unfrequently fell out  that the public reversed the decrees of this chancery for genius  nay  they had sometimes the gross ill breeding to hiss the very pieces which had been sanctioned by this court of criticism   I was chief manager of the establishment  and my office consisted in getting the drawing room ready to receive the company  in setting the chairs in order for the gentlemen  and the sofas for the ladies  after which I took my station on the landing place to bawl out the names of the visitors as they came up stairs  and usher them into the circle  The first day  an old piece of family furniture  who was stationed by my side in the ante chamber  gave me their description with some humour  after I had shown them into the room  His name was Andrew Molina  He had a good deal of mother s wit  with a flowing vein of satire  much gravity of sarcasm  and a happy knack at hitting off characters  The first corner was a bishop  I roared out his lordship s name  and as soon as he was gone in  my nomenclator told me    That prelate is a very curious gentleman  He has some little influence at court  but wants to persuade the world that he has a great deal  He presses his service on every soul he comes near  and then leaves them completely in the lurch  One day he met with a gentleman in the presence chamber who bowed to him  He laid hold of him  and squeezing his hand  assured him  with an inundation of civilities  that he was altogether devoted to his lordship  For goodness  sake  do not spare me  I shall not die in my bed without having first
