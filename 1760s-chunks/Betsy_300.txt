 enemy  conjured up a spirit of jealousy in him  for my torment at first    and  at last  for my utter ruin  His fears of losing me  as he   pretended  secluded me from all society  denied me all the publick   diversions of the town  and though I lived amidst the very seat of   pleasures  kept me as much a stranger to them as if I had been a   thousand leagues removed  but  oh  this night  this night  Madam  has   compleated all his too suspicious temper long since threatened  The poor   mercer  at whose house you saw me  came this night to bring a piece of   silk I had bespoke of him  Mr  Thoughtless came home immediately after    and being told who was above with me  flew up stairs  burst open the   door  which by some accident was locked  rushed in with his drawn sword    swearing he would sacrifice us both  the man  to avoid his fury  jumped   out of the window into the yard  Mr  Thoughtless ran down the back   stairs  in order  I suppose  to make him in that place the victim of his   rage  whether he has effected it  I know not  for  trembling at my own   danger  I took that opportunity of running directly out of the house    though where to go I knew not  I had no friend  no acquaintance to whom   I could apply  I found myself all alone in the street  and exposed to   insults  even worse than those from which I fled  My good genius   for   so I hope it was  in that dreadful instant  reminded me of you  I had   heard a high character of your goodness  and was assured of it  even by   the little I had seen of you  when you were pleased to think me worthy   of your notice        This  Madam   added she   has brought me to you  and I once more   beseech shelter and protection under your roof for this night at least    till I can recollect in what manner I can dispose of my wretched self        Though Mrs  Munden was apprehensive this lady had favoured herself too   much in the recital she had made  yet she could not think of refusing   what she asked  she ordered a bed to be instantly prepared for her  and   having conducted her to the chamber where she was to lie  told her she   would defer  till the next morning  any farther discourse on the subject   they had been talking of  as it was very late  and she expected Mr    Munden home  so wishing her a good repose  returned to her own   apartment  to reflect at more leisure on this strange adventure                CHAPTER XVII       Is less entertaining than some of the former          The husband of Mrs  Munden being engaged abroad till his usual hour  she   had just time to get into bed before he came home  which she was very   glad of  as it prevented him from asking any question concerning her   sitting up so much beyond her custom  and she was not willing to say any   thing to him of her new guest  till she had talked farther with her  and   also examined into the truth of the affair which brought her thither       The more she reflected on the account that lady had given of herself    the less reason she found to give credit to some passages in it  she   could not think that a prince  such as the Duke of M      would  on a   mere suggestion  cast a woman out to misery and beggary  whom he had so   passionately loved  and yet less could she believe that her brother  a   man not fiery by nature  could have acted in the manner she had   represented  without a much greater provocation than what she pretended       Besides  the mercer bringing home goods so late at night to a customer    and being locked up with her  seemed so inconsistent with innocence    that she could not help being of opinion  that the cause must be bad   indeed which had no better plea for it s defence       It also afforded her a good deal of matter for vexation  that by   expressing  in such warm terms  the great liking she took of this lady   when they accidentally met at the mercer s  she had encouraged her to   make choice of her house for an asylum in her distress  and by this   means rendered herself interested in the concerns of
