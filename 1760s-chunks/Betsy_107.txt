       presence till that time  it would not only be a sure touchstone of        his affection  but also be a means of clearing your reputation from        those blemishes it has received on his account  After what I have        said  I believe it would be needless to add  that the less freely        you converse with Miss Mabel  the less you will suffer  both in the        judgment of the world and your own future peace of mind            Slight not this counsel because given behind the curtain  but be        assured it comes from one who is  with the sincerest attachment         Madam  your most humble  though concealed servant        If Miss Betsy had received this letter a very small time before she did    it might probably have wrought on her all the effect it was intended   for  but she had scarce read it half through before the lucky discovery   of Miss Flora s baseness  seasonably made to her by Mr  Saving  came   fresh into her mind  and she was at no loss to guess at the malicious   purpose  and the author of it  though wrote in a hand altogether a   stranger to her       She doubted not but it was a trick of Miss Flora s  to cause a   separation between her and Mr  Trueworth  but the motives which had   instigated her to do this  were not in her power to conceive        Revenge for her disappointed expectations   said she to herself   might   make her take the steps she did  on Mr  Saving s account  but what has   Mr  Trueworth done to her  He never pretended to love her  he neither   flattered nor deceived her vanity  it must be  therefore  only a wicked   propensity  an envious  unsocial disposition  a love of mischief   implanted in her nature  and uncorrected by reason or principle  that   has induced her to be guilty of this poor  low  enervate spite  but I am   resolved to mortify it        She was not long considering in what manner she should proceed to do as   she had said  and I believe the reader will acknowledge she hit upon one   as effectual for that end as could have been contrived       She appeared extremely gay the whole time of dinner  and  as soon as it   was over   I will present you with a dessert  Sir   said she to Mr    Goodman   I will shew you what pains has been taken to break off my   acquaintance with Mr  Trueworth  by some wretch  who either envies me   the honour of his affections  or him the place they imagine he has in   mine  but  I beseech you  read it   continued she   and I will appeal to   you  Lady Mellasin  and Miss Flora  if ever there was a more stupid   plot         Stupid enough  indeed   cried the honest merchant  as soon as he had   done reading   but it is yet more base  I am glad  however   continued   he   to find your good sense prevents you from being imposed upon by   such artifices     This is so shallow a one   answered she   that a very   small share of understanding might serve to defend any one from being   deceived by it  I pity the weakness  while I despise the baseness  of   such mean incendiaries  Mr  Trueworth  however  will fare the better for   this attempt against him  I will now make no scruple of prefering him to   all mankind besides  and  perhaps  when my brothers arrive  shall   consent to every thing he desires        Lady Mellasin could not help applauding the spirit and resolution she   shewed on this occasion  and Mr  Goodman was quite charmed with it  and   both of them joined in the severest exclamations against the folly and   wickedness of the letter writer  but Miss Flora said little  and  as   soon as she could quit the table with decency  went up into her chamber    saying  she had a piece of work in her hand which she was in haste to   finish       If Miss Betsy had wanted any confirmation of the truth of her   suspicions  the looks of Miss Flora  during this whole discourse  would   have removed all doubt in her  and the opportunity of venting the spleen   she
