natured  and of a   very amorous complexion  at least  Sir John Shuffle  who toyed with her   in my lord s park  tells me she is so  But   continued he   I dare take   his word  he knows your sex perfectly  and  I dare answer  if you will   get her to go abroad with you  the consequence will be agreeable to us   all          What   said I   would you have me make her my confidante    Not   altogether so   said he   at least  not till you are upon even terms   with her  I mean  till you have secret for secret          How can that be   demanded I   Leave that to me   said he   do you only   get her out to morrow a walking  let me know  what time you think you   can best do it  and Sir John and I will meet you as if by chance   I   told him I would undertake to do it if the weather were fair  and that   they might meet us going towards the town  but it must be past five    after she had given her French lesson to the ladies  This being agreed   upon  we parted  though not without the extremest reluctance  at least    I am sure  on my side it was sincerely so  I then went back with the   same precaution I had gone out  locked all the doors softly  and got   into my chamber before any of the family were stirring        I was more than ordinarily civil to Mademoiselle all the next day  I   said every thing I could think on to flatter her  and  having got an   opportunity of speaking to her alone   Dear Mademoiselle   said I  in a   wheedling tone   I have a great favour to beg of you     What is that    Miss   replied she   Any thing in my power you may command   I then told   her I had got a whim in my head for a new tippet  and that I wanted her   fancy in the choice of the colours   With all my heart   said she   and   when we go out a walking this evening  we can call at the milliner s    and buy the ribbands     That will not do   cried I   I would not have   any of the ladies know any thing of the matter till I have made it  and   got it on  so nobody must go with us     Well  well   answered she   it   shall be so  but I must tell the governess  I know she will not be   against humouring you in such a little fancy  and will send the other   tutoress  or Nurse Winter  to wait upon the other ladies   I told her   she was very good  but enjoined her to beg the governess to keep it as a   secret  for my tippet would be mighty pretty  and I wanted to surprize   them with the sight of it        The governess  however  was so kind as to let us go somewhat before the   time we expected  in order to prevent any one from offering to accompany   us  but  early as it was  the two gentlemen were on the road  They   accosted us with a great deal of complaisance   What  my Diana of the   forest   said Sir John to Mademoiselle   am I so fortunate to see you   once again   What reply she made I do not know  being speaking to Wildly   at the same time  but he also  by my instigations  made his chief court   to Mademoiselle  and both of them joined to intreat she would permit   them to lead her to some house of entertainment  her refusals were very   faint  and  perceiving by my look  that I was not very averse   What   shall we do  Miss   said she to me   there is no getting rid of these   men  Shall we venture to go with them  It is but a frolick     I am   under your direction  Mademoiselle  but I see no harm in it  as  to be   sure   replied I   they are gentlemen of honour         In fine  we went into the first house that had the prospect of   affording us an agreeable reception  It is not to be doubted but we were   treated with the best the place we were in could supply  Sir John   declared the most flaming passion for Mademoiselle
