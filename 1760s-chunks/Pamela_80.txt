 I   should be too happy  could I ever have it in my power to contribute in   the least to it  But  alas  to serve me  must be for God s sake only    for I am poor and lowly in fortune  though in mind  I hope  too high to   do a mean or unworthy deed to gain a kingdom  But I lose time            Any way you think best  I should be pleased with  for I know not the   persons  nor in what manner it is best to apply to them  I am glad   of the hint you so kindly give me of the man at the post house  I   was thinking of opening a way for myself by letter  when I could have   opportunity  but I see more and more that I am  indeed  strangely   surrounded with dangers  and that there is no dependance to be made on   my master s honour        I should think  sir  if either of those ladies would give leave  I   might some way get out by favour of your key  and as it is impossible    watched as I am  to know when it can be  suppose  sir  you get one made   by it  and put it  the next opportunity  under the sunflower   I am sure   no time is to be lost  because it is rather my wonder  that she is   not thoughtful about this key  than otherwise  for she forgets not the   minutest thing  But  sir  if I had this key  I could  if these ladies   would not shelter me  run away any where  and if I was once out of the   house  they could have no pretence to force me again  for I have done no   harm  and hope to make my story good to any compassionate body  and by   this way you need not to be known  Torture should not wring it from me    I assure you        One thing more  good sir  Have you no correspondence with my master s   Bedfordshire family  By that means  may be  I could be informed of   his intention of coming hither  and when I enclose you a letter of a   deceitful wretch  for I can trust you with any thing  poor John Arnold    Its contents will tell why I enclose it  Perhaps by his means  something   may be discovered  for he seems willing to atone for his treachery to   me  by the intimation of future service  I leave the hint to you to   improve upon  and am                      Reverend Sir                       Your for ever obliged  and thankful servant         I hope  sir  by your favour  I could send a little packet  now and   then  some how  to my poor father and mother  I have a little stock of   money  about five or six guineas  Shall I put half in your hands  to   defray the charge of a man and horse  or any other incidents           I had but just time to transcribe this  before I was called to dinner    and I put that for Mr  Williams  with a wafer in it  in my bosom  to get   an opportunity to lay it in the dear place       O good sirs  of all the flowers in the garden  the sunflower  sure    is the loveliest   It is a propitious one to me  How nobly my plot   succeeds  But I begin to be afraid my writings may be discovered  for   they grow large  I stitch them hitherto in my under coat  next my linen    But if this brute should search me  I must try to please her  and then   she won t       Well  I am but just come off from a walk in the garden  and have   deposited my letter by a simple wile  I got some horse beans  and we   took a turn in the garden  to angle  as Mrs  Jewkes had promised me  She   baited the hook  and I held it  and soon hooked a lovely carp  Play it    play it  said she  I did  and brought it to the bank  A sad thought just   then came into my head  and I took it  and threw it in again  and O the   pleasure it seemed to have  to flounce in  when at liberty   Why this
