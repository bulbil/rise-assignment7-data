afterwards it appeared that the culprit had thrown himself into the Carthusian convent at Seville  there to pass the remnant of his days in penance       CH  XII     Conclusion of Scipio s story   BAD example sometimes produces the converse of itself  The behaviour of young Velasquez made me think seriously on my own predicament  I began to wrestle with my thievish propensities  and to live like one of the better sort  A confirmed habit of pouncing upon money wherever I could get it  had been contracted by such a long succession of individual acts  that it was no easy matter to say where it should stop  And yet I was in hopes to accomplish my own reformation  under the idea that to become virtuous a man had nothing to do but to contract the desire of being so  I therefore undertook this great work  and heaven seemed to smile upon my efforts  I left off eyeing the old draper s strong box with the carnal regard of avaricious longing  nay  I verily believe  that if it had depended on my own will and pleasure to have turned over the contents to my own use  I should have abstained from the crime of picking and stealing  It must  however  be admitted  that it would have been an unadvisable measure to tempt my new born integrity with meats too strong for its stomach  and Velasquez was nurse enough to keep me on a proper diet   Don Manriquez de Medrano  a young gentleman  knight of Alcantara  was in the habit of coming backwards and forwards to our house  He was a customer  one of our principal in point of rank  if not punctual in point of pay  I had the happiness to find favour with this knight  who never met me without that sort of notice which encouraged conversation  and with that conversation he appeared always to be very much pleased  Scipio  said he  one day  if I had a footman of your kidney  it would be as good as a fortune to me  and if you were not in the service of a man who stands so high in my regards  I should make no scruple about enticing you away  Sir  answered I  you would have very little trouble in succeeding  for I am distractedly partial to people of fashion  it is my weak side  their free and easy manners fascinate me to the extreme of folly  That being the case  replied Don Manriquez  I will at once beg Signor Balthasar to turn you over from his household to mine  he will scarcely refuse me such a request  Accordingly Velasquez was kind and complying  with so much the less violence to his own private feelings  as there seemed no reason to think  that if a man parted with one knavish servant  he might not easily get another in his place  To me the change was all for the better  since a tradesman s service appeared but a beggarly condition in comparison with the office of own man to a knight of Alcantara   To draw a faithful likeness of my new master  I must describe him as a gentleman possessing every requisite of person  figure  manners  and disposition  Nor was that all  for his courage and honour were equal to his other qualities  the goods of fortune were the only good things he wanted  but being the younger son of a family more distinguished by descent than opulence  he was obliged to draw for his expenses on an old aunt living at Toledo  who loved him as her own child  and administered to his occasions with affectionate liberality  He was always well dressed  and everywhere well received  He visited the principal ladies in the city  and among others the Marchioness of Almenara  She was a widow of seventy two  but the centre of attraction to all the fashionable society of Cordova  by the elegance of her manners and the sprightliness of her conversation  men as well as women laid themselves out for an introduction  because her parties conferred at once on the frequenters the patent of good company   My master was one of that lady s most assiduous courtiers  After leaving her one evening  his spirits seemed to be more elevated than was natural to him  Sir  said I  you are evidently in a good deal of agitation  may your faithful servant ask on what account  Has anything happened out of the common way  The young gallant smiled at so home a question  and owned candidly that he had just been engaged in a serious conversation with the Marchioness of Almenara  I will lay a wage  said I  laughing outright  that this moppet of threescore and ten  this girl in her second childhood  has been unfolding to you all the secret movements of a tender  susceptible heart  Do not make a jest of it  answered he  for the fact is  my friend  that the Marchioness is seriously in love with me  She told me that the narrowness of my circumstances was as well known to her as the nobility of my birth  that she had taken a liking to me  and was determined to place me at my ease by marriage  since she could not decently lay her fortune at my feet on any other terms
