  made such profession  or that his nephew had been drowned with   his father   for no sooner had his gains  in his art of diminishing    restored him a little to his spirits  than  thinking his portion of that   profit too little  and insufficient  besides  to raise him to opulence   80 suddenly as he desired  he oast about how to acquire the whole    or at least a great part of his uncle s wealth  at once  He therefore   took a proper place to work in  for his merchandise did not interrupt   him in his main business  at some distance from his uncle s house    and  having conveyed a large sum of money thither to work upon    he directly informed the Holy Office of his tmcle s Judaism  with   directions how to detect him in it  concluding that  when he should   be seized  there would be no inquiry made after the money that   was in his own hands  as he knew it was impossible he should ever   escape from thence  And though this was but a poor pittance in   comparison of the sums which he knew would be forfeited yet he   comforted himself with the thought that it was more than he could   any other way hope to obtain from him  But he was deceived by   his avarice  and justly involved in the ruin which he drew upon his   benefactor  for when the officers of the Inquisition took possession   of his uncle s effects  finding an entry in his books of the money in   his hands  they went directly in quest of it  and that so unexpectedly    that they caught him at his work  beyond a possibility of evasion or   escape      This is a crime never forgiven in any state  He was therefore   immediately delivered up to the civil power  from which he received   a death not less cruel than that of his uncle from the Inquisition    Of all the human sufierings I had yet seen  except in the case of the   sacrifices  this gave me the greatest pleasure  as there is no crime   that can deform the heart of man more than ingratitude      I here changed my service  of course  and entered into that of the   Holy Office  to the judge of which I was delivered the day I was   taken out of the possession of the unfortunate Jew  I have before         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 283     given you my sentiments on the absurdity of thinking to please the   Deity by cruelty to His creatures  in the instance of the human   Passover of the Jews  The same arguments will hold here  and with   this additional force  that cruelty of every kind is  if possible  more   absurd under the Christian dispensation than any other  as  beside   the general laws of nature and reason  the particular laws of Chris    tianity do everywhere clearly and expressly command brotherly   love  tenderness  and compassion  forbidding every appearance of   cruelty under the severest denunciations of wrath      But there has been so much  and that so well said  on this subject   already  and the nature of the sufferings of those unhappy wretches   who are brought before this tribunal are so well known  that I shall   spare myself the pain of the repetition  and only mention one   affair  the circumstances of which appeared singularly affecting to         CHAPTER XXXIX     AN UNCOMMON CRIMINAL APPBABS AT THE TEIBUNAL OP THE HOLY   OFPICE â€”  A LOVB SOENB IN A STEANGB PLACE â€” THE HISTORY OF   PHBEON AND ILISSA     The next day after I came into the possession of the Inquisitor    there appeared at his tribunal a person of a most august presence    though overcast with all the melancholy which his unhappy situa    tion could inspire  He seemed to be advanced in years  but not   past the vigour of life  and was distinguished from the national look   of the Portuguese by an uncommon turn of feature  which showed   him of another people      As soon as he was brought to the place appointed for him  the   Inquisitor  with an awful solemnity in his voice and manner  ad    dressed him thus   â€”       Thou art once more brought to this tribunal  to try if the stub    bornness of thine heart has yet relented  and thou wilt confess thy   guilt          I told thee before  judge of the faith of Christians    replied   the prisoner  with a composed look and determined voice    I told   thee before  and I repeat it again  that I am not conscious of
