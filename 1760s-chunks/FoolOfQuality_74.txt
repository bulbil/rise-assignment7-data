prolific imagination  with   tribes of the same species from head to foot      In this fit of disgust  Susy happened  unfortunately  to step into   the closet  and spied Ned in a dark corner  where he had squatted   and drawn himself up to the size of a hedgehog      She immediately flew at him  like one of the Eumenides  and   dragged him forth to the light  as Hercules is said to have hauled   Cacus from his den  She questioned him with a voice of implacable   authority  and Ned  with humble and ingenuous tears  confessed   the whole adventure  But Susy  no way melted  exclaimed   What  sirrah  have you and your master Harry a mind to   breed an affection in the house  I will remit of no such doings    for I have an utter conversion to beggars  brats and vermin  She   then commanded him to bundle up his old rags  and  driving him   down stairs before her  she dismissed him from the hall door with   a pair of smart boxes on the side of his head  and ordered him   never more to defend her sight      Poor Ned went weeping and wailing from the door  when who   should he see  at about fifty paces distant  but his beloved patron   Harry  who had been cutting a switch from the next hedge  To   him he ran with precipitation  Harry  touched with a compassion    not free from resentment  to see his favourite in tears  demanded   the cause of his apparent distress  which Ned truly related  Our   hero thereupon became thoughtful and moody  and  judging that   Susy had not acted thus without authority  he conceived a general   disgust at a family who had treated him so injuriously in the   person of his Neddy  but  comforting his dependant the best he   could Come  Neddy  says he  don t cry  my man  I will bring   you  that I will  to my own dear dada  and he will welcome and   love you for my sake  Then  making his way through a small   breach in the neighbouring hedge  he ordered Ned to follow him    and flew across the field like a bird of passage  in a direct line to   his patron s      The old gentleman saw him approaching  and gave sign to his   ancient domestic  who withdrew with precipitation  He received   and caressed our hero with more than usual transport And who    my dear  says he  is this pretty little boy that you have got with   you   Harry then  like the Grecian Demosthenes  taking time to   warm himself with the recollection of his own ideas  and setting his   person forth with an action and ardour that determined to prevail    made the following oration     Why  dada  I must tell you how this poor little boy  for he is   a very poor little boy  and his name is Neddy  sir  and he has no   friend in the wide world but you and I  sir   and so  sir  as I was         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  49     telling you  he comes to the door  crying sadly for cold and hunger    for he had no clothes  no daddy nor mammy at all  sir  and I had   a many of them  and that was not fair you know  sir   and I was   in the humour to give him all the dadas and mammas I had in the   world except you  sir  and mammy nurse  And so I took him up    stairs  and I put the clothes upon him that you gave me when   I was a poor little boy  sir   for nobody had to say to them but you   and I  sir   and I knew that you would pity poor little Neddy more   than I pitied him myself  sir  And so  dada  they took my poor   little Neddy to day  and boxed him  and beat him sadly  and turned   him out of doors   and so I met him crying and roaring  and so you   know  sir  how I had nothing to do but to bring him to you  sir    or to stay and cry with him for company  sir      Here orator Harry ceased to speak  except by his tears  which   he could no longer restrain  and which proceeded to plead most   emphatically for him  But his patron took him in his arms  and   kissed the drops from both eyes  and said Do not cry  my darling    for I am yours  my Harry  and all that
