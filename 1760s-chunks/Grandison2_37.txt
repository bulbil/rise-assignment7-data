to quarrel with yourself  you knew not why —And  pray  had you not a fretting▪ gnawing pain in your stomach  that made you I can t tell how to describe it  yet were humble  meek  as if looking out for pity from every body  and ready to pity every body —Were you not attentive to stories of people  young women especially  labouring under doubts and difficulties —Was not your humanity raised  your self consequence lower d  But did you not think suspense the greatest of all torments —I think  my dear  you lived without eating or drinking  yet look d not pining  but fresh —Pure Love is  perhaps  to lovers as the manna of heaven was to the Israelites  But yet  Israelite like  we may be uneasy and murmur at the too much of it —Your rest—I remember it was broken  In your sleep you seemed to be disturbed  You were continually rolling down mountains  or tumbling from precipices—or were borne down by tempests  carried away with sudden inundations  or sinking in deep waters  or flying from fires  thieves  robbers—  How apt are we to recollect  or to try to recollect  when we are apprehensive  that a case may possibly be our own  all those circumstances  of which  while another s  however dear that other might be to us  we had not any clear or adequate ideas —But I know  that such of these as I recollect not from you  must be owing to the danger  to the terror  I was in from the violence of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  Often and often do I dream over again what I suffered from him  I am now imploring mercy from him  and meet with nothing but upbraidings and menaces  He is   92 now stopping my mouth with his handkerchief  His horrible clergyman  if a clergyman he was  is reading the service quite through  And I am contending against the legality of the asserted marriage  At other times  I have escaped  and he is pursuing me  He gains upon my flying feet  and I wake myself with endeavouring in vain to cry out for help   But when fancy is more propitious to me  then comes my rescuer  my deliverer  And he is sometimes a mighty prince  dreams then make me a perfect romancer  and I am a damsel in distress  The milk white palfrey once came in  All the Marvellous takes place  and lyons and tygers are slain  and armies routed  by the puissance of his single arm   Now  do not these resveries convince you  that I owe all my uneasiness to what I suffered from Sir Hargrave s barbarity  I think I must take my aunt s advice  leave London  and then I shall better find out  whether  as all my friends suspect  and as  to be ingenuous  I myself now begin sometimes to fear  a passion stronger than gratitude has not taken hold of my heart  Of this I am sure  My reasoning faculties are weaken d  Miss Grandison says  that  in my illness at Colnebrooke  I was dilirious  and that the doctor they called in was afraid of my head  And should I suffer myself to be entangled in an hopeless passion  there will want no further proof  that my intellects have suffer d   Adieu  my Lucy  What a letter have I written  The conclusion of it  I doubt  will of itself  be a sufficient evidence of the weakness I have mentioned  both of head and heart  of  Your HARRIET     93  LETTER VI  Miss HARRIET BYRON  To Miss LUCY SELBY    Sat  Mar  4   THIS morning Sir Hargrave Pollexfen made Mr  Reeves a visit  He said it was to him  but I was unluckily below  and forced to hear all he had to say  or to appear unpolite   He proposed visiting my grandmamma and aunt Selby  in order to implore their forgiveness  But Mr  Reeves diverted him from thinking of that   He had not sought me  he said  at Lady Betty Williams s  but from his desire  on the character he had heard of me  to pay his addresses to me  in preference to every other woman  He had laid out for several opportunities to get into my company  before he heard I was to dine there  Particularly  he once had resolved to pay a visit in form to my uncle Selby  in Northamptonshire  and had got all his equi in readiness to set out  but heard that I was come to town with Mr  and Mrs  Reeves  He actually then set out  he said  for Peterborough  with intent to propose the affair to my godfather Deane  But found that he was gone to Cambridge  And then  being resolved to try his fate with me  he came to town  and hardly questioned succeeding  when he understood that my friends left me to my own choice  and knowing that he could offer such proposals  as none of the gentlemen who had made pretensions to be  were able to make  His intentions therefore were not sudden  and such as arose upon what he saw of me
