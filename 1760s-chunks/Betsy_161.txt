Mr  Trueworth on this subject all the time he was there    and  at parting  told him he would not ask him to stay dinner that day    because he supposed they would be very busy in unpacking their things    and setting themselves in order  but engaged him to come on the   following       Mr  Trueworth thought no farther on what had passed  than to remember   his promise  which he accordingly fulfilled  Sir Bazil received him with   open arms  and conducted him into the dining room  where the two ladies   were sitting  They were both very handsome  the elder was extremely   graceful  and  at first glance  appeared to be the most striking beauty   of the two  but  on a second  the younger had the advantage  she was not   altogether so tall as her sister  nor had a skin of that dazzling   whiteness  but her shape was exquisite  her complexion clear  her eyes   sparkling  all her features perfectly regular  and accompanied with a   sweetness which had in it somewhat irresistibly attractive       After the first compliments were over  neither of them lost  by their   manner of conversation  any part of that admiration which their eyes had   gained  Mrs  Wellair talked pretty much  yet so agreeably  that nobody   could be tired of hearing her  Miss Harriot spoke much less  but all she   said discovered a delicacy of sentiment  and a judgment far above her   years  Sir Bazil had a large estate  he lived up to the height of it    had a very elegant taste  and  in complaisance to his sisters  as well   as to his friend  who had never dined with him before since he set up   housekeeping  had taken care that day to omit nothing in his bill of   fare that could excite  or gratify  the most luxurious appetite  yet it   was the wit  spirit  and good humour  of the company  especially of Miss   Harriot  which  to Mr  Trueworth  made the most agreeable part of the   entertainment       When the dessert was over  and the healths of absent friends toasted in   Tokay and Frontiniac  they all adjourned into the drawing room  where   coffee and tea were soon brought in  Mrs  Wellair having been advised by   her physicians to refrain from the use of any of those liquors  on   account of some disorder she had complained of  took this opportunity of   desiring leave to retire  in order to acquaint her husband  it being   post night  with her safe arrival in town       Agreeable as her conversation was  Mr  Trueworth found no miss of her    as the lovely Harriot was left behind  on the contrary  he was rather   rejoiced  in the hope she would now give her tongue a greater latitude   than she had done in the presence of one whom  he easily perceived  she   looked upon as her superior in understanding  as well as years  and  to   provoke her to it  artfully introduced some discourse on the pleasures   of the town  and said to Sir Bazil  it seemed to him a kind of miracle    that so young and beautiful a lady as Miss Harriot could content herself   with the obscurity of a country life   Few of her age  indeed   replied   Sir Bazil   could chuse to live in the manner she does  but though I   should  perhaps  not be of the same way of thinking  if I were a woman    and in her place  yet I cannot but say  my reason approves of her   conduct in this point         London   said she   is a very magnificent  opulent city  and those who   have their lot cast to live in it  may  doubtless  find sufficient to   content them  but as for those amusements  which you gentlemen call the   pleasures of the town  and which so many people take every winter such   long journies merely to enjoy  I can see nothing in them which a   reasonable person may not very well dispense with the want of         What do you think of the Court  Madam   cried Mr  Trueworth   As of a   place I would always chuse to avoid   replied she   I heartily pity the   fatigue of those who are obliged to attend  and am tempted to laugh at   the stupidity of those who undertake it without necessity  I am amazed   to think how any one of common sense can be at so great an expence for   rich cloaths  to go to a place where she must suffer as great pain in   shewing them
