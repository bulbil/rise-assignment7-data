hoped  Madam  that cleared as I have been of one imputation  I might have recovered some favour in yours and Lady Bidulph’s thoughts  I was flattered with this consolation     small as it was  when every other hope forsook me  But when an unexpected event again brought happiness within my prospect  this reflection  I own became of more importance  and served to strengthen my then revived hopes  But you dash them with an unrelenting hand  and again build up those barriers between us  that heaven itself had overthrown  What can I say to you  inflexible as you are  has Miss Burchell all your pity  You may command my life  Madam  I would lay it down freely for you  but I cannot  must not  will not give up my love  and till you declare in express terms that I must be miserable  I will not even give up my hope   Orlando Faulkland ’  See  my Cecilia  the heart I have to deal with  Hard to be subdued  and obstinate in all its purposes  I expected difficulties  but was in hopes he would be less determined in regard to his perseverance towards me  I think however I have gained some ground  he acknowleges Miss Burchell’s merit  and seems obliged to her for the part she has acted towards him  I have been under some difficulties on this occasion  for as Miss Burchell was not so candid in her acknowlegements to my mother as she has been to me  I cannot let her know the whole of her confession  for this reason  I only told her the general purport of what I wrote last to Mr Faulkland  and in reading his answer to her  I passed over such passages as I thought might induce her to require an explanation  I own I am a little hurt at Miss Burchell’s former perverting of facts on this occasion  but  as I have already said more than once  there are great allowances to be made for one in her very critical situation  Neither have I the least right to reproach her for it even in my thoughts  for had she been ever so explicit at my mother’s first interview with her  it could not have availed me   You find  my dear  it is necessary I should speak plainly to Mr Faulkland  I shall write to him again  and here you shall have a copy of what I say  but I must lead this violent spirit with gentleness  and endeavour to convince his reason  without wounding his tenderness   Mrs Arnold’s third letter to Mr Faulkland  ‘You give me pleasure  Sir  I begin to descry hopes for your and my amiable friend  I know such a heart as Mr Faulkland’s    cannot be proof against sentiments of gratitude and compassion  it will not be difficult to convert those sentiments into love  when the object is so deserving  Try  Sir  try  the experiment cannot fail  How much to your honour will so noble a triumph be over an ill fated passion  What delightful returns may you not expect from the obliged  the grateful partner of your happiness  Do not call me inflexible  or rigid  filled as I am with gratitude  and a sense of your merit  I should hate myself  if I did not acknowlege that you deserve more from me than it can ever be in my power to repay  I must be plain with you  since you require it  it is impossible I ever can be yours  Sorry I am  that the necessity of circumstances compels me to make so early a declaration  from which I thought my present situation would have exempted me  but I forgive you  Sir  for urging me on this head  and draw a happy presage from your resting your hopes in relation to me  on my own determination  You appeal to my delicacy  whether you ought  with a heart estranged  to offer your hand to Miss Burchell  Were delicacy alone to be consulted  the answer perhaps might be easy  but there are superior considerations in your case to be taken in  Love  without doubt  demands love in return  but where injured honour is to be repaired  where the disgrace of a darling child is to be prevented  those nicer sentiments of the soul must and ought to give way  and I will venture to pronounce  that Miss Burchell would  with raptures  receive the hand which would confer such valuable blessings on her  leaving it to time  and her own unremiting tenderness and assiduity  to get an interest in the heart  which  by such an act  proved its own rectitude  On this subject  I  from experience  am qualified to speak  You know  sir  the interest you once had in me  you cannot think me so light a creature  as to suppose I so soon after my breaking with you  bestowed my affections on another  I did not  obedience to my mother’s commands was the sole motive which engaged my vows to Mr Arnold  and I married him with no other sentiments  those of esteem and gratitude for the great love he bore me  Yet from these seeds sown in my heart  sprung a tender and ardent affection  never
