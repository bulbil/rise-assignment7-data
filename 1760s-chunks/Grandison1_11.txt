  But after all  methinks I hear my correcting uncle ask  May not Lady Betty have better reasons for her conduct in this particular  than she gave you —She may  my uncle  and I hope she has  But I wish she had condescended to give those better reasons  since she gave any  and then you had not been troubled with the impertinent remarks of your saucy kinswoman   Lady Betty was so kind as to take great notice of me  She desired to be one in every party of pleasure that I am to be engaged in  Persons who were often   23 at publick places  she observed  took as much delight in accompanying strangers to them  as if they were their own  The apt comparisons  she said  the new remarks  the pretty wonder  the agreeable passions excited in such  on the occasion  always gave her high entertainment  And she was sure from the observation of such a young Lady  civilly bowing to me  she should be equally delighted and improved  I bowed in silence  I love not to make disqualifying speeches  by such we seem to intimate  that we believe the complimenter to be in earnest  or perhaps  that we think the compliment our due  and want to hear it either repeated or confirmed  and yet  possibly  we have not that pretty confusion  and those transient blushes  ready  which Mr  Greville archly says are always to be at hand when we affect to disclaim the praises given us   Lady Betty was so good as to stop there  tho  the muscles of her agreeable face shewed a polite promptitude  had I  by disclaiming her compliments  provoked them to perform their office   Am I not a saucy creature   I know I am  But I dislike not Lady Betty  for all that   I am to be carried by her to a Masquerade  to a Ridotto  when the season comes  to Ranelagh and Vauxhall  In the mean time  to Balls  Routes  Drums  and so forth  and to qualify me for these latter  I am to be taught all the fashionable games  Did my dear grandmamma  twenty or thirty years ago  think she should live to be told  That to the Dancing master  the Singing or Music master  the high mode would require the Gaming master to be added for the completing of the female education   Lady Betty will kindly take the lead in all these diversions   And now  Lucy  will you not repeat your wishes  that I return to you with a sound heart  And are you not afraid that I shall become a modern fine Lady  As   24 to the latter fear  I will tell you when you shall suspect me—If you find that I prefer the highest of these entertainments  or the Opera itself  well as I love music  to a good Play of our favourite Shakespeare  then  my Lucy  let your heart ake for your Harriet  Then  be apprehensive that she is laid hold on by levity  that she is captivated by the Eye and the Ear  that her heart is infected by the modern taste  and that she will carry down with her an appetite to pernicious gaming  and  in order to support her extravagance  will think of punishing some honest man in marriage   James has signified to Sally his wishes to be allowed to return to Selby house  I have not therefore bought him the new liveries I designed for him on coming to town  I cannot bear an unchearful brow in a servant  and he owning to me  on my talking with him  his desire to return  I have promised that he shall  as soon as Mr  Reeves has provided me with another servant —Silly fellow  But I hope my aunt will not dismiss him upon it  The servant I may hire may not care to go into the country perhaps  or may not so behave  as that I should choose to take him down with me  And James is honest  and his mother would break her heart  if he should be dismissed our service   Several servants have already offered themselves  but  as I think people are answerable for the character of such as they choose for their domestics  I find no small difficulty in fixing  I am not of the mind of that great man  whose good natur d reason for sometimes preferring men no ways deserving  was  that he loved to be a friend to those whom no other person would befriend  This was carrying his goodness very far  if he made it not an excuse for himself  for haveing promoted a man who proved bad afterwards  rather than as supposing him to be so at the time   since else  he seemed not to consider  that every bad man he promoted  ran away with the reward due to a better     25 Mr  and Mrs  Reeves are so kind to me  and their servants are so ready to oblige me  that I shall not be very uneasy  If I cannot soon get one to my mind  Only if I could fix on such a one  and if my grandmamma s Oliver should leave her  as
