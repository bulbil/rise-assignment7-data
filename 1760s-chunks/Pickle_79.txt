wishes  and having lodged one night upon the road  arrived next  day in the afternoon at the garrison  where he found all his friends in  good health  and overjoyed at his return   The commodore  who was by this time turned of seventy  and altogether  crippled by the gout  seldom went abroad  and as his conversation was  not very entertaining  had but little company within doors  so that his  spirits must have quite stagnated  had not they been kept in motion  by the conversation of Hatchway  and received at different times a  wholesome fillip from the discipline of his spouse  who  by the force of  pride  religion  and Cognac  had erected a most terrible tyranny in the  house  There was such a quick circulation of domestics in the family   that every suit of livery had been worn by figures of all dimensions   Trunnion himself had long before this time yielded to the torrent of her  arbitrary sway  though not without divers obstinate efforts to maintain  his liberty  and now  that he was disabled by his infirmities  when  he used to bear his empress singing the loud Orthyan song among the  servants below  he would often in whispers communicate to the lieutenant  hints of what he would do if so be as how he was not deprived of the use  of his precious limbs  Hatchway was the only person whom the temper of  Mrs  Trunnion respected  either because she dreaded his ridicule  or  looked upon his person with eyes of affection  This being the situation  of things in the garrison  it is not to be doubted that the old  gentleman highly enjoyed the presence of Peregrine  who found means to  ingratiate himself so effectually with his aunt  that while he remained  at home  she seemed to have exchanged the disposition of a tigress for  that of a gentle kid  but he found his own mother as implacable  and his  father as much henpecked  as ever   Gamaliel  who now very seldom enjoyed the conversation of his old friend  the commodore  had some time ago entered into an amicable society   consisting of the barber  apothecary  attorney  and exciseman of the  parish  among whom he used to spend the evening at Tunley s  and listen  to their disputes upon philosophy and politics with great comfort and  edification  while his sovereign lady domineered at home as usual   visited with pomp in the neighbourhood  and employed her chief care in  the education of her darling son Gam  who was now in the fifteenth year  of his age  and so remarkable for his perverse disposition  that  in  spite of his mother s influence and authority  he was not only hated   but also despised  both at home and abroad  She had put him under the  tuition of the curate  who lived in the family  and was obliged to  attend him in all his exercises and excursions  This governor was a  low bred fellow  who had neither experience nor ingenuity  but possessed  a large fund of adulation and servile complaisance  by which he had  gained the good graces of Mrs  Pickle  and presided over all her  deliberations in the same manner as his superior managed those of Mrs   Trunnion   He had one day rode out to take the air with his pupil  who  as I have  already observed  was odious to the poor people  for having killed  their dogs and broken their inclosures  and  on account of his hump   distinguished by the title of My Lord  when in a narrow lane they  chanced to meet Peregrine on horseback  The young squire no sooner  perceived his elder brother  for whom he had been instructed to  entertain the most inveterate grudge  than he resolved to insult him en    6 22 15  3 45 PM   passant  and actually rode against him from gallop  Our hero  guessing  his aim  fixed himself in his stirrups  and by a dexterous management  of the reins avoided the shock in such a manner as that their legs only  should encounter  by which means my lord was tilted out of his saddle   and in a twinkling laid sprawling in the dirt  The governor  enraged at  the disgrace of his charge  advanced with great insolence and fury  and  struck at Peregrine with his whip  Nothing could be more agreeable  to our young gentleman than this assault  which furnished him with  an opportunity of chastising an officious wretch  whose petulance and  malice he had longed to punish  He therefore  spurring up his horse  towards his antagonist  overthrew him in the middle of a hedge  Before  he had time to recollect himself from the confusion of the fall  Pickle  alighted in a trice  and exercised his horsewhip with such agility about  the curate s face and ears  that he was fain to prostrate himself before  his enraged conqueror  and implore his forbearance in the most abject  terms  While Peregrine was thus employed  his brother Gam had made shift  to rise and attack him in the rear
