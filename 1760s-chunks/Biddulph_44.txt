to fear that the poor thing loves him  but he never made any addresses to her  and I hope does not suspect it   Things are now gone so far  that my mother and lady Grimston talked to day of settlements  Mr Arnold receives but twelve hundred pounds a year from his estate  his brother’s widow  as I have already told you  having a jointure upon it of three hundred pounds a year  She lives intirely in London  and is  I am told  a very imprudent woman  and not at all esteemed by the family  The elder Mr Arnold and she were married several years  but never had a child  the last two years of his life his wife and he lived separate  her conduct having given room for some suspicions  very injurious to her husband’s honour   The Arnold estate was originally a very considerable one  but has been dissipated by the extravagance of the successive possessors  What remains  however  is quite clear  and is likely to be kept so by the good management of the present owner  His late brother was exceedingly remiss in his affairs  and spent most of his time in London  and if it had not been for Mr Arnold  the mansion house would have fallen to the ground  but his brother lent it to him  and he kept it in repair for his own use  as he is fond of the place  though he has a pretty house in Kent  belonging to another estate of about three hundred pounds a year  which came to him by his mother  for he is the son of a second marriage  And this  till his brother’s death  was the whole of his income  but he is so good an oeconomist  that he always made a genteeler figure on his three hundred pounds a year  than his brother did on twelve   My mother  who you know is integrity itself  thinks that I ought not to have more settled on me than the widow of Mr Arnold’s brother had  whose fortune was superior to mine  Mr Arnold makes a much handsomer proposal  lady Grimston is for laying hold of it  The Dean was for striking a medium  I do not care how they settle it  but I fancy my mother will have her own way in this   She purposes going to town next week  that the wedding— bless me     whose wedding is it that I am talking of so coolly   well—that it may be celebrated in her own house  This to be sure will send Sir George directly out of it  I cannot help it  I am born to give  and to receive vexation   Mr Arnold speaks of taking a house in London  where my mother is to have an apartment whenever she chuses to be in town  This is a pleasing circumstance to me  and she likewise proposes our being sometimes with her at Sidney castle  That is a prospect which loses much of its charms  by the reflection that my dear Cecilia is not there   October 1  All preliminaries are settled  There has been a fuss with parchments this week past  My mother has carried her point  in regard to the jointure  and has made choice of that little estate in Kent to be settled on me  as it is a complete three hundred pounds a year  detached intirely from the rest  and has a pretty house on it  This was all she would accept of  though  to do Mr Arnold justice  he would have been much more liberal  but  my mother says  a single woman  bred in retirement as I have been  who cannot live on that  does not deserve to live at all  adding  that as the estate was already subject to one jointure  and the widow so young a woman  if it should be also my misfortune to become one early  a great part of the fortune would be swallowed by dowagers  and the heir not have enough to support his rank   October 2  This morning my mother  lady Grimston  the Dean  and Mr Arnold  who is the idol of them all  took a rumbling together in the old coach  by way of taking the air  in a dusty road  and what do you think was the result of their deliberations in this jaunt  Why truly lady Grimston  proud of her handy work  would needs see it accomplished  and nothing will serve her  but I must be married at her house  My mother opposed it at first  but the Dean seconded the proposal  that he might have  as he expressed himself  the satisfaction of contributing himself to make Mr Arnold happy  and Mr Arnold  audaciously expecting  I suppose  that this would hasten the ceremony  joined his intreaties so effectually  that my mother was obliged to yield   What a tormenting old woman is this lady Grimston  I hoped  at    least  for the respite of a month  by getting to London  I thought first to have delayed the time of our going to town  and then to have faddled away a good while longer under pretence of preparations  though there is but little room for that now  as all my
