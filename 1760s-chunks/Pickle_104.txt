ordered his servant to get everything ready for his departure by break  of day  and when our adventurer rose next morning  he found that his  fellow travellers were gone above three hours  though they had agreed  to stay all the forenoon  with a view of seeing the prince of Conde s  palace  and to proceed all together for Paris in the afternoon   Peregrine was a little chagrined  when he understood that he was so  suddenly deprived of this untasted morsel  and Jolter could not conceive  the meaning of their abrupt and uncivil disappearance  which  after many  profound conjectures  he accounted for  by supposing that Hornbeck  was some sharper who had run away with an heiress  whom he found it  necessary to conceal from the inquiry of her friends  The pupil  who  was well assured of the true motive  allowed his governor to enjoy the  triumph of his own penetration  and consoled himself with the hope of  seeing his dulcinea again at some of the public places in Paris  which  he proposed to frequent  Thus comforted  he visited the magnificent  stables and palace of Chantilly  and immediately after dinner set out  for Paris  where they arrived in the evening  and hired apartments at an  hotel in the Faubourg St  Germaine  not far from the playhouse   CHAPTER XXXIX   He is involved in an Adventure at Paris  and taken prisoner by the City  Guard  Becomes acquainted with a French Nobleman  who introduces him in  the Beau Monde   They were no sooner settled in these lodgings  than our hero wrote to  his uncle an account of their safe arrival  and sent another letter to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   his friend Gauntlet  with a very tender billet inclosed for his dear  Emilia  to whom he repeated all his former vows of constancy and love   The next care that engrossed him was that of bespeaking several suits  of clothes suitable to the French mode  and  in the mean time  he never  appeared abroad  except in the English coffee house  where he soon  became acquainted with some of his own countrymen  who were at Paris on  the same footing with himself  The third evening after his journey  he  was engaged in a party of those young sparks  at the house of a noted  traiteur  whose wife was remarkably handsome  and otherwise extremely  well qualified for alluring customers to her house  To this lady our  young gentleman was introduced as a stranger fresh from England  and  he was charmed with her personal accomplishments  as well as with the  freedom and gaiety of her conversation  Her frank deportment persuaded  him that she was one of those kind creatures who granted favours to the  best bidder  on this supposition he began to be so importunate in  his addresses  that the fair bourgeoise was compelled to cry aloud  in defence of her own virtue  Her husband ran immediately to her  assistance  and finding her in a very alarming situation  flew upon her  ravisher with such fury  that he was fain to quit his prey  and turn  against the exasperated traiteur  whom he punished without mercy for  his impudent intrusion  The lady  seeing her yoke fellow treated with  so little respect  espoused his cause  and  fixing her nails in his  antagonist s face  sacrificed all one side of his nose  The noise of  this encounter brought all the servants of the house to the rescue of  their master  and Peregrine s company opposing them  a general battle  ensued  in which the French were totally routed  the wife insulted  and  the husband kicked downstairs   The publican  enraged at the indignity which had been offered to him and  his family  went out into the street  and implored the protection of  the guet  or city guard  which  having heard his complaint  fixed their  bayonets and surrounded the door  to the number of twelve or fourteen   The young gentlemen  flushed with their success  and considering the  soldiers as so many London watchmen whom they had often put to flight   drew their swords  and sallied out  with Peregrine at their head   Whether the guard respected them as foreigners  or inexperienced youths  intoxicated with liquor  they opened to right and left  and gave them  room to pass without opposition  This complaisance  which was the effect  of compassion  being misinterpreted by the English leader  he  out of  mere wantonness  attempted to trip up the heels of the soldier that  stood next him  but failed in the execution  and received a blow on his  breast with the butt end of a fusil  that made him stagger several paces  backward  Incensed at this audacious application  the whole company  charged the detachment sword in hand and  after an obstinate engagement   in which divers wounds were given and received  every soul of them was  taken  and conveyed to the main guard  The commanding officer being made  acquainted with the circumstances of the quarrel  in consideration  of their youth and
