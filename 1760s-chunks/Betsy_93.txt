so ill judged a pride  among other things    she told her  that  in compassion to the despair that gentleman had so   feelingly expressed in his letter  she ought to give him the consolation   of knowing  that if he had not gained so far on her affections as he   wished  it was not because his rival had gained more  and added  that   the steps she persuaded her to take  were such as common justice to her   own character had a right to exact from her       Miss Betsy heard  but was not to be prevailed upon by all she could say   on this subject  but the other  who had a greater share of artifice than   perhaps was ever known in one of her years  would not give over the   design she had formed in her head  and  perceiving that the writing to a   man was the greatest objection Miss Betsy had to letting Mr  Staple know   she was not so much attached to his rival as he imagined  took another   way of working her to her purpose  which she thought would be less   irksome        Well  then  my dear Miss Betsy   said she  in the most flattering   accent   I will tell you the only method you can take  and I am glad I   have been so lucky to hit upon it  you shall let me go and make Mr    Staple a visit  as of my own accord  I shall take care not to drop a   syllable that may give him room to think you know of my coming  but yet    as he may suppose I am enough in your secrets to be mistress of this  or   at least not altogether a stranger to it  he will  doubtless  say   something to me concerning the matter  but if he should not  it will be   easy for me  in the way of discourse  and as it were by chance  to   express myself in such terms as will entirely clear you  and rid him of   all the apprehensions he is under  of your being in love with Mr    Trueworth        Miss Betsy was not in her heart at all averse to Mr  Staple s having   that eclaircissement Miss Flora had mentioned  and was much less shocked   at this proposal than she had been at the former  offered to her   consideration for that purpose  yet did not seem to come into it  till   the other had lavished all the arguments that woman  witty and wilful to   obtain her ends  could urge to prevail on her to do so  and at last   consented not to the execution  without exacting from Miss Flora the   most solemn vow of an inviolable secrecy       This project being concluded on  and everything relating to it settled   while they were dressing  they went together according to their promise    to the ladies who expected them  and then accompanied them into the   Park  but as if this was to be a day of surprizes to Miss Betsy  she   here met with something which gave her  at least  an equal share with   that she had received from the letter of Mr  Staple       They had not gone many yards in the Mall before they saw three gentlemen   coming towards them  one of whom  as they drew nearer to each other    Miss Betsy and Miss Flora presently knew to be the son of Alderman   Saving  though he was grown fatter  more ruddy  and in many respects   much altered from what he was when he visited at Mr  Goodman s       As our young ladies had not heard of this gentleman s return to England    it was natural for them  especially Miss Betsy  after what had passed   between them  to be in some little surprize at the sudden sight of him    he was in some confusion too  but both parties had presence enough of   mind to recover themselves  so as to salute as persons would do  who   never had any thing more than an ordinary acquaintance with each other       After the civilities common to people who thus meet by accident  Mr    Saving asked the ladies leave for himself and friends to join company    which being readily granted  they all walked up the Mall together  but   the place being pretty full  were obliged to divide themselves  and walk   in couples  or as it happened  During this promenade  Mr  Saving found   an opportunity of saying to Miss Betsy  unheard by any of the others     Madam  I have something to acquaint you with  of great consequence to   yourself  it is improper for me either to come or write to you at Mr
