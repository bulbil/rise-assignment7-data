of the Indians who assisted   the English expedition to relieve Oswego and Fort William Henry          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 351       And pray  sir  how much time will this course of operations   take up           I cannot exactly say   but not above a month or two  I   imagine          A month or two   Why  sir  I hope we shall have done the   most troublesome part of our work by that time  or else I do not   know what may be the consequence  For to be plain with you    these delays will never do with the uncivilized Americans  who   judge of things only by common sense  and cannot be made to   comprehend this way of carrying on a war  by l3dng still in a camp    and doing nothing  They have formed very disadvantageous   notions of the delays already made  and think a man who does   not advance to fight his enemy is afraid of him   and  therefore    if they are not led to action directly  they will desert   so that  if   I stay a month or two here at school  to learn a lesson I may never   have occasion for  I must find other forces to put it in practice   with          Cannot you devise any reason that may account for your stay    ing  to their satisfaction           Really  sir  not I  I never was good at devising reasons desti    tute of truth  in my life  and have entirely forgot the practice since   I have conversed with the Americans  who are far from being such   fools as they are too generally thought to be  Though they have   not the advantages of learning  they see  by the light of natural   reason  through all the boasted wiles of policy  and  as they never   mean deceit themselves  detest it in others  however speciously   disguised  nor ever place confidence a second time where it has been   once abused          How   The Americans never mean deceit   Surely you must   know better  They are the most perfidious  deceitful savages that   burthen the earth  and it would be an advantage to the world if the   whole race of them was exterminated          Such as them as converse much with civilized Europeans  it is   too true  learn many things from them  which are a disgrace to   their own savage nature  as you call it  But I speak of the general   disposition of the people  Treat them with candour  probity    and tenderness  and they will return them tenfold  in all their   intercourse with you  as  on the other hand  they seldom fail to   retort the contrary treatment with severe usury  Nor are they to   be blamed  In all their dealings with the Europeans  they find   themselves imposed upon in the grossest maimer  in a manner not   fit to be practised  even with brutes  Their sensibility is quick    and their passions ungovemed  perhaps ungovernable   how  then    can it be wondered at that they make returns in kind  whenever   they find opportunity  and become the most dangerous enemies     Whereas  if those passions were attached by good treatment    they would be the most affectionate  steady  and careful friends    I speak from experience  I treat them as rational creatures  and   they behave as such to me  I never deceive them  and they never   deceive me  I do them all the good offices in my power  and they   return them manifold  In short  I practice to them the behaviour   which I wish to meet from them  and am never disappointed          352 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     All the evils which have been suffered from them have proceeded   from the unhappy error of thinking ourselves possessed of a superi    ority over them  which Nature  that is  Heaven  has not given us    They are our fellow creatures  and  in general  above our level in   the virtues which give real pre eminence  however despicably we   think of  and injuriously we treat them          They are much obliged to your character of them  at least    whatever others may do  And pray  sir  what is it you would   have me do to preserve the good opinion of these most virtuous   people           I presume not  sir
