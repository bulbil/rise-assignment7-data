their menaces together  that he drew    and stood upon his defence  and was so much in earnest  that the man he   pushed into the arm  and disabled  and pressing pretty forward upon   the other  as he retreated  he rushed in upon him near the top of the   stairs  and pushed him down one pair  and he was much hurt by the fall    Not but that  he said  he might have paid for his rashness  but that   the business of his antagonists was rather to frighten than to kill   him  That  upon this  in the sight of the old lady  the parson she had   provided  and her other daughters  he went out of their house  with   bitter execrations against them all       That after this  designing to break off all correspondence with the   whole family  and miss too  she found means to engage him to give her   a meeting at Woodstock  in order to clear herself  That  poor lady  she   was there obliged  naughty creature as he was  to make herself quite   guilty of a worse fault  in order to clear herself of a lighter    That they afterwards met at Godstow often  at Woodstock  and every   neighbouring place to Oxford  where he was then studying  as it proved    guilty lessons  instead of improving ones  till  at last  the effect   of their frequent interviews grew too obvious to be concealed  That the   young lady then  when she was not fit to be seen  for the credit of the   family  was confined  and all manner of means were used  to induce him   to marry her  That  finding nothing would do  they at last resolved   to complain to his father and mother  but that he made his sister   acquainted with the matter  who then happened to be at home  and  by her   management and spirit  their intentions of that sort were frustrated    and  seeing no hopes  they agreed to Lady Davers s proposals  and sent   poor miss down to Marlborough  where  at her expense  which he answered   to her again  she was provided for  and privately lay in  That Lady   Davers took upon herself the care of the little one  till it came to be   fit to be put to the boarding school  where it now is  And that he had   settled upon the dear little miss such a sum of money  as the interest   of it would handsomely provide for her  and the principal would be   a tolerable fortune  fit for a gentlewoman  when she came to be   marriageable  And this  my dear  said he  is the story in brief  And   I do assure you  Pamela  added he  I am far from making a boast of  or   taking a pride in  this affair  But since it has happened  I can t say   but I wish the poor child to live  and be happy  and I must endeavour to   make her so       Sir  said I  to be sure you should  and I shall take a very great pride   to contribute to the dear little soul s felicity  if you will permit me   to have her home   But  added I  does miss know any thing who are her   father and mother  I wanted him to say if the poor lady was living or   dead   No  answered he  Her governess has been told  by my sister  that   she is the daughter of a gentleman and his lady  who are related  at   a distance  to Lord Davers  and now live in Jamaica  and she calls me   uncle  only because I am the brother to Lady Davers  whom she calls   aunt  and who is very fond of her  as is also my lord  who knows the   whole matter  and they have her  at all her little school recesses  at   their house  and are very kind to her       I believe  added he  the truth of the matter is very little known   or suspected  for  as her mother is of no mean family  her friends   endeavour to keep it secret  as much as I  and Lady Davers  till her   wrath boiled over  t other day  has managed the matter very dexterously   and kindly       The words  mother is of no mean family  gave me not to doubt the poor   lady was living  And I said  But how  sir  can the dear miss s poor   mother be content to deny herself the enjoyment of so sweet a child    Ah  Pamela  replied he  now you come in  I
