than my existence       Tell her my heart is hers  that I will receive her as my guardian angel  that we will never part  that we will be friends  that we will be sisters  that I will omit nothing possible to make her happy with my brother in England  and that I have very rational hopes it may be in time accomplished  but that  if she marries him in Canada  and suffers him to pursue his present design  she plants a dagger in the bosom of her who gave him life       I scarce know what I would say  my dear Bell  but I am wretched  I have no hope but in you  Yet if Emily is all you represent her       I am obliged to break off  my mother is here  she must not see this letter   Adieu  your affectionate  LUCY TEMPLE     LETTER CXLII   142   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  May 21   YOUR letter of the 8th of April  my dear  was first read by Emily  being one of the three I gave her for that purpose  as I before mentioned       She went through it  and melting into tears  left the room without speaking a word  she has been writing this morning  and I fancy to you  for she enquired when the mail set out for England  and seemed pleased to hear it went to day       I am excessively shocked at your account of Mrs  Rivers  assure her  in my name  of your brother s immediate return  I know both him and Emily too well to believe they will sacrifice her to their own happiness  there is nothing  on the contrary  they will not suffer rather than even afflict her       Do not  however  encourage an idea of ever breaking an attachment like theirs  an attachment founded less in passion than in the tenderest friendship  in a similarity of character  and a sympathy the most perfect the world ever saw       Let it be your business  my Lucy  to endeavor to make them happy  and to remove the bars which prevent their union in England  and depend on seeing them there the very moment their coming is possible       From what I know of your brother  I suppose he will insist on marrying Emily before he leaves Quebec  but  after your letter  which I shall send him  you may look on his return as infallible       I send all yours and Temple s letters for your brother to day  you may expect to hear from him by the same mail with this       I have only to say  I am   A  FERMOR     LETTER CXLIII   143   To Colonel RIVERS  at Quebec   London  April 8   MY own happiness  my dear Rivers  in a marriage of love  makes me extremely unwilling to prevent your giving way to a tenderness  which promises you the same felicity  with so amiable a woman as both you and Bell Fermor represent Miss Montague to be       But  my dear Ned  I cannot  without betraying your friendship  and hazarding all the quiet of your future days  dispense with myself from telling you  though I have her express commands to the contrary  that the peace  perhaps the life  of your excellent mother  depends on your giving up all thoughts of a settlement in America  and returning immediately to England       I know the present state of your affairs will not allow you to marry this charming woman here  without descending from the situation you have ever held  and which you have a right from your birth to hold  in the world       Would you allow me to gratify my friendship for you  and shew  at the same time  your perfect esteem for me  by commanding  what our long affection gives you a right to  such a part of my fortune as I could easily spare without the least inconvenience to myself  we might all be happy  and you might make your Emily so  but you have already convinced me  by your refusal of a former request of this kind  that your esteem for me is much less warm than mine for you  and that you do not think I merit the delight of making you happy       I will therefore say no more on this subject till we meet  than that I have no doubt this letter will bring you immediately to us       If the tenderness you express for Miss Montague is yet conquerable  it will surely be better for both it should be conquered  as fortune has been so much less kind to each of you than nature  but if your hearts are immoveably fixed on each other  if your love is of the kind which despises every other consideration  return to the bosom of friendship  and depend on our finding some way to make you happy       If you persist in refusing to share my fortune  you can have no objection to my using all my interest  for a friend and brother so deservedly dear to me  and in whose happiness I shall
