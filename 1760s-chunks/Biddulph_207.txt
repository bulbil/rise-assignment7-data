a suitable return for their friendly reception of him during so long a time  made him resolve not to continue there  and the more so  as Miss Bond  who was present when he proposed it to Mrs Faulkland  seemed to wish for their departure  as she dissented from that lady with regard to her opinion of the state of the new house  and seemed to think there could no danger attend their immediate entrance into it  Mrs Faulkland seemed nettled at this  and immediately assented to her husband’s proposal  the next day they took their leave of Mr Bond’s family  and repaired to their own house   Mr Faulkland  from this period  remarked a change in his wife’s behaviour  she grew melancholy and peevish  but as she complained of not being well  he imputed the alteration in her temper to that alone  and the more so  as she did not abate in the tokens of her seeming affection for him   Mr Bond’s family frequently visited them  Major Smyth always made one of the party  and often came without them  Though they lived but at the distance of three miles from each other  yet as the road for carriages between the two houses  being a cross one  was very bad  the ladies were often prevailed on  if they staid late  to lye a night at Mr Faulkland’s  and in consequence of this  Mr Bond and the Major had frequently done the same when they were of the party   Though Mr Faulkland was far from having any injurious suspicion of his wife  he could not help observing that all her complaints vanished  whenever this family were at her house  This  however  he ascribed to nothing more than her being fond of the company  though he thought a coolness between her  and the eldest Miss Bond  was still apparent  The principals of the family  however     behaved with their usual frankness and good humour  and Mr Faulkland thought there might be some little female pique between the two ladies  which was not worth enquiring into   As they punctually returned the friendly visits of these agreeable neighbours  Mrs Faulkland always proposed passing the night there  to induce them  as she said  to use the same obliging freedom at her house  Mr Faulkland  on those occasions observed  that his lady always rose much earlier than usual  but unsuspecting as he was  he was satisfied with the reason she assigned for it  that of enjoying the pleasant hours of the morning in a very delicious garden  a pleasure which they could not have at home  as Mr Faulkland’s improvements were only in their infancy   The mutual intercourse between the two families was thus carried on for more than three months  when the time drew near  that Miss Bond and her lover were to be united  and every thing was preparing for the purpose  The young Mr Bond was come home from the college  and the house on this occasion was more chearful than ever  Mr Faulkland and his lady were there at a ball one night  when the latter  after dancing a long time  complained suddenly of being violently ill and either really did  or pretended to  faint  She was immediately conveyed to bed  and  at her request  another room prepared for Mr Faulkland  He  extremely alarmed at her indisposition  came to her bed side  purposing to sit up by her the whole night  the youngest of the Miss Bond’s offering to do the same  but Mrs Faulkland absolutely refused them both  and about midnight  saying she found herself inclined to sleep  insisted on their retiring  nor would she admit a servant to stay in the room  but contented herself with having a candle burning on the hearth   Mr Faulkland  who really had an affection for his lady  was impatient the next morning to enquire after her health  he found her in bed  the complaints of the preceding night all renewed   The family were extremely disconcerted at this unlucky accident  and expresed the utmost uneasiness  all but the eldest Miss Bond  who was silent  and heard her mother and sisters condoling with Mr Faulkland  not only with unconcern  but a suppressed smile of contempt  which did not escape Mr Faulkland’s observation  He now began to resent such a behaviour  which he thought very unkind  and told his lady he wished she was in a condition to be removed  as he was fearful in her present situation it might be very inconvenient to the family to have her remain sick in their house  especially as it quite    broke in on the mirth and festivity which were now going forward   To this she replied  that she found herself so weak and dispirited  which she said was always the consequence of those faintings  to which she had been subject from her childhood  that she could not think of leaving her room  She made a shift  however  to rise  and said she hoped in a day or two to be able to remove   Mrs Bond  who was of an extremely humane and tender disposition  begged of her not to think of stirring till she found her health perfectly re established  Mrs Faulkland thankfully accepted her offer  and Mr Faulkland
