In my conscience  Harriet  look all my acquaintance through  of both Sexes  I think there are three silly fellows to one silly woman  Don t you think so in yours —Are your Grevilles  your Fenwicks  your Ormes  your Fowlers  your Pollexfens  your Bagenhalls  and half a score more I could name  to be put in competition with Mrs  Shirley  Mrs  Selby  Lady D  our Lucy  Nancy  Miss Orme  the two Miss Holles s —Let uncle Selby and cousin James determine on the question   I am half in hopes  that the little rogue Emily will draw herself in  Beauchamp is modest  yet not sheepish  he is prudent  manly  lively  has address  He will certainly draw her in  before she knows where she is  And how  Why by praising sincerely  and loving cordially  the man at present most dear to her  When he first addressed her at St  Alban s  O Mr  Beauchamp  said she  with an innocent freedom  not regarding his tremblings  his glow  and his falterings  I am glad to see you  I long to have you entertain me with stories of my guardian  But  ah  Sir  speaking lower  and with a fallen countenance  tears ready to start  Whose  whose is he by this time  Yet  if you know it  don t tell me  It must not  must not be   The praises given to those we really love  I believe  are more grateful to us than those conferred on ourselves  I will tell you how I account for this  in general cases  my brother out of the question —We doubt not our own merits  but may be afraid  that Page  123 the favoured object will not be considered by others as we are willing to consider him  But if he is  we take the praise given him as a compliment to our own judgment  Self love  self love  at the bottom of all we say and do  I am convinced it is  notwithstanding all you have urged to the contrary  Generally  you know  I said  Do you think I will allow you to judge of the generality of the world by what you find in one of the best hearts in it   An instance  in point—I remember a Miss Hurste  a sweet pretty creature  and very sensible  She had from her chamber window been shot through the heart by the blind archer  who took his stand on the feather of a military man marching at the head of his company through the market town in which she lived  Yet was her susceptibility her only inducement  for the man was neither handsome in his person  nor genteel in his appearance  Nor could she be in Love with the sense of a man  had he been a Solomon  whose mouth she never saw opened  and to whose character she was as much a stranger  as he was to hers  or her person  till she contrived to have him made acquainted with his good fortune  Constant  however  to her first foolish impression  she  in opposition to all advice  and the expostulations of a tender and indulgent mother  married him  A Solomon he was not  And when he at any time  by virtue of his relation to her  was introduced into her family  how would she blush  whenever he opened his mouth  And how did her eyes sparkle with gratitude upon any one who took the least respectful notice of him  Compliments to herself were unheeded  but she seemed ready to throw herself at the feet of those who smiled upon  and directed themselves to  her Captain  Poor girl  she wanted to give credit to the motive by which she had been acted   Now  Harriet  I charge you  that you think not that this man s name was Anderson  Somebody met Page  124 with an escape  Yet now and then I blush for Some body  Yet between this Some body and Miss Hurste s cases there was this difference—A father s apprehended—Tyranny— shall I call it   impressing the one  a tindery fit the other  In the one a timely recovery  in the other  the first folly deliberately confirmed   Dear  dear Harriet  let me make you smile —I protest  if you won t  I will talk of Lord D  and then I know you will frown   The excellent Lady of that name has already been to welcome us to town  She absolutely dotes upon you  so  she says  does the young Earl  She prays day and night  she tells me  that my brother may soon come to England  his Italian bride in his hand  She expects every post to hear from Sir Arthur Brandon  who has carried a Letter from her  and another from the Earl of N  recommending that promising young gentleman to my brother s favour  on his visiting Italy  She hopes my brother will not take amiss her freedom  at so short an acquaintance  If Sir Arthur sends her such news as she wishes  and we dread  to hear  away drives she to Northamptonshire—And should she  I don t know who will scruple
