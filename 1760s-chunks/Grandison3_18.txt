favour  and her merit so extraordinary  it must do  Don t you remember what the old song says   When Phoebus does his beams display   To tell men gravely  that  tis day   Is  to suppose them blind   All I want  methinks  is  to have them oftener together  Idleness  I believe  is a great friend to Love  I wish his affairs would let him be a little idle  They must be dispatched soon  be they what they will  for Lord L  said  that when he is master of a subject  his execution is as swift as thought  Sir Charles hinted  that he should soon be obliged to go to France  Seas are nothing to him  Dr  Bartlett said  that he considers all nations as joined on the same continent  and doubted not but if he had a call  he would undertake a journey to Constantinople or Pekin  with as little difficulty as some others would  he might have named me for one  to the Land s end  Indeed he appears to be just that kind of man  Yet he seems not to have any of that sort of fire in his constitution  that goes off with a bounce  and leaves nothing but vapour aod smoke behind it   You are in doubt about our girl s fortune  It is not a despicable one  He may  no question  have a woman with a much greater  and so may she a man —What say you to Lady D s proposal  rejected for his sake    44 at hap hazard too  as the saying is  But let it once come to that question  and leave it to me to answer it   You bid me remark how Harriet looks  She is as lovely as ever  but I think  not quite so lively  and somewhat paler  but it is a clear and healthy  not a sickly paleness  And there is a languor in her fine eyes  that I never saw in them before  She never was a pert girl  but she has more meekness and humility in her countenance  than  methinks  I would wish her to have  because it gives to Miss Grandison  who has fine spirits  some advantages  in conversation  over Harriet  that  if she had  methinks she should not take  But they perfectly understand one another   But now for a word or two about Miss Jervois  I could not but take notice to our Miss Byron  of the greediness  with which she eats and drinks the praises given her guardian  of the glow that overspreads her cheeks  and of a sigh that now and then seems to escape even her own observation  when he is spoken of  so like a neice of mine  that drew herself in  and was afterwards unhappy  and by these symptoms I conclude  that this young creature is certainly giving way to Love  She has a very great fortune  is a pretty girl  and an improving beauty  She is tall and womanly  I thought her sixteen or seventeen  but  it seems  she is hardly fourteen  There is as much difference in girls  as in fruits  as to their maturing  as I may say  My mother  I remember  once said of an early bloom in a neice of her s  that such were born to woe  I hope it won t be so with this  for she certainly is a good young creature  but has not had great opportunities of knowing either the world or herself  Brought up in a confined manner in her father s house at Leghorn  till twelve or thirteen  whatopportunities could she have  No mother s wings to be sheltered under  Her mother s wickedness giving occasion the more to streighten her education  and at a time of life so young  and in so restraining a country as Italy  for girls and   45 young maidens  and  since brought over  put to board with a retired country gentlewoman—What can she know  poor thing  She has been but a little while with Miss Grandison  and that but as a guest  So that the world before her is all new to her  And  indeed  there seems to be in her pretty wonder  and honest declarations of her whole heart  a simplicity that sometimes borders upon childishness  tho  at other times a kind of womanly prudence  I am not afraid of her on our Harriet s account  and yet Harriet  Lover like  perhaps   was alarmed at my hinting it to her  But I am on her own  I wish  as I said before  Sir Charles were more among them  He would soon discover whose Love is fit to be discountenanced  and whose to be encouraged  and  by that means  give ease to twenty hearts  For I cannot believe that such a man as this would be guilty  I will call it  of reserve to such a young Lady as ours  were he but to have the shadow of a thought that he has an interest in her heart   My affairs are more untoward than I expected  But on my return to Peterborough I will call at Shirley house
