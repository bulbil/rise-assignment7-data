the maid  told him  that lady  desired to know what would be her destiny in point of marriage  The  philosopher  without lifting up his eyes to view the person in whose  behalf he was consulted  turned his ear to one of the sable familiars  that purred upon his shoulder  and  taking up the pen  wrote upon a  detached slip of paper these words  which Peregrine  at the desire  of the ladies  repeated aloud   Her destiny will  in a great measure   depend upon what happened to her about nine o clock in the morning on  the third day of last December    This sentence was no sooner pronounced  than the counterfeit lady  screamed  and ran into the ante chamber  exclaiming   Christ have mercy  upon us  Sure he is the devil incarnate   Her mistress  who followed her  with great consternation  insisted upon knowing the transaction to which  the response alluded  and Mrs  Abigail  after some recollection  gave  her to understand that she had an admirer  who  on that very hour and  day mentioned by the cunning man  had addressed himself to her in  a serious proposal of marriage  This explanation  however  was more  ingenious than candid  for the admirer was no other than the identical  Mr  Pickle himself  who was a mere dragon among the chambermaids  and   in his previous information communicated to his associate  had given  an account of this assignation  with which he had been favoured by the  damsel in question   Our hero seeing his company very much affected with the circumstance  of the wizard s art  which had almost frightened both mistress and  maid into hysteric fits  pretended to laugh them out of their fears  by  observing  that there was nothing extraordinary in this instance of  his knowledge  which might have been acquired by some of those secret  emissaries whom such impostors are obliged to employ for intelligence   or imparted by the lover himself  who had  perhaps  come to consult  him about the success of his amour  Encouraged by this observation  or  rather prompted by an insatiable curiosity  which was proof against all  sorts of apprehension  the disguised lady returned to the magician s own  apartment  and  assuming the air of a pert chambermaid   Mr  Conjurer    said she   now you have satisfied my mistress  will you be as good as  to tell me if ever I shall be married   The sage  without the least  hesitation  favoured her with an answer  in the following words   You  cannot be married before you are a widow  and whether or not that will  ever be the case  is a question which my art cannot resolve  because my  foreknowledge exceeds not the term of thirty years    This reply  which at once cut her off from her pleasing prospect of  seeing herself independent in the enjoyment of youth and fortune  in  a moment clouded her aspect  all her good humour was overcast  and she    6 22 15  3 45 PM   went away  without further inquiry  muttering in the rancour of her  chagrin  that he was a silly impertinent fellow  and a mere quack in  his profession  Notwithstanding the prejudice of this resentment  her  conviction soon recurred  and when the report of his answers was made  to those confederates by whom she had been deputed to make trial of  his skill  they were universally persuaded that his art was altogether  supernatural  though each affected to treat it with contempt  resolving  in her own breast to have recourse to him in private   In the meantime  the maid  though laid under the most peremptory  injunctions of secrecy  was so full of the circumstance which related to  her own conduct  that she extolled his prescience  in whispers  to all  acquaintances  assuring them  that he had told her all the particulars  of her life  so that his fame was almost instantaneously conveyed   through a thousand different channels  to all parts of the town  and   the very next time he assumed the chair  his doors were besieged by  curious people of all sects and denominations   Being an old practitioner in this art  Cadwallader knew it would be  impossible for him to support his reputation in the promiscuous exercise  of fortune telling  because every person that should come to consult him  would expect a sample of his skill relating to things past  and it could  not be supposed that he was acquainted with the private concerns of  every individual who might apply to him for that purpose  He  therefore   ordered his minister  whom he distinguished by the name of Hadgi Rourk   to signify to all those who demanded entrance  that his price was half a  guinea  and that all such as were not disposed to gratify him with that  consideration  would do well to leave the passage free for the rest   This declaration succeeded to his wish  for this congregation consisted  chiefly of footmen  chambermaids
