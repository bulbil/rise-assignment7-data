example  I was in love with a girl of some family at Oviedo  and was beloved by her in return  I asked her of her father in marriage  he refused  Many a young fellow would have died of grief  but no  mark my spirit  I carried off the little baggage  She was lively  heedless  and coquettish  pleasure consequently was always uppermost to the prejudice of duty  I took her with me for six months backwards and forwards about Galicia  thence  adopting my taste for travelling  she had a mind to go to Portugal  but in other company    more food for despair  Yet I did not give in under the weight of this new affliction  but  improving on Menelaus  thought myself much obliged to the Paris who had whispered in the ear of my Helen  for ridding me of a bad bargain  I therefore determined to keep the peace  After that  not finding it convenient to return to the Asturias and balance accounts with justice  I went forward into the kingdom of Leon  spending between one town and another all the loose cash remaining from the rape of my Indian princess  for we had both of us birdlimed our fingers at our departure from Oviedo  I got to Palencia with a solitary ducat  out of which I was obliged to buy a pair of shoes  The remainder would not go far  My situation became rather perplexing  I began already to be reduced to short allowance  something must be done  I resolved to go out to service  My first place was with a woollen draper in a large way  whose son was a lad of wit and fashion  here was a complete antidote to fasting  but then there was a little awkwardness  The father ordered me to dog the son  the son begged my assistance in imposing on the father  it was necessary to take one side or other  Entreaties sound more musical than commands  and my taste for music got me turned out of doors  The next service I entered into was with an old painter  who undertook  as a matter of favour  to teach me the principles of his art  but he was so busy in feeding me with knowledge  that he forgot to give me any meat  This neglect of substance for shadow disgusted me with my abode at Palencia  I came to Valladolid  where  by the greatest good luck in the world  I was hired by a governor of the hospital  I am with him still  and delighted with my quarters  My master  Signor Manuel Ordonnez  is a man of profound piety  He always walks with his eyes cast downwards  and a large rosary in his hand  They say that from his early youth  having been a close inspector of the poor  he has interested himself in their affairs with unwearied zeal  Charity draws down a blessing on the charitable  everything has prospered with him  What a favourite of heaven  The more he does for the poor  the richer he grows   As Fabricio was going on in this manner  I interrupted him  It is well you are satisfied with your lot  but  between ourselves  surely you might play your part better in the world  Do not you believe it  Gil Blas  replied he  be assured that for a man of my temper a more agreeable situation could not possibly have been devised  The trade of a lacquey is toilsome  to be sure  for a poor creature  but for a lad of spirit it is all enchantment  A superior genius  when he gets a service  does not go about it like a lumpish simpleton  He enters into a family as viceroy over the master  not as an inferior minister  He begins by measuring the length of his employer s foot  by lending himself to his weaknesses  he gains his confidence  and ends with leading him by the nose  Such has been my plan of operation at the governor s  I knew the pilgrim at once by his staff  his wish was for an earthly canonization  I pretended to believe him to be the saint he wished to be taken for  hypocrisy costs nothing  Nay  I went further  for I took pattern by him  and playing the same part before him which he played before others  I out cozened the cozener  and by degrees got to be major domo  I am in hopes some day or other  under his wing  to have the fingering of the poor  box  It may bring a blessing upon me as well as another  for I have caught the flame from him  and already feel deeply for the interests of charity   These are fine hopes  my dear Fabricio  replied I  and I congratulate you upon them  For my part  I am determined on my first plan  I shall straightway convert my embroidered suit into a cassock  repair to Salamanca  and there  enlisting under the banner of the university  fulfil the sacred duties of a tutor  A fine scheme  exclaimed Fabricio  a pleasant conceit  What madness  at your age  to turn pedant  Are you aware  you stupid fellow  what you take upon yourself by that choice  As soon as
