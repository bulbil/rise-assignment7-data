say I have changed my Opinion  is no more than to say  I am wiser To day  than I was Yesterday   I am doubly pleased to have my Knowledge increased by a Consciousness of your Regard  but  in Return for the Maxim you quoted  give me Leave to use one of the same Author s  where he says   That the Violence done us by others is often less painful than that we do ourselves   Now  my dear Harry  if this be the Case  I am still unhappy in your Correspondence  For  be assured  that my sole Motive for desiring to put an End to it  was  that I imagined it grew tiresome to you  and it would mortify me extremely  if I thought I owed more to your Good breeding  than your Good will  This Opinion of mine  however  did not proceed from any Suspicion of your Inconstancy  but from a Consciousness  that I had neither a natural  or acquired Fund  sufficient to return your charming and frequent Letters  with that Sense and Spirit they required  and  if ever I neglected a Post  it was from that Awe  which has often made me silent in your Company  But  if you have indeed Condescension enough to read the Dictates of   70 my little artless Heart  with a more than partial Eye  if they sometimes give you Pleasure  even of good natured Criticism  and that you still regard me with friendly Opticks  I wish no higher Satisfaction than the Continuance of your entertaining and improving Correspondence     It humbles me sometimes  when I suspect that you only write to me  as Moliere used to read his Works to his House keeper  that he might be sure there was natural Wit  in whatever was relished by her untutored Taste  However  your Condescension has  any Way  its Esteem with me  and puts me in Mind of a beautiful Simile  I have some where met  quoted from the Antients    that a Man of Merit resembles an Ear of Corn  which stoops the more it is loaded with Grain     I thank you for the Lock of your Hair  but am angry  at what you call a Compliment to female Vanity  I assure you  I do not feel any Joy in this short lived Triumph  but rather look upon it as a Memento  Of that hard Fate  which she must one Day prove   Who hopes  from Henry s Vows  eternal Love     Besides  I should have set it in a more elegant Manner  for your former Mistress seems to have had but an old fashioned Taste  but I will now keep it  as it is  for its own intrinsick Value     71I should be tempted to send you a Locket  to replace the one you have parted with  but  if Beauty could not keep its Situation near your Heart  I fear you would not let any Thing  which belonged to me  have any Place about you  nor even give it so honourable a Funeral  as that of the antient Romans  I wish  however  I could prevail with you to deal with my Letters  as  you say  you have done with her s  for I can t be easy  while you have so many Proofs of my Folly in your Keeping   Adieu   Frances   Pray send me some more of your Poetry   LETTER XLIV  HENRY to FRANCES   I AM very well pleased to find you are at length recovered to a right Way of thinking  I swear you wronged me much  if you really imagined  I could any Way be tired of a Correspondence with you  if you was kind enough to bless me with one  in every Sense  nor can I believe you had even the least Suspicion about it  but had a Mind to make a farther Essay of my Fondness for you  like People  who rise to go away  in order to be pressed to stay  These are  my dear Fanny  idle  romantick   72 Experiments  and I beg you ll never make Use of them again  as they suit not with my Sincerity and Plainness  As to the Sacrifice  I made you  it was neither out of Inconstancy  or Ingratitude  but she has been married some Years  and lives very happily  so I burned her Letters  and destroyed her Bracelet  because I did not care to keep any Thing of her s  which might  at any Time  give Cause of unjust Suspicion  or give me Occasion to recollect any Thing about her  By which Means I thought to acquit myself with Honour  both to her and you   The Inclosed I wrote the other Day upon my Friend s Illness  which I should not think worth sending you  if I had not received your Commands  last Post  to this Effect   Adieu   my Pett—  write often  and oftener   Henry   When first Amyntor caught Disease   My sympathizing Heart  Could taste no Joy   till he had Ease   But felt an equal Smart   Far greater were my Griefs than theirs
