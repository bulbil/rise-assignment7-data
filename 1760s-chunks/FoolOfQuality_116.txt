she interposed  and  dropping on her knees   before me What is my Hammy about   she cried   what madness   has possessed my love   Would you be guilty of actual and instant   murders  through a rash and vain attempt of rescuing from our   laws a person whom neither God nor man hath yet condemned    This  indeed  were to ensure the ruin you apprehend  Ah  no  my   heart s master  let us neither commit nor fear iniquity   Join with   me  my Hammy  let us trust in our God  and nothing but good can   happen unto us      While she spoke  the late terrors of her countenance disappeared    and her aspect was gradually overspread with a serenity  to be   imagined  in some measure  from the face of an evening heaven   in autumn  when the songs of harvest are heard through the villages   all about      I gazed on her with a speechless and complacent reverence    She gently took the weapon from my unresisting hand   and  leading   me back  she seated me in the furthest chair  She then removed   every bar and obstacle to their entrance  The stairs were now     H2         100 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      filled with people who had been called to the assistance of the   king s officers  but they still appeared apprehensive  and fearful of   advancing      Gentlemen  said Arabella  be pleased to walk in   I deliver myself   peaceably into your hands  ye shall find no further opposition to   his majesty or the laws  The officers accordingly entered  but   bowing  and with a timid kind of respect   neither did any of them   offer to lay a hand upon her  Good God  madam   exclaimed the   foremost  is it possible you should be guilty of the crimes laid to   your charge by that rascal  whom your husband has half killed    He is carried off to the doctor s  but I think  in my conscience    that he has got his deserts   and  as for the few hurts that we have   received  we excuse your husband  madam  for your sake   and we   think him the braver and the better man for what he did  For  in   truth  sweet madam  you are well worth defending      I thank ye  gentlemen  said my wife  gracefully smiling and   curtsying   pray  be pleased to sit while I prepare to attend you    I am guilty  indeed  of the death of a man  and yet guilty of no    thing that I would not repeat in the defence of virtue  But    gentlemen  says she  again smiling  you are likely to be troubled   with more prisoners than you look for  One of them  indeed  is   young  and as little meaning of harm to any one as his mother  I   must  therefore  beg your indulgence in sending for a coach   and   pray  do me the favour to accept this trifle  as the means of washing   away animosity between you and my husband  So saying  she pre    sented their chief with a guinea   who  rising and awfully bowing    ordered one of the others to step for a coach      Had the harp of Orpheus been tuned like the voice of my Ara    bella at this season  it is not to be wondered that tigers should grow   tame  and bears crouch down before him and lick his feet  since   wretches like these  hardened in hourly acts of insolence and in    humanity  were now awed to downcast reverence  and  on her   return from the closet with her infant in her arms  dropped a tear   of still compassion  as though they had not wholly forgotten that   they were born of women      In the mean time  my fury having subsided at the instance of my   wife  I should certainly have fainted if I had not been relieved by   a gush of tears   which I endeavoured to conceal by turning aside   and putting my handkerchief to my face  A cloud of thick dark    ness again overspread my soul   and every internal idea grew   pregnant  and laboured with apprehension and horror  I cursed   my meeting with my father  and his treacherous appearance of   bounty  which had served to bring this decisive ruin upon us    and I looked upon fortune as solicitous and industrious to bring   evil and destruction out of every presentment and promise of   advantage      Being conducted to Newgate  I agreed with the keeper
