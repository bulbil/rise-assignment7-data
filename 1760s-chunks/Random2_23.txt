the river Main  to watch the motions of the English  Austrians  and Hessians  under the command of the earl of Stair  We began our march accordingly    61 and then I became acquainted with that part of a soldier s life to which I had been a stranger hitherto —It is impossible to describe the hunger and thirst I sustained  and the satigue I underwent in a march of so many hundred miles  during which  I was so much chased with the heat and motion of my limbs  that in a very short time the inside of my thighs and legs were deprived of skin  and I proceeded in the utmost torture —This misfortune I owed to the plumpness of my constitution  which I cursed  and envied the withered condition of my comrades  whose bodies could not spare juice enough to supply a common issue  and were indeed proof against all manner of friction  The continual pain I felt made me fretful  and my peevishness was increased by the mortification of my pride in seeing these miserable wretches  whom a hard gale of wind would have scattered through the air like chaff  bear those toils with alacrity  under which I was ready to sink   One day while we enjoyed a halt  and the soldiers with their wives had gone out to dance  according to custom  my comrade staid at home with me on pretence of friendship  and insulted me with his pity and consolation  He told me  though I was young and tender at present  I would soon be seasoned to the service  and he did not doubt but I should have the honour to contribute in some measure to the glory of the king —   Have courage  therefore  my child  said he  and pray to the good God  that you may be as happy as I am  who have had the honour of serving Lewis the Great  and of receiving many wounds in helping to establish his glory  —  When I looked upon the contemptible   62 object that pronounced these words  I was amazed at the infatuation that possessed him  and could not help expressing my astonishment at the absurdity of a rational being  who thinks himself highly honoured in being permitted to encounter abject poverty  oppression  famine  disease  mutilation  and evident death  merely to gratify the vicious ambition of a prince  by whom his sufferings were disregarded  and his name utterly unknown —I observed  that if his situation was the consequence of compulsion  as having been pressed into the service  I would praise his patience and fortitude in bearing his lot —if he had taken up arms in defence of his injured country  he was to be applauded for his patriotism —or if he had fled to this way of life as a refuge from a greater evil  he was justifiable in his own conscience   though I could have no notion of misery more extreme than that he suffered   but to put his condition on the footing of conducing to the glory of his prince  was no more than professing himself a desperate slave  who voluntarily underwent the utmost wretchedness and peril  and committed the most flagrant crimes  to sooth the barbarous pride of a fellowcreature  his superior in nothing but the power he derived from the submission of such wretches as he  The soldier was very much affronted at the liberty I took with his king  which  he said  nothing but my ignorance could excuse  He affirmed  that the characters of princes were sacred  and ought not to be profaned by the censure of their subjects  who were bound by their allegiance to obey their commands  of what nature soever  without scruple or repining—And advised me to correct the rebellious principles I had imbibed among the   63 English  who  for their insolence to their kings  were notorious all over the world  even to a proverb   Le roy d  Angleterre   Est le roy de l  Enfer     In vindication of my countrymen  I adduced all the arguments commonly used to prove that every man has a natural right to liberty  that allegiance and protection are reciprocal  that when the mutual tie is broken by the tyranny of the king  he is accountable to the people for his breach of contract  and subject to the penalty of the law  and that those insurrections of the English  which are branded with the name of rebellion  by the slaves of arbitrary power  were no other than glorious efforts to rescue that independance which was their birthright  from the ravenous claws of usurping ambition —The Frenchman  provoked at the little deference I paid to the kingly name  lost all patience  and reproached me in such a manner  that my temper forsook me  and I clenched my fist  with an intention to give him a hearty box on the ear —Perceiving my design  he started back  and demanded a parley  upon which I checked my indignation  and he gave me to understand that a Frenchman never forgave a blow  therefore if I was not weary of my life  I would do well to spare him that mortification  and do him the honour of measuring his sword with mine  like a gentleman —I took his advice and followed him to a field hard by  where indeed I was
