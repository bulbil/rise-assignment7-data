colours they would bear  yet all was insufficient   Louisa was absent in   reality  but her image was ever present to him   Whatever company he   engaged himself in  whatever amusement he endeavoured to entertain   himself with  he could think only of her         The Town without her seemed a desart  and every thing in it rather   seemed irksome than agreeable  for several months did he endure this   cruel conflict  but love and nature at last got the victory  and all   those considerations which had occasioned the opposition subsided  he   found it impossible to recover any tranquility of mind while he   continued in this dilemma  and therefore yielded to the strongest side    All the arguments he had used with himself in the beginning of his   passion seemed now weak and trifling  the difference of age  which he   had thought so formidable an objection  appeared none in the light with   which he at present considered it  he was now but in his fortieth year    and the temperance he had always observed had hindered any decay either   in his looks or constitution   What censures the world might pass on   his marrying one of her age and obscure birth  he thought were of little   weight when balanced with his internal peace   Thus was he enabled to   answer to himself all that could be offered against making her his wife    and having thus settled every thing  as he imagined  to the satisfaction   of his passion  became no less resolute in following the dictates of it   than he had been in combating it while there was a possibility of   doing so       To this end he went down to his country seat  and as soon as he arrived   sent to let Louisa know he would have her come and pass some time with   him  She readily obeyed the summons  and found by his manner of   receiving her that she was no less dear to him than her brother  As she   had always considered him as a father  tho  she knew all her claim in   him was compassion  she was far from suspecting the motive which made   him treat her with so much tenderness  but he suffered her not long to   remain in this happy ignorance  As he was walking with her one day in   the garden  he purposely led her on that side where he had found Horatio   and herself in the manner already related  and as they came towards the   arbour  It was here  said he  that heaven put into my power the   opportunity of affording my protection to two persons whom I think will   not be ungrateful for what I have done   I hope  Louisa  continued he    you will not at least deceive my good opinion of you  but as you have   always found in me a real friend  you will testify the sense you have of   my good wishes  by readily following my advice in any material point       I should be else unworthy  sir  answered she  of the life you have   preserved  and I flatter myself with being guilty of nothing which   should give you cause to call in question either my gratitude or duty       I insist but on the former  resumed he  nor can pretend to any claim to   the latter   look on me therefore only as your friend  and let me know   your sentiments plainly and sincerely on what I think proper to ask you    This she having assured him she would do  he pursued his discourse in   these or the like terms       You are now  said he  arrived at an age when persons of your sex   ordinarily begin to think of marriage   I need not ask you if you have   ever received any addresses for that purpose  the manner in which you   have lived convinces me you are yet a stranger to them  but I would know   of you whether an overture of that kind  in favour of a man of honour    and who can abundantly endow you with the goods of fortune  would be   disagreeable to you       Alas  sir  replied she  blushing  you commanded me to answer with   sincerity  but how can I resolve a question which as yet I have never   asked myself   All that I can say is  that I now am happy by your   bounty  and have never entertained one wish but for the continuance   of it       On that you may depend  said he  while you continue to stand in need of   it  But would it not be more pleasing to find yourself the mistress of   an ample fortune  and in a condition to do the same good offices by   others
