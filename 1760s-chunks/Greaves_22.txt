the storm should be overblown  Had his heart been unengaged  he would have chose to travel  but at this period  when his whole soul was engrossed  and so violently agitated by his passion for Aurelia  nothing but the fear of seeing the old gentleman run distracted would have induced him to desist from the pursuit of that young lady  far less quit the kingdom where she resided    Well then  gemmen  he repaired to Harwich  where he embarked for Holland  from whence he proceeded to Brussels  where he procured a passport from the French king  by virtue of which he travelled to Marseilles  and there took a tartan for Genoa  The first letter Sir Everhard received from him was dated at Florence  Meanwhile the surgeon s prognostic was not altogether verified  Mr  Darnel did not die immediately of his wounds  but he lingered a long time  as it were in the arms of death  and even partly recovered  yet  in all probability  he will never be wholly restored to the enjoyment of his health  and is obliged every summer to attend the hot well at Bristol  As his wounds began to heal  his hatred to Mr  Greaves seemed to revive with augmented violence  and he is now  if possible  more than ever determined against all reconciliation    Mr  Launcelot  after having endeavoured to amuse his imagination with a succession of curious objects  in a tour of Italy  took up his residence at a town called Pisa  and there fell into a deep melancholy  from which nothing could rouse him but the news of his father s death    The old gentleman  God rest his soul  never held up his head after the departure of his darling Launcelot  and the dangerous condition of Darnel kept up his apprehension  This was reinforced by the obstinate silence of the youth  and certain accounts of his disordered mind  which he had received from some of those persons who take pleasure in communicating disagreeable tidings  A complication of all these grievances  co operating with a severe fit of the gout and gravel  produced a fever  which  in a few days  brought Sir Everhard to his long home  after he had settled his affairs with heaven and earth  and made his peace with God and man  I ll assure you  gemmen  he made a most edifying and Christian end  he died regretted by all his neighbours except Anthony  and might be said to be embalmed by the tears of the poor  to whom he was always a bounteous benefactor    When the son  now Sir Launcelot  came home  he appeared so meagre  wan  and hollow eyed  that the servants hardly knew their young master  His first care was to take possession of his fortune  and settle accounts with the steward who had succeeded my father  These affairs being discussed  he spared no pains to get intelligence concerning Miss Darnel  and soon learned more of that young lady than he desired to know  for it was become the common talk of the country  that a match was agreed upon between her and young Squire Sycamore  a gentleman of a very great fortune  These tidings were probably confirmed under her own hand  in a letter which she wrote to Sir Launcelot  The contents were never exactly known but to the parties themselves  nevertheless  the effects were too visible  for  from that blessed moment  he spoke not one word to any living creature for the space of three days  but was seen sometimes to shed a flood of tears  and sometimes to burst out into a fit of laughing  At last he broke silence  and seemed to wake from his disorder  He became more fond than ever of the exercise of riding  and began to amuse himself again with acts of benevolence    One instance of his generosity and justice deserves to be recorded in brass or marble  You must know  gemmen  the rector of the parish was lately dead  and Sir Everhard had promised the presentation to another clergyman  In the meantime  Sir Launcelot chancing one Sunday to ride through a lane  perceived a horse saddled and bridled  feeding on the side of a fence  and  casting his eyes around  beheld on the other side of the hedge an object lying extended on the ground  which he took to be the body of a murdered traveller  He forthwith alighted  and  leaping into the field  descried a man at full length  wrapped in a greatcoat and writhing in agony  Approaching nearer  he found it was a clergyman  in his gown and cassock  When he inquired into the case  and offered his assistance  the stranger rose up  thanked him for his courtesy  and declared that he was now very well  The knight who thought there was something mysterious in this incident  expressed a desire to know the cause of his rolling in the grass in that manner  and the clergyman  who knew his person  made no scruple in gratifying his curiosity   You must know  sir   said he   I serve the curacy of your own parish  for which the late incumbent paid me twenty pounds a year  but this sum being scarce sufficient to maintain my wife
