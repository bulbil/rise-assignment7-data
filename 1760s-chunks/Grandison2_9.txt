a better world  if we are permitted to look back upon the highest of our satisfactions in this   I was asked to give them a lesson on the harpsichord after tea  Miss Grandison said  Come  come  to prevent all excuses  I will shew you the way   Let it then be  said Mr  Grandison  Shakespear s Cuckow  You have made me enter with so much comparative shame into myself  that I must have something lively to raise my spirits   Well  so it shall  replied Miss Grandison  Our poor cousin does not know what to do with himself when you are got a little out of his reach   That is not fair  Charlotte  said Sir Charles  It is not that graceful manner of obliging  in which you generally excel  Compliance and Reflection are not to be coupled   Well  well  but I will give the good man his Cuckow  to make him amends   Accordingly she sung that ballad from Shakespear  and with so much spirit and humour  as delighted every body   Sir Charles being a judge of musick  I looked a little sillier than common  when I was again called upon   Come  my dear  said the kind Countess  I will prepare you a little further  When you see your two elder sisters go before you  you will have more courage     22 She sat down  and play d one of Scarlatti s lessons  which  you know  are made to shew a fine hand  And surely  for the swiftness of her fingers  and the elegance of her manner  she could not be equalled   It is referred to you  my third Sister  said Sir Charles  who had been taken aside by Mr  Reeves  some whispering talk having passed between them  to favour us with some of Handel s musick  Mrs  Reeves says  she has heard you sing several songs out of the Pastoral  and out of some of his finest Oratorios   Come hither  come hither  my sweet Harriet—Here s his Alexander s Feast  My brother admires that  I know  and says it is the noblest composition that ever was produced by man  and is as finely set  as written   She made me sit down to the instrument   As you know  said I  that great part of the beauty of this performance arises from the proper transitions from one different strain to another  any one song must lose greatly  by being taken out of its place  and I fear—  Fear nothing  Miss Byron  said Sir Charles  Your obligingness  as well as your observation  intitle you to all allowances   I then turned to that fine piece of accompanied recitative    Softly sweet  in Lydian measures   Soon he sooth d his soul to pleasures     Which not being set so full with accompanying symphonies  as most of Mr  Handel s are  I performed with the more ease to myself  tho  I had never but once before play d it over   They all  with more compliments than I dare repeat  requested me to play and sing it once more   Dare repeat  methinks I hear my uncle Selby say  The girl that does nothing else but repeat her own praises  comes with her  If I dare repeat     23 Yes  Sir  I answer  for compliments that do not elevate  that do not touch me  run glibly off my pen  But such as indeed raise one s vanity  how can one avow that vanity by writing them down —But they were resolved to be pleased before I began   One compliment  however  from Sir Charles  I cannot  I find  pass over in silence  He whispered Miss Grandison  as he leaned upon my chair  How could Sir Hargrave Pollexfen have the heart to endeavour to stop such a mouth as that   AND now  having last night  and this morning  written so many sides  it is time to break off  Yet I could give you many more particulars of agreeable conversation that passed  were I sure you would not think me insufferably tedious  and did not the unkind reserve of my cousin Reeves  as to the business of that Bagenhall  rush upon my memory with fresh force  and help to tire my fingers  I am the more concerned  as my cousin himself seems not easy  but is in expectation of hearing something  that will either give him relief  or add to his pain   Why  Lucy  should our friends take upon themselves to keep us in the dark  as to those matters which it concerns us more to know  than perhaps any body else  There is a tenderness sometimes shewn on arduous occasions in this respect  that gives as much pain  as we could receive from the most explicit communication  And then  all the while  there is so much strength of mind  and discretion  supposed in the person that knows an event  and such weakness in her that is to be kept in ignorance  that—But I grow as saucy as impatient  Let me conclude  before I expose my self to reproof for a
