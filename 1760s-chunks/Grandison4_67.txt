—But perhaps he has taken his leave of me already  as to the solemnity of it  in the manner I have recited   LETTER XXIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Saturday Morning  Apr  15   O Lucy  Sir Charles Grandison is gone  Gone indeed  He sat out at three this morning  on purpose  no doubt  to spare his sisters  and the two brothers in law  and Lord W  as well as himself  concern  We broke not up till after two  Were I in the writing humour which I have never known to fail me till now  I could dwell upon an hundred things  some of which I can now only briefly mention   Dinner time yesterday passed with tolerable chearfulness  Every one tried to be chearful  O what pain attends loving too well  and being too well beloved  He must have pain  as well as we   Lady Olivia was the most thoughtful  at dinnertime  yet p••r Emily  Ah the poor Emily  she went out four or five times to weep  tho  only I perceived it   Nobody was chearful after dinner but Sir Charles  He seemed to exert himself to be so  He prevailed on me to give them a lesson on the harpsichord  Lady L  played  Lady G  played  We tried to play  I should rather say  He himself took the violin  and   168 afterwards sat down to the harpsichord  for one short lesson  He was not known to be such a master  But he was long in Italy  Lady Olivia indeed knew him to be so  She was induced to play upon the harpsichord  She surpassed every body  Italy is the land of harmony   About seven at night he singled me out  and surprised me greatly by what he said  He told me  that Lady D  had made him a visit  I was before low  I was then ready to sink  She has asked me questions  madam   Sir  Sir  was all I could say   He himself trembled as he spoke—Alas  my dear  he surely loves me  Hear how solemnly he spoke—God Almighty be your director  my dear Miss Byron  I wish not more happiness to my own Soul  than I do to you —In discharge of a promise made  I mention this visit to you  I might otherwise have spared you  and myself—  He stopt there—Then resumed  for I was silent—I could not speak—Your friends will be entreated for a man that loves you  a very worthy young nobleman —I give you emotion  madam —Forgive me —I have performed my promise  He turned from me with a seeming chearful air  How could he appear to be chearful   We made parties at cards  I knew not what I played  Emily sighed  and tears stole down her cheeks  as she played  O how she loves her guardian  Emily  I say—I don t know what I write   At supper we were all very melancholy  Mr  Beauchamp was urgent to go abroad with him  He changed the subject  and gave him an indirect denial  as I may call it  by recommending the two Italian Ladies to his best services   Sir Charles  kind  good  excellent  wished to Lord L  to have seen Mr  Grandison —Unworthy as that man has made himself of his attention     169 He was a few moments in private with Lady Olivia  She returned to company with red eyes   Poor Emily watched an opportunity to be spoken to by him alone—So diligently  He led her to the window—About one o  clock it was—He held both her hands  He called her  she says  his Emily  He charged her to write to him   She could not speak  she could only sob  yet thought she had a thousand things to say to him   He contradicted not the hope his sisters and their Lords had of his breakfasting with them  They invited me  they invited the Italian Ladies  Lady L  Lord L  did go  in expectation  But Lady G  when she found him gone  sent me and the Italian Ladies word  that he was  It would have been cruel  if she had not  How could he steal away so  I find  that he intended that his morning visit to me  as indeed I half suspected  should be a taking leave of my cousins  and your Harriet  How many things did he say then—How many questions ask—In tender woe—He wanted to do us all service—He seemed not to know what to say—Surely he hates not your poor Harriet—What struggles in his noble bosom —But a man cannot complain  A man cannot ask for compassion  as a woman can  But surely his is the gentlest of manly minds   When we broke up  he handed my cousin Reeves into her coach  He handed me  Mr  Reeves said  We see you again  Sir Charles  in the morning  He bowed  At handing me in  he sighed—He pressed my hand—I think he did—That was all—He saluted nobody —He will not meet his Clementina as he parted with us   But  I doubt not
