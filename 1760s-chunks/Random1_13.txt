as they intended to leave the school next day  as well as I  the first being ordered by his father to return into the country  and the other being bound apprentice to a barber  at a market town not far off     In the mean time  my uncle being informed of my master s behaviour to me  was enraged beyond all composition  and vowed revenge so heartily  that I could not refrain from telling him the scheme I had concerted  which he heard with great satisfaction  at every sentence squirting out a mouthful of spittle  tinctured with tobacco  of which he constantly chewed a large quid —At last  pulling up his breeches  he cried     No  no  Z—ds  that won t do neither —howsomever   tis a bold undertaking  my lad —that I must say  i  faith —but lookée  lookée  how dost propose to get clear off —won t the enemy give chace  my boy —ay  ay  that he will  I warrant—and alarm the whole coast—ah  G—d help thee  more sail than ballast  Rory —Let me alone for that—leave the whole to me—I ll shew him the foretop sail  I will —If so be that your ship mates are jolly boys  and won t flinch  you shall see  you shall see  egad  I ll play him a salt water trick—I ll bring him to the gang way  and anoint him with a cat and nine tails —he shall have a round dozen doubled  my lad  he shall—and be left lashed  to his meditations  —  We   27 were very proud of our associate  who immediately went to work  and prepared the instrument of his revenge with great skill and expedition  after which  he ordered our baggage to be packed up and sent off  a day before our attempt  and got horses ready to be mounted  as soon as the affair should be over  At length the hour arrived  when our auxiliary  seizing the opportunity of the usher s absence  bolted in  secured the door  and immediately laid hold of the pedant by his collar  who bawled out   Murder  Thieves  —  with the voice of a stentor  Though I trembled all over like an aspenleas  I knew there was no time to be lost  and accordingly got up  and summoned our associates to my assistance —Strap without any hesitation obeyed the signal  and seeing me leap upon the master s back  ran immediately to one of his legs  which pulling with all his force  this dreadful adversary was soon humbled to the ground  upon which Gawky  who had hitherto remained in his place  under the influence of an universal trepidation  hastened to the scene of action  and insulted the fallen tyrant with a loud huzza  in which the whole school joined —This noise alarmed the usher  who finding himself shut out  endeavoured  partly by threats  and partly by entreaties  to procure admission —My uncle bid him have a little patience  and he would let him in presently  but if he pretended to move from that place  it should fare the worse with the son of a b—ch his superior  on whom he intended only to bestow a little wholesome chastifement  for his barbarous usage of Rory    to which  said he  you are no stranger  —  By this time we had dragged the criminal to a post    28 to which Bowling tied him with a rope he had provided on purpose  after having fastened his hands behind his back  pulled down his breeches  and tucked up his garments and shirt  as far as they would go—In this ludicrous posture he stood  to the no small entertainment of the boys  who crowded about him  and shouted with great exultation at the novelty of the sight  venting bitter imprecations against the lieutenant  and reproaching his scholars with treachery and rebellion  when the usher was admitted  whom my uncle accosted in this manner    Harkée  Mr  Syntax  I believe you are an honest man  d ye see—and I have a respect for you—but for all that  we must for our own security  d ye see  belay you for a short time  —  With these words  he pulled out some fathoms of cord  which the honest man no sooner saw  than he protested with great earnestness  that he would allow no violence to be offered to him  at the same time accusing me of perfidy and ingratitude  But Bowling representing  that it was in vain to resist  and that he did not mean to use him with violence and indecency  but only to hinder him from raising the hue and cry against us  before we should be out of their power  he allowed himself to be bound to his own desk  where he sat a spectator of the punishment inflicted on his principal  My uncle having unbraided this arbitrary wretch with his inhumanity to me  told him  that he proposed to give him a little discipline for the good of his soul  which he immediately put in practice  with great vigour and dexterity  This smart application to the pedant s withered pofteriors  gave him such exquisite pain  that he roared like a mad bull
