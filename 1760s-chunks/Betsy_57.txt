       have already wrote to her on this subject  and I believe she will        pay some regard to what I have said in his behalf  I am very well        assured she can never have a more advantageous offer  as to his        circumstances  nor be united to a man of more true honour         morality  and sweetness of disposition  all of which I have had        frequent occasions of being an eyewitness of  but she is young         gay  and  as yet  perhaps  not altogether so capable as I could        wish of knowing what will make for her real happiness  I therefore        intreat you  Sir  as the long experienced friend of our family  to        forward this match  both by your advice  and whatever else is in        your power  which certainly will be the greatest act of goodness        you can confer on her  as well as the highest obligation to a        brother  who wishes nothing more than to see her secured from all        temptations  and well settled in the world  I am  with the greatest        respect  Sir  your most humble  and most obedient servant            F  THOUGHTLESS            P S  I had forgot to inform you Sir  that the name of the gentleman        I take the liberty of recommending with so much warmth  is        Trueworth  that he is descended from the ancient Britons by the        father s side  and by the mother s from the honourable and        well known Oldcastles  in Kent         O fie  Miss Betsy   said Lady Mellasin   how could you serve Mr    Goodman so  What will Mr  Staple say  when he comes to know he was   encouraged to court a woman that was already pre engaged     Pre engaged    Madam   cried Miss Betsy  in a scornful tone   what  to a man I never   saw but three times in my whole life  and whose mouth never uttered a   syllable of love to me   She was going on  but Mr  Goodman  who was   still in a great heat  interrupted her  saying   No matter whether he   has uttered any thing of the business  or not  it seems you are enough   acquainted with his sentiments  and I doubt not but he knows you are  or   he would not have taken a journey to London on your account  You ought   therefore to have told me of his coming  and what your brother had   wrote concerning him  and I should then have let Mr  Staple know it   would be to no purpose to make any courtship to you  as I did to another   just before I came home  who I find has taken a great fancy to you  but   I have given him an answer  For my part  I do not understand this way of   making gentlemen lose their time        It is probable these last words nettled Miss Betsy more than all the   rest he had said  she imagined herself secure of the hearts of both   Trueworth and Staple  but was vexed to the heart to have lost the   addresses of a third admirer  through the scrupulousness of Mr  Goodman    who she looked upon to have nothing to do with her affairs in this   particular  she was too cunning  however  to let him see what her   thoughts were on this occasion  and only said  that he might do as he   pleased  that she did not want a husband  that all men were alike to   her  but added  that it seemed strange to her that a young woman who had   her fortune to make  might not be allowed to hear all the different   proposals that should be offered to her on that score  and with these   words  flung out of the room  and went up into her chamber  nor would be   prevailed upon to come down again that night  though Miss Flora  and   Mr  Goodman himself  repenting he had said so much  called to her for   that purpose                CHAPTER XVI       Presents the reader with the name and character of Miss Betsy s third
