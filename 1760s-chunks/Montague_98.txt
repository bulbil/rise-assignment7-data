brother  I love him so much  that a man who had less candor and generosity than Fitzgerald  would be almost angry at my very lively friendship       I have this moment a letter from Madame Des Roches  she laments the loss of our two amiable friends  begs me to assure them both of her eternal remembrance  says   she congratulates Emily on possessing the heart of the man on earth most worthy of being beloved  that she cannot form an idea of any human felicity equal to that of the woman  the business of whose life it is to make Colonel Rivers happy  That  heaven having denied her that happiness  she will never marry  nor enter into an engagement which would make it criminal in her to remember him with tenderness  that it is  however  she believes  best for her he has left the country  for that it is impossible she should ever have seen him with indifference         It is perhaps as prudent not to mention these circumstances either to your brother or Emily  I thought of sending her letter to them  but there is a certain fire in her style  mixed with tenderness  when she speaks of Rivers  which would only have given them both regret  by making them see the excess of her affection for him  her expressions are much stronger than those in which I have given you the sense of them       I intend to be very intimate with her  because she loves my dear Rivers  she loves Emily too  at least she fancies she does  but I am a little doubtful as to the friendships between rivals  at this distance  however  I dare say  they will always continue on the best terms possible  and I would have Emily write to her       Do you know she has desired me to contrive to get her a picture of your brother  without his knowing it  I am not determined whether I shall indulge her in this fancy or not  if I do  I must employ you as my agent  It is madness in her to desire it  but  as there is a pleasure in being mad  I am not sure my morality will let me refuse her  since pleasures are not very thick sown in this world       Adieu   Your affectionate  A  FERMOR     LETTER CLVIII   158   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  July 10   BY this time  my dear Lucy  I hope you are happy with your brother and my sweet Emily  I am all impatience to know this from yourselves  but it will be five or six weeks  perhaps much more  before I can have that satisfaction       As to me to be plain  my dear  I can hold no longer  I have been married this fortnight  My father wanted to keep it a secret  for some very foolish reasons  but it is not in my nature  I hate secrets  they are only fit for politicians  and people whose thoughts and actions will not bear the light       For my part  I am convinced the general loquacity of human kind  and our inability to keep secrets without a natural kind of uneasiness  were meant by Providence to guard against our laying deep schemes of treachery against each other       I remember a very sensible man  who perfectly knew the world  used to say  there was no such thing in nature as a secret  a maxim as true  at least I believe so  as it is salutary  and which I would advise all good mammas  aunts  and governesses  to impress strongly on the minds of young ladies       So  as I was saying  voilà Madame Fitzgerald       This is  however  yet a secret here  but  according to my present doctrine  and following the nature of things  it cannot long continue so       You never saw so polite a husband  but I suppose they are all so the first fortnight  especially when married in so interesting and romantic a manner  I am very fond of the fancy of being thus married as it were  but I have a notion I shall blunder it out very soon  we were married on a party to Three Rivers  nobody with us but papa and Madame Villiers  who have not yet published the mystery  I hear some misses at Quebec are scandalous about Fitzgerald s being so much here  I will leave them in doubt a little  I think  merely to gratify their love of scandal  every body should be amused in their way       Adieu  yours  A  FITZGERALD       Pray let Emily be married  every body marries but poor little Emily           LETTER CLIX   159   To the Earl of —   Silleri  July 10   I HAVE the pleasure to tell your Lordship I have married my daughter to a gentleman with whom I have reason to hope she will be happy       He is the second son of an Irish baronet of good fortune  and has himself about five hundred pounds a year  independent of his commission  he is
