crying   D  n the  rascal  I ll lay any wager that he s a Jesuit  for none of his order  travel without a familiar   But Peregrine  who looked upon the affair  in another point of view  interposed in behalf of the stranger  whom he  freed from his aggressors  observing  that there was no occasion to use  violence  and asked  in French  what he had done to incur the censure of  the informer  The poor foreigner  more dead than alive  answered that  he was an Italian charlatan  who had practised with some reputation  in Padua  until he had the misfortune to attract the notice of the  Inquisition  by exhibiting certain wonderful performances by his skill  in natural knowledge  which that tribunal considered as the effects of  sorcery  and persecuted him accordingly  so that he had been fain to  make a precipitate retreat into France  where not finding his account  in his talents  he was now arrived in England  with a view of practising  his art in London  and that  in consequence of a specimen which he  had given to a company below  the choleric gentleman had followed him  up stairs to his own apartment  and assaulted him in that inhospitable  manner  he therefore earnestly begged that our hero would take him  under his protection  and  if he entertained the least suspicion of his  employing preternatural means in the operations of his art  he would  freely communicate all the secrets in his possession   The youth dispelled his apprehension by assuring him that he was in no  danger of suffering for his art in England  where  if ever he should be  questioned by the zeal of superstitious individuals  he had nothing to  do but appeal to the justice of the peace  who would immediately acquit  him of the charge  and punish his accusers for their impertinence and  indiscretion     6 22 15  3 45 PM   He then told Gauntlet and the Welshman that the stranger had a good  action against them for an assault  by virtue of an Act of Parliament   which makes it criminal for any person to accuse another of sorcery and  witchcraft  these idle notions being now justly exploded by all sensible  men  Mr  Jolter  who had by this time joined the company  could not  help signifying his dissent from this opinion of his pupil  which he  endeavoured to invalidate by the authority of Scripture  quotations from  the Fathers  and the confession of many wretches who suffered death for  having carried on correspondence with evil spirits together with  the evidence of  Satan s Invisible World   and Moreton s  History of  Witchcraft    The soldier corroborated these testimonies by facts that had happened  within the sphere of his own knowledge  and in particular mentioned the  case of an old woman of the parish in which he was born  who used to  transform herself into the shapes of sundry animals  and was at last  killed by small shot in the character of a hare  The Welshman  thus  supported  expressed his surprise at hearing that the legislature had  shown such tenderness for criminals of so dark a hue  and offered to  prove  by undeniable instances  that there was not a mountain in  Wales which had not been  in his memory  the scene of necromancy and  witchcraft   Wherefore   said he   I am assuredly more than above  astonished and confounded and concerned that the Parliament of Great  Britain should  in their great wisdoms  and their prudence  and their  penetration  give countenance and encouragement  look you  to the works  of darkness and the empire of Pelzepup  ofer and apove the evidence of  holy writ  and those writers who have been quoted by that aggurate and  learned shentleman  we are informed  by profane history  of the pribbles  and pranks of the old serpent  in the bortents and oragles of antiquity   as you will find in that most excellent historian Bolypius  and Titus  Lifius  ay  and moreofer  in the Commentaries of Julius Caesar himself   who  as the ole world knows  was a most famous  and a most faliant  and  a most wise  and a most prudent  and a most fortunate chieftain  and a  most renowned orator  ay  and a most elegant writer to boot    Peregrine did not think proper to enter the lists of dispute with three  such obstinate antagonists  but contented himself with saying that he  believed it would be no difficult matter to impugn the arguments  they had advanced  though he did not find himself at all disposed to  undertake the task  which must of course break in upon the evening s  entertainment  He therefore invited the Italian to supper  and asked  the same favour of his accuser  who seemed to have something curious and  characteristic in his manner and disposition  resolving to make himself  an eye witness of those surprising feats which had given offence to  the choleric Briton  This scrupulous gentleman thanked our hero for  his courtesy  but
