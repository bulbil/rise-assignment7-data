the constituents of female perfection   and that the more we de    preciate and detract from others  the more eminently we ourselves   shall shine forth  and be exalted  She is foUowed by fops  she is     K2         132 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      worshipped by fortune hunters  She is mounted aloft upon the   wings of flattery  and is hardened against public opinion by self    conceit  While she beholds a circling group of the tailor s creation    admiring the harmony of her motions  the fineness of her com    plexion  and the lustre of her ornaments  the same vanity that bids   her to be desirous of conquest  bids her also to despise them   but    for the vulgar world  she regards it as the dust beneath her steps    created to no end  save to be looked down upon  and trodden   under foot      Will ye now affirm  or can ye conceive  that any trace of native   bashfulness and lowliness should remain in the frontlet of this   piece of court petrifaction   No such trace can remain      As I observed to ye before  that every affection of the human   soul has its distinct and respective interpreter in the countenance     I am further to take notice  that each of those many interpreters   hath its respective set of tubes and fibres leading thereto  through   which the blood and spirits flow on their respective emotion  Thus    whatever the general tenor of a person s temper may be  such as   joyous or melancholy  irascible or placid  and so forth   the vessels   relative to these affections are kept open and full by an almost   constant flow of the blood and animal spirits  and impress such   evident characters of that person s disposition as are not to be   suppressed except for a time  and that too by some powerful and   opposite passion  For the muscles  so employed  grow stronger   and more conspicuous by exercise   as we see the legs of a chairman    and the shoulders of a porter  derive bulk and distinction from the   peculiarity of their occupation      Now I will take the argument in the strongest light against my    self  I will suppose a man to be naturally of a melancholy cast of   countenance   that he has the additional unhappiness of a bilious   constitution   and that he is confirmed in this look and habit of   despondence by a train of distressful circumstances  till he arrives   at his twentieth or thirtieth year  I will then suppose that his   habit of body and temper of mind are totally changed by medicine    a flow of success  a happy turn of reason and resignation  or perhaps   of complacence in the divine dispensations  He now grows sociable    benevolent  cheerful  always joyous when in company  and placid   Vvhen alone  I ask  on this occasion  will ye continue to see the   same cast and habit of melancholy in this man s countenance   No   more than ye can see the gloom of last winter in the smiling serene   of a summer s evening  For some time I admit it will be difficult   for the set of joyous muscles and glances to overpower their adver    saries who have so long kept the field   but  in the end  they must   prevail   they will receive constant supplies from within  and the   passages for their reinforcement will lie opened more and more    while their opponents daily subside  give place  and disappear      What I have observed with respect to melancholy  may be   equally affirmed of any other affection whose opposite gets an   habitual empire in the mind  I say habitual  because there are   some persons of such variable and fluctuating tempers  now furious    now complacent   now churlish  now generous   now mopingly   melancholy  now merry to madness   now pious  now profane   now         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  133     cruelly hard hearted  now meltingly humane that a man can no   more judge of what nature or disposition such people are  than he   can determine what wind shall predominate next April   and yet    when the wind blows  he can tell by every cloud and weathercock   from what point it comes  and may as easily decipher the present   temper by the aspect      But  sir  said Arabella  might not nature impress  as in the case   of Socrates  such conspicuous characters of vice  in his peculiar cast   of countenance and strong turn of muscling  as no internal virtues   should be able to retract
