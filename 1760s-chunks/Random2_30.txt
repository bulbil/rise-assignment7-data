corner  one of whom  as I thought  tipt my charmer the wink  and when we were past  I heard them set up the loud laugh —This arroused my attention  and I was resolved to be fully satisfied of this lady s character  before I should have any nearer connexion with her —As no convenience appeared  I proposed  that I should conduct her to a tavern  where we might stay a few minutes  until my servant could fetch a coach from the Strand —She seemed particularly shy of trusting herself in a tavern with a stranger  but at last  yielded to my pathetic remonstrances  rather than endanger her health  by remaining in a cold damp thorough fare —Having thus far succeeded  I begged to know what wine she would be pleased to drink a glass of  but she professed the greatest aversion to all sorts of strong liquors  and it was with much difficulty   83 that I could persuade her to eat a jelly —In the mean time  I endeavoured to alleviate the uneasiness she discovered  by saying all the agreeable things I could think of  at which she would often sigh  and regard me with a languishing look  that seemed too near a kin to the lewd leer of a courtezan —This discovery added to my former suspicion  while it put me upon my guard against her arts  divested me of reserve  and enabled me to entertain her with more gaity and freedom —In the course of our conversation  I pressed her to allow me the honour of waiting upon her next day  at her lodgings  which she  with many apologies  refused  lest it should give umbrage to Sir John  who was of a disposition apt to be fretted with trifles —This information  by which I was to understand that her husband was a knight  did not check my addresses  which became more and more importunate  and I was even hardy enough to ravish a kiss —But  O heavens  instead of banqueting on the ambrosial flavour  that her delicacy and complexion promised  I was almost suffocated with the steams of Geneva  An exhalation of this kind from a mouth which had just before declared an utter abhorrence of all spirituous liquors  not only changed my doubts into certainty  but my raptures into loathing  and it would have been impossible for me to have preserved common complaisance five minutes longer  when my servant returned with a coach —I took the advantage of this occasion  and presented my hand to the lady  who put in practice against me the whole artillery of her charms  ogling  languishing  sighing  and squeezing  with so little reserve  that Strap perceived her tenderness  and rubbed his hands with joy as   84 he followed us to the door —but I was proof against all her endearments  and handed her into the coach with an intention to take my leave immediately  She guessed my design  and invited me to her house  whispering  that now Sir John was gone to bed  she could have the pleasure of my conversation for half an hour without interruption —I told her  there was no mortification I would not undergo  rather than endanger the repose of her ladyship  and bidding the coachman drive on  wished her a good night —She lost all temper at my indifference  and stopping the coach at the distance of about twenty yards from me  popped out her head  and bawled with the lungs of a fish woman     D—n you  you dog  won t you pay the coach hire    I made no answer  Upon which she held forth against me with an eloquence peculiar to herself  calling me pitiful fellow  scoundrel  and an hundred such appellations  and concluding with an oath  that for all my appearance  she believed I had got no money in my pocket     Having thus vented her indignation  she ordered the coachman to proceed  and I returned to the tavern  where I bespoke something for supper  very well pleased at the issue of this adventure —I dispensed with the attendance of the waiter at table  on pretence that my own servant was present  and when we were alone  said to Strap     Well  Monsieur d Estrapes  what d ye think of this lady    My friend  who had not opened his mouth since her departure  could make no other reply than the monosyllable   Think    which he pronounced with a note of fear and astonishment —Surprized at this emphasis  I surveyed my valet  and perceiving a wildness in   85 his looks  asked if he had seen his grandfather s ghost —   Ghost   said he  I am sure I have seen a devil incarnate  Who would have thought that so much devilish malice and Billingsgate  could lurk under such sweetness of countenance and modesty of behaviour  Ah  God help us  Fronti nulla fides—nimium ne crede colori—but we ought to down on our knees and bless God for delivering us from the jaws of that painted sepulchre  —  I was pretty much of Strap s opinion  and though I did not believe myself in any danger from the allurements of that sisterhood  I determined to act with great circumspection for the future  and shun all commerce of that kind
