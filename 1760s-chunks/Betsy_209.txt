surprized her   You are pensive    Sir   said she   I hope the mention we have been making of Miss Betsy   has given you no alarm     A very great one   answered he   but not on   the account you may  perhaps  imagine  I have wronged that lady in the   most cruel manner  and  though the injury I have done her went no   farther than my own heart  yet I never can forgive myself for harbouring   sentiments which  I now find  were so groundless and unjust        As it was not possible for Miss Mabel to comprehend the meaning of these   words  she intreated him  somewhat hastily  to explain the mystery they   seemed to contain  on which he made no scruple of repeating to her the   substance of the letter he had received  his going down to Denham  in   order to convince himself more fully  and the many circumstances which    according to all appearances  corroborated the truth of that infamous   scandal       Never was astonishment equal to that Miss Mabel was in on hearing the   narrative of so monstrous a piece of villainy   Good God   cried she   I   know Miss Betsy has many enemies  who set all her actions in the worst   light  and construe every thing she says and does into meanings she is   ignorant of herself  but this is so impudent  so unparalleled a slander    as I could not have thought the malice of either men or devils could   have invented         Indeed  Madam   said Mr  Trueworth   should fortune ever discover to me   the author of this execrable falsehood  I know no revenge I could take   that would be sufficient  both for traducing the innocence of that lady    and the imposition practised upon myself   Miss Mabel agreed with him    that no punishment could be too bad for the inventors of such cruel   aspersions  and  having a little vented her indignation on all who were   capable of the like practices   I suppose  then   said she   that it was   owing to this wicked story that you desisted your visits to Miss Betsy         Not altogether  Madam   answered he   I had long before seen it was not   in my power to inspire that lady with any sentiments of the kind that   would make me happy in the married state  I loved her  but my reason   combated with my passion  and got the better         I understand you  Sir   replied she   and though I hope  nay  believe   in my soul  that poor Miss Betsy is innocent as a vestal  yet I cannot   but own  that the too great gaiety of her temper  and the pride of   attracting as many admirers as to have eyes to behold her  hurries her   into errors  which  if persevered in  cannot but be fatal both to the   peace and reputation of a husband  Where you are now fixed  you   doubtless have a much better prospect of being truly happy  It is    however  a great pity  methinks   continued this amiable lady   that so   many rare and excellent qualities as Miss Betsy is possessed of  should   all be swallowed up and lost in the nonsensical vanity of being too   generally admired        They had time for no more  Sir Bazil returned  he had only been sent for   to examine the sole copy of the marriage articles  which the old   gentleman had just brought from his lawyer s  on purpose to shew them to   him some time that day  and they now took their leave  that the lady   might have time to dress  Sir Bazil looking on his watch  said  it was   then a quarter past two  and they should dine at three  so begged she   would not waste too much time in consulting her glass   For   added he     you know you have always charms for me     And I am not ashamed  then     replied she  with a smile   even before Mr  Trueworth  to confess  that   I desire to have none for any other        He kissed her hand on this obliging speech  and ran hastily down stairs    followed by Mr  Trueworth  whose temper had not quite recovered its   accustomed vivacity                CHAPTER XIII       Seems to promise a very great change for the better  both in the humour   and conduct of Miss Betsy  in regard to those
