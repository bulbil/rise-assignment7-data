 to Frenchmen  prisoners of war  and naked  I only wish that he may find as much pleasure from his virtues  as I have done in reflecting upon them  that alone will amply reward him  Such a one  my friend  is an honour to human nature  he makes no private distinctions of party  all that are stampt with the divine image of their creator are friends to him  he is a native of the world  and the emperor of China may be proud that he has such a countryman   To rejoice at the destruction of our enemies  is a foible grafted upon human nature  and we must be permitted to indulge it  the true way of atoning for such an ill founded pleasure  is thus to turn our triumph into an act of benevolence  and to testify our own joy by endeavouring to banish anxiety from others   Hamti  the best and wisest emperor that ever filled the throne  after having gained three signal victories over the Tartars  who had invaded his dominions  returned to Nankin in order to enjoy the glory of his conquest  After he had rested for some days  the people  who are naturally fond of processions  impatiently expected the triumphal entry  which emperors upon such occasions were accustomed to make  Their murmurs came to the emperor s ear  He loved his people  and was willing to do all in his power to satisfy their just desires  He therefore assured them  that he intended  upon the next feast of the Lanthorns  to exhibit   90 one of the most glorious triumphs that had ever been seen in China   The people were in raptures at his condescension  and  on the appointed day  assembled at the gates of the palace with the most eager expectations  Here they waited for some time without seeing any of those preparations which usually precede a ant  The lanthorn  with ten thousand tapers  was not yet brought forth  the fire works  which usually covered the city walls  were not yet lighted  the people once more began to murmur at this delay  when in the midst of their impatience  the palace gates flew open  and the emperor himself appeared  not in splendour or magnificence  but in an ordinary habit  followed by the blind  the maimed  and the strangers of the city  all in new cloaths  and each carrying in his hand money enough to supply his necessities for the year  The people were at first amazed  but soon perceived the wisdom of their king  who taught them  that to make one man happy was more truly great than having ten thousand captives groaning at the wheels of his chariot  Adieu   LETTER XXIV  To the same   WHatever may be the merits of the English in other sciences  they seem peculiarly excellent in the art of healing  There is scarcely a disorder incident to humanity  against which they are not possessed with a most infallible antidote  The professors of other arts confess the inevitable intricacy   91 of things  talk with doubt  and decide with hesitation  but doubting is entirely unknown in medicine  the advertising professors here delight in cases of difficulty  be the disorder never so desperate or radical  you will find numbers in every street  who  by leveling a pill at the part affected  promise a certain cure without loss of time  knowledge of a bedfellow  or hindrance of business   When I consider the assiduity of this profession  their benevolence amazes me  They not only in general give their medicines for half value  but use the most persuasive remonstrances to induce the sick to come and be cured  Sure there must be something strangely obstinate in an English patient  who refuses so much health upon such easy terms  does he take a pride in being bloated with a dropsy  Does he find pleasure in the alternations of an intermittent fever  Or feel as much satisfaction in nursing up his gout  as he found pleasure in acquiring it  He must  otherwise he would never reject such repeated assurances of instant relief  What can be more convincing than the manner in which the sick are invited to be well  The doctor first begs the most earnest attention of the public to what he is going to propose  he solemnly affirms the pill was never found to want success  he produces a list of those who have been rescued from the grave by taking it  Yet  notwithstanding all this  there are many here who now and then think proper to be sick  only sick did I say  There are some who even think proper to die  Yes  by the head of Confucius they die  though they might have purchased the health restoring specific for half a crown at every corner     92I am amazed  my dear Fum Hoam  that these doctors who know what an obstinate set of people they have to deal with  have never thought of attempting to revive the dead  When the living are found to reject their prescriptions  they ought in conscience to apply to the dead  from whom they can expect no such mortifying repulses  they would find in the dead the most complying patients imaginable  and what gratitude might they not expect from the patient s son  now no longer an heir
