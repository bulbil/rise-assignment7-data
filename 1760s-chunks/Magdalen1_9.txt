a couple of guineas and a trifling treat at the tavern —All these considerations put together  induce me to think marriage a very desirable institution —and  as I never knew what it was to be heartily in love  I think I have as fair a chance for   50 felicity with this beautiful girl I am engaged to  as with any body else —My reason  to say nothing of my vanity  therefore is much more concerned in the affair than my inclination  Before I was sure of her  I really felt some anxieties on her account—but now I am pretty certain both of her heart and her person  I almost begin to shudder at the approaching alliance  notwithstanding my absolute conviction of its propriety —Such unaccountable creatures are we  Melmoth  impatiently burning for what we find it difficult to enjoy  and sickening with apprehension the moment we get the blessing in our reach —There is no describing my present situation to you  I am the strangest compound of contradiction in the whole circuit of creation  and am one minute ready to reject what the next appears most essential both to my honour and my happiness     51Lady Haversham has just now done a very obliging thing with her usual tenderness and delicacy  she had promised to drink tea with me in the evening at Louisa s—and was to call on me in her chariot at seven for that purpose—but being prevented by the intrusion of some unexpected visitors  she sent one of her footmen to me with a little box  sealed up in a large sheet of paper  which contained a suit of diamonds to the value of five thousand pounds—they were accompanied by the following note  which I assure you gave me every whit as much satisfaction as the present itself   MY dear brother has this day made me the happiest woman in the world —As a mark of my gratitude  I therefore beg he will accept of this little box  and present it at a convenient time to his intended lady—The   52 least hesitation to receive it I shall consider as a proof of his neglect  and a want of that sincere and cordial affection which he will be always sure of finding in his  Affectionate Sister  HAVERSHAM   The jewels  Charles  are elegant to an excess—and I purpose carrying them to the amiable girl in the evening  I dare say we shall have a delicious tete a tete—for the old people  as their stay is to be so short in Bath  have a variety of engagements on their hands  What a pity it is  my dear friend  that our fancy will not always obey the dictates of our reason—Do you know now that I would give a thousand pounds to be heartily in love with Miss Mildmay  the match is really so desirable in itself  and my sister appears so strenuous for its taking place  that I am actually concerned to   53 find myself so little influenced by inclination—Yet I don t know  upon the whole  but that those marriages are the best calculated for felicity which have the least of passion in their commencement  I have seen a multitude of people venturing their necks to come together  who  a month after their union  would venture their necks for a divorce with an equal degree of alacrity —One thing I am assured of  Charles  which is  that  if I do not make a fond husband  I shall at least make a good natured one —I flatter myself that hitherto I have shewn no great want either of humanity or manners  and  let me tell you  that a man of this cast is much more likely to make a woman happy  than he who sets out upon a romantic stock of rapture  and is much too exalted a lover to be satisfied merely with content  The generality of men  by expecting too much in their marriages  ridiculously sacrifice those blessings which   54 the state is really capable of affording  instead of a rational tranquility they are buoyed up with a continual notion of tumultuary transports  and imagine  if they do not find their wives something more than goddesses  they must be something less than women  In like manner the women look for as much courtship after the union as before it  accustomed to an intoxicating round of fulsome adulation  they really believe themselves the wonders we represent them  and think it surprizing that we should relax in the least from that profound adoration with which they have all along been so respectfully distinguished  Thus both parties being led to expect too much  as I have already said  each is unhappily disappointed  and good naturedly ascribes to the other those very uneasinesses which actually proceed from the folly of its own imagination  Hence a thousand   55 jealousies and altercations take their birth  and hence poor matrimony undergoes a thousand censures from its want of power to make a couple of fools happier than is consistent with the lot of humanity  or the narrowness of their own understandings —But adieu  dear Charles—it is high time to dress  and I am determined to be as much as possible with Louisa  in hopes that the numberless attractions which she possesses may make me fairly enamoured  against the celebration of our nuptials  I am  honest Melmoth   Your own ROBERT HAROLD     56  LETTER V  Mss HARRIOT BEAUCLERK to Miss LOUISA MILDMAY
