happy in my acquaintance  for the ladies were polite  good tempered  and  obliging  and treated me with the utmost hospitality and respect  Among  others  I contracted a friendship with Madame la comtesse de C   and her  two daughters  who were very amiable young ladies  and became intimate  with the Princess C   and Countess W    lady of the bedchamber to the  queen of Hungary  and a great favourite of the governor  Monsieur d H     in whose house she lived with his wife  who was also a lady of a very  engaging disposition    Soon after I had fixed my habitation in Brussels  the company at our  hotel was increased by three officers  who professed themselves my  admirers  and came from Ghent  with a view of soliciting my love  This  triumvirate consisted of the Scotch earl of     Lord R M    and another  young officer  The first was a man of a very genteel figure and amorous  complexion  danced well  and had a great deal of good humour  with a  mixture of vanity and self conceit  The second had a good face  though  a clumsy person  and a very sweet disposition  very much adapted for the  sentimental passion of love  And the third  Mr  W   by name  was tall   thin  and well bred  with a great stock of good nature and vivacity   These adventurers began their addresses in general acts of gallantry   that comprehended several of my female friends  with whom we used to  engage in parties of pleasure  both in the city and the environs   which are extremely agreeable  When they thought they had taken the  preliminary steps of securing themselves in my good opinion and esteem   they agreed to go on without further delay  and that Lord    should make  the first attack upon my heart    He accordingly laid siege to me  with such warmth and assiduity  that I  believe he deceived himself  and began to think he was actually in love   though  at bottom  he felt no impulse that deserved the sacred name   Though I discouraged him in the beginning  he persecuted me with his  addresses  he always sat by me at dinner  and imparted a thousand  trifles in continual whispers  which attracted the notice of the company  so much  that I began to fear his behaviour would give rise to some  report to my prejudice  and therefore avoided him with the utmost  caution  Notwithstanding all my care  however  he found means one night   while my maid  who lay in my room  went downstairs  to get into my  chamber after I was abed  Upon which  I started up  and told him  that   if he should approach me  I would alarm the house  for I never wanted  courage and resolution  Perceiving my displeasure  he kneeled by the  bedside  begged I would have pity on his sufferings  and swore I  should have carte blanche to the utmost extent of his fortune  To these  proposals I made no other reply  but that of protesting I would never  speak to him again  if he did not quit my apartment that moment  upon  which he thought proper to withdraw  and I never afterwards gave him  an opportunity of speaking to me on the same subject  So that  in a  few weeks  he separated himself from our society  though the ladies of  Brussels considered him as my lover  because  of all the other officers   he was their greatest favourite     6 22 15  3 45 PM    His lordship being thus repulsed  Mr  W   took the field  and assailed  my heart in a very different manner  He said he knew not how to make  love  but was a man of honour  and would keep the secret  and so forth   To this cavalier address I answered  that I was not angry as I otherwise  should have been  at his blunt declaration  because I found by his own  confession  he did not know what was due to the sex  and my unhappy  situation in some shape excused him for a liberty which he would  not have dreamed of taking  had not my misfortunes encouraged his  presumption  But I would deal with him in his own way  and  far from  assuming the prude  frankly assured him  that he was not at all to my  taste  hoping he would consider my dislike as a sufficient reason to  reject his love    Lord R   began to feel the symptoms of a genuine passion  which he  carefully cherished in silence  being naturally diffident and bashful   but  by the very means he used to conceal it from my observation   I plainly discerned the situation of his heart  and was not at all  displeased at the progress I had made in his inclinations  Meanwhile he  cultivated my acquaintance with great assiduity and respect  attended me
