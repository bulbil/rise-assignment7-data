neighbour  Ah  if times were as good now as in my early days  my purse should be at your service as a friend  and even now  in the present distress of the money  market  it goes against the grain to take a poor twenty per cent  But one would think the money was all gone back to the mines whence it came  there is no such thing to be had  and the scarcity compels me to depart a little from the disinterested severity of my benevolence  How much do you want  pursued he  addressing my master  Two hundred pistoles  answered Don Matthias  I have four hundred here in a bag  replied the usurer  it is only to give you half of them  At the same time he drew from underneath his cloak a blue bag  looking just like that in which farmer Talego had left five hundred pistoles with Rodriguez  I was not long in forming my judgment of the matter  and saw plainly that Melendez had not bragged without reason of the steward s aptness in the ways of the world  The old man emptied the bag  displayed the cash on a table  and set about counting it  The sight set all my master s extravagant passions in a flame  the sum total proved very striking to his comprehension  Signor Descomulgado  said he to the usurer  I have just made a very sensible reflection  I am a great fool  I only borrow enough to redeem my credit  without thinking of my empty pockets  I should be obliged to give you the trouble of coming again to morrow  I think  therefore  it will be best to spare your age and infirmities  and ease you of the four hundred at once  My lord  answered the old man  I had destined half of this money to a good licentiate  who lays out the income of his large preferments in those pious and charitable uses for which they were originally given to the clergy  as stewards of the poor  and guides to the young and unwary  In pursuance of this end  it is his great delight to wean young girls from the seductions of a wicked world  and place them in a snug well furnished little box of his own  where they may be obnoxious to his ghostly admonitions by day and by night  But  since you have occasion for the whole sum  it is at your disposal  Some thing by way of security         Oh  as for security  interrupted Rodriguez  taking a paper out of his pocket  you shall have as good as the bank  Here is a note which Signor Don Matthias has only just to sign  He makes over five hundred pistoles  due from one of his tenants  Talego  a wealthy yeoman of Mondejar  That is enough  replied the usurer  I never split hairs  but deal upon the square  The steward insinuated a pen between his master s fingers  who signed his name at the bottom of the note  without reading it  and whistled as he signed  for want of thought   That business settled  the old man took his leave of my noble employer  who shook him cordially by the hand  saying  Till I have  the pleasure of seeing you again  good master pounds  shillings  and pence  I am your most devoted humble servant  I do not know why you should all be lumped together for a set of blood suckers  you seem to me a necessary link in the chain of well ordered society  You are as good as a physician to us pecuniary invalids of quality  and keep us alive by artificial restoratives in the last stage of a consumptive purse  You are in the right  exclaimed Centellés  Usurers are a very gentlemanly order in society  and I must not be denied the privilege of paying my compliments to this illustrious specimen  for the sake of his twenty per cent  With this banter  he came up and threw his arms about the old man s neck  and these two overgrown children  for their amusement  began sending him backward  and forward between them like a shuttlecock  After they had tossed him about from pillar to post  they suffered him to depart with the steward  who ought to have come in for his share of the game  and for something a little more serious   When Rodriguez and his stalking horse had left the room  Don Matthias sent  by the lacquey in waiting  half his pistoles to the Countess de Pedrosa  and deposited the other half in a long purse worked with gold and silk  which he usually wore in his pocket  Very well pleased to find himself in cash  he said to Don Antonio  with an air of gaiety  What shall we do with ourselves to day  Let us call a council  That is talking like a statesman  answered Centellés  I am your man  let us ponder gravely  While they were collecting their deliberative wisdom on the course they were to pursue for the day  two other noblemen came in  Don Alexo Segiar and Don Ferdinand de Gamboa  both nearly about my master s age  that is  from eight and twenty to thirty  These four jolly blades began with such
