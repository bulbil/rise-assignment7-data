appointed a   certain hour for uttering the fatal sentence  I got up under visible   concern and retired       From the bench  so please your graciousness  I withdrew to   my closet  and  having locked myself up  I called upon my tutelary   and never erring directors in the solution of all knots and un    winding of all intricacies  In short  I went to a little drawer and   took out my box and dice        Box and dice   exclaimed the monarch  half starting from his   seat        Yes  sire   replied the judge     I repeat it  box and dice  And   if your majesty will be pleased to attend for a few moments  I trust   to convince you of the propriety of this proceeding        Humanum est errare  This  my liege  is a maxim that has never   yet been controverted by precept or by practice   and it is as much   as to say that life is a mere labyrinth of errors  in which all men are   appointed to travel and to stray       Nothing save number and measure is yet determined upon   earth nothing is certain  save that two and two make four  and   that lines are equal  or differ according to their dimensions       All men  further than this  depend upon reason as their en    lightener and director in the search of truth   and yet reason itself   has nothing whereon it may rest or depend  It first doubts  and   then proceeds to examine   it calls in evidence and arguments on   this side and on that side  pro and con  it compares  canvasses          154 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      and discusses   sifts and boults matters  suppose to the very bran     it endeavours to poise the scales of its own uncertainty  and now   recovers some lapsed circumstance and casts it into this scale  and   again throws some new proof or discovery into that scale  and so   changes its opinion from day to day   while prejudice and partiality   stand invisibly at its elbow  and at length determine the long sus    pended balance by casting their own weights into one scale or other    according as interest or pleasure would wish to preponderate       Truth  so please your supremacy  has been sunk in so very   deep a well as to mock the five inched fathom of mere human ra    tiocination  whether it be a dealer or retailer of physics or meta    physics   of the distinctions in law  or the distinctions in philosophy    and I flatter myself that I alone  the least and most unlikely of all   your majesty s subjects  have hit upon a method for fishing up   truth  by a line which I acknowledge is not of my own twisting        Within my memory  and nearly within that of your majesty    particular laws have been in force for trial by combat  and trial by   ordeal   and though at present those laws are held to have been   iniquitous and wholly absurd  they could not have been instituted   without just and ponderous reasons  They related  my liege  as my   sentences do  to the interposition of Providence in the Jewish lots    whereby all doubts  however general  could be speedily ascertained    where the nation drew lots according to tribes  the tribes accord    ing to families  and the families by individuals  till the criminal   was detected       Thus  in trial by combat  I have known and read manifold   instances  wherein guilty courage and prowess have been foiled by   the weak and fearful   and  in trial by ordeal  heaven never failed   to guide the steps of the hood winked innocent between the   narrow intervals of the burning ploughshares  And thus  con    scious of my own infirmity and blindness  I have referred all my   decrees to a power of better discernment   and he never failed to   determine according to truth         Indeed   said the monarch    I cannot wholly disapprove your   method  when I reflect on your motive  And  according to your   account  when I think on the plague and anxiety  loss of time and   loss of fortune  to which my subjects are put by these professors of   the law  you have clearly convinced me  my good lord judge  that   it would be infinitely better to cast dice at the beginning  than to   give the most righteous judgment at the end of any lawsuit
