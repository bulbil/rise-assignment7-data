was for life       Madame De — turned quick   And is not marriage for life         True  Madam  and  what is worse  without a year of probation  I confess the force of your argument        I have never dared since to mention convents before Madame De —       Between you and I  Lucy  it is a little unreasonable that people will come together entirely upon sordid principles  and then wonder they are not happy  in delicate minds  love is seldom the consequence of marriage       It is not absolutely certain that a marriage of which love is the foundation will be happy  but it is infallible  I believe  that no other can be so to souls capable of tenderness       Half the world  you will please to observe  have no souls  at least none but of the vegetable and animal kinds  to this species of beings  love and sentiment are entirely unnecessary  they were made to travel through life in a state of mind neither quite awake nor asleep  and it is perfectly equal to them in what company they take the journey       You and I  my dear  are something awakened  therefore it is necessary we should love where we marry  and for this reason  our souls  being of the active kind  can never be totally at rest  therefore  if we were not to love our husbands  we should be in dreadful danger of loving somebody else       For my part  whatever tall maiden aunts and cousins may say of the indecency of a young woman s distinguishing one man from another  and of love coming after marriage  I think marrying  in that expectation  on sober prudent principles  a man one dislikes  the most deliberate and shameful degree of vice of which the human mind is capable       I cannot help observing here  that the great aim of modern education seems to be  to eradicate the best impulses of the human heart  love  friendship  compassion  benevolence  to destroy the social  and encrease the selfish principle  Parents wisely attempt to root out those affections which should only be directed to proper objects  and which heaven gave us as the means of happiness  not considering that the success of such an attempt is doubtful  and that  if they succeed  they take from life all its sweetness  and reduce it to a dull unactive round of tasteless days  scarcely raised above vegetation       If my ideas of things are right  the human mind is naturally virtuous  the business of education is therefore less to give us good impressions  which we have from nature  than to guard us against bad ones  which are generally acquired       And so ends my sermon       Adieu  my dear   Your faithful  A  FERMOR       A letter from your brother  I believe the dear creature is out of his wits  Emily has consented to marry him  and one would imagine by his joy that nobody was ever married before       He is going to Lake Champlain  to fix on his seat of empire  or rather Emily s  for I see she will be the reigning queen  and he only her majesty s consort       I am going to Quebec  two or three dry days have made the roads passable for summer carriages  Fitzgerald is come to fetch me  Adieu    Eight o clock       I am come back  have seen Emily  who is the happiest woman existing  she has heard from your brother  and in such terms his letter breathes the very soul of tenderness  I wish they were richer  I don t half relish their settling in Canada  but  rather than not live together  I believe they would consent to be set ashore on a desart island  Good night     LETTER CXXXIII   133   To the Earl of —   Silleri  April 25   THE pleasure the mind finds in travelling  has undoubtedly  my Lord  its source in that love of novelty  that delight in acquiring new ideas  which is interwoven in its very frame  which shews itself on every occasion from infancy to age  which is the first passion of the human mind  and the last       There is nothing the mind of man abhors so much as a state of rest  the great secret of happiness is to keep the soul in continual action  without those violent exertions  which wear out its powers  and dull its capacity of enjoyment  it should have exercise  not labor       Vice may justly be called the fever of the soul  inaction its lethargy  passion  under the guidance of virtue  its health       I have the pleasure to see my daughter s coquetry giving place to a tender affection for a very worthy man  who seems formed to make her happy  his fortune is easy  he is a gentleman  and a man of worth and honor  and  what perhaps inclines me to be more partial to him  of my own profession       I mention the last circumstance in order to introduce a request  that your
