to  a smelling bottle   The bride  who understood the whole mystery  was the only person that  acted with deliberation and composure  she imputed Emilia s disorder to  the right cause  which was no other than concern for the condition of  her lover  and assured the ladies there was nothing extraordinary in Mr   Pickle s going off  he being subject to fainting fits  by which he was  often overtaken without any previous notice  The arrival of Gauntlet  confirmed the truth of this declaration  He made an apology to the  company in the name of his friend  who  he told them  was suddenly  taken ill  and they returned to their diversion of dancing  with this  variation  Emilia was so disordered and fatigued  that she begged to  be excused from continuing the exercise  and Peregrine s partner  being disengaged  was paired with the young officer  for whom she  was originally designed  Meanwhile  the bride withdrew into another  apartment with her sister  and expostulated with her upon her cruelty  to Mr  Pickle  assuring her  from Godfrey s information  that he had  undergone a severe fit on her account  which  in all likelihood  would have a dangerous effect upon his constitution  Though Emily was  inflexible in her answers to the kind remonstrances of the gentle  Sophy  her heart was melting with the impressions of pity and love  and   finding herself unable to perform the duty of her function  in putting  the bride to bed  she retired to her own chamber  and in secret  sympathized with the distemper of her lover   In the morning  as early as decency would permit him to leave the arms  of his dear wife  Captain Gauntlet made a visit to Peregrine  who had  passed a very tedious and uneasy night  having been subject to short  intervals of delirium  during which Pipes had found it very difficult to  keep him fast belayed  He owned indeed to Godfrey  that his imagination  had been haunted by the ideas of Emilia and her officer  which tormented  him to an unspeakable degree of anguish and distraction  and that  he would rather suffer death than a repetition of such excruciating  reflections  He was  however  comforted by his friend  who assured  him  that his sister s inclinations would in time prevail over all the  endeavours of resentment and pride  illustrating this asseveration by an  account of the manner in which she was affected by the knowledge of  his disorder  and advising him to implore the mediation of Sophy  in a  letter which she should communicate to Emilia   This was an opportunity which our hero thought too favourable to be  neglected  calling for paper  he sat up in his bed  and  in the first  transports of his emotion  wrote the following petition to Godfrey s  amiable wife          Dear Madam  The affliction of a contrite heart can never       appeal to your benevolence in vain  and  therefore  I       presume to approach you in this season of delight  with       the language of sorrow  requesting that you will espouse       the cause of an unhappy lover  who mourns with unutterable       anguish over his ruined hope  and intercede for my pardon       with that divine creature  whom  in the intemperance and       excess of passion  I have so mortally offended  Good Heaven     6 22 15  3 45 PM        is my guilt inexpiable  Am I excluded from all hope of       remission  Am I devoted to misery and despair  I have       offered all the atonement which the most perfect and sincere       penitence could suggest  and she rejects my humility and       repentance  If her resentment would pursue me to the grave        let her signify her pleasure  and may I be branded with the       name of villain  and remembered with infamy and detestation       to all posterity  if I hesitate one moment in sacrificing a       life which is odious to Emilia  Ah  madam  while I thus pour       forth the effusions of my grief and distraction  I look       around the apartment in which I lie  and every well known       object that salutes my view  recalls to my remembrance that       fond  that happy day  on which the fair  the good  the       tender hearted Sophy became my advocate  though I was a       stranger to her acquaintance  and effected a transporting       reconciliation between me and that same enchanting beauty        that is
