when  how  where did Les Roches perish  Could not  his followers defend him  Or did they desert him  Perfidious men  Where  were their coward swords  when the malice of his persecutors tore his  poor helpless body  No faithful friend to defend him  No charitable hand  to close his dying eyes   Here a flood of tears broke forth  while my  countrymen wondered at her emotion  and eager to remove her suspicions   declared  that Les Roches had wanted neither fidelity nor courage to  defend him    Lives he  cried the maid   where  lead me to him   And  again resigned herself to sorrow  when the Englishmen declared that they  were strangers to his fate  nor knew his place of residence if yet  alive  I interposed to moderate her passion  then turning to my friends   demanded the full relation of their fortunes  since treachery and  oppression had last torn us from each other     They had been persuaded   as I now learned  that I must have been seized  in the castle  and that  I now lay under the severe oppression of captivity  as Les Roches had  instantly acquainted them with the secret of his daughter s being  conveyed to Poictiers  with his apprehensions of my precipitate zeal   and the measures he had taken to prevent any rash purpose of throwing  myself into the hands of my pursuers  They had attended him in his  sudden excursion to collect his forces  and in the gallant act of  defending him  they had been particularly animated by Fitz Alan  the man  whose inconsiderate error had first disclosed my name in the isle of  Rh√®  and who now fought with redoubled sury  to atone for his fatal  imprudence  He it was who  when Les Roches lay surrounded and disarmed   hewed his way thro  unequal numbers  and led the brave Englishmen to  his rescue  They took their course from his direction  and conveyed him  to the neighbouring hills  where secret and unvisited retreats received  him  and where the vigilance and bravery of his followers guarded  against the approach of frand and violence  His own countrymen  awed by  the denunciations of Chauvigny  deserted their unhappy chief  the  helpless and abandoned victim of fatigue and want  The woods supplied  his nourishment  the naked turf received his devoted head  whilst the  sidelity and affection of his associates watched his broken slumbers   Long time had they attended him from one retreat to another  thro  a  series of uniform distress  without any new or extraordinary change of  fortune   till on one fatal morning  they whose industry bad been  employed in hunting for food  and they who had the charge of watching  near his humble couch  were struck with confusion and surprize  when  they came to seek their leader  He had suddenly disappeared  nor could  their most diligent enquiries learn his new residence  or inform them of  his fate  And now  impatient of their situation  and determined rather  to yield themselves into the hands of their enemies  than to waste a  tedious life in distressful and useless retirement  they descended  from their mountains  and boldly adventured into more known and more  frequented paths  Here they soon found that the hopes of regaining  England were not yet to be resigned  Pursuit and difficulty had ceased   they passed on unnoticed and unmolested  and at length gained the coast   where we were now all happily assembled     The vessel lay ready to receive us  we embarqued with joy  yet still  cautious to guard against malice and hostility  I continued my disguise   The winds were long unfavourable  and frequently were our souls  terrified with the most alarming menaces of destruction  Twice did I  embrace my lovely charge  in firm persuasion that I had taken my last  and final farewel  and that the approaching hour must have consigned us  to one general ruin  Yet still the holy saints denied not their  protection  Courage and vigour unabated  successfully contended against  the angry elements  Harassed  wasted  and oppressed with toil  we at  length gained the cheering prospect of our dear native shore  Here out  shattered vessel happily arrived  and here we repose our wearied limbs  under your hospitable protection                  SECT  IV     THE Earl ceased  and Randolph  who had listened with exact attention   paused for a moment  in thoughtful silence  raised his eyes and hands  to heaven  in rapturous admiration  and grateful acknowledgement of  that power which had hitherto conducted his friend safely through this  variety of peril and distress  then freely exclaimed at the envy of  Mal leon  the tyranny of Chauvigny  and the treachery of D Aumont  with  all the zeal of generous indignation and abhorrence  His tears  confessed that pity with which he thought on the cruel sate of Les  Roches  and infected the Earl with a render emotion of grief for the  misfortunes
