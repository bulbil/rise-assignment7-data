and retire   to his seat in the country  and there endeavour to lose the remembrance   of all that had been displeasing to him since he left it                CHAPTER XVIII       Is of very small importance  yet contains such things as the reader may   expect to hear          While Mr  Trueworth was employing himself in exploring the truth of Miss   Betsy s imaginary crime  and hunting after secrets to render her more   unworthy of his love  that young lady s head was no less taken up with   him  though in a widely different manner  she wanted not a just sense of   the merits  both of his person and passion  and though a plurality of   lovers  the power of flattering the timid with vain hopes  and awing the   proudest into submission  seemed to her a greater triumph than to be the   wife of the most deserving man on earth  yet when she consulted her   heart  she found  and avowed within herself  she could part with the   triumph with less reluctance in favour of Mr  Trueworth than of any   other she yet had seen       His absence  therefore  and the strange neglect he testified in not   sending to acquaint her with the cause  gave her as much inquietude as a   person of her humour could be capable of feeling  but whether it   proceeded in reality from the first shootings of a growing inclination    or from that vanity which made her dread the loss of so accomplished a   lover  cannot be easily determined  but to which soever of these causes   it was owing  I think we may be pretty certain  that had he visited her   in the situation her mind then was  he would have had no reason to   complain of his reception       She never went abroad without flattering herself with the expectation of   hearing  on her return home  that he had been there  or at least that   some letter or message from him had been left for her  and every   disappointment involved her in fresh perplexity  In short  if she had   considered him with half that just regard  while he continued to think   her worthy of his affections  as she was beginning to do when he was   endeavouring to drive all favourable ideas of her from his mind  they   might both have been as happy as at present they were the contrary       She had been with Miss Mabel  and two other ladies of her acquaintance    to see that excellent comedy  called the Careless Husband  she was very   much affected with some scenes in it  she imagined she saw herself in   the character of Lady Betty Modish  and Mr  Trueworth in that of Lord   Morelove  and came home full of the most serious reflections on the   folly of indulging an idle vanity  at the expence of a man of honour and   sincerity  She was no sooner within the doors  than the letter   above mentioned was put into her hands  as they told her it had been   left for her in the beginning of the evening  by one of Mr  Trueworth s   servants  and she knew  both by the superscription  and device on the   seal  that it came from that gentleman  she ran hastily up stairs to her   chamber  in order to examine the contents  but what flutterings seized   her heart  what an universal agitation diffused itself through all her   frame  on reading even the first lines of this cruel epistle   Good   Heaven   cried she   going out of town  not to return   And then    proceeding a little farther   What   added she   not see me before he   goes  Sure the man is either mad  or I am in a dream        Surprize  and some mixture of a tender remorse  were the first emotions   of her soul  but when she came to that part of the letter which seemed   to reflect upon her conduct  and the way in which she chose to live  her   native haughtiness re assumed it s former power  and turned her all into   disdain and rage   No retrospect   said she   on my own behaviour  can   ever justify the audacious reproaches he treats me with  If I have been   to blame  it is not his province to upbraid me with it        As she was entirely ignorant of the base artifice that had been put in   practice against her  and was conscious of no fault Mr  Trueworth had to   accuse her of  but that of her going with Miss Forward to the play    after the
