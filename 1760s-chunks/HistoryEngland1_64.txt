two Lords more  came to offer her their lives and fortunes  a dawn of hope was sufficient to raise her courage  and her numerous misfortunes gave way to the flattering prospect of another trial  She had now fought battles in almost every province in England  Tewkesbury park was the last scene  that terminated her misfortunes  The Duke of Somerset headed her army  a man who had shared her dangers  and had ever been steady in her cause  He was valiant  generous  and polite  but rash and headstrong  when Edward first attacked him in his intrenchments  he repulsed him with such vigour  that the enemy retired with precipitation  Somerset  supposing them routed  immediately pursued  and ordered Lord Wenlock to support him  while he charged  but this Lord disobeyed his injunctions  and the forces of Somerset were over powered by numbers  Somerset now  finding all gone  was unable to govern his rage  he had depended upon Wenlock  but  when he beheld him inactive  in the very place where he had first drawn up his men  giving way to his transport  with his heavy battle ax in both hands  he ran upon the coward  and  with one blow  dashed out his brains     188 After the battle  the Queen  torpid with griefs was taken prisoner  and afterwards had the misery of finding her son  the Prince of Wales  in the same condition  But this noble youth was not long in bondage  being brought into the victor s presence  he appeared before him with undaunted majesty  Edward  surprized at the boy s behaviour  asked him  How he durst enter into his dominions without leave    I have entered the dominions of my father  replied the Prince  to revenge his injuries  and to redress my own    The barbarous Monarch  enraged at his intrepidity  struck him on the mouth with his gauntlet  this seemed to be the signal for his death  Gloucester  Clarence  and others  like wild beasts  rushing upon the unarmed youth at once  stabbed him to the heart with their daggers  When the governors of a kingdom behave thus  what must be the behaviour of the people  To complete the tragedy  Henry himself  who had long been the passive spectator of all these cruelties  was now thought unfit to live  The Duke of Gloucester  afterwards named Richard III  or the Crouch back  entering his chamber alone  murdered him in cold blood  Of all those that were taken  none were suffered to survive but Margaret herself  it was  perhaps  expected that she would be ransomed by the King of France  and in this they were not deceived  Lewis XI  paid the King of England fifty thousand crowns for her freedom  Thus Margaret of Anjou  after having sustained the cause of her husband in twelve battles  after having survived her fortune and her children  died a few years after in privacy in France  very miserable indeed  but with no other claims to our pity  except her courage and her distresses       189 Of all people in the world the English are the most compassionate  a throne raised upon cruelty never wanted enemies among them  and nothing could ever have been more ridiculous than attempting to govern such subjects as the English by the hand of the executioner  The heads of either faction seemed to have been insensible of this truth  and it was their ill judged punishments  which  by turns  plunged them into new distresses  A tyrant  however  when once drenched in blood  knows not when to give over  Edward  being now freed from great enemies  turned to the punishment of those of lesser note  the gibbets were hung with his adversaries  and their estates confiscated to his use   Yet  while he was thus rendering himself terrible on the one hand  he was immersed in gallantry on the other  Nature  it seems  was not unfavourable to him in this respect  for he was universally allowed to be the most beautiful man of his time  The court seemed willing to countenance those debaucheries  in which they had a share  and the clergy  as they themselves practised every species of lewdness with impunity  were ever ready to lend absolution for all his failings  The truth is  enormous vices had been of late so common  that adultery was held but a very slight offence  among the number of his mistresses was the wife of one Shore  a woman of exquisite beauty and good sense  but who had not virtue enough to withstand the temptations of a beautiful man and a Monarch   England now enjoying a temporary calm  the King thought the best way to ingratiate himself with the people  was to assert his right to his domains in France  which the insurrections of his   190 father had contributed to alienate in the former reign  this proposal was sure of pleasing the English  who ever appeared more fond of splendid than useful acquisitions  To prosecute this scheme  therefore  he sends his ally  the Duke of Burgundy  a reinforcement of three thousand men  and soon after passed over himself at the head of a numerous army  Lewis XI  then King of France
