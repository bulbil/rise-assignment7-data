 supported by the Doctrine of eternal Misery  For my Part  I have been often guilty of Vice  with all the Fear and Trembling of an orthodox Christian  and have  at other Times  been capable of Virtue  without the least Contemplation about Hope   As true Religion consists in the perfect Love of God    I do not see how Fear is  any way  necessary to Piety  except that best and strongest of all Fears  which proceeds from extreme Love    There is Mercy with thee  therefore shalt thou be feared   And I cannot help joining Page  341 with Shaftsbury  who says   that Priests have made Religion so very selfish  that I do not see  after all  what Merit there is in it worth rewarding   Fear may deter from Vice  but can never conduce to Virtue     The less we suppose the Deity capable of Cruelty or Revenge  the higher our Love must naturally rise  and it is certain that Mankind is apt to undertake nobler and more difficult Actions from the Spirit of Love  than from the Passion of Fear  There is a Courage in our Natures  which spurns at Fear  but a Tenderness in our Frames  which disposes to Love  And  if any Man is base enough to be influenced by Terror  it is because he has not had his Mind sufficiently imbued with more worthy Principles  and  in this Case  which is corrupt Morals  it is too often found that even Fear will have no Avail  Instances are numberless of moral Pagans  independent of Hope  For  tho  in the Writings of the Antients there are very fine Reasonings upon a future Life  and Retributions of Justice  yet these appear to be rather the Effect of their Philosophy  than the Cause of their Virtue   The Jesuits have a blasphemous Tenet with regard to Communicants    That Attrition alone  which proceeds merely from the Fear of Hell Torments  without Contrition  which Page  342 comprehends the Love of God  is sufficient to justify a Sinner at the Sacrament     I will here give you some of the truly religious Sentiments of Father Quesnel  which I think regard this Subject  and  in order to raise your Esteem for them  I need only tell you  they are some of the Propositions condemned by the infamous Bull Unigenitus     As Sin proceeds from a mistaken Love of ourselves  so Virtue proceeds from a true Love of God       Fear stops only the Hand  but the Heart remaineth adherent to Sin  as long as it is not directed by the Love of Justice       He  who refrains from Evil only out of Fear of Punishment  commits it in his Heart  and is already guilty of it before God       He  who is baptized  is yet under the Law  even as a Jew  if he doth not fulfil it  or if he fulfil it only thro  Fear       Moses  and the Prophets  the Priests  and the Doctors of the Law are dead  without sending any Children to God  since they have made Slaves  but thro  Fear       They  that are under the Curse of the Law  do no Good  because it is equal Sin to do Evil  or to shun it thro  Fear       He  that approacheth God  should not come to him with brutal Passions  nor be Page  343 led by Instinct or Fear  as Beasts  but by Faith and Love  as Children       Slavish Fear represents God as a severe  imperious  unjust  and unmerciful Master     To all which I shall add  that Fear may make good Citizens  but Love alone makes good Christians  And  upon the whole  I really think that in my Doctrine there is Mystery enough to exercise Faith  and Inducements sufficient to influence Action   Adieu   my Fanny   Henry   Several other Thoughts occurred to me upon this Subject  but I think I have hinted them in former Letters   LETTER CCCXX   I HAVE  ever since the Close of my late nice and extraordinary Subject  been examining and viewing it in several Lights  to find out whether my Reasoning had proceeded from the Prejudice of former Opinions  or had arisen from an Hope produced by a Sinner s Fear  But I found  that  during a constant Neglect of religious and Christian Duties  and a free Indulgence of a debauched and libertine Life  Page  344 I preserved an unhesitating Belief in the Orthodoxy of Hell Torments  and that   till within these few Years  that is  since I became in Practice  as well as Belief  a Christian  I never had the least Doubt upon the Subject  The Truth is  that I had never before given myself Leisure to reason about Religion  and had entirely rested upon a childish Belief  instead of supporting myself by a rational Faith  Perhaps a Dispute upon this Subject may be put an End to by a very strong  though not obvious  Distinction between
