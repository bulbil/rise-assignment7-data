reads them with delight   Very well  said Mr  Walden     But if this cannot be attained to  I would not have it reckoned that the education of an ill Latin scholar is to be given over      Thus far the Bishop  We all know  proceeded Mr  Reeves  how well Mr  Locke has treated this subject  And he is so far from discouraging the fair Sex from learning languages  that he gives us a method in his Treatise of Education  by which a mother may not only learn Latin herself  but be able to teach it to her son  Be not therefore  Ladies  ashamed either of your talents or acquirements  Only take care  you give not up any knowlege that is more laudable in your Sex  and more useful  for learning  and then I am sure  you will  you must  be the more agreeable  the more suitable companions to men of sense  Nor let any man have so narrow a mind as to be apprehensive for his own prerogative  from a learned woman  A woman who does not behave the better the more she knows  will make her husband uneasy  and will think as well of herself  were she utterly illiterate  nor would any argument convince her of her duty  Do not men marry with their eyes open  And cannot they court whom they please  A conceited  a vain mind in a woman cannot be hid  Upon the whole  I think it may be fairly concluded  that the more a woman knows  as well as a man  the wiser she will generally be  and the more regard she will have for a man of sense and learning   Here ended Mr  Reeves  Mr  Walden was silent  yet shrugged his shoulders  and seemed unsatisfied   The conversation then took a more general turn  in which every one bore a part  Plays  Fashion  Dress  and the Public Entertainments  were the subjects   Miss Cantillon  who had till now sat a little uneasy  seemed resolved to make up for her silence  But did not   78 shine at all where she thought herself most intitled to make a figure   But Miss Clements really shone  Yet in the eye of some people  what advantages has folly in a pretty face  over even wisdom in a plain one  Sir Hargrave was much more struck with the pert things spoken  without fear or wit  by Miss Cantillon  than with the just observations that fell from the lips of Miss Clements   Mr  Walden made no great figure on these fashionable subjects  no  not on that of Plays  For he would needs force into conversation  with a preference to our Shakespeare  his Sophocles  his Euripides  his Terence  of the merits of whose performances  except by translation  no one present but Mr  Reeves and himself  could judge   Sir Hargrave spoke well on the subject of the reigning fashions  and on modern dress  so much the foible of the present age   Lady Betty and Mrs  Reeves spoke very properly of the decency of dress  and propriety of fashions  as well as of public entertainments   Miss Clements put in here also with advantage to herself   Nor would Mr  Walden be excluded this topic  But  as the observations he made on it  went no deeper than what it was presumed he might have had at second hand  he made a worse figure here  than he did on his more favourite subject  He was  however  heard  till he was for bringing in his Spartan jacket  I forget what he called it  descending only to the knees of the women  in place of hoops  and the Roman toga for the men   My uncle will be pleased to remember  that Mr  Walden has given my letters the learned jaundice  Had not that gentleman been one of the company  not a word of all this jargon would my uncle have had from his Harriet  And yet all I have said is but   79 from common reading  And  let me ask  why  because we know but little  we are to be supposed to know nothing   Miss Barnevelt broke in upon the Scholar  but by way of approbation of what he said  and went on with subjects of heroism  without permitting him to rally and proceed  as he seemed inclined to do  After praising what he said of the Spartan and Roman dresses  she fell to enumerating her heroes  both antient and modern  Achilles  the savage Achilles  charmed her  Hector was a good clever man  however  Yet she could not bear to think of his being so mean as to beg for his life  tho  of her heroic Achilles  He deserved for it  she said  to have his corpse dragged round the Trojan walls at the wheels of the victor s chariot  Alexander the Great was her dear creature  and Julius Caesar was a very pretty fellow  These were Miss Barnevelt s antient heroes  Among the moderns  the great Scanderbeg  our Henry V  Henry IV  of France  Charles XII  of Sweden  and the great Czar Peter
