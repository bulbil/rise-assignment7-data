ease  But here another difficulty occurred  which was no other than the landlady s insisting on his paying for the pot he had rendered useless  he swore he would pay for nothing but what he had eat  and bid her be thankful for his moderation  or else he would prosecute her for damages —Strap foreseeing it would all land at him  promised to satisfy the cook  and called for a dram of gin to treat the drummer with  which entirely appeased him  and composed all animosities  After this our landlord and we sat down at a board  and dined upon shin of beef most deliciously  our reckoning amounting to two pence halfpenny each  bread and small beer included       104  CHAP  XIV   We visit Strap s friend—a description of him—his advice—we go to Mr  Cringer s house—are denied admittance—an accident befals Strap—his behaviour thereupon—an extraordinary adventure occurs  in the course of which I lose all my money   IN the afternoon  my companion proposed to to call at his friend s house  which  we were informed  was in the neighbourhood  whither we accordingly went  and were so lucky as to find him at home  This gentleman  who had come from Scotland three or four years ago  kept a school in town  where he taught the Latin  French and Italian languages  but what he chiefly professed was the pronounciation of the English tongue  after a method more speedy and uncommon than any practised heretofore  and indeed if his scholars spoke like their master  the latter part of his undertaking was certainly performed to a tittle  for although I could easily understand every word of what I had heard hitherto since I entered England  three parts in four of his dialect were as unintelligible to me  as if he had spoke in Arabick or Irish —He was a middle sized man  and stooped very much  though not above the age of forty  his face was very much pitted with the small pox  his eyes blear d  and his mouth extended from ear to ear —He was dressed in a   105 night gown of plaid  fastened about his middle with a serjeant s old sash  and a tie perriwig with a fore top three inches high  in the fashion of king Charles the second s reign —After he had received Strap  who was related to him  very courteously  he enquired of him  who I was  and being informed  took me by the hand  telling me  he was at school with my father —When he understood my situation  he assured me that he would do me all the service in his power  both by his advice and otherwise  and while he spoke these words  he eyed me with great attention  walking round me several times  and muttering     O Ch—st  O Ch—st  fat a saight is here  —  I soon guessed the reason of of his ejaculation  and said    I suppose  sir  you are not pleased with my dress  —   Dress   answered he  you may caal it fat you please  in your country  but I vaw to Gad   tis a masquerade here —No christian will admit such a figure into his hawse —Upon my conscience  I wonder the dogs did not hunt you —Did you pass through St  James s market —God bless my eye saight  you look like a cousin german of Ouran Outang  —  I began to be a little serious at this discourse  and asked him  if he thought I should obtain entrance tomorrow at the house Mr  Cringer  on whom I chiefly depended  for an introduction into business —   Mr  Cringer  Mr  Cringer  replied he  scratching his cheek  may be a very honest gentleman—I know nothing to the contrary  but is your sole dependance upon him —Who recommended you to him  —  I pulled out Mr  Crab s letter  and told him the foundation of my hopes  at which he stared at me  and repeated    106   O Ch—st  —  I began to conceive bad omens from this behaviour of his  and begged he would assist me with his advice  which he promised to do very frankly  and as a specimen  directed us to a perriwig ware house  in the neighbourhood  in order to be accommodated  laying strong injunctions on me not to appear before Mr  Cringer  till I had parted with these carroty locks  which  he said  were sufficient to beget an antipathy against me  in all mankind —And as we were going to pursue this advice  he called me back  and bid me be sure to deliver my letter into Mr  Cringer s own hand —As we walked along  Strap triumphed greatly in our reception with his friend  who  it seems  had assured him  he would in a day or two provide for him  with some good master  and   now  says he  you shall see how I will fit you with a wig—There s ne er a barber in London  and that s a bold word  can palm a rotten caul  or a penny weight of dead hair upon me  —  And indeed this zealous adherent did wrangle
