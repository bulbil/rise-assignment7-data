us engaged in conversation  was about to retire  But he  stepping to her  and taking both her hands—OUR Lucy  obligingly  said he  you must come in—You are to be one judge of three in a certain cause  that will come before you—And I hope—  No prejudgings  Sir Charles  said I—You are not to plead at all—  Yet deeply interested in the event  Miss Selby  said he   A bad sign  cousin Byron  said Lucy  I begin already to doubt the justice of your cause   When you hear it  Lucy  make  as you usually do  the golden rule yours  and I have nothing to fear   I tell you  before hand  I am inclined to favour Sir Charles  No three judges can be found  but will believe  from his character  that he cannot be wrong     191 But from mine  that I may  O my Lucy  I did not expect this from my cousin  You must not  I think  be one of my judges   To this place  I have shewn my three judges  The following is their determination  drawn up by the dear Lady president  my grandmamma   Sir Charles Grandison  against Harriet Byron  Et é Contra    WE  the underwritten  do find  upon the case laid before us by the said Harriet  That  in the whole conversation between the said Sir Charles and her  she has behaved herself with that true virgin delicacy  yet with that laudable unreservedness  that might be expected from her character  and his merits  We think  the gentleman has the advantage of the Lady in the arguments for the early day contended for  and  if she had defended herself by little artifices and disguises  we should have had no scruple to decide against her  But as she has shewn  throughout the conversation  noble instances of generosity  trust reposed  and even acknowleged affection  we recommend to them both a compromise   We allow  therefore  Sir Charles Grandison to pursue his intentions of going up to town  declaredly to prepare for the happy day  and recommend it to Harriet  in consideration of the merits of the requester  who lays his whole heart open before her  in a manner too generous not to meet with a like return  to fix as early a day as in prudence she can   For the rest  May the Almighty shower down his blessings on both  May all their contentions  like this  be those of Love  and true Delicacy  May they live together many  very many  happy years  an example of conjugal felicity  And may their   192 exemplary virtues meet with an everlasting reward —So prays  so subscribes      • HENRIETTA SHIRLEY    • MARIANNE SELBY    • LUCY SELBY     To morrow morning  when Sir Charles comes to breakfast  this paper will be presented to him by my grandmamma   I wonder whether Sir Charles writes to Dr  Bartlett an account of what passes here  If he does  what would I give to see his Letters  and particularly  what he thinks of the little delays he meets with▪ But do  dear Lady G  acquit me of affectation and parade  Indeed it is not that  I hope he himself acquits me  and censures himself  for  upon my word  he is unreasonably hasty   I could not but express a little curiosity about his hint of Lady Olivia s favourable opinion of me  tho  not at the time  and he was so good as to shew me  and my grandmamma and aunt  a most extraordinary character which she gave me in a long Letter  I saw it was a long Letter  I was very Eve ish  my dear   Lucy said afterwards  that I did so leer at it  An ugly word  importing sliness  and  after I was angry at myself for giving her the idea that put her upon applying it  I chid her for using it   Lady Olivia writes such high things  my dear  I blushed—I did not  could not  deserve them  I always pitied her  you know  but now you cannot imagine how much more than ever I pitied her  Do all of us  indeed  as the men say  love flattery —I did not think I did—I shall find out all the obliquities of my heart  in time  I was supposed once to be so good a creature—as if none other were half so good —Ah  my partial friends  you studied your Harriet in the dark  but here comes the sun darting into all the   193 crooked and obscure corners of my heart  and I shrink from his dazling eye  and  compared to Him  and Clementina  let me add  appear to myself such a Nothing—  Nay  I have had the mortification  once or twice  to think myself less than the very Olivia  upon whom  but lately  secure of my mind s superiority to her mind  I looked down with a kind of proud compassion  And whence this exaltation of Olivia  and self humiliation —Why  from her magnifying beyond measure
