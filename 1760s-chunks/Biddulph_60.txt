he had had with a person of some condition  and that it had disgusted her so much  she could not think of uniting me with a man whose passions were not a little more staid  and that this was the sole reason of her dislike to a gentleman  who was in every other respect unexceptionable  I am glad it was no worse  said lady V——  smiling  I am sure Mr Faulkland is not capable    of a base action  youthful follies he may have had  though I believe as few even of those to answer for as most men of his years  I make not the least doubt  however  that lady Bidulph was guided by prudence in what she did  She certainly could not be too cautious in the disposal of such a child as you  and whatever Mr Faulkland’s disappointment may be  you I hope are happy  Lady V—— looked at me as she pronounced these words  with an inquisitive  though tender regard  I was glad of an opportunity of enlarging on the merits of Mr Arnold  and told her  I was as happy as my heart could wish  or the worthiest of men could make me  I am glad of it  said she  with a quickness in her voice  but don’t imagine  my dear Mrs Arnold   and she took me by the hand  that I introduced this conversation merely to gratify a curiosity  which I fear you must condemn in your private thoughts  though you have been so good as to satisfy it  I had another reason  a much stronger one  What is it dear madam  almost starting with apprehensions of I did not know what  Don’t be alarmed  said she smiling  it is only this  a great aunt of Mr Faulkland’s is lately dead  who has left him a considerable personal estate  and he is coming over to take possession of it  otherwise I don’t know when we should have seen him in England  My lord had a letter very lately from him  he was then at Turin  where he had met with our eldest son  who is now on his travels  he told us he had letters and some tokens of love to deliver us from him  and that he should immediately on his arrival in England come to V—— hall  where he would pass a month with us  Now as we expect him daily  I had a mind to apprize you of his intended visit  that you might not be surprized  by perhaps unexpectedly meeting him at my house  I thanked her ladyship for her obliging caution  though I thought it had something in it that mortified me  I told her  that though I should not seek to renew my acquaintance with Mr Faulkland  yet had I no reason to avoid him  Lady V——  who is extremely quick of apprehension  replied  Without doubt  madam  you have not  but you might be surprized at seeing him notwithstanding   She presently turned the discourse  but made me happy the whole day  by that inexhaustible fund of good sense and improving knowlege  of which she is mistress   Mr Arnold came not home ’till very late  he complains that he is got into a knot of acquaintance that like the bottle too well  but I am sure his natural sobriety is such  that it will not be in the power of example to lead him into intemperance  though I am vexed he has    fallen into such acquaintance  because I know drinking is disagreeable to him  yet a country gentleman must sometimes give a little into it  to avoid the character of being singular   August 22  Surprized I was not  because I came prepared  but I own I was abashed  at seeing Mr Faulkland to day  Mr Arnold and I were invited to dine at Lord V——’s  and his lordship  and his guest  came in from the fields where they had been walking  just as we were ready to sit down to table   There happened to be a good deal more company  Mr Faulkland was not introduced  so that there was no room for any thing constrained or improper of either side  I presently recovered the little embarrassment  that his first entrance into the room occasioned  I am sure nobody took notice of it  for dinner being immediately served  there was a sort of bustle in hurrying out of the drawing room  The crowd we had at table destroyed all conversation  and nothing particular was said during dinner  Lady V—— soon withdrew  and all her female friends followed her  I observed she frequently glanced her penetrating eyes at Mr Faulkland while we were at table  but I did not chuse to make any observations on him  We had not been long seated at our Coffee  when four of the gentlemen slipped from their company and came to us  these were Mr Arnold  Mr Faulkland  and two others  My lord is pretty free at his bottle  and none of these gentlemen I suppose were fond of that entertainment  Lady V—— and I were sitting on a couch  I called to Mr Arnold  and placed him between us  Mr Faulkland approached me  and then  for the first time  with a respectful distance  enquired after my mother
