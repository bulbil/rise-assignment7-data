accomplices  hanged in chains  This was the first instance of the people s struggling for privileges  as a body distinct from the barons and clergy  Longbeard may be considered as the first victim to that untameable spirit  which ever since has actuated this people in support of their privileges  and prompted them to the rights of humanity   Upon a review of the rest of this reign  we find the Monarch almost always in the field  or intent upon schemes to supply his warlike expeditions  disappointed of the fruits of conquest  or groaning in captivity  If  indeed  it were just to ascribe his misfortunes to his incensed father s malediction  we might be apt to suspect it  in some measure  as the cause  However  after a reign of ten years  thus passed in turbulence and fruitless victory  he died of a wound received from an arrow at the siege of Chaluz  While he was yet alive  the soldier  by whose hand he died  was brought before him  the King sternly demanded the reason why he sought his life    My father and my brothers  replied the undaunted soldier  died by your hand  and Heaven has given me the opportunity of a just and glorious revenge    The dying Monarch  no way exasperated by this reply  observed  that the centinel had done his duty  ordered him a present  and forgave him  But the Flemish General was unacquainted with such generosity  instead of complying with the King s command  he seized the miserable wretch    91 and  aster Richard s death  commanded him  in his presence  to be flead alive     All the actions of this Prince were generous and brave  I know not what pleasure  Rapin  that so frequently injudicious historian  can take in lessening the virtues of the race of Norman Monarchs  Among other faults ascribed to Richard  he accuses him of pride  yet it appears he bore the admonitions of his inferiors with gentleness and good humour  The easiness of his disposition  as well as the delicacy of his wit  are apparent from the quickness of his replies  It is said  that being one day admonished  by an obscure Monk  to part with his three daughters  by which he meant his pride  his lust  and his avarice  he wittily made answer  that he desired nothing more  and had already pitched upon proper husbands for their disposal  heresolved to give his pride to the Templars  his avarice to the Monks  and  as for his lust  the Clergy should share that among them  Such insolent advice  from a churchman  at this day  would be attended with a very different reply  I am   Dear Charles   c   LETTER XIV   THE wars that were now kindled up between England and France  continued to depopulate both countries  without making  in the end  any material alteration  John  the brother and successor of Richard  pursued them with unabating vigour  We may regard these  and such like commotions  among Christian Princes  as pestilences  which lay whole provinces waste  without making   92 any change in their limits  their manners or government   John  who was sirnamed Lackland  was  in fact  possessed of the most extensive dominion of any Prince in Europe  Besides the lands left him by succession  he had wrested Bretagne from Arthur  his nephew  whose right it was  However  John  by thus pretending to what was not justly his  in the end lost even what he had   Having made himself master of Bretagne  the unfortunate Arthur also fell into his power  He caused him to be confined in a tower  and what became of him was never after explained to the public satisfaction  John was suspected  and not without reason  of the death of his nephew  He made some efforts to wipe off the odious stain  yet without effect  happily  for the instruction of future Princes  this crime only opened a way to his future ruin  and  having begun his reign by being the enemy of mankind in prosperity  the whole world  in the end  seemed to turn their back upon him in his distress  The power of the nobility of France was now exerted  with justice  against him  those assemblies of noblemen  each of which was  at that time  the petty lawless tyrant of his dependants  in this instance  at least  undertook to punish the guilty  Constance  the unfortunate mother of the murdered Prince  flew for protection to the peers  and implored redress  The King of England was summoned to appear  he refused  and the peers of France confiscated all the lands and possessions which were held under that crown  This confiscation was soon attended with vigorous efforts to put it into execution  John  at once both weak and cowardly  a tyrant when unopposed  but timorous in danger  suffered himself tamely to   93 be stripped of them all  He successively lost Normandy  Touraine  and Poictou  and then fled back to England  to make himself hated and despised   Hitherto  however  he was only contemptible to his neighbour Princes  he still
