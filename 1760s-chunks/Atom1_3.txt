transmigrations since my conveyance from Japan  I shall return thither  and unfold some curious particulars of state intrigue  carried on during the short period  the history of which I mean to record  I need not tell thee  that the empire of Japan consists of three large islands  or that the people  who inhabit them  are such inconsistent  capricious animals  that one would imagine they were created for the purpose of ridicule  Their minds are in continual agitation  like a shuttlecock    10 tossed to and fro  in order to divert the demons of philosophy and folly  A Japonese  without the intervention of any visible motive  is  by turns  merry and pensive  superficial and profound  generous and illiberal  rash and circumspect  courageous and fearful  benevolent and cruel  They seem to have no fixed principle of action  no certain plan of conduct  no effectual rudder to steer them through the voyage of life  but to be hurried down the rapid tide of each revolving whim  or driven  the sport of every gust of passion that happens to blow  A Japonese will sing at a funeral  and sigh at a wedding  he will this hour talk ribaldry with a prostitute  and the next immerse himself in the study of metaphysics or theology  In favour of one stranger  he will exert all the virtues of hospitality  against another he will exercise all the animosity of the most sordid prejudice  one minute sees him    11 hazarding his all on the success of the most extravagant project  another beholds him hesitating in lending a few copans  to his friend on undeniable security  To day  he is afraid of paring his corns  to morrow  he scruples not to cut his own throat  At one season  he will give half his fortune to the poor  at another  he will not bestow the smallest pittance to save his brother from indigence and distress  He is elated to insolence by the least gleam of success  he is dejected to despondence by the slightest turn of adverse fortune  One hour he doubts the best established truths  the next  he swallows the mostimprobable fiction  His praise and his censure is what a wise man would choose to avoid  as evils equally pernicious  the first is generally raised without foundation  and carried to such extravagance  as to expose the    12 object to the ridicule of mankind  the last is often unprovoked  yet usually inflamed to all the rage of the most malignant persecution  He will extol above Alexander the great  a petty officer who robs a hen roost  and damn to infamy  a general for not performing impossibilities  The same man whom he yesterday flattered with the most fulsome adulation  he will to morrow revile with the most bitter abuse  and  at the turning of a straw  take into his bosom the very person whom he has formerly defamed as the most perfidious rascal   The Japanese value themselves much upon their constitution  and are very clamorous about the words liberty and property  yet  in fact  the only liberty they enjoy is to get drunk whenever they please  to revile the government  and quarrel with one another  With respect to their property  they are the tamest animals in the world  and  if properly managed     13 undergo  without wincing  such impositions  as no other nation in the world would bear  In this particular  they may be compared to an ass  that will crouch under the most unconscionable burthen  provided you scratch his long ears  and allow him to bray his belly full  They are so practicable  that they have suffered their pockets to be drained  their veins to be emptied  and their credit to be cracked  by the most bungling administrations  to gratify the avarice  pride  and ambition  of the most sordid and contemptible sovereigns  that ever sate upon the throne   The methods used for accomplishing these purposes are extremely simple  You have seen a dancing bear incensed to a dangerous degree of rage  and all at once appeased by firing a pistol over his nose  The Japonese  even in their most ferocious moods  when they denounce vengeance against the Cuboy  or minister  and even    14 threaten the throne itself  are easily softened into meekness and condescension  A set of tall fellows  hired for the purpose  tickle them under the noses with long straws  into a gentle convulsion  during which they shut their eyes  and smile  and quietly suffer their pockets to be turned inside out  Nay  what is still more remarkable  the ministry is in possession of a pipe  or rather bullocks s horn  which being sounded to a particular pitch  has such an effect on the ears and understanding of the people  that they allow their pockets to be picked with their eyes open  and are bribed to betray their own interest with their own money  as easily as if the treasure had come from the remotest corner of the globe  Notwithstanding these capricious peculiarities  the Japonese are become a wealthy and powerful people  partly from their insular situation  and partly from a spirit of commercial adventure  sustained by    15 all the obstinacy of perseverance  and conducted by repeated flashes
