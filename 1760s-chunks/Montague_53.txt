give you a winter description  and which I only slightly mentioned when I gave you an account of the rivers by which it is supplied       The road  about a mile before you reach this bay  is a regular glassy level  without any of those intervening hills of ice which I have mentioned  hills  which with the ideas  though false ones  of danger and difficulty  give those of beauty and magnificence too       As you gradually approach the bay  you are struck with an awe  which increases every moment  as you come nearer  from the grandeur of a scene  which is one of the noblest works of nature  the beauty  the proportion  the solemnity  the wild magnificence of which  surpassing every possible effect of art  impress one strongly with the idea of its Divine Almighty Architect       The rock on the east side  which is first in view as you approach  is a smooth and almost perpendicular precipice  of the same height as the fall  the top  which a little over hangs  is beautifully covered with pines  firs  and ever greens of various kinds  whose verdant lustre is rendered at this season more shining and lovely by the surrounding snow  as well as by that which is sprinkled irregularly on their branches  and glitters half melted in the sun beams  a thousand smaller shrubs are scattered on the side of the ascent  and  having their roots in almost imperceptible clefts of the rock  seem to those below to grow in air       The west side is equally lofty  but more sloping  which  from that circumstance  affords soil all the way  upon shelving inequalities of the rock  at little distances  for the growth of trees and shrubs  by which it is almost entirely hid       The most pleasing view of this miracle of nature is certainly in summer  and in the early part of it  when every tree is in foliage and full verdure  every shrub in flower  and when the river  swelled with a waste of waters from the mountains from which it derives its source  pours down in a tumultuous torrent  that equally charms and astonishes the beholder       The winter scene has  notwithstanding  its beauties  though of a different kind  more resembling the stillness and inactivity of the season       The river being on its sides bound up in frost  and its channel rendered narrower than in the summer  affords a less body of water to supply the cascade  and the fall  though very steep  yet not being exactly perpendicular  masses of ice are formed  on different shelving projections of the rock  in a great variety of forms and proportions       The torrent  which before rushed with such impetuosity down the deep descent in one vast sheet of water  now descends in some parts with a slow and majestic pace  in others seems almost suspended in mid air  and in others  bursting through the obstacles which interrupt its course  pours down with redoubled fury into the foaming bason below  from whence a spray arises  which  freezing in its ascent  becomes on each side a wide and irregular frozen breast work  and in front  the spray being there much greater  a lofty and magnificent pyramid of solid ice       I have not told you half the grandeur  half the beauty  half the lovely wildness of this scene  if you would know what it is  you must take no information but that of your own eyes  which I pronounce strangers to the loveliest work of creation till they have seen the river and fall of Montmorenci       In short  my dear  I am Montmorenci mad       I can hardly descend to tell you  we passed the ice from thence to Orleans  and dined out of doors on six feet of snow  in the charming enlivening warmth of the sun  though in the month of February  at a time when you in England scarce feel his beams       Fitzgerald made violent love to me all the way  and I never felt myself listen with such complacency       Adieu  I have wrote two immense letters  Write oftener  you are lazy  yet expect me to be an absolute slave in the scribbling way   Your faithful  A  FERMOR       Do you know your brother has admirable ideas  He contrived to lose his way on our return  and kept Emily ten minutes behind the rest of the company  I am apt to fancy there was something like a declaration  for she blushed    Celestial rosy red    when he led her into the dining room at Silleri     Once more  adieu     LETTER LXXXII   82   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   March 1   I WAS mistaken  my dear  not a word of love between your brother and Emily  as she positively assures me  something very tender has passed  I am convinced  notwithstanding  for she blushes more than ever when he approaches  and there is a certain softness in his voice when he addresses her  which cannot escape a person of my penetration       Do you know
