 but when you are so good  like the   slender reed  to bend to the hurricane  rather than  like the sturdy   oak  to resist it  you will always stand firm in my kind opinion  while   a contrary conduct would uproot you  with all your excellencies  from my   soul       Sir  said I  I will endeavour to conform myself  in all things  to your   will  I make no doubt but you will  and I ll endeavour to make my will   as conformable to reason as I can  And let me tell you  that this belief   of you is one of the inducements I have had to marry at all  for nobody   was more averse to this state than myself  and  now we are upon this   subject  I ll tell you why I was so averse       We people of fortune  or such as are born to large expectations  of both   sexes  are generally educated wrong  You have occasionally touched upon   this  Pamela  several times in your journal  so justly  that I need say   the less to you  We are usually so headstrong  so violent in our wills    that we very little bear control       Humoured by our nurses  through the faults of our parents  we practise   first upon them  and shew the gratitude of our dispositions  in   an insolence that ought rather to be checked and restrained  than   encouraged       Next  we are to be indulged in every thing at school  and our masters   and mistresses are rewarded with further grateful instances of our   boisterous behaviour       But  in our wise parents  eyes  all looks well  all is forgiven and   excused  and for no other reason  but because we are theirs       Our next progression is  we exercise our spirits  when brought home    to the torment and regret of our parents themselves  and torture their   hearts by our undutiful and perverse behaviour to them  which  however   ungrateful in us  is but the natural consequence of their culpable   indulgence to us  from infancy upwards       And then  next  after we have  perhaps  half broken their hearts  a   wife is looked out for  convenience  or birth  or fortune  are the first   motives  affection the last  if it is at all consulted   and two people   thus educated  thus trained up  in a course of unnatural ingratitude    and who have been headstrong torments to every one who has had a share   in their education  as well as to those to whom they owe their being    are brought together  and what can be expected  but that they should   pursue  and carry on  the same comfortable conduct in matrimony  and   join most heartily to plague one another  And  in some measure  indeed    this is right  because hereby they revenge the cause of all those who   have been aggrieved and insulted by them  upon one another       The gentleman has never been controlled  the lady has never been   contradicted       He cannot bear it from one whose new relation  he thinks  should oblige   her to shew a quite contrary conduct       She thinks it very barbarous  now  for the first time  to be opposed   in her will  and that by a man from whom she expected nothing but   tenderness       So great is the difference between what they both expect from one   another  and what they both find in each other  that no wonder   misunderstandings happen  that these ripen to quarrels  that acts of   unkindness pass  which  even had the first motive to their union been   affection  as usually it is not  would have effaced all manner of tender   impressions on both sides       Appeals to parents or guardians often ensue  If  by mediation of   friends  a reconciliation takes place  it hardly ever holds  for why    The fault is in the minds of both  and neither of them will think so    so that the wound  not permitted to be probed  is but skinned over  and   rankles still at the bottom  and at last breaks out with more pain and   anguish than before  Separate beds are often the consequence  perhaps   elopements  if not  an unconquerable indifference  possibly aversion    And whenever  for appearance sake  they are obliged to be together    every one sees  that the yawning husband  and the vapourish wife  are   truly insupportable to one another  but separate  have freer spirits
