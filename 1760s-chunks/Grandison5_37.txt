me the power of opposing it  Permit me to be silent   Father Marescotti and I  said the Bishop  are in one situation  as to scruples of conscience  But I will forget the Prelate for the Brother  Dear Grandison  will you permit us to say to enquirers  that we look upon you as one of our church  and that prudential reasons  with regard to your country  and friends in it  deter you at present from declaring yourself   Let not terms be proposed  my good Lord  that would lessen your opinion of me  should I comply with them  If I am to be honoured with an admission into this noble family  let me not in my own eyes appear unworthy of the honour  Were I to find myself capable of prevaricating in an article so important as religion  no one could hate me so much as I should hate myself  were even an imperial diadem with your Clementina  the noblest of women  to be the consideration   You have the example of great princes  Chevalier  said Father Marescotti  Henry the Fourth of France  Augustus of Poland—  True  Father—But great Princes are not always  and in every action of their lives  great men  They might make the less scruple of changing their religion as they were neither of them strict in the practice of it  They who can allow themselves in some deviations  may in others  I boast not of my own virtue  but it has been my aim to be uniform  I am too well satisfied with my own religion  to doubt  If I were not  it would be impossible but I must be influenced by the wishes of friends so dear to me  whose motives are the result of their own piety  and of the regard they have for my everlasting welfare   Page  93 The Chevalier and I  rejoined the Bishop  have carried this argument to its full extent before  My honoured Lord s question recurs  What security can we have  that my sister shall not be perverted  The Chevalier refers to Father Marescotti to propose it  The Father excuses himself  I  as the brother of Clementina  ask you  Chevalier  Will you promise never by yourself  or your English divines  to attempt to pervert her —A confessor you have allowed her  Shall Father Marescotti be the man   And will Father Marescotti—  I will  for the sake of preserving to Lady Clementina her faith  that faith by which only she can be saved  and  perhaps  in hope of converting the man who then will be dear to the whole family   I not only comply with the proposal  but shall think Father Marescotti will do me a favour  in putting it into my power to shew him the regard I have for him  One request I have only to make  That Father Marescotti will prescribe his own conditions to me  And I assure you all  that they shall be exceeded  as to the consideration  be they ever so high   You and I  Chevalier  replied the Father  shall have no difficulty  as to the terms   None you can have  said the Marquis  as to those  Father Marescotti will be still our spiritual director   Only one condition I will beg leave to make with Father Marescotti  that he will confine his pious cares to those only who are already of his own persuasion  and that no disputable points may ever be touched upon to servants  tenants  or neighbours  in a country where a different religion  from that to which he is a credit  is established  I might  perhaps  have safely left this to his own moderation and honour  yet  without such a previous engagement  his conscience might have been embarrassed  and had I not insisted on it  I should have behaved towards my country in a manner for which I could not answer to my own heart   Page  94 Your countrymen  Chevalier  said the Count  complain loudly of persecution from our church  Yet what disqualifications do Catholics lie under in England   A great deal  my Lord  may be said on this subject  I think it sufficient to answer for myself  and my own conduct   As to our child s servants  said the Marchioness  methinks I should hope  that Father Marescotti might have a small congregation about him  to keep their Lady in countenance  in a country where her religion will subject her to inconveniencies  perhaps to more than inconveniencies   Her woman  and those servants  replied I  who will immediately attend her person  shall always be chosen by herself  If they behave well  I will consider them as my servants for their benefit  If they misbehave  I must be allowed to consider them also as my servants  as well as their Lady s  I must not be subject to the dominion of servants  the most intolerable of all dominion  Were they to know that they are independent of me  I should be disobeyed  perhaps insulted  and my resentment of their insolence would be thought a persecution on account of their religion   This article bore some canvassing  If Camilla  at last  I said  were the
