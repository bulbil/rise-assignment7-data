after the usual compliments  I stood by while he continued to paint on  As every thing done by the rich is praised  as princes here  as well as in China  are never without followers  three or four persons  who had the   205 appearance of gentlemen  were placed behind to comfort and applaud him at every stroke   Need I tell  that it struck me with very disagreeable sensations to see a youth who  by his station in life  had it in his power to be useful to thousands  thus letting his mind run to waste upon canvas  at the same time fancying himself improving in taste  and filling his rank with proper decorum   As seeing an error  and attempting to redress it  are only one and the same with me  I took occasion  upon his lordship s desiring my opinion of a Chinese scroll  intended for the frame of a picture  to assure him  that a mandarine of China thought a minute acquaintance with such mechanical trifles below his dignity   This reply raised the indignation of some  and the contempt of others  I could hear the names of Vandal  Goth  taste  polite arts  delicacy  and fire  repeated in tones of ridicule or resentment  But considering that it was vain to argue against people who had so much to say  without contradicting them  I begged leave to repeat a fairy tale  This request redoubled their laughter  but not easily abashed at the rallery of boys  I persisted  observing that it would set the absurdity of placing our affections upon trifles  in the strongest point of view  and adding that it was hoped the moral would compensate for its stupidity  For heaven s sake  cried the great man  washing his brush in water  let us have no morality at present  if we must have a story  let it be without any moral  I pretended not to hear  and while he handled the brush  proceeded as follows     206IN the kingdom of Bonbobbin  which  by the Chinese annal  appears to have flourished twenty thousand years ago  there reigned a prince  endowed with every accomplishment which generally distinguishes the sons of kings  His beauty was brighter than the sun  The sun  to which he was nearly related  would sometimes stop his course in order to look down and admire him   His mind was not less perfect than his body  he knew all things without having ever read  philosophers  poets  and historians  submitted their works to his decision  and so penetrating was he  that he could tell the merit of a book by looking on the cover  He made epic poems  tragedies  and pastorals  with surprising facility  song  epigram  or rebus  was all one to him  tho  it is observed he could never finish an acrostic  In short  the fairy  who presided at his birth  had endowed him with almost every perfection  or what was just the same  his subjects were ready to acknowledge he possessed them all  and  for his own part  he knew nothing to the contrary  A prince so accomplished  received a name suitable to his merit  and he was called Bonbenin bonbobbin bonbobbinet  which signifies Enlightener of the Sun   As he was very powerful  and yet unmarried  all the neighbouring kings earnestly sought his alliance  Each sent his daughter  dressed out in the most magnificent manner  and with the most sumptuous retinue imaginable  in order to allure the prince  so that at one time there were seen   207 at his court not less than seven hundred foreign princesses of exquisite sentiment and beauty  each alone sufficient to make seven hundred ordinary men happy   Distracted in such a variety  the generous Bonbennin  had he not been obliged by the laws of the empire to make choice of one  would very willingly have married them all  for none understood gallantry better  He spent numberless hours of solicitude in endeavouring to determine whom he should chuse  one lady was possessed of every perfection  but he disliked her eyebrows  another was brighter than the morning star  but he disapproved her fong whang  a third did not lay white enough on her cheek  and a fourth did not sufficiently blacken her nails  At last after numberless disappointments on the one side and the other  he made choice of the incomparable Nanhoa  queen of the scarlet dragons   The preparations for the royal nuptials  or the envy of the disappointed ladies  needs no description  both the one and the other were as great as they could be  the beautiful princess was conducted amidst admiring multitudes to the royal couch  where after being divested of every encumbering ornament  she was placed  in expectance of the youthful bridegroom  who did not keep her long in expectation  He came more chearful than the morning  and printing on her lips a burning kiss  the attendants took this as a proper signal to withdraw   Perhaps I ought to have mentioned in the beginning that  among several other qualifications    208 the prince was fond of collecting and breeding mice  which being an harmless pastime  none of his counsellors thought proper to dissuade him from  he therefore kept a great variety
