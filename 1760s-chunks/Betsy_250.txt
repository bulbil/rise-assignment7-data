 humble servant            E  THOUGHTLESS        Though no one could have more refined notions of virtue  nor a greater   abhorrence for vice  than this young lady  yet never did she hate the   persons of the guilty  nor would judge with that severity of their   faults which some others  much less innocent  are apt to do       It pleased her to think that  by this donation  she should gladden the   heart of an afflicted person  who had been of her acquaintance  how   unworthy soever of late she had rendered herself  and this little   interruption of her meditations contributed a good deal to compose her   mind  after the sudden shock it had sustained on the score of Mr    Trueworth s marriage       But she had very shortly another and more agreeable relief  Sir Ralph   and Lady Trusty came to town  which she no sooner was informed of  and   where a house had been taken for their reception  than she went early   the next morning to pay her respects  and testify the real satisfaction   she conceived at their arrival       Nothing of business would probably have been said to her on this first   visit  if her two brothers had not come in immediately after  The first   compliments on such an occasion being over   Sir Ralph   said the elder   Mr  Thoughtless   we have wished for your coming to town on many   accounts  but none so much as that of my sister  who is going to be   married  and has only waited to intreat you will do her the favour of   disposing of her hand        The good baronet replied  that there was nothing he should do with   greater pleasure  provided it were to a person worthy of her   That    Sir   said the elder Mr  Thoughtless   we have taken care to be   convinced of  and I doubt not but you will think as we do  when you   shall be informed of the particulars   Miss Betsy blushed  but uttered   not a word  either to oppose or to agree to what had been said       Lady Trusty perceiving her in some confusion  led her into another room    in order to talk seriously to her on many things she had in her head                CHAPTER II       Is very full of business          The two brothers of Miss Betsy having some reason to apprehend she would   still find some pretence  if possible  to evade fulfilling the promise   she had made them in regard to Mr  Munden  and also that he  finding   himself trifled with  might become weary of prosecuting so unavailing a   suit  and break off as Mr  Trueworth had done  resolved to omit nothing   in their power for bringing to a conclusion an affair which seemed to   them so absolutely necessary for securing the honour of their family in   that of their sister       They suspected that their putting off the marriage till the arrival of   Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty  was only to gain time  and invent some excuse   to get that lady on her side  they  therefore  judged it highly proper   to acquaint her previously with the motives which made them so impatient   to see their sister disposed of  and by that means prevent her ladyship   from being prepossessed by any ideas the other might prepare for that   purpose       Accordingly  Mr  Francis Thoughtless having been informed by letter of   the day in which they intended to be in town  he went on horseback  and   met them at the inn where they dined  about twenty miles from London       That good lady was so much troubled at the recital he made her of Miss   Betsy s late adventures  that she could not forbear letting fall some   tears  and  though she laid the blame of her ill conduct chiefly on her   having lived so long under the tuition and example of a woman such as   Lady Mellasin  yet she could not but allow there was a certain vanity in   her composition  as dangerous to virtue as to reputation  and that   marriage was the only defence for both       Sir Ralph  who was an extreme facetious  good natured man  was a little   pleasant on what his lady had said on this occasion   You forget  my   dear   cried he   how many ladies of late have broke the conjugal hoop    and think themselves justified in doing so  by having been prevailed   upon to enter
