did not think his own  in case of a search  a place of security   He said he had seen him in bed  and hoped a little sleep would compose his mind  which seemed very much disturbed  I requested my brother to give me the particulars of that terrible affair  which Mr Faulkland had mentioned  Sir George related to me what follows  though Mr Faulkland  he said  told the story but incoherently   Mr Faulkland said he had no reason to be displeased with his wife’s conduct for more than a year after their marriage  her affection for him seemed lively and sincere  and he had made her the most grateful returns  it being the study of his life to render her happy  Her love abated not of its ardor  and he had all the reason in the world to imagine himself intirely possessed of her heart   Whilst Mr Faulkland’s house in the country was building  he had been invited by a neighbouring gentleman  who lived at the distance of about three miles from his own place  to stay at his house  which obliging offer Mr Faulkland had readily accepted  as by that means he had daily opportunities of seeing  and expediting his own improvements   Mr Bond  that was the gentleman’s name  had a wife and two or three daughters  all very agreeable women  with whom Mrs Faulkland had  by living so much in their family  contracted a great intimacy  but particularly with the eldest  a sprightly fine young    woman  of about twenty years old  They had been three or four months at Mr Bonds  their house  which was nothing more than a little lodge  was finished  and they only waited till it was thoroughly dry to remove into it  as Mr Faulkland had laid out extensive gardens  in the finishing of which he proposed to amuse himself some time  for he acknowleged to my brother  he was in no haste to return to England   During their residence with this gentleman  they had made two or three excursions to town  On their return from one of these  after an absence of about a fortnight  they found a visitor at Mr Bond’s  his name was Smyth  he was an officer  a genteel handsome man  and they were given to understand he made his addresses to the eldest daughter  of whom he had been an admirer a long time  but durst not make his pretensions known to her father  till having lately been promoted in the army to the rank of a major  the young lady’s parents admitted his visits to their daughter  She had long before that acknowleged to Mrs Faulkland in confidence  her attachment to him  Mr Faulkland  who had learned this secret from his wife  was very glad to find that Miss Bond  for whom he had great esteem  was likely to have her wishes accomplished  as he saw that Major Smyth was treated with distinction by her parents  who complimented him with a bed at their house  for he generally staid two or three nights with them  every time he paid them a visit  as his regiment was then quartered at a town about fifteen miles distant from their house   The Major  without being a man of very shining parts  had such talents as made him acceptable to the women  He sung prettily  was lively to extravagance  full of agreeable trifling  and always in good humour  Miss Bond loved him  and as he was considered in the light of a person who would shortly be one of the family  Mr Faulkland soon contracted a friendship with him  which the Major on his part  seemed very solicitous to improve   The marriage was now agreed on  and was only deferred till the young lady’s brother should be at age  as he was to join with his father in making a settlement on his sister  This desirable event was at the distance of four months  but as the lover was in the mean time permitted to enjoy so much of his mistress’s conversation  he seemed to submit to the delay with patience   Things were in this situation  when Mr Faulkland  thinking it time to remove to his own house  proposed it to his lady  but she objected to it  declaring she did not think it safe  as the house had been so    lately built  Though indeed it was now perfectly well seasoned  for the shell had been intirely finished some time before Mr Faulkland had gone to Mr Bond’s house  and it was only the inside work  and a kitchen that was built apart from the lodge  that wanted to be completed  Mr Faulkland was unwilling to oppose his lady in any thing  but he was the more solicitous that she should comply with his request in this particular  as he thought he had observed that the eldest Miss Bond  had  of late  behaved with more coldness towards her than usual  Though he was far from guessing the cause of this  he thought it  however  a sufficient reason for their removal  He was afraid they had already staid too long  and that  perhaps  notwithstanding the good nature and hospitality of the family they all now secretly wished their absence  This  though he intended to make
