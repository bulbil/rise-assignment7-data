 said Miss Betsy   I am glad    however  you were so well pleased with your entertainment  and equally   so  that you were not hindered from enjoying it by my not being able to   share with you in it         I am obliged to you  my dear   replied Miss Airish   I was a little   vexed with you at first  indeed  but knew you could not help it  the   lady we called upon went very readily with us  so  as it happened  there   was no disappointment in the case         It was only to be convinced of that   said Miss Betsy   that I came   hither thus early  but I will now take my leave  repose I am sure is   necessary for you  after so many waking hours   The other did not oppose   her departure  being  in effect  desirous of taking that rest which her   exhausted spirits wanted       Never had Miss Betsy felt within herself a greater or more sincere   satisfaction than she now did  for having so prudently avoided falling   into inconveniences  the least of which  as she very rightly judged    would have been paying too dear a price for all the pleasures she could   have received       Sweet indeed are the reflections which flow from a consciousness of   having done what virtue  and the duty owing to the character we bear in   life  exact from us  but poor Miss Betsy was not to enjoy  for any long   time  so happy a tranquillity  she was rouzed out of this serenity of   mind by an adventure of a different kind from all she had ever yet   experienced  and which  if she were not properly guarded against  it   ought to be imputed rather to the unsuspecting goodness of her heart    than to her vanity  or that inadvertency which had occasioned her former   mistakes       She was sitting near the window  leaning her arms upon the slab  very   deep in contemplation  when  hearing a coach stop at the door  she   looked out  imagining it might be somebody to her  and saw Mrs  Modely   come out  she wondered what business that woman should now come upon    after the letter she had sent her  and resolved to chide her for any   impertinent message she should deliver       Mrs  Modely  whose profession was known to the people of the house    always ran up without any other ceremony than asking if Miss Betsy was   at home and alone  being now told she was so  she flew into the room    with a distraction in her countenance which very much surprized Miss   Betsy  but before she had time to ask the meaning  the other  throwing   herself down in a chair  increased her astonishment by these words        O  Madam   cried she   I am come to tell you of the saddest   accident  poor Sir Frederick Fineer   O that he had never seen you   O   that I had never meddled between you   I am undone  that is to be   sure  ruined for ever   I shall never get another lodger  nay  I believe   I shall never recover the fright I am in        Here she burst into a violent fit of tears  and her sobs interrupting   the passage of her words  gave Miss Betsy opportunity to enquire into   the mystery of her behaviour   For Heaven s sake  what is the matter     said that young lady   pr ythee  cease these exclamations  and speak to   be understood         Ah  dear Miss Betsy   resumed the other   I scarce know what I say or   do  poor Sir Frederick has run himself quite through the body     What    killed himself   cried Miss Betsy hastily   He is not dead yet   replied   Mrs  Modely   but there he lies  the most dismal object that ever eyes   beheld  the agonies of death in his face  the sword sticking in his   breast  for the surgeon says  that the moment that is drawn out  his   life comes with it        Perceiving Miss Betsy said nothing  and looked a little troubled  she   went on in this manner   But this is not the worst I have to tell you    Madam   continued she   his death is nothing  but it is his soul  his   soul  Miss Betsy  hearing them say he could not live above three hours   at most  I sent for a parson  and
