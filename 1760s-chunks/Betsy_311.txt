at parting  that it would be proper for   her to stay at Bologne till she received a letter from him with an   account in what street and part of the town the lodgings he should   provide for her were situated  to the end she might come directly into   them on her arrival  he spoke this with an air so full of tenderness and   care for her repose  that she had not the least suspicion of his drift    and replied  that she would not fail to do as he advised  but desired he   would be as speedy as possible in writing to her   For   cried she    embracing him   I shall think every day a year till I return to the arms   of my dear Munden        Having thus  in reality  discarded  his mistress  though without her   knowing he had done so  he went home  in order to boast to his wife of   the complaisance he had shewn to her in this affair  but  finding she   was not yet come back  he called for her maid  and bid her tell her  the   moment she should return  that he had complied with her request  and   made the Frenchwoman go out of the house       After having said this  he went out again  and came not home till late   at night  when he was confounded beyond measure on finding a letter from   Mrs  Munden  which had been left for him by her own footman in the   beginning of the evening  and contained these lines             To Mr  Munden            Sir            As you cannot but be sensible that the mutual engagements between        us have been strictly adhered to on my part  and almost in every        particular falsified on yours  you ought not to be surprized that I        have at last resolved to put a final end to a way of life so        unpleasing in the eyes of Heaven  and so disagreeable to ourselves         it never was in my power to make you truly happy  nor in your will        to make me even tolerably easy  I therefore fly for ever from your        ill usage  and once more put myself under the protection of my        friends  to whom I also shall commit the care of settling with you        the terms of our separation  which being once agreed upon  you will        not be troubled either with the complaints  or the reproaches  of        your much injured wife            B  MUNDEN            P S  I have removed nothing out of your house but what was my own        before marriage        Upon enquiring further into the matter  he was informed that Mrs  Munden   had  indeed  removed a large India chest  a bureau  cabinet   dressing table  and  in fine  every thing that belonged immediately to   herself  and also that his family was now reduced to two  her own man   and maid having followed her       All this convincing him how much she was in earnest  involved him in the   most perplexing cogitations  not that he regretted the parting with her   through any remains of affection  or that his hardened heart was touched   with a just sensibility of her merit  or with any repentance of his ill   treatment of her  but that he knew such an affair must necessarily be   attended with some noise and confusion  and in many respects give him a   good deal of embarrassment  it was therefore these last two reasons   which alone determined him to make use of all his artifice to bring   about a second reconciliation       That beautiful lady  in the mean time  had thoughts much more composed    her brother had received her in the most affectionate manner  had   approved her conduct in regard to her unfaithful husband  had assured   her of the continuance of his friendship and protection  and  before she   could request it of him  invited her  and such of her servants as she   chose should attend her  to remain in his house as long as she should   think fit  He desired her to take upon her the sole command and   management of his house and family  and assigned the best apartment for   her particular use  in fine
