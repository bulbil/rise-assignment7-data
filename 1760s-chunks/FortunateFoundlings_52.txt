 I   shall see to that  replied the fellow  Horatio stepped into a room to   take some refreshment while his servant went to the stable  but had not   been there above a minute before he heard very high words between some   people in the yard  and as he turned towards the window  saw a man in   the livery of the baron de Palfoy  and whom he presently knew to be the   coachman of that nobleman  He was hot in dispute with the innkeeper   concerning a horse which he had hired of him  and  as the other   insisted  drove so hard that he had killed him  The coachman denied the   accusation  but the innkeeper told him he had witnesses to prove the   horse died two hours after he was brought home  and declared  that if he   had not satisfaction for his beast  he would complain to the baron  and   if he did not do him justice  have recourse to law   There was a long   argument between them concerning the number of miles  the hours they   drove  and the weight of the carriage   Among other things the innkeeper   alledged  that he saw them as he passed his corner  and there were so   many trunks  boxes  and other luggage behind and before the coach    besides the company that was in it  that it required eight horses   instead of six to draw it  Why then  said the coachman  did it not kill   our horses as well as yours  if they had been equally good  they would   have held out equally   I do not pretend mine was as good  replied the   innkeeper  I cannot afford to feed my horses as my lord does  but yet he   was a stout gelding  and if he had not been drove so very hard  and   perhaps otherwise ill used into the bargain  he would have been   alive now       All this was sufficient to make Horatio imagine it was for the journey   which deprived him of his dear Charlotta  that this horse had been   hired  so tarried in the place where he was till the debate was over    which ended not to the satisfaction of the innkeeper  who swore he would   not be fooled out of his money  As soon as the coachman was gone    Horatio called him in  and asked what was the matter  and who it was   that endeavoured to impose upon him  on which the innkeeper readily told   him  that on such a day this coachman came to him and hired a horse in   order to make up a set to go to Rheines in Champaigne  my lord baron   having three or four sick in the stable at that time   Two days after    said he  my horse was brought home all in a foam  and fell down dead in   less than three hours  and yet this rascally coachman refuses to pay   me for him       Horatio humoured him in all he said  and let him go on his own way till   he had vented his whole stock of railing  and then asked him what   company were in the coach  The innkeeper replied  that there was one man   and two women  but did not know who they were  for their faces were   muffled up in their hoods  This was sufficient for him to be assured it   was no other than Charlotta  with her woman  and some friend whom the   baron had sent with them  The day mentioned  being the very same he had   been informed she was carried away  was also another confirmation  and   he had not only the happiness of knowing where his mistress was  but of   knowing it by such means as could give the baron no suspicion of his   being acquainted with it  and therefore make him think it necessary to   remove her       Having gained this intelligence  which yet he was no better for than the   hope of being able to get a sight of her thro  the grate  which he was   resolved to accomplish some way or other  he resumed his design of going   into the army of the king of Sweden  As a perfect knowledge of the many   excellent qualities of the chevalier St  George  made him regard and   love him with an affection beyond what is ordinarily to be met with from   a servant to his master  he felt an extreme repugnance to quit him  and   yet more in breaking a matter to him which  while it testified a   confidence in the goodness of him whose assistance he must implore  he   thought  at the same time  would be looked on as ingratitude in himself    and he was some time deliberating in what manner he should do it  and it   would
