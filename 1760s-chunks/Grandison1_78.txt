 I believe   You may look  and beg  and pray  Mr  Reeves  When you know me better  you ll find me a very whimsical creature  But you must stay to see Sir Charles  Would you go home to your wife with half your errand  She won t thank you for that  I can tell you  let her be as good a woman as the best  But  to comfort you  we give not into every modern fashion  We dine earlier  than most people of our condition  My brother  tho  in the main above singularity  will  nevertheless  in things he thinks right  be govern d by his own rules  which are the laws of reason and convenience  You are on horseback  and  were I you  such good news as I should have to carry  considering   191 what might have happened  would give me wings  and make me fly thro  the air with it   I was about to speak  Come  come  I will have no denial  interrupted she  I shall have a double pleasure  if you are present when Sir Charles comes  on hearing his account of what happened  You are a good man  and have a reasonable quantity of wonder and gratitude  to heighten a common case into the marvellous  So sit down  and be quiet   I was equally delighted and surprised at her humorous raillery  but could not answer a single word  If it be midnight before you will suffer me to depart  thought I  I will not make another objection   While this amiable Lady was thus entertaining me  we heard the trampling of horses—My brother  said she  I hope —He comes  pardon the fondness of a sister  who speaks from sensible effects—A father and a brother in one   Sir Charles entered the room  He addressed himself to me in a most polite manner  Mr  Reeves  said he  as I understand from below—Then turning to his sister  Excuse me Charlotte  I heard this worthy gentleman was with you  And I was impatient to know how my fair guest—  Miss Byron is in a good way  I hope  interrupted she  but very weak and low spirited  She arose and dressed  but I have prevailed on her to lie down again   Then turning to me  with a noble air  he both welcomed and congratulated me   Sir Charles Grandison is indeed a fine figure  He is in the bloom of youth  I don t know that I have ever seen an handsomer or genteeler man  Well might his sister say  that if he married  he would break half a score hearts  O this vile Pollexfen  thought I  at the moment  Could he draw upon  has he hurt  such a man as this   After pouring out my acknowlegements  in the name   192 of several families  as well as my own  I could not but enquire into the nature of the hurt he had received   A very trifle —My coat only was hurt  Mr  Reeves  The skin of my left shoulder raked a little  putting his hand upon it   Thank God  said I  Thank God  said Miss Grandison—But so near —O the villain  what might it have been —  Sir Hargrave  pent up in a chariot  had great disadvantage  My reflexions on the event of yesterday  yield me the more pleasure  as I have  on enquiry  understood that he will do well again  if he will be ruled  I would not  on any account  have had his instant death to answer for  But no more of this just now  Give me the particulars of the young Lady s state of health  I left her in a very bad way —You had advice   Miss Grandison gave her brother an account of all that had been done  and of every thing that had passed since he went away  as also of the character and excellencies of the Lady whom he had rescued   I confirmed what she said in my cousin s favour  and he very gratefully thanked his sister for her care  as a man would do for one the nearest and dearest to him   We then besought him to give an account of the glorious action  which had restored to all that knew her  the darling of our hearts   I will relate all he said  in the first person  as nearly in his own words as possible  and will try to hit the coolness with which he told the agreeable story      You know  sister  said he  the call I had to town  It was happy  that I yielded to your importunity to attend you hither        About two miles on this side Hounslow  I saw a chariot and six driving at a great rate  I also had ordered Jerry to drive pretty fast        The coachman seemed inclined to dispute the   193 way with mine  This occasioned a few moments stop to both  I ordered my coachman to break the way  I don t love to stand upon trisles  My horses were fresh
