entertainment  It is possible the anxiety from this last circumstance alone might have brought on a relapse  had I not been supplied by a traveller  who stopt to take a cursory refreshment  This person was no other than the philanthropic bookseller in St  Paul s church yard  who has written so many little books for children  he called himself their friend  but he was the friend of all mankind  He was no sooner alighted  but he was in haste to be gone  for he was ever on business of the utmost importance  and was at that time actually compiling materials for the history of one Mr  Thomas Trip  I immediately recollected this good natured man s red pimpled face  for he had published for me against the Deuterogamists of  Page  191  the age  and from him I borrowed a few pieces  to be paid at my return  Leaving the inn  therefore  as I was yet but weak  I resolved to return home by easy journies of ten miles a day  My health and usual tranquillity were almost restored  and I now condemned that pride which had made me refractory to the hand of correction  Man little knows what calamities are beyond his patience to bear till he tries them  as in ascending the heights of ambition  which look bright from below  every step we rise shews us some new prospect of hidden disappointment  so in our descent to the vale of wretchedness  which  from the summits of pleasure appears dark and gloomy  the busy mind  still attentive to its own amusement  finds something to flatter and surprise it  Still as we descend  the objects appear to brighten  unexpected prospects amuse  and the mental eye becomes adapted to its gloomy situation   I now proceeded forwards  and had walked about two hours  when I perceived  Page  192  what appeared at a distance like the waggon  which I was resolved to overtake  but when I came up with it  found it to be a strolling company s cart  that was carrying their scenes and other theatrical furniture to the next village  where they were to exhibit  The cart was attended only by the person who drove it  and one of the company  as the rest of the players were to follow the ensuing day  Good company upon the road  says the proverb  is always the shortest cut  I therefore entered into conversation with the poor player  and as I once had some theatrical powers myself  I disserted on such topics with my usual freedom  but as I was pretty much unacquainted with the present state of the stage  I demanded who were the present theatrical writers in vogue  who the Drydens and Otways of the day —   I fancy  Sir    cried the player    few of our modern dramatists would think themselves much honoured by being compared to the writers you mention  Dryden and Row s manner  Sir  are quite out of fashion  our taste has gone back a  Page  193  whole century  Fletcher  Ben Johnson  and all the plays of Shakespear  are the only things that go down    —   How    cried I    is it possible the present age can be pleased with that antiquated dialect  that obsolete humour  those over charged characters  which abound in the works you mention    —   Sir    returned my companion    the public think nothing about dialect  or humour  or character  for that is none of their business  they only go to be amused  and find themselves happy when they can enjoy a pantomime  under the sanction of Johnson s or Shakespear s name    —   So then  I suppose   cried I    that our modern dramatists are rather imitators of Shakespear than of nature    —   To say the truth    returned my companion    I don t know that they imitate any thing at all  nor indeed does the public require it of them  it is not the composition of the piece  but the number of starts and attitudes that may be introduced into it that elicits applause  I  Page  194  have known a piece  with not one jest in the whole  shrugged into popularity  and another saved by the poet s throwing in a fit of the gripes  No  Sir  the works of Congreve and Farquhar have too much wit in them for the present taste  our modern dialogue is much more natural      By this time the equipage of the strolling company was arrived at the village  which  it seems  had been apprised of our approach  and was come out to gaze at us  for my companion observed  that strollers always have more spectators without doors than within  I did not consider the impropriety of my being in such company till I saw a mob gathered about me  I therefore took shelter  as fast as possible  in the first ale house that offered  and being shewn into the common room  was accosted by a very well drest gentleman  who demanded whether I was the real chaplain of the company  or whether it was only to be
