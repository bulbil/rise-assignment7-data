stand affected by what we have just seen  For my part  there is no disguising the truth  my mind is ill at ease  Emotions  new and indescribable  are rushing upon my mind  and  for the first time in my life  I reproach myself with the wickedness of my past actions  I am just in the same temper of soul  answered I  my iniquities are all drawn up in array against me  they beset me  they stare me in the face  my heart  hitherto proof against all the arrows of remorse  is at this moment shot through  torn and disfigured  tormented and destroyed  Ah  my dear Ambrose  resumed my partner  we are two stray sheep  whom our Heavenly Father  in mercy  would lead back gently to the fold  It is he himself  my child  it is he who warms and guides us  Let us not be deaf to the call of his voice  let us abandon all our wicked courses  let us begin from this day to work out our salvation with diligence and in the spirit of repentance  we had better spend the remainder of our days in this convent  and consecrate them to penitence and devotion   I applauded Raphael s sentiment  continued brother Ambrose  and we formed the glorious resolution of becoming Carthusians  To carry it into effect  we applied to the venerable prior  who was no sooner made acquainted with our purpose  than to ascertain whether our call was front the world above or the world beneath  he appointed us to cells  and all the strictness of monkish discipline  for a whole year  We acted up to the rules with equal regularity and fortitude  and  by way of reward  were admitted among the novices  Our condition was so much what we wished it  and our hearts were so full of religious zeal  that we underwent the toils of our noviciate with unflinching courage  When that was over  we professed  after which  Don Raphael  appearing admirably well qualified  both by natural talent and various experience  for the management of secular concerns  was chosen assistant to an old friar who was at that time proctor  The son of Lucinda would infinitely have preferred dedicating every remaining moment of his existence to prayer  but he found it necessary to sacrifice his taste for devotion  in furtherance of the general prosperity  He entered with so much zeal and knowledge into the interests of the house  that he was considered as the most eligible person to succeed the old proctor  who died three years afterwards  Don Raphael accordingly fills that office at present  and it may be truly said that he discharges his duty to the entire satisfaction of all our fathers  who praise in the highest terms his conduct in the administration of our temporalities  What is most of all miraculous  and shews the hand of heaven in his conversion  is that  with such an accumulation of business rushing in upon him in his bursarial department  his regards are inalienably fixed on the world to come  When business leaves him but a moment to recruit nature  instead of lavishing the short period in indulgence  his thoughts wing their way into the regions of devout and holy meditation  In short  he is the most exemplary member of this body   At this period of our conversation I interrupted Lamela by an ebullition of joy to which I gave vent at the sight of Raphael coming in  Here he is  exclaimed I  behold that righteous bursar for whom I have been so impatiently waiting  With a leap and a bound did I run to meet and embrace him  He submitted to the hug with his newly acquired resignation  and  without betraying the slightest shock at meeting with an old companion of his profaner hours  his words were dictated by the spirit of gentleness and humility  The powers above be praised  Signor de Santillane  the powers be praised for this kind providence whereby we meet again  In good truth  my dear Raphael  replied I  your happy destiny pleases me as much as if it had been my own good luck  brother Ambrose has told me the whole story of your conversion  and the tale almost moved me to a similar change  What a glorious lot for you two  my friends  when you have reason to flatter yourselves with being among that picked number of the elect  who have eternal happiness thrust upon them whether they will or no   Two miserable sinners like ourselves  resumed the son of Lucinda  with an air which marked the extreme of sanctified morality  must not hope that our own merits are of weight enough to save our souls  but even the wicked one who repenteth  findeth grace with the Father of mercies  And you  Signor Gil Blas  added he  is it not time to lay in a claim for pardon of the offences which you have committed  What is your business here in Valencia  Are you not hankering after some office of devil s deputy  and making shipwreck of your voyage to another world  Not so  by the blessing of heaven  answered I  since I turned my back on the court  I have led a very moral sort of life  sometimes enjoying rural recreations on an estate of mine
