he concludes with the demonstrative   proof    his skill  of offering to make a present of a pair of his own   making  The advantage of such an offer  and the pleasure of   encouraging so illustrious a mechanic  make his present always   accepted  so that he has generally the most business of any one   in the trade  though some accidents have happened  that have   almost made him afraid to pursue such an indiscriminate method   of soliciting custom      Happening  some time ago  in a very large company  to sit near   a young gentleman  whose delicate complexion had brought bim    though most unjustly  under a suspicion of indulging unnatural   passions  he applied his hand to the gentleman s thigh  and began   to feel it all over  to take measure of it  according to his custom    The gentleman  who was not ignorant of the imputation he lay   under  and therefore was more quickly sensible of everything that   might possibly seem to allude to it  thought this application to   his thigh was meant either to tempt or insult him  for he had been   informed that those wretches often make their infamous addresses   in this manner  and was enraged at it to such a degree  that  for    getting all respect to the company present  and to the rank of hia   supposed lover  he felled the poor breeches maker to the ground    and starting from his chair drew his sword and would have run   him through the body had not his arm been happily seized by the   gentleman who sat next him      It is not easy to describe the astonishment of the company at   Buoh an outrage  which they could attribute to nothing but frenzy    but the gentleman soon undeceived them        Infamous  unnatural wretch     exclaimed he  as soon as rage         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 47     permitted him utterance     I ll make you know that I am not an   object of your brutal passions  I have exposed you here  but your   infamy shall not be confined to this company  I ll publish it to all   the world  Unhand me  gentlemen  and let me wash off the disgrace   of such an attempt with the monster s blood   I ll gladly pay my   own life as a forfeit to the defect of the law that has provided no   punishment for such odious crimes        ft  To the greater part of the company this speech was quite unin    telligible  and only confirmed the suspicion of his madness   but one   of them  who had observed the gentleman change countenance   upon the noble mechanic s applying his hand to his thigh  soon   cleared up the mystery        I believe  sir    said he    you have been too hasty  and mistaken   an intention  not only harmless in itself  but generous also  for one   of a very different nature   Have you any other reason for accus    ing his lordship of unnatural designs upon you  beside his laying   his hand upon your thigh  and feeling it           No  sir   but that I think enough   too much for him to offer or   for me to bear   nor will I bear it          I do not pretend  sir  to teE you what you must bear  but this   I can tell you  that you have entirely  and most injuriously  mis    taken his lordship  who meant no more by that action which gave   you such offence than just to take your measure for a pair of breeches    which  if you had not been so hasty in your resentment  he would   have made you a present of          Death  sir  do you make a jest of me         His lordship  who had heard their discourse  and was by this time   BO far recovered of his fright aa to be able to speak  interposed here    or the affair might probably have taken another turn        No  indeed  sir    said he    he does not jest   I meant nothing   more   and all the company present knows that I never had any   passion in my life but for breeches making   and  if you appre      bended anything else  you were very much mistaken        This speech and the manner in which it was delivered  were not   to be resisted  They disarmed the gentleman
