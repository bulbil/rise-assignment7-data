acquaintance  art the only man who has shewn any attachment to me  If the friendship of one labouring under the displeasure of his prince  be worth thy accepting  I offer thee mine  and  Page  88  conjure thee to grant me yours in return  The base ingratitude I have already experienced from the rest of my pretended friends  has determined me to disclaim all society with them  if thou wilt sometimes visit me in my retirement  thou wilt find ← Nourjahad → not undeserving of thy kindness     Zamgrad promised to see him as often as he could  and took his leave     However vexed ← Nourjahad → was at his disappointment  in finding himself  by being still debarred of his liberty  deprived for a time at least from executing one of his favourite purposes  that of travelling all over the world  he yet  Page  89  contented himself with the reflection  that this project was only postponed to another opportunity  and that he should have time enough for executing his design  after Schemzeddin  and many of his posterity were in their graves  I will not waste my hours  said he  in fruitless languishment for what I cannot at present attain  but make the most of the good which now offers itself to my acceptance     He ordered Hasem to pay down the money forthwith  for that fine seat  I will remove thither  said he  immediately  and make myself some recompence by all the means that art can devise  for that cruel long trance  which  Page  90  overpowered me so unseasonably  I hope I shall not be visited by another for these fifty or sixty years at least     Hasem s diligence kept pace with his lord s impatience  He got every thing in readiness for his reception at his rural mansion  and to avoid the notice which might be taken of so numerous a seraglio  and such a train of domestics  the prudent Hasem advised that they should set out and travel by night  This precaution  said he  will prevent the malice of your enemies from making ill natured representations of your conduct to the sultan  and as you yourself are supposed by every body in Ormuz to have laboured under a long and painful illness   Page  91  I think  to give colour to this report  it would be most advisable for you to be carried in a litter  As ← Nourjahad → loved his ease  he readily enough consented to this proposal  and in this manner suffered himself to be conveyed to his new habitation     On his arrival he found Hasem had not exaggerated in his description of this place  The house  or rather palace  for such it might be called  infinitely exceeded his expectations  but above all  the gardens were so delicious  that his senses were ravished with delight  He declared that those mansions of joy prepared for the reception of the faithful  could not exceed them  and forgetting  Page  92  that this paradise was to be his prison  he ordered that a pavilion of light brocade should be reared for him in the midst of his garden  where he purposed to enjoy the cool hours of the evening  amidst the noise of falling waters  and the wild notes of innumerable birds  who had taken up their residence in this terrestrial paradise     Behold him now once more  in the possession of every thing  for which the heart of man in the wildest wishes of Epicurean phrenzy  could pant  He gave the reins to his passions  he again became the slave of voluptuous appetites  He submitted a second time to the power of beauty  he invented new  Page  93  modes of luxury  and his delightful abode became the scene of every licentious pleasure     The delicacies and profusion in which he himself wallowed  made him forget that there were wants or miseries amongst his fellow creatures  and as he had but little intercourse with mankind  except with those who flattered his follies  or administered to his loose pleasures  he became hardened to all the social affections  He ceased to relieve the poor  because they never came in his way  and with a heart naturally generous and benevolent  he lived only for himself     Page  94  Immersed in sensual gratifications  he lost all relish for any others  The poets and sages whom he entertained in his house  began to grow irksome to him  He derided the wisdom and philosophy of the latter  and if they attempted to entertain him with learned or grave discourses  he laughed at them  and at length thinking their company tedious  he turned them out of his house     His bards would have shared the same fate  if they had not by a timely address rendered their art subservient to his depraved inclinations  They composed nothing but pieces filled with adulation on himself  or light verses in  Page  95  praise of one or other of his mistresses  these were set to melting airs  and sung accompanied by the lute     Thus did ← Nourjahad → pass his days  Every rising sun beheld some fresh outrage on the laws of temperance and
