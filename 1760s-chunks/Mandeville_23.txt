   Twelve at Night      She forgives me  and I am most happy  Lady Anne has told her all  and has had the goodness to introduce me to her as we walked  unobserved by the Ladies who were with us  I have kissed her hand as a seal of my pardon  That moment  Oh           1 116       Mordaunt  with what difficulty did I restrain the transport of my soul      Yes  my friend  she forgives me  a sweet benign serenity reigns in her lovely eyes  she approves my conduct  she is pleased with the concern I shew at giving pain to the heart which loves me  her chearfulness is returned  and has restored mine  she rules every movement of my heart as she pleases  never did I pass so happy a day  I am all joy  no sad idea can enter  I have scarce room even for the tender compassion I owe to her I have made wretched  I am going to bed  but without the least expectation of sleep  joy will now have the same effect as I last night found from a contrary cause  Adieu     H  Mandeville           1 117         To Colonel Bellville   Thursday Morning      I Have reconciled the friends  the scene was amazingly pathetic and pretty  I am only sorry I am too lazy to describe it  He kissed her hand  without her shewing the least symptom of anger  she blushed indeed  but  if I understand blushes    in short  times are prodigiously changed        The strange misses were of infinite use  as they broke the continuity of the tender scene  if I may be allowed the expression  which  however entertaining to Les Amies  would have been something sickly to my Ladyship  if it had lasted        And now  having united  it must be my next work to divide them  for seriously I am apt to believe  the dear creatures are          1 118       in immense danger of a kind of partiality for each other  which would not be quite so convenient      I have some thoughts  being naturally sentimental and generous  of taking Harry myself  merely from compassion to Lady Julia  Widows  you know  are in some degree the property of handsome young fellows  who have more merit than fortune  and there would be something very heroic in devoting myself to save my friend  I always told you  Bellville  I was more an antique Roman than a Briton  But I must leave you  I hear Lady Julia coming to fetch me  we breakfast Ã  Trio in a bower of roses        Oh  heavens  the plot begins to thicken    Lucretia s dagger    Rosamonda s bowl    Harry has had a letter from his charmer    vows she can t live without him    determined to die unless the barbarous man relents           1 119          This cruel Harry will be the death of us all      Did I tell you we were going to a ball to night  six or seven miles off  She has heard it  and intends to be there  tells him  she shall there expect the sentence of life or death from his lovely eyes  the signal is appointed  if his savage heart is melted  and he pities her sufferings  he is to dance with her  and be master of her divine person and eighty thousand pounds  to morrow  if not    but she expires at the idea    she entreats him to soften the cruel stroke  and not give a mortal wound to the tenderest of hearts by dancing with another        You would die to see Harry s distress    so anxious for the tender creature s life  so incensed at his own wicked attractions  so perplext how to pronounce the fatal sentence    for my part  I have had the utmost          1 120       difficulty to keep my countenance     Lady Julia  who was to have been his partner  sighing with him over the letter  intreating him not to dance  pitying the unhappy love sick maid  her fine eyes glistening with a tear of tender sympathy      The whole scene is too ridiculous to be conceived  and too foolish even to laugh at  I could stand it no longer  so retired  and left them to their soft sorrows        You may talk of women  but you men are as much the dupes of your own vanity as the weakest amongst us can be  Heaven and earth  that  with Harry s understanding and knowledge of the world
