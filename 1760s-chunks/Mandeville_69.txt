the world           2 117       who raise the storms which shake the foundation of government      You will imagine  my dear friend  I only intend this alliance to take place  if their sentiments  when of age to judge for themselves  correspond with our intentions for their happiness  That this may be the case  let us educate them  with the utmost care  in every accomplishment of mind and person  which can make them lovely in the eyes of each other        Let me  my dear Colonel  hear immediately if this proposal is as agreeable to you as to    Your faithful and affectionate Belmont         2 118       TO the Earl of Belmont      My Lord        I AM greatly obliged to your Lordship for a proposal which does my son such honor  and for a conduct towards us both so noble and worthy your character        The disposition you mention is what I have sometimes hoped  but knew your Lordship s honor and integrity too well to think it necessary to make any enquiry  convinced  if a settlement was made in my favor  you would in due time make me acquainted with it  till some probability appeared of its taking place  it was  perhaps  better concealed than disclosed        The alliance your Lordship proposes  if it ever takes place  will make me the happiest of mankind  having  however  observed marriages made by parents in the          2 119       childhood of the parties  to be generally disagreeable to the latter  whether from the perverseness of human nature  or the free spirit of love impatient of the least controll  will intreat our design may be kept secret from all the world  and in particular from the young people themselves  all we can do is  to give them such an education as will best improve the gifts of nature  and render them objects of that lively and delicate affection  which alone can make such a connexion happy  Perhaps it may be best to separate them till the time when the heart is most susceptible of tenderness  least an habitual intercourse should weaken that impression  which we wish their perfections to make on each other  Both at present promise to be lovely  and  if we guard against other attachments  the charm of novelty  added to what nature has done for them  and those acquired graces which it is our part to endeavor to give the  can        2 120       scarce fail of inspiring a mutual passion  which ones seeming to desire it would probably prevent      If I am so happy as to have your Lordship s concurrence in these sentiments  I will remove my son immediately from your neighbourhood  and educate him in town  at a proper time he shall go  with a private tutor of birth and merit  to the university  and from thence make the tour of Europe  whilst Lady Julia is advancing in every charm  under the eye of the most excellent of mothers        Men  who act a conspicuous part on the stage of life  and who require a certain audacity and self possession to bring their talents into full light  cannot  in my opinion  have too public an education  but women  whose loveliest charm is the rosy blush of native modesty  whose virtues blossom fairest          2 121       in the vale  should never leave their household gods  the best protectors of innocence      It is also my request  that my son may be educated in a total ignorance of the settlement in our favor  both because the effect of it may possibly be destroyed by your Lordship s having a son  and because he will taste the pleasures of a distinguished station  if he ever arrives at it  with double relish  if bred with more moderate expectations  He will by this means too escape the pernicious snares of flattery  the servile court of interested inferiors  and all the various mischiefs which poison the minds of young men bred up as heirs to great estates and titles  he will see the hatefulness of pride and arrogance in others  before he is tempted to be guilty of them himself  he will learn to esteem virtue  without those trappings of wealth and greatness which he will never hope to be possessed of  he will see the          2 122       world as it is  by not being of consequence enough to be flattered or deceived      His education  his company  his expences  shall  however  be suited to the rank he may one day possibly fill  my acquaintance with foreign courts enables me to introduce him every where to those of the first rank and merit  his equipage and attendance shall be such as
