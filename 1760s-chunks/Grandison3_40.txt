 in terror  was already in it  When they were also in it  they cursed  swore  and threatened   The pretended Captain  putting his body half way out of the coach  bid my servants tell me  That I was—That I was—And avoiding a worse name  as it seemed No Gentleman  and that he would find an opportunity to make me repent the treatment I had given to men of honour  and to a Lady   The Major  in eagerness to say something  by way of resentment and menace likewise— beginning with damning his blood —had his intended threatening cut short  by meeting the Captain s head with his  as •he other  in a rage  withdrew it  after his sp•ech to the   98 servant  And each cursing the other  one rubbing his forehead  the other putting his hand to his head  away drove the coach   They forgot to ask for their swords  and one of them left his hat behind him   You cannot imagine  my dear Dr  Bartlett  how much this idle affair has disturbed me  I cannot forgive myself—To suffer myself to be provoked by two such men  to violate the sanction of my own house  Yet they came  no doubt  to bully and provoke me  or to lay a foundation for a demand  that they knew  if personally made  must do it   My only excuse to myself is  That there were two of them  and that  tho  I drew  yet I had the command of myself so far as only to defend myself  when I might have done any thing with them  I have generally found  that those who are the readiest to give offence  are the unfittest  when brought to the test  to support their own insolence   But my Emily  my poor Emily  How must she be terrified —I will be with you very soon  Let not her know any thing of this idle affair  nor any body but Lord L   Tuesday Morning   I HAVE just parted with one Blagrave  an attorney  who already had been ordered to proceed against me  But  out of regand to my character  and having  as he owned▪ no great opinion of his clients  he thought fit to come to me in person  to acquaint me of it  and to inform himself  from me  of the whole affair   The gentleman s civility intitled him to expect an account of it  I gave it him   He told me  That if I pleased to restore the swords and the hat  by him▪ and would promise not to stop the future quarterly payments of the 200 l  a year  about which they were very apprehensive  he dared to say  that  after such an exertion of spirit  as he called a choleric excess  I should not hear any more   99 of them for one while  since  he believed  they had only been trying an experiment  which had been carried farther  he dared to say  than they had designed it should   He hinted his opinion  that the men were common men of the town  and that they had never been honoured with commissions in any service   The woman  I know not by what name to call her  since it is very probable  that she has not a real title to that of O Hara  was taken out of the coach in violent hysterics  as O Hara told him  who  in consulting Mr  Blagrave  may be supposed to aggravate matters  in order to lay a foundation for an action of damages   She accused the men of cowardice  before Mr  Blagrave  and that in very opprobrious terms   They excused themselves  as being loth to hurt me  which  they said  they easily could have done  especially before I drew   They both pretended  to Mr  Blagrave  personal damages  but I hope their hurts are magnified   I am  however that be  most hurt  for I am not at all pleased with myself  They  possibly  tho  they have no cause to be satisfied with their parts in the sray  have been more accustomed to such scuf•les  than I  and are above  or rather beneath  all punctilio   Mr  Blagrave took the swords and the hat with him in the coach that waited for him   If I thought it would not have looked like a compromise  and encouraged their insolence  I co ld freely have sent them more than what belonged to hem  I am really greatly hurt by the part I acted to such men   As to the annuity  I bid Mr  Blagrave tell the woman  that the payment of that  depended upon her future good behaviour  and yet  that I was not •ure  that she was intitled to it  but as the widow of my friend   However  I told this gentleman  That no provocation   100 should hinder me from doing strict justice  tho  I were sure that they would go to law with the money I should cause to be paid to them quarterly  You will therefore know  Sir  added I
