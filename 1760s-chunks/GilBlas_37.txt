Salamanca  where I shall see what I can make of my Latin  All my trouble is  how to get to Burgos  one must live on the road  I understand you  replied he  Take my purse  it is rather thinly lined  to be sure  but you know a chorister s dividends are not like a bishop s  At the same time he drew it from his pouch  and inserted it between my hands with so good a grace  that I could not do otherwise than accept it  for want of a better  I thanked him as though he had made me a present of a gold mine  and tendered him a thousand promises of recompense  to be duly honoured and punctually paid at doom s day  With this I left him  and skulked out of the town  not paying my respects to my other benefactors  but giving them a thousand blessings from my heart   The little chorister had reason for speaking modestly of his purse  it was not orthodox  By good luck  I had been used for these two months to a very slender diet  and had still a little small change left when I reached Ponte de Mula  not far from Burgos  I halted there to inquire after Donna Mencia  The hostess of the inn I put up at was a little withered  spiteful  emaciated bit of mortality  I saw at a glance  by the mouths she made at me aside  that my frock did not hit her fancy  and I thought it a proof of her taste  So I sat myself down at a table  ate bread and cheese  and drank a few glasses of execrable wine  such as innkeepers technically call cassecoquin  During this meal  which was of a piece with the outward appearance of the guest  I did my utmost to come to closer quarters with my landlady  Did she know the Marquis de la Guardia  Was his castle far out of town  Above all  what was become of my lady marchioness  You ask many questions in a breath  replied she  bridling with disdain  But I got out of her  though by hard pumping  that Don Ambrosio s castle was but a short league from Ponte de Mula   After I had done eating and drinking  as it was night  I thought it natural to go to bed  and asked for my room  A room for you  shrieked my landlady  darting at me a glance of contempt and pride  I have no rooms for fellows who make their supper on a bit of cheese  All my beds are bespoke  There are people of fashion expected  and our accommodations are all kept for them  But I will not be unchristian  you may lie in my barn  I suppose your soft skin will not be incommoded by the feel of straw  She spoke truth without knowing it  I took it all in silence  and slunk to my roosting place  where I fell asleep like a man  the excess of whose labours are his ready passport to the blessings of repose       CH  XIV     Donna Mencia s reception of him at Burgos   I WAS no sluggard  but got up the next morning betimes  I paid my bill to the landlady  who was already stirring  and seemed a little less lofty and in better humour than the evening before  a circumstance I attributed to the endeavours of three kind guardsmen belonging to the holy brotherhood  These gentlemen had slept in the inn  they were evidently on a very intimate footing with the hostess  and doubtless it was for guests of such note that all the beds were bespoke   I inquired in the town my way to the castle where I wanted to present my  self  By accident I made up to a man not unlike my landlord at Pegnaflor  He was not satisfied with answering my question to the point  but informed me that Don Ambrosio had been dead three weeks  and the marchioness his lady had taken the resolution of retiring to a convent at Burgos  which he named  I proceeded immediately towards that town  instead of taking the road to the castle  as I had first meant to do  and flew at once to the place of Donna Mencia s retreat  I besought the attendant at the turning box to tell that lady that a young man just discharged from prison at Astorga wanted to speak with her  The nun went on the message immediately  On her return  she showed me into a parlour  where I did not wait long before Don Ambrosio s widow appeared at the grate in deep mourning   You are welcome  said the lady  Four days ago I wrote to a person at Astorga  to pay you a visit as from me  and to tell you to come and see me the moment you were released from prison  I had no doubt of your being discharged shortly  what I told the corregidor in your exculpation was enough for that  An answer was brought that you had been set at liberty  but that no one knew what was become of you  I was afraid of not seeing you any more  and losing the pleasure of expressing my gratitude  Never mind  added she
