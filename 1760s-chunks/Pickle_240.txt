 being in town  though he himself was in the country  I wrote to him  immediately  and  when he came to London  declared my intention of  separating from my lord  in which  seeing me obstinate and determined   he at length acquiesced  and a formal separation accordingly ensued   which at that time I thought binding and immutable    I was now sheltered under the wings of an indulgent father  who had  taken me into favour again  on the supposition that my commerce with Mr   S   was absolutely at an end  Nevertheless  though we had separated   in all appearance for ever  we had previously agreed to maintain our  correspondence in private interviews  which should escape the notice of  the world  with which I was again obliged to keep some measures    Our parting at the duke of K   s house in the country was attended with  all the genuine marks of sincere and reciprocal affection  and I lived  in the sweet hope of seeing him again  in all the transport of his  former passion  when my lawyer  who received my letters  brought me a  billet one night  just as I had gone to bed  Seeing the superscription  of S   s handwriting  I opened it with all the impatience of an absent  lover  but how shall I describe the astonishment and consternation with  which I was seized  when I perused the contents  Instead of the most  tender vows and protestations  this fatal epistle began with  Madam   the best thing you can do is to return to your father  or some cold and  killing expression to that effect    Heaven and earth  what did I feel at this dire conjuncture  the light  forsook my eyes  a cold sweat bedewed my limbs  and I was overwhelmed  with such a torrent of sorrow and surprise  that everybody present  believed I would have died under the violent agitation  They endeavoured  to support my spirits with repeated draughts of strong liquor  which had  no sensible effect upon my constitution  though for eight whole years  I had drunk nothing stronger than water  and I must have infallibly  perished in the first ecstasy of my grief  had it not made its way in  a fit of tears and exclamation  in which I continued all night  to the  amazement of the family  whom my condition had alarmed  and raised from  their repose  My father was the only person who guessed the cause of  my affliction  he said he was sure I had received some ill usage in  a letter or message from that rascal S    so he termed him in the  bitterness of passion    At mention of that name  my agony redoubled to such a degree that  all who were present wept at sight of my deplorable condition  My poor    6 22 15  3 45 PM   father shed a flood of tears  and conjured me to tell him the cause of  my disquiet  upon which  rather than confess the truth  I amused his  concern by pretending that my lover was ill  The whole family having  stayed by me till I was a little more composed  left me to the care of  my maid  who put me into bed about six in the morning  but I enjoyed no  rest  I revolved every circumstance of my conduct  endeavouring to find  out the cause of this fatal change in S   s disposition  and as I could  recollect nothing which could justly give offence  concluded that some  malicious persons had abused his ears with stories to my prejudice    With this conjecture I got up  and sent my lawyer to him with a letter   wherein I insisted upon seeing him  that I might have an opportunity of  justifying myself in person  a task which would be easily performed   as I had never offended  but in loving too well  I waited with the most  anxious impatience for the return of my messenger  who brought me an  answer couched in the coldest terms of civility which indifference  could dictate  acknowledging  however  that he had nothing to lay to my  charge  but that it was for the good of us both that we should part  He  ought to have reflected on that before  not after I had sacrificed my  all for his love  I was well nigh distracted by this confirmation of  his inconstancy  and I wonder to this day how I retained the use of my  reason under such circumstances of horror and despair  My grief laid  aside all decorum and restraint  I told my father that S   was dying   and that I would visit him with all expedition    Startled at the proposal  this careful parent demonstrated the fatal  consequence of such an unguarded step  reminded me of the difficulty  with which he had prevailed upon my mother and uncle to forgive my  former imprudence  observed that his intention was to carry me into the  country next day  in order to effect a perfect reconciliation  but now
