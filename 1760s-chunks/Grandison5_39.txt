shall not know how to part with a child so dear to us—But these seas—  Well  well  said the Bishop  this is a contingence  and must be left to time  and to the Chevalier and my sister  when they are one  As his is the strongest mind  it will  in all reasonable matters  yield to the weaker—Now  as to my sister s fortune—  It is a large one  said the Count  We shall all take pleasure in adding to it   Should there be more sons than one by the marriage  rejoined the Bishop  as the estate of her two grandfathers will be an ample provision for one of them  and your English estate for another  I hope we may expect that the education of one of them may be left to us   Every one said  this was a very reasonable expectation   I cannot condition for this  my Lord  The education of the sons was to be left to me  that of the daughters  to the mother  I will consent  that the Italian estate shall be tied up for daughters portions  and that they shall be brought up under your own eyes  Italians  The sons shall have no benefit by the Italian estate—  Except they become Catholics  Chevalier  added the Bishop   No  my Lord  replied I  That might be a temptation—Tho  I would leave posterity as free  as I myself am left  in the article of religion  yet would I not lay any snares for them  I am for having them Page  98 absolutely secluded from any possibility of enjoying that estate  as they will be Englishmen  Cannot this be done by the laws of your country  and the tenure by which these estates are held   If Clementina marry  said the Marquis  whether there be issue or not  Laurana s claim ceases  But  Chevalier  can you think it just to deprive children unborn of their natural right   I have a very good estate  It is improving  I have considerable expectations besides  That is not mine which I do not possess  and shall have no right to  but by marriage  and which  therefore  must and ought to be subject to marriage articles  Riches never made men happy  If my descendants will not be so with a competence  they will not with a redundance  I hope Signor Jeronymo may recover  and marry  Let the estate here  from the hour that I shall be honoured with the hand of your dear Clementina  be Jeronymo s  and his posterity s for ever  If it shall be thought proper for him  on taking possession  to make his sister any brotherly acknowlegement  it shall be to her sole and separate use  and not subject to any controul of mine  If Signor Jeronymo marry not  or if he do  and die without issue  let the estate in question be the General s  He and his Lady deserve every thing  The estate shall not  by my consent  go out of the name   They looked upon each other—Brother  said the Count  I see not  but we may leave every thing to the generosity of such a young man as this  He quite overcomes me   A disinterested and generous man  rejoined the Bishop  is born a ruler  and he is  at the same time  the greatest of politicians  were policy only to be considered   The most equitable medium  I think  resumed the Marchioness  is what the Chevalier hinted at—and most answerable to the intention of the dear child s Page  99 grandfathers  It is  that the estate in question be secured to the daughters of the marriage  Our sons will be greatly provided for  And it will be rewarding  in some measure  the Chevalier for his generosity  that the sons of the marriage shall not have their patrimony lessened  by the provision to be made for daughters   They all generously applauded the Marchioness  and proposing this expedient to me  I bowed my grateful assent—See  Chevalier  said Father Marescotti  what a generous family you are likely to be allied with  O that you could be subdued by a goodness so much like your own  and declare yourself a Catholic  His Holiness himself  my Lord the Bishop could engage  would receive you with blessings  at the footstool of his throne  You allow  Sir  that salvation may be obtained in our church  Out of it  we think it cannot  Rejoice us all  Rejoice  Lady Clementina—and let us know no bound in our joy   What opinion  my dear Father Marescotti  would you all have of the man who could give up his conscience  tho  for the highest consideration on earth —Did you  could you  think the better of the two princes mentioned to me  for the change of their religion  One of them was assassinated in the streets of his metropolis  by an ecclesiastic  who questioned the sincerity of his change  Could the matter be of indifference to me—But  my dear Father Marescotti  let us leave this to be debated hereafter between you and me  as father and son  Your piety shall command my reverence  But pain not
