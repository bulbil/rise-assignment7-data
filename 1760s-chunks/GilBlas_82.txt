off with the lady  He had a violent suspicion of its being our abode  without having the courage to go in  It was enough to mark the adjacent parts  by lightly peeling with his knife bark from the nearest trees  and so on  from distance to distance  till he was quite out of the wood  He then betook himself to Leon  with this grand discovery for the corregidor  who was so much the better pleased  as his son had been robbed by our gang  This magistrate collected together three companies to lay hold of us  and the peasant showed them the way   My arrival in the town of Leon was as good as that of a wild beast to the inhabitants  Even though I had been a Portuguese general made prisoner of war  the people could not have been more anxious to see me  There he goes  was the cry  that is he  the famous captain  the terror of these parts  It would serve him right to tear him piecemeal with pincers  and make his comrades join in the chorus  To the corregidor  was the universal cry  and his worship began insulting me  So  so  said he  scoundrel as you are  the powers of justice  worn to a thread with your past irregularities  hand over the task of punishment to me as their delegate  Sir  answered I  great as my crimes may have been  at least the death of your only son is not to be laid at my door  His life was saved by me  you owe me some acknowledgment on that score  Oh  wretch  exclaimed he  there are no measures to be kept with people of your description  And though it were my wish to save you  my sacred office would not allow me to indulge my feelings  Having spoken to this effect  he committed us to a dungeon  where my companions had no time to lament their hard fate  They got out of confinement  at the end of three days  to expatiate with tragic energy at the place of execution  For my part  I took up my quarters in limbo for three complete weeks  My punishment seemingly was deferred only to render it more terrible  and I was looking out for some refinement on the ordinary course of criminal justice  when the corregidor  having summoned me before him  said  Give ear to your sentence  You are free  Had it not been for you  my only son would have been assassinated on the highway  As a father  my gratitude was due for this service  but not being competent to acquit you in my capacity of a magistrate  I have written up to court in your favour  have solicited your pardon  and have obtained it  Go  then  whithersoever it may seem good to you  But take my advice  profit by this lucky escape  Look to your paths  and give up the trade of a highwayman for good and all   I was deeply impressed by this advice  and took my departure for Madrid  in the firm determination of mending my ways  and living quietly in that city  There I found my father and mother dead  and what they left behind them in the hands of an old kinsman  who administered duly and truly  as all trustees of course do  I saved three thousand ducats out of the fire  scarcely a quarter of what I was entitled to  But where was the remedy  There was no standing to the quirks and evasions of the law  Just to be doing something  I have purchased an alguazil s place  My colleagues would have set their faces against my admission  for the honour of the cloth  had they known my history  Luckily they did not  or at least affected not to know it  which was just as good as the reality  for  in that illustrious body  it is the bounden duty and interest of every member to wear a mask  The pot cannot call the kettle hard names  thank heaven  The devil would have no great catch in the best of us  And yet  my friend  I could willingly unbosom myself to you without disguise  My present occupation is much against the grain  it requires too circumspect and too mysterious a conduct  there is nothing to be done but by underhand dealings  gravity  and cunning  Oh  for my first trade  The new one is safer  to be sure  but there is more fun in the other  and liberty is my motto  I feel disposed to get rid of my office  and to set out some sunshiny morning for the mountains at the source of the Tagus  I know of a retreat thereabouts  inhabited by a numerous gang  composed chiefly of Catalonians  when I have said that  I need say no more  If you will go along with me  we will swell the number of those heroes  I shall be second in command  To make your footing respectable at once  I will swear that you have fought ten times by my side  Your valour shall mount to the very skies  I will tell more good of you than a commander in chief of a favourite officer  I will not say a word about
