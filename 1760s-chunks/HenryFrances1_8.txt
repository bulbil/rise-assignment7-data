the Loss of an old one   Frances   LETTER IV  FRANCES to HENRY   I WAS never passionately fond of the Country  but you have made me hate it  You know my Nature jealous  and I cannot help considering Belvidere as a beloved Rival  who monopolizes all your Time  yet  like a true Woman  I sincerely long to see it  not to admire but to depreciate all it s Charms  tho  much I fear there will be no Room for Envy so to work  for I am apt to think that whatever you design and execute must be perfect     6I have a great Mind  if I thought it would vex you  not to write to you this Month  for your failing to answer my Tuesday s Letter  but I will believe you did not receive it Time enough  for I dare hope you would not fail me in a Matter of Business  You may see by this that my Spirits are much recovered  for  when they are low  I am always humble and desponding   You say that I never did  nor ever will do any Thing you recommend to me  and I am picqued into a Principle of Contradiction and resolved—not to do any Thing henceforward  but what you desire  In short  you vile Men have strange Ways with us poor Women  and you want but Power to be most admirable Tyrants   I must repeat what I have often told you  that I never took ill any Advice you gave me  for I could not be such a Child as to misinterpret the Kindness of your Design  tho  I might be feeble enough to resent the Harshness of your Discipline  I have  from my Infancy  been used to a fatal Delicacy  Fatal indeed to me  as it has enervated every Faculty of my Soul  and superadded a thousand tender Weaknesses to the Weakest of the weaker Sex  You were yourself  my dear Harry  as the Lawyers term it   accessary after the Fact   and helped to augment this Foible in me  perhaps  beyond a Cure  The Tenderness of your Manners  the   7 Fondness of your Expressions  and the Softness of your Letters joined to render my weak Mind more delicate  It is true  that  from the transitory State of sublunary Things  I ought to know that our Passions are as variable as the Moon   Which monthly changes in her circling Orb   and that we should not depend on the Tempers or Affections of Men  which can ebb and flow as frequent as the Sea    But bid Physicians preach our Veins to Temper   And with an Argument new set a Pulse   c    I acknowledge myself obliged for the friendly Concern you express at my Want of Health — But  for Heaven s Sake  why need you be so anxious to divest yourself of that little Tenderness which remains for me  At your Time of Life to set up for a Stoick is something extraordinary indeed  and  without assuming that insensate Apathy which they pretend to  I cannot conceive what Glory you can find in an affected Insensibility for one  who feels the tenderest Friendship and Esteem for you  Adieu     Frances     8  LETTER V   Dear FANNY   THE Indifference you mention is  like other Matters  unfairly laid to my Charge  I feel no such mortal Symptom of a Decay in my Love  therefore  my dear Hygea  you have  with Reverence to your Divinity  mistaken my Disorder  If I do not indeed write in the same gallant  gay Stile as formerly  it is  because no Man ever continued to do so  except some vain Fop  to shew his Wit  his Jeu d esprit  or Tour d expression  I had already said every Thing  which a fond Heart could dictate  and instead of ransacking the Poets for apt Expressions  which shew more of Fancy  than of Love  I for the Rest of my Life  sincerely meant  and purposed to prove my Attachments  by Actions  not by Words  Few Words among Friends are best  they say  then fewer still between Lovers  whose whole Life should be a Repetition of silent Minutes   Where Words meet Words  e re from the Lips they part   My former Letters  to which you allude  were proper to persuade you into a Belief of my Passion for you  But  when you seemed convinced of   9 that Truth  I thought it Time to quit romantick Flights for a more rational Converse  In the Mathematicks some general Principles are  at first  demonstrated  and then they are taken for granted  thro  the Remainder of the Study  for  if they were to be repeated on every Occasion  Science would be intolerably tedious   In short  if my Professions are not as frequent as usual  or my Expressions as fond  it is owing to what Shakespear says for Cordelia    Her full Heart  Reverberates no hollow Sound of Emptiness   The Paper you sent me does not answer the Character of it  or  perhaps  I may have thought it insipid  and inelegant  having read it
