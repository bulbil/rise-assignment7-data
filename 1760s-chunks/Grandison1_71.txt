proceeded with her  saying  they had indeed mistaken their way  but they were just there  and hurried on   She then undrew the side curtains—Good God of heaven protect me  they heard her say—I am in the midst of fields—They were then at Lissom Green   They heard her pray  and Macpherson said  He began then to conclude  that the Lady was too much frighten d  and too pious  to be in a love plot   But  nevertheless  backoned by their villainous guide  they hurried on  And then she screamed out  and happening to see one of the three men  she begg d his help for God s sake   The fellow blustered at the chairmen  and bid them stop  She asked for Grosvenor street  She was to be carried  she said  to Grosvenor street   She was just there  that fellow said—It can t be    173 Sir  It can t be —Don t I see fields all about me —I am in the midst of fields  Sir   Grosvenor Square  madam  reply d that villain  the trees and garden of Grosvenor Square   What a strange way have you come about  cry d her miscreant  And then trod out his flambeaux  while another fellow took the chairmens lantern from them  and they had only a little glimmering star light to guide them   She then  poor dear soul  screamed so dismally  that Macpherson said  it went to his heart to hear her  But they followed Wilson  who told them they were just landed  that was his word  he led them up a long garden walk  by a back way  One of the three men having got before  opened the garden door  and held it in his hand  and by the time they got to the house to which the garden seemed to belong  the dear creature ceased screaming   They too well saw the cause  when they stopt with her  She was in a fit   Two women  by the assistance of the person in the cloak  helped her out  with great seeming tenderness  They said something in praise of her beauty  and expressed themselves concerned for her  as if they were afraid she was past recovery  Which apparently startled the man in the cloak   Wilson entered the house with those who carried in the dear creature  but soon came out to the chairmen  They say the man in the cloak  who hung about the villain  and hugg d him  as in joy  give the rascal money  who then put a guinea into each of their hands  and conveyed them thro  the garden again  to the door at which they entered  but refused them light even so much as that of their own candle and lantern  However he sent another man with them  who led them over rough and dirty by ways into a path that pointed London ward  but plainly so much about with   174 design to make it difficult for them to find out the place again   THE other fellow is brought hither  He tells exactly the same story  I ask d of both  what sort of man he in the cloak was  But he so carefully muffled himself up  and so little appeared to them  either walking after them  or at the house  that I could gain no light from their description   On their promise to be forth coming  I have suffered them to go with Lady Betty s chairmen to try if they can trace out their own footsteps  and find the place   How many hopeless things must a man do  in an exigence  who knows not what is right to be done   I HAVE enquired of Lady Betty  Who it was that told her  Mr  Greville was not gone out of town  but intended to lie perdue  and she named her informant  I ask d how the discourse came in  She own d  a little aukwardly  I ask d whether that Lady knew Mr  Greville  She could not say whether she did  or not   I went to that Lady  Mrs  Preston  in New Bondstreet  She had her intelligence  she told me  from Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  who had hinted to her  that he should take such notice of Mr  Greville  as might be attended with consequences  and she was the readier to intimate this to Lady Betty  in order to prevent mischief   Now  Mr  Selby  as the intimation that the darklantern figure at the Masquerade was Mr  Greville  came from Sir Hargrave  and nobody else  and we saw nothing of him ourselves  how do we know—And yet Mr  Greville intended that we should believe him to be out of town—Yet even that intimation came from Sir Hargrave—And furthermore  was it   175 not likely that he would take as much care to conceal himself from Sir Hargrave  as from us —But I will go instantly to Sir Hargrave s house  He was to dine at home  and with company  If I cannot see him  If he should be absent—But no more till I return   O MR  Selby  I believe I have wrong d Mr
