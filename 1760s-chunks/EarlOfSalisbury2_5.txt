 hath consigned to his protection the  widow of that noble house  and destined his hand for that of the gentle  Countess  When Raymond first arrived at her castle  to execute the  orders of his liege Lord  he found her  alas  sunk deep in sorrowful  reflections on the fate of her unhappy Lord  and but ill disposed to  listen to his honourable passion  nor could his noble nature permit him  to break in too precipitately upon her melancholy  by declaring his  suit  and demanding her consent         — Here Oswald would have interrupted his discourse  but Grey  with a  mild  yet commanding look  claimed a free and undisturbed audience  The  Abbot seemed to assent  and the crasty minion proceeded thus       A decent interval of retirement was allowed to her grief  and in the  mean time her suitor was entertained with the respect due to his  greatness  nor was she long a stranger to his purpose  nor did she  disdain his suit  although she still deemed it dishonourable openly to  admit a second lover  until she had fully paid her duty to the memory of  Lord William  In this interval  heaven was pleased to afflict the  unhappy Lady with severe sickness  her fever was violent  and long and  obstinate was her delirium  She raved  I know not how  of force and  oppression  she called upon her late Lord  who she declared was yet  alive  now in her castle  and concealed from her by treachery and  cruelty  She spoke of blood  of murder  of her son  his dangers  and his enemies  Even when her bodily disorder began to abate  the  disorder of her mind was still unconquered  nor were those wild visions  yet dispelled  which had so long tormented her  Her Discourse indeed  seemed more consistent  though the discourse of madness  and  unhappily   imposed on the weakness and inexperience of her attendants  They  indulged her madness  and persuaded her to fly  for they believed that  Lord Raymond was really her persecutor  who  on his part  was only  anxious for her recovery  For this  were his prayers incessantly  breathed to heaven  For this  did he bind himself by solemn vow  to  reward the devotion of your house  with ample donations  nor was his  piety unnoticed  or his prayers rejected  Scarcely had the distraction  of this Lady prompted her to send away her son  and to retire from the  castle  when heaven was pleased  as it were miraculously  to awaken her  from her frightful dreams  and restore her unsettled reason  The first  sign of recollection which she discovered  was  her orders to those who  had been deceived by her distraction  and rashly conveyed her at  midnight from her castle  to conduct her back again  She was obeyed  and  instantly called for Lord Raymond  acknowledged her infirmity  and  entreated his pardon and indulgence  He  noble and gentle Lord   expressed nothing but the most rapturous joy at this happy change   earnestly pressing her to reward his love  and crown his wishes  No  longer now reluctant  or insensible to the happiness which heaven and  the royal favour had ordained for her  she only requested that some  little respite might still be granted  some time allowed to pay what  farther duties the memory of her late Lord demanded  This holy father  came opportunely to confirm her in those sentiments  and to direct her  pious intentions  By his persuasions am I ordered to attend him hither   directed by Lord Raymond  to enquire by what means and in what manner  he may most effectually discharge his vow  and by the gentle Countess to  desire   that a solemn requiem shall  without delay  be performed by this  reverend brotherhood to her departed Lord  I am still farther to  declare  that she reflects with confusion on the late disorder of her  mind  which had driven her young son from her arms  that she is  impatient to embrace him  that  at her request to Lord Raymond  he hath  sreely and fully pardoned the flight of this his attendant  Nothing  now remains  but that both return  and share in that general joy which  reigns in the castle         —The Abbot wondered  and hesitated  Oswald prepared to speak  but Grey  again prevented him —      To remove doubts  or scruples         said he  turning to Reginhald       let us produce the token of our truth and fairly delivered charge   Behold  Lord Abbot  this ancient ring  the well known signet of the  Countess  entrusted to us from her fair hand  By this she speaks her  pleasure  that young William be instantly delivered to our care  that   without delay  we may conduct him to her noble presence         The Abbot had listened with suspicion and distrust
