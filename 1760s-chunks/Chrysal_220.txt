war   This   is demonstration   this is conviction to him who dares open his   eyes to see it   judge now of our undertaking by this invariable   system  and show me one objection to it        This long dissertation was not delivered at one time   it was the   substance of many conversations  by which the Jesuit so wrought   upon his brother  that he resigned himself wholly to his disposal    and entered sincerely into his designs  The only objection he   made  and that was not urged against him  was  to being any way   concerned in the compendious warfare of the society  the prejudice   of education being still so strong with him  that he could not yet   abstract things so nicely as to consider assassination in any other   light than as a crime      I had been in this state of speculation about a week  for my   master never stirred out  as he made sickness hia excuse for quitting   the service  when his brother  having occasion for some money to   send to Lisbon on the grand design  the bag in which I was  was   ordered for that service  the brothers having joined their fortunes    as well as their endeavours  in the promotion of it  I now changed   my master again  and set out for Lisbon in the possession of one   of the society  who was to deliver us to a particular person there          CHAPTER XXDC     CHEYSAL PKOPOSES A POLITICAL SCHEME THAT WILL NEVEE TAXE   PLACE  TO SETTLE THE PEACE OF OBEMANY â€” A SHORT VIEW OF   THE WAR BETWEEN THE FKBNCH AND ENGLISH  WITH THE MOTIVES   OF THE FOEMBE FOE TEANSPBERING THE SEAT OF IT INTO GERMANY   â€” INSIDIOUS AMBITION MEETS A JTTST DISAPPOINTMENT     In so complicated an undertaking  there necessarily mxist be a   great number of engines at work  and in many different places    upon the regularity and agreement of whose motions depends the   success of the whole  The person by whom I was sent to Lisbon   was not to go directly thither  but to take a large circuit  and   call at several places on his way  to see that all moved in concert    and everything was properly prepared for the main action  that   precipitancy should not defeat the design a second time      It is not necessary to recount all the circumstances of this tour    which  for the most part  were no more than the common occurrences   upon such occasions  I shall therefore take notice only of such few    as  for their singularity and importance  may deserve attention    As to the secret motive of the journey  for that alleged was only to   inspect  as usual  into the private concerns of the order   it has been   already so well explained  that it is sufficient to say everything   exceeded expectation  and gave the strongest assurance of success      As the war had overspread all Germany  it was impossible for my   master to avoid falling in with some of the armies  which were then   in the field   but this gave him no concern   he was blessed with one   of those ready geniuses that can put on any appearance so naturally         ADVENTVBES OF A GUINEA 25      aa to deceive suspicion itself   besides  that he had passports  under   one character or another  from every power engaged in the war    The first event worth remark that occurred to us  for the nature of   war and its operations in general have been sufficiently explained   before  was in the army of the allies of the King of Bulgaria  into   which my master entered  in the character rf a Jewish asc nt  This   army was composed of the forces of several of the smaller German   states  who were hired by the English to defend their own liberties  a   smallnumber of Bulgarians  and a considerable body ofBnglish troops      You are surprised to hear that people should require to be paid   to fight for themselves in so interesting a cause   but so it is  and   so it will continue to be  while a number of little sovereigns assume   the state  and live in the luxury of the greatest kings   for  as their   own revenues are insufficient to support the expense  they will be   ready to sell themselves to the first that offers  for an immediate   supply  without looking forward to  or regarding the consequences   of such inconsiderate  such wretched venality  They have  indeed    this excuse  which the general depravity of mankind seems to justify   their alleging  that  as their ruin would involve greater
