your compassion  your generosity  and disinterested nobleness of mind  that I was once indebted for the greatest blessing of my life  To you I owe the vindicating of my suspected faith  and the being restored to the affection of my dear husband  For this goodness I have never ceased to bless and pray for you  and shall continue to do so while I live  But oh  Sir  while you have given me so much cause for gratitude and esteem  why will you leave one heart to sigh for your unkindness  a heart that admires  that loves  that adores you  a heart worthy of your acceptance  and which has a right to demand all your tenderness  Need I name the amiable possessor of this heart  I need not  there is but one woman in the world who owns this description  for her let me become an advocate  she has won me to her party  indeed  Sir  she  and she only  deserves your love  Her’s  I am sure  you have ever possessed unrivalled  though her youth  beauty  and charming accomplishments  must have made her the object of every one’s wishes who saw her  ’Tis above four years since you first won her virgin affections  What has been her portion since that fatal time  Tears  solitude  and unremitting anguish  How can a mind like yours  susceptible as it is of pity for the woes of others  condemn such a woman to perpetual sorrow  How can that generosity  which has been so active on other occasions  droop and languish where there is such a cause to call forth all its exertions   Do  Mr Faulkland  permit pity to plead in your bosom for the dear Miss Burchell  I should urge paternal affection too  but to the voice of nature you cannot be deaf  Your sweet little son calls upon you to do him and his mother justice  the injured lady herself implores your compassion  my mother  who equally admires and loves her  intreats you  I  whom you once esteemed  conjure you  the secret monitor in your own soul must join in our sollicitations  Why  then  why will you shut your ears against    the united voice of reason  of conscience  and of gratitude  You cannot  you will not do it  Miss Burchell’s merit and sufferings must be rewarded  and I shall bless Mr Faulkland as the guardian of the injured  the patron of the afflicted  the assertor of his own  as well as of my honour  This is the light  and this only  in which I shall rejoice to see him   Mr Faulkland’s Answer  You do well  Madam  you do well to anticipate my suit  and  with so much cruel eloquence  to bid me despair  Yes  I see Miss Burchell has won you to her party  but what have I done to merit such a malevolent fate  that you  you of all created beings  should become her advocate  I little thought Mrs Arnold would make such a barbarous use of her power  Tell me  thou dear tyrant  how have I deserved this  Would it not have been kinder to have said at once  Faulkland  do not hope  I never will be yours  I hate  I despise you  and leave you to your fate  Oh  no  you are artful in your cruelty  you would prevent even my wishes  and cut off my hopes in their blossom  before they dare to unfold themselves to you   But you have furnished me with weapons against yourself  and I will use them with as little mercy as you have shewn to me  If four years are past since I won Miss Burchell’s affections  is it not also as long that I have loved you with an ardor—Oh thou insensible  Were you not mine by your own consent  with your mother’s approbation  Was not the day  the hour fixed  that I was to have led you to the altar  Miss Burchell’s hopes were never raised to such a pitch as mine  when an avenging fiend snatched the promised blessing from my grasp  Think what were then my sufferings  I saw you afterwards in the arms of another  Miss Burchell never suffered such torture  Had I seen you happy  I might have been consoled  If Miss Burchell loved me as I have loved you  she would rejoice in the prospect of my felicity  I should have done so in your’s  Heaven is my witness  Had you been happy  I should not have thought myself miserable  though you were lost to my hopes   Why do you compel me to urge an ungrateful truth in regard to Miss Burchell  Madam  she has no claim to my vows  my gratitude  my compassion  she has an ample right to  and she has them  More might by this time have been her’s  if I had never    seen Mrs Arnold   Remember  I do not yet desire permission to throw myself at your feet  I revere you too much to make such a request  but do not banish me your presence  I cannot always be proof against such rigours  Indulge me at least in the hope that time
