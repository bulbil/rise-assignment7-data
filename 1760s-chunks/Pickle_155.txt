such precipitation  that the physician had almost dislocated his shoulder by running against  one side of the entry  Jolter  having pulled the door after him and  turned the key  betook himself to flight  roaring aloud for assistance   His colleague  seeing the door secured  valued himself upon his  resolution  and exhorted him to return  declaring that  for his own  part  he was more afraid of the madman s teeth than of his weapon  and  admonishing the governor to re enter and execute what they had left  undone   Go in   said he   without fear or apprehension  and if any  accident shall happen to you  either from his slaver or his sword   I will assist you with my advice  which from this station I can more  coolly and distinctly administer  than I should be able to supply if my  ideas were disturbed  or my attention engaged in any personal concern    Jolter  who could make no objection to the justness of the conclusion   frankly owned that he had no inclination to try the experiment   observing  that self preservation was the first law of nature  that his  connections with the unhappy lunatic were but slight  and that it could  not be reasonably expected that he would run such risks for his service  as were declined by one who had set out with him from England on the  footing of a companion  This insinuation introduced a dispute upon  the nature of benevolence  and the moral sense  which  the republican  argued  existed independent of any private consideration  and could  never be affected by any contingent circumstance of time and fortune   while the other  who abhorred his principles  asserted the duties and  excellence of private friendship with infinite rancour of altercation   During the hottest of the argument  they were joined by the Capuchin   who being astonished to see them thus virulently engaged at the door   and to hear the painter bellowing within the chamber  conjured them  in  the name of God  to tell him the cause of that confusion which had kept  the whole house in continual alarm during the best part of the night   and seemed to be the immediate work of the devil and his angels  When    6 22 15  3 45 PM   the governor gave him to understand that Pallet was visited with an evil  spirit  he muttered a prayer of St  Antonio de Padua  and undertook  to cure the painter  provided he could be secured so as that he might   without danger to himself  burn part of a certain relic under his nose   which he assured them was equal to the miraculous power of Eleazar s  ring  They expressed great curiosity to know what this treasure was  and  the priest was prevailed upon to tell them in confidence  that it was  a collection of the parings of the nails belonging to those two madmen   whom Jesus purged of the legion of devils that afterwards entered  the swine  So saying  he pulled from one of his pockets a small box   containing about an ounce of the parings of a horse s hoof  at sight of  which the governor could not help smiling  on account of the grossness  of the imposition  The doctor asked  with a supercilious smile  whether  those maniacs whom Jesus cured were of the sorrel complexion  or  dapple gray  for  from the texture of these parings  he could prove that  the original owners were of the quadruped order  and even distinguish  that their feet had been fortified with shoes of iron   The mendicant  who bore an inveterate grudge against this son of  Esculapius ever since he had made so free with the Catholic religion   replied  with great bitterness  that he was a wretch with whom no  Christian ought to communicate  that the vengeance of Heaven would one  day overtake him  on account of his profanity  and that his heart was  shod with a metal much harder than iron  which nothing but hell fire  would be able to melt   It was now broad day  and all the servants of the inn were afoot   Peregrine  seeing it would be impossible to obtain any sort of  indemnification for the time he had lost  and the perturbation of  his spirits hindering him from enjoying repose  which was moreover  obstructed by the noise of Pallet and his attendants  put on his clothes  at once  and  in exceeding ill humour  arrived at the spot where this  triumvirate stood debating about the means of overpowering the furious  painter  who still continued his song of oaths and execrations  and made  sundry efforts to break open the door  Chagrined as our hero was  he  could not help laughing when he heard how the patient had been treated   and his indignation changing into compassion  he called to him through  the keyhole  desiring to know the reason of his distracted behaviour   Pallet no sooner recognized his voice than  lowering his own to a  whimpering tone   My dear friend   said he   I have at
