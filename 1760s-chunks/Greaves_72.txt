in a postillion s leathern jerkin  covered with thin plates of tinned iron  His buckler was a potlid  his lance a hop pole shod with iron  and a basket hilt broadsword  like that of Hudibras  depended by a broad buff belt  that girded his middle  His feet were defended by jack boots  and his hands by the gloves of a trooper  Sir Launcelot would not lose time in examining particulars  as he perceived some mischief had been done  and that the enemy had rallied at a distance  he therefore commanded Crowe to follow him  and rode off with great expedition  but he did not perceive his squire was taken prisoner  nor did the captain recollect that his nephew  Tom Clarke  had been disabled and secured in the beginning of the fray  The truth is  the poor captain had been so belaboured about the pate  that it was a wonder he remembered his own name             CHAPTER SEVENTEEN  CONTAINING ADVENTURES OF CHIVALRY EQUALLY NEW AND SURPRISING       The knight Sir Launcelot  and the novice Crowe  retreated with equal order and expedition to the distance of half a league from the field of battle  where the former  halting  proposed to make a lodgment in a very decent house of entertainment  distinguished by the sign of St  George of Cappadocia encountering the dragon  an achievement in which temporal and spiritual chivalry were happily reconciled  Two such figures alighting at the inn gate did not pass through the yard unnoticed and unadmired by the guests and attendants  some of whom fairly took to their heels  on the supposition that these outlandish creatures were the avant couriers or heralds of a French invasion  The fears and doubts  however  of those who ventured to stay were soon dispelled  when our hero accosted them in the English tongue  and with the most courteous demeanour desired to be shown into an apartment   Had Captain Crowe been spokesman  perhaps their suspicions would not have so quickly subsided  for he was  in reality  a very extraordinary novice  not only in chivalry  but also in his external appearance  and particularly in those dialects of the English language which are used by the terrestrial animals of this kingdom  He desired the ostler to take his horse in tow  and bring him to his moorings in a safe riding  He ordered the waiter  who showed them into a parlour  to bear a hand  ship his oars  mind his helm  and bring alongside a short allowance of brandy or grog  that he might cant a slug into his bread room  for there was such a heaving and pitching  that he believed he should shift his ballast  The fellow understood no part of this address but the word brandy  at mention of which he disappeared  Then Crowe  throwing himself into an elbow chair   Stop my hawse holes   cried he   I can t think what s the matter  brother  but  egad  my head sings and simmers like a pot of chowder  My eyesight yaws to and again  d ye see  then there s such a walloping and whushing in my hold—smite me—Lord have mercy upon us  Here  you swab  ne er mind the glass  hand me the noggin    The latter part of this address was directed to the waiter  who had returned with a quartern of brandy  which Crowe  snatching eagerly  started into his bread room at one cant  Indeed  there was no time to be lost  inasmuch as he seemed to be on the verge of fainting away when he swallowed this cordial  by which he was instantaneously revived   He then desired the servant to unbuckle the straps of his helmet  but this was a task which the drawer could not perform  even though assisted with the good offices of Sir Launcelot  for the head and jaws were so much swelled with the discipline they had undergone  that the straps and buckles lay buried  as it were  in pits formed by the tumefaction of the adjacent parts   Fortunately for the novice  a neighbouring surgeon passed by the door on horseback  a circumstance which the waiter  who saw him from the window  no sooner disclosed  than the knight had recourse to his assistance  This practitioner having viewed the whole figure  and more particularly the head of Crowe  in silent wonder  proceeded to feel his pulse  and then declared  that as the inflammation was very great  and going on with violence to its acme  it would be necessary to begin with copious phlebotomy  and then to empty the intestinal canal  So saying  he began to strip the arm of the captain  who perceiving his aim   Avast  brother   cried he   you go the wrong way to work  you may as well rummage the afterhold when the damage is in the forecastle  I shall right again when my jaws are unhooped    With these words he drew a clasp knife from his pocket  and  advancing to a glass  applied it so vigorously to the leathern straps of his headpiece  that the gordian knot was cut  without any other damage to his face than a moderate scarification  which  added
