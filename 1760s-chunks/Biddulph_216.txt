I left you  I could be inattentive to your motions  I am not a madman  Bidulph  I must not be treated like one  I    do not think you one  answered your brother  but I know you are warm  and too fearless of danger   When the coach was ready  Mr Faulkland very willingly got into it with us  He spoke but little  and appeared very thoughtful during our journey   The coachman stopped at an inn  after we had driven about fifteen miles  to bate his horses for a while  He seemed startled at it  and said he would not alight  We told him there was no occasion  but your brother and I chose to go into the house  that he might not think we watched him  He seemed pleased at this  and smiled when we set forward again  but did not speak   When we arrived in London  Now  Sir  said I  we will  if you please  go directly to Mrs Arnold’s house  As I am sure your absenting yourself in the manner you did  exceedingly afflicted her  so am I certain your return will give her sincere joy  I am ready therefore to attend you immediately to her  but if I may advise you  I think it were better that I should first see and talk to her  It will be proper to prepare her  by giving her at least one night to reflect on the important event  which I expect will take place to morrow  Sir George  what are your sentiments  I am of your mind  replied your brother  I think my sister ought by all means to have so much time given her for recollection  If Faulkland has no objection to it  we will go to my friend’s house  where he was before  When you have seen my sister you may come to us there with her determination   I have submitted myself for the present  answered Mr Faulkland  to your guidance  To morrow remember I am to be at liberty  Bidulph  beware how you watch my motions again   Your brother then directed the coachman to his friend’s house  Mr Faulkland not opposing the motion  I went in for a few minutes merely to satisfy myself in what manner Mr Faulkland had escaped from thence in order to inform you   Mr Faulkland was very urgent with me to go to you  Keep me not long in suspence  Sir  said he  I may as well know my fate to night  as to morrow   I left him with a promise to return with your final answer  You know my sentiments  you know your brother’s  and it rests on you to pronounce sentence of life or death  for your answer imports no less  on a man who is worthy of the greatest queen in the universe  What do you say  Mrs Arnold  must Faulkland die   Heaven forbid  cried I  no  Sir  I should be inflexible indeed  if     after what you have told me  I were any longer to resist  I yield  Sir  to your request  to Mr Faulkland’s  and to my brother’s  and I will own at the same time that my heart strongly impels me to consent  Yet  my dear Sir  believe me I should have resisted that impulse  if I could hope that my refusal would not be followed by consequences too dreadful to be thought on  There is therefore no alternative  I must be the wife of Mr Faulkland   The sooner the affair is finished then the better  said he  Faulkland stands here on slippery ground  perhaps some of the Bond family may by this time be arrived in England  and in pursuit of him  therefore let your marriage be dispatched immediately  and send him away directly to Holland  I suppose when he has made sure of you  he may be prevailed on to go without you  Oh  Sir  said I  urge this request to him I beseech you  it is of the last importance to me that he should comply with it  and the only preliminary that I have now to make to our marriage  Yes  yes  answered my kinsman  I think we shall convince him of the necessity of this  I shall escort you to Holland myself  for I have business at Rotterdam  and I had thoughts of taking the voyage  if this occasion had not offered  We will but just stay to settle some affairs here  and observe what measures can be taken for his service  and then follow him  Take courage  my dear  continued he  seeing me look sad  all may come right again  I love out of the way adventures  and this I think is one  We will live like princes  let us go where we will  I only wish that your brother were against the match  that I might have the more pleasure in forwarding it  but I need not grudge him that once in his life he has shewn some tokens of generosity   I will return to Faulkland  I long to set his noble heart at ease  Strange perverse creatures your sex are  It amazes me that any thing could tempt you to
