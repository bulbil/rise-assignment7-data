  Unhappy man  How much I pity you  You know my principles  It is hard  acting as I have done  to be thus invited  Acquaint yourself with my whole conduct in this affair  from the Bishop  from Father Marescotti  from the General himself  so much always your friend  and once so little mine  What has influenced them  so much as you seem to think against their inclinations  cannot want its influence upon a mind so noble as that of the Count of Belvedere  But whatever be your resolutions upon the enquiries I wish you to make  I tell you before hand  that I never will meet you but as my friend   He turned from me with emotion  He walked about the room as a man irresolute  and at last  with a wildness in his air  approached me —I will go this instant  said he  to the family  I will see Father Marescotti  and the Bishop  and I will let them know my despair  And if I cannot have hope given me —O Chevalier  Page  135 once more I say  that Lady Clementina shall not be yours while I live   He looked round him  as if he would not have anybody hear what he was going to say  but me  tho  no one was near  and whispering  It is better  said he  to die by your hand  than—He stopt  and in disorder hurried from me  and was out of sight when I got down to the door   The Count  when he came up to me  left his valet below  who told Saunders that Lady Sforza had made his Lord a visit at Parma  and by something she related to him  had stimulated him to make this to me  He added  that he was very apprehensive of the humour he came in  and which he had held ever since he saw Lady Sforza   How  my dear Dr  Bartlett  do the rash escape as they do  when I who endeavour to avoid embarrassments  and am not ready either to give or take offence  am hardly able to extricate myself from one difficulty  but I find myself involved in another  What cannot a woman do  when she resolves to make mischief among friends  Lady Sforza is a highspirited and contriving woman  It is not for her interest that Clementina should marry at all  But yet  as the Count of Belvedere is a cool  a dispassionate man  and knows the views of that Lady  I cannot but wonder what those arts must be  by which she has been able to excite  in so calm a breast  a flame so vehement   I am now hastening to the palace of Porretta  my heart not a little affected with the apprehensions  given me by Camilla s account of her young Lady s solemn  yet active turn  on the expected visit  For does it not indicate an imagination too much raised for the occasion  important as that is   and that her disorder is far from subsiding   Page  136  LETTER XXIV  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Bologna  Sat  Evening   I Sit down  now  my dear and reverend friend  to write to you particulars which will surprise you  Clementina is the noblest woman on earth  What at last—But I find I must have a quieter heart  and fingers too  before I can proceed   I THINK I am a little less agitated than I was  The above few lines shall go  for they will express to you the emotions of my mind  when I attempted to write an account of what had then so newly passed   As soon as I entered the palace  Camilla met me  and conducted me to the Marchioness  The Marquis and the Bishop were with her  O Chevalier  said she  we have been greatly disturbed by a visit from the Count of Belvedere  Poor man —He says he waited on you at your lodgings   He did  I then  at the Bishop s request  told them all that had passed between us  except his last words  which implied  that it was better to die by the hand of another man  than by his own   They expressed their concern for him  and their apprehensions for me  but I found that his unexpected visit had not altered their purpose in my favour  They were convinced  they told him  that the restoration of their daughter s tranquillity of mind depended upon giving her entirely her own way  and not one word more of opposition or contradiction should she meet with from them   I have been hindered  said the Marchioness  by this unhappy man s visit  and his vehemence  which moved me to pity him  for I am afraid that he will be in our daughter s unhappy way  from watching in Page  137 person the humour of my child  which  two hours ago  Camilla told me  was very particular  I was going to her  when you came  but I will send for Camilla —She did   As soon as she saw me in the morning  continued the Marchioness  she apologized to me for sending Camilla to
