to any body  nor to any thing but God s grace and   their own labour  that they once lived in credit  that misfortunes might   befall any body  and that I could not bear they should be treated so   undeservedly       Then her ladyship said  Ay  she supposed my master s folly would make   us set up for a family  and that the heralds  office would shortly be   searched to make it out       Exactly my sister again  said he  So you could not please her any way       No  indeed  sir  When she commanded me to fill her a glass of wine    and would not let her woman do it  she asked  If I was above it  I then   said  If to attend your ladyship at table  or even kneel at your feet    was required of me  I would most gladly do it  were I only the person   you think me  But if it be to triumph over one  who has received honours   which she thinks require from her another part  that she may not   be utterly unworthy of them  I must say  I cannot do it  This quite   astonished her ladyship  and a little before  her kinsman brought me   the bottle and glass  and required me to fill it for my lady  at her   command  and called himself my deputy  And I said   Tis in a good hand    help my lady yourself  So  sir  added I  you see I could be a little   saucy upon occasion       You please me well  my Pamela  said he  This was quite right  But   proceed       Her ladyship said  She was astonished  adding  She supposed I would have   her look upon me as her brother s wife  And asked me  What  in the name   of impudence  possessed me  to dare to look upon myself as her sister    And I said  That was a question better became her most worthy brother to   answer  than me  And then I thought I should have had her ladyship upon   me  but her woman interposed       I afterwards told Mrs  Jewkes  at the window  that since I was hindered   from going to you  I believed it was best to let Robert go with the   chariot  and say  Lady Davers was come  and I could not leave her   ladyship  But this did not please  and I thought it would too  for she   said  No  no  he ll think I make the creature my companion  and know not   how to part with her       Exactly  said he  my sister again       And she said  I knew nothing what belonged to people of condition  how   should I   What shall I say  madam  said I  Nothing at all  answered   she  let him expect his dearest love  alluding to your kind epithet in   your letter  and be disappointed  it is but adding a few more hours   to this heavy absence  and every one will become a day in his amorous   account       So  to be short  I saw nothing was to be done  and I feared  sir  you   would wonder at my stay  and be angry  and I watched my opportunity    till my lady  who was walking about the room  was at the further end    and the parlour being a ground floor  in a manner  I jumped out at the   window  and ran for it       Her ladyship called after me  so did her woman  and I heard her say  I   flew like a bird  and she called two of her servants in sight to stop   me  but I said  Touch me at your peril  fellows  And Mr  Colbrand    having been planted at hand by Mrs  Jewkes   who was very good in the   whole affair  and incurred her ladyship s displeasure  once or twice  by   taking my part   seeing how I was used  put on a fierce look  cocked   his hat with one hand  and put t other on his sword  and said  he would   chine the man who offered to touch his lady  And so he ran alongside   of me  and could hardly keep pace with me   And here  my dear sir    concluded I  I am  at yours and the good company s service       They seemed highly pleased with my relation  and my master said  he was   glad Mrs  Jewkes behaved so well  as also Mr  Colbrand
