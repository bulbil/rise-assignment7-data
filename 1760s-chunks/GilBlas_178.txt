Lucinda quitted my presence in moody silence  It struck me that a remnant of reason still enlightened her  and that she would not obstinately persevere in requiring her daughter to be given up to her  How little did I know of my mother  One of my slaves said to me two days afterwards  Sir  take care of yourself  A captive belonging to Pegelin has just let me into a secret  of which you cannot too soon avail yourself  Your mother has changed her religion  and as a punishment upon you for having refused Beatrice to her wishes  it is her purpose to acquaint the bashaw with your flight  I could not for a moment doubt but what Lucinda was the woman to do just what my slave had said she would  The lady had given me manifold opportunities of studying her character  and it was sufficiently evident that by dint of playing bloody parts in tragedy  she had familiarized herself with the guilty scenes of real life  It would not in the least have gone against her nature to have got me burned alive  nor probably would she have been more affected by my exit after that fashion  than by the winding up of a dramatic tale   The warning of my slave  therefore  was not to be neglected  My embarkation was hastened on  I took some Turks on board  according to the practice of the Algerine corsairs when going on a piratical expedition  but I engaged no more than was necessary to blind the eyes of jealousy  and weighed anchor from the port as soon as possible  with all my slaves and my sister Beatrice  You will do right to suppose  that I did not forget  in that moment of anxiety  to pack up my whole stock of money and jewels  amounting probably to the worth of six thousand ducats  When we were fairly out at sea  we began by securing the Turks  They were easily mastered  as my slaves outnumbered them  We had so favourable a wind  that we made the coast of Italy in a very short time  Without let or hindrance  we got into the harbour of Leghorn  where I thought the whole city must have come out to see us land  The father of my slave Azarini  either accidentally or from curiosity  happened to be among the gazers  He looked with all his eyes at my captives  as they came ashore  but though his object was to discover his lost son among the number  it was with little hope of so fortunate a result  But how powerful is the plea of nature  What transports  expressed by mutual embraces  followed the recognition of a tie so close  but so painfully interrupted for a time   As soon as Azarini had acquainted his father who I was  and what brought me to Leghorn  the old man obliged me  as well as Beatrice  to accept of an apartment in his house  I shall pass over in silence the description of a thousand ceremonies  necessary to be gone through  in order to my return into the bosom of the church  suffice it to say  that I forswore Mahometanism with much more sincerity than I had pledged myself to it  After having entirely purged myself from my Algerine leaven  I sold my ship  and set all my slaves at liberty  As for the Turks  they were committed to prison at Leghorn  to be exchanged against Christians  I received kind attention in abundance from the Azarini family  indeed  the young man married my sister Beatrice  who  to speak the truth  was no bad match for him  being a gentleman s daughter  and inheriting the castle of Xerica  which my mother had taken care to let out to a rich tanner of Paterna  when she resolved upon her voyage to Sicily   From Leghorn  after having staid there some time  I departed for Florence  a town I had a strong desire to see  I did not go thither without letters of recommendation  Azarini the father had connections at the grand duke s court  and introduced me to them as a Spanish gentleman related to his family  I tacked don to my name  in honest rivalry of impudence with other low Spaniards  who take up that travelling title of honour without compunction  when far enough from home to set detection at defiance  Boldly then did I dub myself Don Raphael  and appeared at court with suitable splendour  on the strength of what I had brought from Algiers  to keep my nobility from starving  The high personages  to whom old Azarini had written in my favour  gave out in their circle that I was a person of quality  so that with this testimony  and a natural knack I had of giving myself airs  the deuce must have been in it if I could not have passed muster for a man of some consequence  I soon got to be hand in glove with the principal nobility  and they presented me to the grand duke  I had the good fortune to make myself agreeable  It then became an object with me to pay court to that prince  and to study his humour  I sucked in with greedy ear all that his most experienced courtiers said about him  and by their conversation fathomed all his peculiarities  Among other things
