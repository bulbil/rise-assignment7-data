sad relation  for my   pen and ink  in my now doubly secured closet  are all I have to employ   myself with  and indeed I have been so weak  that  till yesterday   evening  I have not been able to hold a pen       I took with me but one shift  besides what I had on  and two   handkerchiefs  and two caps  which my pocket held   for it was not for   me to encumber myself   and all my stock of money  which was but five   or six shillings  to set out for I knew not where  and got out of the   window  not without some difficulty  sticking a little at my shoulders   and hips  but I was resolved to get out  if possible  And it was farther   from the leads than I thought  and I was afraid I had sprained my ancle    and when I had dropt from the leads to the ground  it was still farther   off  but I did pretty well there  at least  I got no hurt to hinder me   from pursuing my intentions  So being now on the ground  I hid my papers   under a rose bush  and covered them with mould  and there they still   lie  as I hope  Then I hied away to the pond  The clock struck twelve    just as I got out  and it was a dark misty night  and very cold  but I   felt it not then       When I came to the pond side  I flung in my upper coat  as I had   designed  and my neckhandkerchief  and a round eared cap  with a knot    and then with great speed ran to the door  and took the key out of my   pocket  my poor heart beating all the time against my bosom  as if it   would have forced its way through it  and beat it well might  for I   then  too late  found  that I was most miserably disappointed  for the   wicked woman had taken off that lock  and put another on  so that my   key would not open it  I tried  and tried  and feeling about  I found   a padlock besides  on another part of the door  O then how my heart   sunk   I dropt down with grief and confusion  unable to stir or support   myself  for a while  But my fears awakening my resolution  and knowing   that my attempt would be as terrible for me as any other danger I could   then encounter  I clambered up upon the ledges of the door  and upon the   lock  which was a great wooden one  and reached the top of the door with   my hands  then  little thinking I could climb so well  I made shift to   lay hold on the top of the wall with my hands  but  alas for me  nothing   but ill luck   no escape for poor Pamela  The wall being old  the bricks   I held by gave way  just as I was taking a spring to get up  and down   came I  and received such a blow upon my head  with one of the bricks    that it quite stunned me  and I broke my shins and my ancle besides  and   beat off the heel of one of my shoes       In this dreadful way  flat upon the ground  lay poor I  for I believe   five or six minutes  and then trying to get up  I sunk down again two or   three times  and my left hip and shoulder were very stiff  and full of   pain  with bruises  and  besides  my head bled  and ached grievously   with the blow I had with the brick  Yet these hurts I valued not  but   crept a good way upon my feet and hands  in search of a ladder  I just   recollected to have seen against the wall two days before  on which the   gardener was nailing a nectarine branch that was loosened from the   wall  but no ladder could I find  and the wall was very high  What now    thought I  must become of the miserable Pamela   Then I began to wish   myself most heartily again in my closet  and to repent of my attempt    which I now censured as rash  because it did not succeed       God forgive me  but a sad thought came just then into my head   I   tremble to think of it  Indeed my apprehensions of the usage I should   meet with  had like to have made me miserable for ever  O my dear  dear   parents  forgive your poor child  but being then quite desperate  I   crept along  till
