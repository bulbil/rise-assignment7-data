Pipes  because I know you ll do for him without any recommendation  the  fellow has sailed with me in many a hard gale  and I ll warrant him as  stout a seaman as ever set face to the weather  But I hope you ll take  care of the rest of my crew  and not disrate them after I am dead     6 22 15  3 45 PM   in favour of new followers  As for that young woman  Ned Gauntlet s  daughter  I m informed as how she s an excellent wench  and has a  respect for you  whereby  if you run her on board in an unlawful way  I  leave my curse upon you  and trust you will never prosper in the voyage  of life  But I believe you are more of an honest man  than to behave  so much like a pirate  I beg  of all love  you wool take care of your  constitution  and beware of running foul of harlots  who are no better  than so many mermaids  that sit upon rocks in the sea  and hang out a  fair face for the destruction of passengers  thof I must say  for my own  part  I never met with any of those sweet singers  and yet I have gone  to sea for the space of thirty years  But howsomever  steer your course  clear of all such brimstone b  s  Shun going to law  as you would shun  the devil  and look upon all attorneys as devouring sharks  or ravenous  fish of prey  As soon as the breath is out of my body  let minute guns  be fired  till I am safe under ground  I would also be buried in the  red jacket I had on when I boarded and took the Renummy  Let my pistols   cutlass  and pocket compass be laid in the coffin along with me  Let  me be carried to the grave by my own men  rigged in the black caps and  white shirts which my barge s crew were wont to wear  and they must keep  a good look out  that none of your pilfering rascallions may come and  heave me up again  for the lucre of what they can get  until the carcase  is belayed by a tombstone  As for the motto  or what you call it  I  leave that to you and Mr  Jolter  who are scholars  but I do desire   that it may not be engraved in the Greek or Latin lingos  and much less  in the French  which I abominate  but in plain English  that  when the  angel comes to pipe all hands  at the great day  he may know that I am a  British man  and speak to me in my mother tongue  And now I have no more  to say  but God in heaven have mercy upon my soul  and send you all fair  weather  wheresoever you are bound    So saying  he regarded every individual around him with a look of  complacency  and closing his eye  composed himself to rest  while the  whole audience  Pipes himself not excepted  were melted with sorrow  and  Mrs  Trunnion consented to quit the room  that she might not be exposed  to the unspeakable anguish of seeing him expire   His last moments  however  were not so near as they imagined  He began  to doze  and enjoyed small intervals of ease  till next day in the  afternoon  during which remissions  he was heard to pour forth many  pious ejaculations  expressing his hope  that  for all the heavy cargo  of his sins  he should be able to surmount the puttock shrouds of  despair  and get aloft to the cross trees of God s good favour  At last  his voice sunk so low as not to be distinguished  and  having lain about  an hour  almost without any perceptible signs of life  he gave up the  ghost with a groan which announced his decease   Julia was no sooner certified of this melancholy event  than she ran to  her aunt s chamber  weeping aloud  and immediately a very decent concert  was performed by the good widow and her attendants  Peregrine and  Hatchway retired till the corpse should be laid out  and Pipes having  surveyed the body  with a face of rueful attention    Well fare thy  soul  old Hawser Trunnion   said he   man and boy I have known thee  these five and thirty years  and sure a truer heart never broke biscuit   Many a hard gale hast thou weathered  but now thy spells are all over   and thy hull fairly laid up  A better commander I d never desire to  serve  and who knows but I may help to set up thy standing rigging in  another world      6 22 15  3 45 PM   All the servants of the house were affected with the loss of their old  master  and the poor people in the neighbourhood assembled at the gate   and  by
