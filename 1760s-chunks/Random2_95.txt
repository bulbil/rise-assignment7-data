absent or present  Upon my sincerity  Mr  Random  I have been so much pestered and besieged by these children of clamour  that my life became a burden to me   CHAP  LXII    The continuation and conclusion of Mr  Melopoyn s story   I Made shift  notwithstanding  to maintain myself till the beginning of next winter  when I renewed my addresses to my friend Mr  Supple  and was most graciously received —   I have been thinking of your affair Mr  Melopoyn   said he  and am determined to shew how far I have your interest at heart  by introducing you to a young nobleman of my acquaintance  who is remarkable for his fine taste in dramatic writings  and is  beside  a man of such influence  that if once he should approve your play  his patronage will support it against all the efforts of envy and ignorance  For I do assure you  that merit alone will not bring success —I have already spoken of your performance to Lord Rattle  and if you will call at my house  in a day or two  you shall have a letter of introduction to his lordship  —  I was sensibly touched with this mark of Mr  Supple s   287 friendship  and looking upon my affair as already done  went home and imparted my good fortune to my landlord  who  to render my appearance more acceptable to my patron  procured a suit of new cloaths for me on his own credit     Not to trouble you with idle particulars  I carried my tragedy to his lordship s lodgings  and sent it up along with Mr  Supple s letter  by one of his servants  who desired me  by his lord s order  to return in a week —I did so  and was admitted to his lordship  who received me very courteously  told me he had perused my play  which he thought  on the whole  was the best coup d essai he had ever seen  but that he had marked some places in the margin  which he imagined might be altered for the better —I was transported with this reception  and promised  with many acknowledgments of his lordship s generosity  to be governed solely by his advice and direction —   Well then  said he  write another fair copy with the alterations I have proposed  and bring it to me as soon as possible  for I am resolved to have it brought on the stage this winter  —  You may be sure I set about this task with alacrity  and although I found his lordship s remarks much more numerous  and of less importance than I expected  I thought it was not my interest to dispute upon trifles with my patron  therefore new modelled it according to his desire  in less than a month     When I waited upon him with the manuscript  I found one of the actors at breakfast with his lordship  who immediately introduced him to my acquaintance  and desired him to read a scene of my play —This he performed very much to my satisfaction  with regard to emphasis and pronounciation    288 but he signified his disgust at several words in every   which I presuming to defend  Lord Rattle told me  with a peremptory look  I must not pretend to dispute with him  who had been a player these twenty years  and understood the oeconomy of the stage better than any man living  I was forced to submit  and his lordship proposed the same actor should read the whole play  in the evening  before some gentlemen of his acquaintance  whom he would convene at his lodgings for that purpose   I was present at the reading  and I protest to you  my dear friend  I never underwent such a severe trial in the whole course of my life  as at that juncture  for although the player might be a very honest man and a good performer  he was excessively illiterate and assuming  and made a thousand frivolous objections  which I was not permitted to answer  However  the piece was very much applauded on the whole  the gentlemen present  who I understood were men of fortune  promised to countenance and support it as much as they could  and Lord Rattle assuring me  that he would act the part of a careful nurse to it  desired me to carry it home and alter it immediately according to their remarks —I was fain to acquiesce in his determination  and fulfilled his injunctions with all the expedition in my power  but before I could present the new copy  my good friend Mr  Supple had disposed of his property and patent to one Mr  Brayer  so that fresh interest was to be made with the new manager —This task Lord Rattle undertook  having some acquaintance with him  and recommended my performance so strongly  that it was received     289 I looked upon myself now  as upon the eve of reaping the fruits of all my labour  I waited a few days in expectation of its being put into rehearsal  and wondering at the delay  applied to my worthy patron  who excused Mr  Brayer on account of the multiplicity of business in which he was involved  and bid me
