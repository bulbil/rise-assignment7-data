how have I regretted the passion I suffered myself to be betray d into  by the foolish violence of O Hara and Salmonet  in my own house  when it would have better become me  to have had them shewed out of it by my servants   Page  9 And yet  were I to receive affronts with tameness from those haughty spirits  who think themselves of a rank superior to me  and from men of the sword  I  who make it a principle not to draw mine but in my own defence  should be subjected to insults  that would be continually involving me in the difficulties I am solicitous to avoid   I attended the General and his Lady to Jeronymo  The generous youth forgot his own weak state  in the hopes he flatter d himself with  of a happy result to his sister s malady  from the change of symptoms which had already taken place  tho  violent hysterics disorder d and shook her before wounded frame   The General said  that if she could overcome this first shock  perhaps it was the best method that could have been taken to rouse her out of that stupidity and inattention which had been for some weeks so disturbing to them all   There were no hopes of seeing the unhappy Lady again that evening  The General would have accompanied me to the Casino  a   saying  that we might both be diverted by an hour passed there  But I excused myself  My heart was full of anxiety  for the welfare of a brother and sister  both so much endeared to me by their calamities  And I retired to my lodgings   Page  10  LETTER II  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Bologna  Tuesday  May 16 27   I Had a very restless night  and found myself so much indisposed in the morning  with a feverish disorder  that I thought of contenting myself with sending to know how the brother and sister rested  and of staying within  at least till the afternoon  to give my hurried spirits some little repose  But my messenger returned with a request from the Marchioness  to see me presently   I obeyed  Clementina had asked  Whether she had really seen me  or had only dreamed so  They took this for a favourable indication  and therefore sent the above request   I met the General in Jeronymo s apartment  He took notice that I was not very well  Mr  Lowther proposed to bleed me  I consented  I afterwards saw my friend s wounds dressed  The three surgeons pronounced appearances not to be unfavourable   We all then retired into Mr  Lowther s apartment  The Bishop introduced to us two of the faculty  The prescriptions of the English physicians were considered  and some of the methods approved  and agreed to be pursued   Clementina  when I came  was retired to her own apartment with Camilla  Her terrors on Laurana s cruelty had again got possession of her imagination  and they thought it not adviseable that I should be admitted into her presence  till the hurries she was in  on that account  had subsided   But by this time  being a little more composed  her mother led her into her dressing room  The Geneneral  and his Lady were both present  and  by their desire  I was asked to walk in   Page  11 Clementina  when I entered  was sitting close to Camilla  her head leaning on her bosom  silent  and  seemingly  thoughtful  I bowed to her  to the two Marchionesses  to the General  She raised her head  and looked towards me  and clasping her arms about Camilla s neck  hid her face in her bosom for a few moments  then  looking as bashful towards me  she loosed her hands  stood up  and looked steadily at me  and at Camilla  by turns  several times  as irresolute  At last  quitting Camilla  she moved towards me with a stealing pace  but when near me  turning short  hurried to her mother  and putting one arm about her neck  the other held up  she looked at me  as if she were doubtful whom she saw  She seemed to whisper to her mother  but not to be understood  She went then by her sister in law  who took her hand as she passed her  with both hers  and kissed it  and coming to the General  who sat still nearer me  and who had desired me to attend to her motions  she stood by him  and looked at me with a sweet irresolution   As she had stolen such advances towards me  I could no longer restrain myself  I arose  and  taking her hand  Behold the man  said I  with a bent knee  whom once you honour d with the name of tutor  your English tutor —Know you not the grateful Grandison  whom all your family have honoured with their regard   O yes —Yes —I think I do —They rejoiced to hear her speak —But where have you been all this time   In England  madam—But returned  lately returned  to visit you and your Jeronymo   Jeronymo  one
