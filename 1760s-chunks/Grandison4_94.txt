to love Sir Charles Grandison  Those who do  give honour to themselves    234 if their eyes stop not at person  his having so many advantages  For the same reason  I make no apologies  and never did  for praising my brother  as any other lover of him might do   Let me know every thing how and about your fellows  too  Ah  Harriet  you make not the use of power that I would have done in your situation  I was half sorry when my hurrying brother made me dismiss Sir Walter  and yet  to have but two danglers after one  are poor doings for a fine Lady  Poorer still  to have but one   Here s a Letter as long as my arm  Adieu  I was loth to come to the name  But difer it ever so long  I must subscribe  at last   CHARLOTTE G   LETTER XXXIV  Miss JERVOIS  To Miss BYRON  a    Monday  May 1   O MY dearest  my honoured Miss Byron  how you have shamed your Emily by sending a Letter to her  such a sweet Letter too  before I have paid my duty to you  in a Letter of thanks for all your love to me  and for all your kind instructions  But I began once  twice  and thrice  and wrote a great deal each time  but could not please myself  You  madam  are such a writer  and I am such a poor thing at my pen —But I know you will accept the heart  And so my very dissidence shews pride  since it cannot be expected from me to be a fine writer  And yet this very Letter  I foresee  will be the worse for my diffidence  and not the better  For I don t like this beginning  neither —But come  it shall go  Am I not used to   235 your goodness  And do you not bid me prattle to you  in my Letters  as I used to do in your dressingroom  O what sweet advice have you  and do you return for my silly prate  And so I will begin   And was you grieved at parting with your Emily on Saturday morning  I am sure I was very much concerned at parting with you  I could not help crying all the way to town  and Lady G  shed tears as well as I  and so did Lady L  several times  and said  You were the loveliest  best young Lady in the world  And we all praised likewise your aunt  your cousin Lucy  and young Mr  Selby  How good are all your relations  They must be good  And Lord L  and Lord G  for men  were as much concerned as we  at parting with you  Mr  Reeves was so dull all the way  poor Mr  Reeves  he was very dull  And Mr  Beauchamp  he praised you to the very skies  and in such a pretty manner too  Next to my guardian  I think Mr  Beauchamp is a very agreeable man  I fansy these noble sisters  if the truth were known  don t like him so well as their brother does  Perhaps that may be the reason  out of jealousy  as I may say  if there be any thing in my observation  But they are vastly civil to him  nevertheless▪ yet they never praise him when his back is turned  as they do others  who can t say half the good things that he says   Well  but enough of Mr  Beauchamp  My guardian  my gracious  my 〈◊〉 my indulgent guardian  who  that thinks of him  can praise any body else   O madam  Where is he now  God protect and guide my guardian  where ever he goes  This is my prayer  first and last  and I can t tell how often in the day  I look for him in every place I have seen him in  And pray tell me  madam  Did not you do so when he had left us    and when I can t find him  I do so sigh —What a pleasure  yet what a pain  is there in sighing  when I think of him  Yet I know I   236 am an innocent girl  And this I am sure of  that I wish him to be the husband of but one woman in the whole world  and that is you  But then my next wish is—You know what—Ah my Miss Byron  you must let me live with you and my guardian  if you should ever be Lady Grandison   But here  madam  are sad doings sometimes  between Lord and Lady G  I am very angry at her often in my heart  yet I cannot help laughing  nowand then  at her out of the way sayings  Is not her character a very new one  Or are there more such young wives  I could not do as she does  were I to be queen of the globe  Every body blames her  She will make my Lord not love her at last  Don t you think so  And then
