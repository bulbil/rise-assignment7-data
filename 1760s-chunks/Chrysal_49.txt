 Though it is but just to comfort you  with an   account of the return which he met with for his kindness  which   was no less than a round robin   to the Lords of the Admiralty  for   his refusing to let them go ashore  and spend their money  in the   same manner  next time they came in          And such a return may their officiousness always meet with      replied the other   for meddling with matters which do not   concern them   cannot they be content with their own large gains        The   name that seamen call their complaints against their captain     it is taken from the manner of their signing them  which is in a circle    BO that there is no knowing who signs first          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 35     without interfering to hinder others   But I see how it is   the   spirit of patriotism has got into them too  forsooth  and they must   be showing their regard to the public  What an evil effect will   the bad example of one man have   There was a time when they   would not have dared to do this  To say the truth  my friend    this ia not the first alarm we have received on this head   though   what to do about it we cannot tell  indeed  I believe we must   e en mend our hands  which  as half a loaf is better than   no bread  hard as it is upon us  ia preferable to losing the   trade quite  in the meantime  I am obhged to you and your   captain for your friendship  and hope you will accept of thia   return        They then proceeded to settle their accounts  as soon as which   were finished  my master took his leave  and went on with hia   business  which was exactly of the same nature  and concluded in   the same way  with every person whom they dealt with      As soon as these transactions were ended  his next care was to   pass his captain s accounts  which he also succeeded in  without   any difficulty  though for this he was more indebted to the chance   of a lucky minute than he had apprehended  For they were no   sooner closed  than an affair happened that gave a tvu n  entirely   new  to the whole course of business  in that channel      When the accounts of the next captain came to be examined    the clerk  glancing his eye cursorily over them  in the usual   manner  on looking at the amount   There must be some mistake   here    said hew       How so  sir     said the captain  who was present    let me look   at the account  if you please  No  sir  there ia no mistake  I   believe  Pray  where do you mean          In the casting it up  sir   answered the clerk   you see  the   amount is made to be but eight hundred pounds          Nor ahould it be more    rephed the captain    I summed up the   account  myself  and these figures are of my own writing          How can that possibly be  sir     returned the clerk in a   surprise    but eight himdred pounds for aU the repairs  wear and   tear  of a man of war  on such a station  for four years  I   suppose then  sir  the ship had a thorough repair going out  and   wants the like now  To be sure it can be done better and   cheaper here  than abroad  and therefore you were in the right to   bring her home to get it          Not at all  sir    added the captain    that was not the case     she had no thorough repair going out  and is come home in better   order than she went  as this return of the officers of the yard   shows          Good God   sir  how did you manage   1       To the best of my judgment  sir  I laid out nothing but what   I thought necessary  and I charged nothing but what I laid out     I mean not to arraign the conduct of others  I only speak for   myself  In these cases I look upon a man as a steward to
