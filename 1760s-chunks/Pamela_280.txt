have   done   I need not say  said he  how well I love her  but she must not   intrude upon me at such times as these   I had intended  as soon as I   could have quelled  by my reason  the tumults you had caused by your   violence  to have come in  and taken such a leave of you both  as might   become a husband  and a brother  But she has  unbidden  broke in upon   me  and must take the consequence of a passion  which  when raised  is   as uncontrollable as your own       Said she  Did I not love you so well  as sister never loved a brother  I   should not have given you all this trouble  And did I not  said he  love   you better than you are resolved to deserve  I should be indifferent to   all you say  But this last instance  after the duelling story  which   you would not have mentioned  had you not known it is always matter   of concern for me to think upon   of poor Sally Godfrey  is a piece of   spite and meanness  that I can renounce you my blood for       Well  said she  I am convinced it was wrong  I am ashamed of it myself     Twas poor   twas mean   twas unworthy of your sister  And  tis for this   reason I stoop to follow you  to beg your pardon  and even to procure   one for my advocate  who I thought had some interest in you  if I might   have believed your own professions to her  which now I shall begin to   think made purposely to insult me       I care not what you think   After the meanness you have been guilty of    I can only look upon you with pity  For  indeed  you have fallen very   low with me        Tis plain I have  said she  But I ll begone   And so  brother  let me   call you for this once  God bless you  And Pamela  said her ladyship    God bless you  and kissed me  and wept       I durst say no more  And my lady turning from him  he said  Your sex   is the d   l  how strangely can you discompose  calm  and turn  as   you please  us poor weathercocks of men  Your last kind blessing to my   Pamela I cannot stand  Kiss but each other again  And then he took both   our hands  and joined them  and my lady saluting me again  with tears on   both sides  he put his kind arms about each of our waists  and saluted   us with great affection  saying  Now  God bless you both  the two   dearest creatures I have in the world       Well  said she  you will quite forget my fault about Miss  He stopt her   before she could speak the name  and said  For ever forget it   And    Pamela  I ll forgive you too  if you don t again make my displeasure so   light a thing to you  as you did just now       Said my lady  She did not make your displeasure a light thing to her    but the heavier it was  the higher compliment she made me  that she   would bear it all  rather than not see you and me reconciled  No matter   for that  said he  It was either an absence of thought  or a slight   by implication  at least  that my niceness could not bear from her   tenderness  For looked it not presuming  that she could stand my   displeasure  or was sure of making her terms when she pleased  Which    fond as I am of her  I assure her  will not be always  in wilful faults    in her power       Nay  said my lady  I can tell you  Pamela  you have a gentleman here   in my brother  and you may expect such treatment from him  as that   character  and his known good sense and breeding  will always oblige him   to shew  But if you offend  the Lord have mercy upon you   You see how   it is by poor me   And yet I never knew him to forgive so soon       I am sure  said I  I will take care as much as I can  for I have been   frightened out of my wits  and had offended  before I knew where I was       So happily did this storm blow over  and my lady was quite subdued
