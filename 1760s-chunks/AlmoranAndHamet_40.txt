bewildered in a labyrinth of doubt and wonder  and alike dreading the   consequence of what she heard  whether it was false or true  was yet   impatient to confute or confirm it  and as soon as she had recovered her   speech  urged him for some token of the prodigy he asserted  which he   might easily have given  by relating any of the incidents which   themselves only could know  But just at this moment  ALMORAN  having at   last disengaged himself from Osmyn  by whom he had been long detained    resumed his own figure  and while the eyes of ALMEIDA were fixed upon   HAMET  his powers were suddenly taken from him  and restored in an   instant  and she beheld the features of ALMORAN vanish  and gazed with   astonishment upon his own   Thy features change   said she   and thou   indeed art HAMET    The sudden trance   said he   has restored me to   myself  and from my wrongs where shalt thou be hidden   This reproach   was more than she could sustain  but he caught her as she was falling    and supported her in his arms  This incident renewed in a moment all the   tenderness of his love  while he beheld her distress  and pressed her by   the embrace that sustained her to his bosom  he forgot every injury   which he supposed she had done him  and perceived her recover with a   pleasure  that for a moment suspended the sense of his misfortunes       Her first reflection was upon the snare  in which she had been taken    and her first sensation was joy that she had escaped  she saw at once   the whole complication of events that had deceived and distressed her    and nothing more was now necessary  than to explain them to HAMET    which  however  she could not do  without discovering the insincerity of   her answers to the enquiries which he had made  while she mistook him   for his brother   If in my heart   says she   thou hast found any   virtue  let it incline thee to pity the vice that is mingled with it  by   the vice I have been ensnared  but I have been delivered by the virtue    ALMORAN  for now I know that it was not thee  ALMORAN  when he possessed   thy form  was with me  he prophaned thy love  by attempts to supplant my   virtue  I resisted his importunity  and escaped perdition  but the guilt   of ALMORAN drew my resentment upon HAMET  I thought the vices which    under thy form  I discovered in his bosom  were thine  and in the   anguish of grief  indignation  and disappointment  my heart renounced   thee  yet  as I could not give thee up to death  I could not discover to   ALMORAN the attempt which I imputed to thee  when you questioned me    therefore  as ALMORAN  I was betrayed to dissimulation  by the   tenderness which still melted my heart for HAMET    I believe thee     said HAMET  catching her in a transport to his breast   I love thee for   thy virtue  and may the pure and exalted beings  who are superior to the   passions that now throb in my heart  forgive me  if I love thee also for   thy fault  Yet  let the danger to which it betrayed thee  teach us still   to walk in the strait path  and commit the keeping of our peace to the   Almighty  for he that wanders in the maze of falsehood  shall pass by   the good that he would meet  and shall meet the evil that he would shun    I also was tempted  but I was strengthened to resist  if I had used the   power  which I derived from the arts that have been practised against   me  to return evil for evil  if I had not disdained a secret and   unavowed revenge  and the unhallowed pleasures of a brutal appetite  I   might have possessed thee in the form of ALMORAN  and have wronged   irreparably myself and thee  for how could I have been admitted  as   HAMET  to the beauties which I had enjoyed as ALMORAN  and how couldst   thou have given  to ALMORAN  what in reality had been appropriated by   HAMET                 CHAP  XVII          But while ALMEIDA and HAMET were thus congratulating each other upon the   evils which they had escaped  they were threatened by others  which    however obvious  they had overlooked       ALMORAN  who was now exulting in the prospect of success that had   exceeded his hopes  and who supposed the possession
