secured to us by repeated treaties  But the ministry of England were too much infected with the more domestic terror  to take sufficient precautions to guard this place  though they had early notice of the enemies intentions  Instead therefore of sufficiently guarding the island with a proper garrison in St  Philip s castle  the citadel  or of detaching a squadron that  in all respects  should be superior to the French fleet in the Mediterranean  they only sent ten men of war upon this service  poorly manned  and indifferently provided  under the command of Admiral Byng  whose character in the navy was by no means established  and orders to reinforce the garrison of St  Philip s with one battalion from Gibraltar  with which command  however  the governor of that place thought it unsafe to comply   The Admiral sent upon this service reinforced his fleet by a detachment of men at Gibraltar  and  sailing towards Minorca  was joined in the way by another man of war  from whom he learned that Minorca was actually besieged  and the French fleet destined to support the operations by land  He soon knew the reality of this information  when  approaching the island  he saw the French banners displayed  and the batteries opened upon the castle of St  Philip s    208 which still displayed the English flag  The appearance of the French fleet  soon after  still more strongly engaged his attention  he drew up his ships in line of battle  and determined to act upon the defensive  Byng had been formerly thought to be eminent in naval operations  to which he was early bred  but he had hitherto exhibited no proofs of courage  Men are generally most apt to pride themselves upon those talents for which they are most praised  and this was the case with this unfortunate commander  he sacrificed his reputation for courage  to the hopes of being applauded for his conduct  The French fleet advanced  a part of the English fleet engaged  the Admiral still kept aloof  giving prudent reasons for his remissness in coming to action  till  at length  the French Admiral  taking the advantage of the Englishman s hesitation  sailed slowly away to join the van of his fleet  which had been already discomfited  The English  for a while  continued the pursuit  but the opportunity of coming to a close engagement was now lost  and never presented itself again   Byng was still resolved to act with his usual caution  he called a council of war  wherein it was represented that he was much inferior to the enemy in ships and men  that the relief of Minorca was impracticable  and that it was most adviseable to sail back to Gibraltar  which might require immediate protection  This representation was almost unanimously agreed to  and put accordingly in execution  His pusillanimous conduct  however  soon reached his native country  where it excited almost a phrenzy of resentment  The ministry were also thought to fan the flame  which served to turn the public eye from their own misconduct in sending so weak an armament  Byng  in the mean time  remained at Gibraltar  no way suspecting the storm that was gathering over his head  but talked  and wrote  even as if he expected the thanks of his King  and the   209 applause of his countrymen  but he was soon awaked from this dream of infatuation  by a letter from the ministry  giving him notice  that he was recalled  and another soon after  by which directions were given that he should be sent home under arrest  and  upon his arrival in England  he was committed close prisoner in Greenwich hospital  Numberless arts were used to inflame the populace against this unhappy man  and  long before his tryal  several addresses were sent up  from different counties  crying out for justice against the delinquent  The industry of his friends  however  was not remiss upon this occasion  they expostulated with the multitude  and attempted to divert the whole of universal hatred upon the ministry  who  at worst  only deserved a share  But  soon after the news of the surrender of fort St  Philip to the French inflamed the people beyond all measure  This fortress had been reckoned  next to Gibraltar  the strongest in Europe  the works having been planned by the celebrated Vauban  and  both from the nature of the soil  which was one solid rock  and the peculiarity of the situation  it was thought almost impregnable  In order to make themselves masters of this important fortress  the French  under the command of the Duke de Richelieu  had landed near twenty thousand men  which  by continual assault  and having  at length  gained an outwork  made themselves masters of the place  The English governor  General Blakeney  however  had very honourable terms of capitulation  and marched out with all the ensigns of war  Yet  perhaps  in truth  the harder the conditions a garrison is obliged to accept  the more honourable to the commander  as they denote his extremity in being reduced to accept of them   The English now saw themselves every where defeated  in America their armies were cut in pieces  in Europe their garrisons taken  the people
