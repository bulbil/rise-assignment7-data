Aix la Chapelle  seemed doubtful  till  at length  the affairs of the English seemed to gain the ascendancy by the courage and conduct of Mr  Clive  a gentleman who first entered into the service of the company as a clerk  but soon shewed his talents more adapted for war  By his vigilance and courage the province of Arcot was cleared of the enemy  the French General taken prisoner  and the Nabob  whom the English supported  reinstated in the government of which he had been formerly deprived  The French  discouraged by these misfortunes  and sensible of their own inferiority in this part of the world  sent over a commissary with a view to restore peace  and a convention between the two companies was accordingly concluded  importing  that the territories taken on either side since the last peace should be mutually restored  that the   224 Nabobs advanced by the influence of either party  should be acknowledged by both  and that  for the future  neither should interfere in the differences between the Princes of the country  This cessation  however  was not of long duration  compacts made between trading companies can never be of long continuance  when there is a prospect of advantage to either side from their infraction  In a few months after both sides renewed their operations  no longer as auxiliaries but as rivals in arms and commerce  What the motives to this infraction were are not sufficiently known  wherever there is trade there must be a degree of avarice  and that is a passion too often the parent of injustice and cruelty  Certain it is that the Viceroy of Bengal  from motives of personal resentment  declared against the English  and  levying a numerous army  laid siege to Calcutta  one of their forts  which was in no situation to endure the attack even of barbarians  It was taken by assault  and the garrison  to the number of one hundred and forty six persons  were crowded into a narrow prison called the Black Hole  about eighteen feet square  without any entrance for air  except by two iron windows to the west  which  by no means  afforded a sufficient quantity for the supporting life in such numbers  In such a burning climate it is terrible to conceive the situation of wretches thus immured and suffocating each other  Their first effort  upon finding the danger of their horrid confinement  was to break open the door  but this being impossible  they endeavoured to excite the compassion or the avidity of the guard  by offering him a large sum of money for his assistance  in removing them to separate prisons  with which he was not able to comply  as the Viceroy was asleep  and no person durst disturb him  They were now therefore left without all hopes of relief to perish  and the whole prison was filled with groans  shrieks  contest and confusion    225 This turbulence soon after sunk into languor and despair  and towards morning all was horrid silence and desolation  Of an hundred and forty six who had entered alive  but twenty three only survived  and of these several died by putrid fevers upon their being set free   The reduction of this important fortress served to interrupt the prosperous successes of the English company  but the fortune of Mr  Clive still vanquished every obstacle  a fleet  under the command of Admiral Watson  conspired with his efforts  and helped him in his victories  Angria  a piratical Prince  who had long annoyed the company s settlements in the neighbourhood of Bombay  first felt the weight of our naval power  This Prince maintained a large number of gallies  with which he would attack the largest ships  when he found a proper opportunity  and  by this means  he exacted a tribute from every European power for a permission to trade  To subdue such a dangerous enemy to commerce  Admiral Watson and Colonel Clive sailed into his harbour of Geriah  though they sustained a warm fire as they passed  and soon threw all his fleet and his fort into flames  The next day the fort surrendered at discretion  where the conquerors found a large quantity of warlike stores  and effects to the value of one hundred and thirty thousand pounds   From this conquest Mr  Clive went on to take revenge for the treatment of the English at Calcutta  and about the beginning of December arrived at Balasore  in the kingdom of Bengal  There was but small opposition made to the fleet  or the army  till they came before Calcutta  the scene of former cruelty  but as soon as the Admiral  with two ships  arrived before the town  he received a furious fire from all the batteries  This  however  he returned with still greater execution  and  in less than two hours  the place was abandoned  Thus  by the conquest   226 of this and the former fortress  the English became possessed of the two strongest settlements on the banks of the Ganges  Soon after these successes  Hughly  a city of great trade was reduced with as little difficulty  and all the Viceroy of Bengal s store houses and granaries were destroyed  This barbarous Prince  incensed at these losses  assembled an army of ten thousand horse  and fifteen thousand foot  fully resolved
