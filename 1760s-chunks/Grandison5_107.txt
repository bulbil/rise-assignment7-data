 is hoped for  as a return for the Present of which I entreat your acceptance  But when I can assure you  that your advice will probably be of great service to me  in the conduct of my future life  as I have no doubt it will  from the calm effects that the Letter  which has now a place in my bosom  has already produced there  I am ready to flatter myself  that a wish so ardent  and so justifiable  will be granted to the repeated request of  OLIVIA   Page  267  Continuation of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON s Letter  No  XL  Begun p  251    OLIVIA  you see  my dear Dr  Bartlett  concludes her Letter  with a desire of corresponding with me  As she has put it  I cannot refuse her request  How happy should I think myself  if I could be a means effectually to serve her in the conduct of her future life   I have written to her  that I shall think an intercourse by Letters an honour done me  if she will allow me to treat her with the freedom and the singleness of heart of an affectionate brother   As to her particular recommendation of a third person  I tell her  that must be the subject of the future correspondence to which she is pleased to invite me   Olivia may be in earnest  in her warm commendations of a Lady  of whose excellencies nobody can write or speak with indifference  But I have no doubt  that she is very earnest to know my sentiments on the subject  But what must be the mind of the bachelor widower  as she calls me  if already I can enter into the subject with any body  with Lady Olivia especially  The most sensible  I will not say subtle creature on earth  is certainly a woman in Love  What can escape her penetration  What can bound her curiosity   I tell her  that I can neither decline nor accept of her present  till I see the contents of the cabinets she is pleased to mention  It will give me pain  I say  to refuse any favour from Lady Olivia  by which she intends to shew her esteem of me  But favours of so high a price  will  and ought to  give scruples to one who would not be thought ungenerous   I had always admired  I tell her  her collection of medals  But they are a family collection  of two or three generations  And I should not allow myself to accept of such a treasure  unless I could have an opportunity Page  268 given me to shew  if not my merit  my gratitude  and that I saw no possibility of being blessed with  in any manner  that could make the acceptance tolerably easy to myself  I cannot  my dear Dr  Bartlett  receive from this munificent Lady a present that is of such high intrinsic worth  Had she offered me any thing that would have had its value from the giver  or to the receiver  for its own sake  and not equally to any body else  for instance  had she desired me to accept of her picture  since the original could not me mine  I would not have refused it  tho  it had been incircled with jewels of price  But  circumstanced as this unhappy Lady and I are  could I have asked her for a favour of that nature   I think  I have broken thro  one delicacy  in consenting to correspond with this Lady  She should not have asked it  I never knew a pain of so particular a nature as this Lady  a not ungenerous  tho  a rash one  has given me  My very heart recoils  Dr  Bartlett  at the thought of a denial of marriage to a woman expecting the offer  whom delicacy has not quite forsaken   But a word or two more on this subject of Presents  When the whole family at Bologna were so earnestly solicitous to shew their gratitude to me by some permanent token  I had once the thought of asking for their Clementina s picture in miniature  But as I was never to think of her as mine  and as  probably  my picture  if but for politeness sake  would have been asked for in exchange  I was afraid of cherishing  by that means  in her mind  the tender ideas of our past friendship  and thereby of making the work of her parents difficult  And do they not the more excusably hope to succeed in their views  as they think their success will be a means to secure health of mind to their child  But if they visit me in England  I will then request the pictures of the whole family  in one large piece  for the principal ornament of Grandison hall   Page  269 By what Olivia says  of designs on my liberty  I believe she means to include the attempt made upon me at Florence  which I hinted at in my last  and supposed to come from that quarter  What she would have done with me  had the attempt succeeded  I cannot imagine  I should not have wished to have been the subject of so romantic
