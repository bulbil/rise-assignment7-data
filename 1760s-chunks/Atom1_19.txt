a person to represent him at his execution  and be crucified in his stead   This was a stratagem very well calculated for the meridian of the Japonese populace  and it would have satisfied them intirely  had not their fears been concerned  But the Chinese had for some time been threatening an invasion  the terror of which kept the people of Japan in perpetual agitation and disquiet  They neglected their business  and ran about in distraction  inquiring news  listening to reports  staring  whispering  whimpering  clamouring  neglecting their food and renouncing their repose  The Dairo  who believed the Tartars of Yesso  from whom he himself was descended  had more valour  and skill and honesty  than was possessed by    102 any other nation on earth  took a large body of them into his pay  and brought them over to the island of Niphon  for the defence of his Japonese dominions  The truth is  he had a strong predilection for that people  he had been nursed among them  and sucked it from the nipple  His father had succeeded as heir to a paultry farm in that country  and there he fitted up a cabin  which he preferred to all the palaces of Meaco and Jeddo  The son received the first rudiments of his education among these Tartars  whose country had given birth to his progenitor Bupo  He therefore loved their country  he admired their manners  because they were conformable to his own  and he was in particular captivated by the taste they shewed in trimming and curling their muftachios   In full belief that the Yessites stood as high in the estimation of his Japonese    103 subjects  as in his own  he imported a body of them into Niphon  where  at first  they were received as saviours and protectors  but the apprehension of danger no sooner vanished  than they were exposed to a thousand insults and mortifications arising from the natural prejudice to foreigners  which prevails among the people of Japan  They were reviled  calumniated  and maltreated in every different form  by every class of people  and when the severe season set in  the Japonese refused shelter from the extremities of the weather  to those very auxiliaries they had hired to defend every thing that was dear to them  from the swords of an enemy whom they themselves durst not look in the face  In vain Fika kaka employed a double band of artists to tickle their noses  They shut their eyes  indeed  as usual  but their eyes no sooner closed  than their mouths opened  and    104 out flew the tropes and figures of obloquy and execration  They exclaimed  that they had not bought  but caught the Tartar  that they had hired the wolves to guard the sheep  that they were simple beasts who could not defend themselves from the dog with their own horns  but what could be expected from a flock which was led by such a pusillanimous bellweather —In a word  the Yessites were sent home in disgrace  but the serment did not subside  and the conduct of the administration was summoned before the venerable tribunal of the populace   There was one Taycho  who had raised himself to great consideration in this self constituted college of the mob  He was distinguished by a loud voice  an unabashed countenance  a fluency of abuse  and an intrepidity of opposition to the measures of the Cuboy  who was far from being a favourite with the plebeians     105 Orator Taycho s eloquence was admirably suited to his audience  he roared  and he brayed  and he bellowed against the m—r  he threw out personal sarcasms against the Dairo himself  He inveighed against his partial attachment to the land of Yesso  which he had more than once manifested to the detriment of Japan  he inflamed the national prejudice against foreigners  and as he professed an inviolable zeal for the commons of Japan  he became the first demagogue of the empire  The truth is  he generally happened to be on the right side  The partiality of the Dairo  the errors  absurdities  and corruption of the ministry  presented such a palpable mark as could not be missed by the arrows of his declamation  This Cerberus had been silenced more than once with a sop  but whether his appetite was not satisfied to the full  or he was still stimulated by the turbulence of    106 his disposition  which would not allow him to rest  he began to shake his chains anew  and open in the old cry  which was a species of musick to the mob  as agreeable as the sound of a bagpipe to a mountaineer of North Britain  or the strum strum to the swarthy natives of Angola  It was a strain which had the wonderful effect of effacing from the memory of his hearers  every idea of his former sickleness and apostacy   In order to weaken the effect of orator Taycho s harangues  the Cuboy had found means to intrude upon the councils of the mob  a native of Ximo called Mura clami  who had acquired some reputation for eloquence  as an advocate in the tribunals of Japan  He certainly possessed an uncommon share of penetration  with a silver tone of voice  and a great magazines of words and phrases
