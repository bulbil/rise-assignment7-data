  minion  which shall not pass away   Again Isaiah     Behold  a   virgin shall conceive and bear a son  For unto us a child is born    unto us a son is given  and the government shall be upon his   shoulder  and his name shall be called  Wonderful  Counsellor    The Mighty God  The Everlasting Father  The Prince of Peace    Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end    upon the throne of David  and upon his kingdom to order it  and   to establish it  with judgment and with justice  from henceforth   even for ever       Secondly  With respect to his character of rejection and suffering      Who hath believed our report  and to whom is the arm of the   Lord revealed   He is despised and rejected of men  a man of   sorrows and acquainted with grief  and we hid as it were our   faces from him   he was despised  and we esteemed him not  He   was oppressed and he was afflicted   he is brought as a lamb to the   slaughter  and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb  so opened   he not his mouth  He was taken from prison and from judgment     and who shall declare his generation   for he was cut off  out of   the land of the living   for the transgression of my people was he   stricken  And he made his grave with the wicked  and with the   rich in his death   Isaiah liii  David too says  Dogs have         334 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      compassed me  the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me   they   pierced my hands and my feet  They part my garments among   them  and cast lots for my vesture  But a bone of him shall not   be broken  They shall look on him whom they pierced       Thirdly  With respect to his being a willing offering for sin    Isaiah says in the same chapter    Surely he hath borne our griefs    and carried our sorrows   yet we did esteem him stricken  smitten   of God  and afflicted  But he was wounded for our transgressions    he was bruised for our iniquities   the chastisement of our peace   was upon him  and with his stripes we are healed  All we like   sheep have gone astray  we have turned every one to his own   way  and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all     Jeremiah too     Here Mr  Fenton was interrupted  His man Frank entered   booted  and all bespattered with dirt  and  having whispered   something in his master s ear  Mr  Fenton turned aside his head   to hide his concern from Harry  and stepping to his closet locked   himself in          CHAPTER     BUT it may now be thought full time to return to the head   branch of this noble family      Nearly nine years had now elapsed since the earl and his lady   had seen or heard of their Harry  except by two or three anony    mous notes in a year  giving a short account of his health and   accomplishments   insomuch that time and long absence had  in   a measure  worn him from the regrets of the family   excepting   his brother Richard  on whom Harry s generosity  in taking his   quarrel upon himself  had left an affecting and indelible impression      Lord Clinton was indeed sweetly dispositioned by nature  and of   an aspect and person extremely elegant  and  as he had tutors   in all branches in which he chose to be instructed  he learned   sufficient  by way of amusement  to render him one of the most   accomplished youths in the nation  He was also naturally un    assuming  and modestly disposed   but the unremitted adulation   of domestics and dependants  with the complimentary artillery   of all the neighbours and visitants  could not fail of some im    pression  at least so far as to make it evident that he was conscious   of his condescension when he became familiar with you      He was  however  easy to all who applied to him for any favour     exceeding charitable to the poor   and particularly fond of our   Harry s foster mother  and kind to her for Harry s sake      He was turned of nineteen years of age when his parents  for   his amusement and the finishing of his education  resolved to   accompany him on a tour to France
