in the house of peers  was thereby rendered incapable of serving his friends at present  but he undertook to make me acquainted with Earl Strutwell  who was hand and glove with a certain person that ruled the roast  This offer I embraced with many acknowledgments  and plied him so closely  in spite of a thousand evasions  that he found himself under a necessity of keeping his word  and actually carried me to the levee of this great man  where he left me in a crowd of fellow dependants  and was ushered to a particular closet audience  from whence in a few minutes  he returned with his lordship  who took me by the hand  assured me he would do me all the service he could  and desired to see me often —I was charmed with my reception  and although   159 I had heard that a courtier s promise is not to be depended upon  I thought I discovered so much sweetness of temper and candour in this Earl s countenance  that I did not doubt of profiting by his protection —I resolved therefore  to avail myself of his permission  and waited on him next audience day  when I was favoured with a particular smile  squeeze of the hand  and a whisper  signifying that he wanted half an hour s conversation with me tête a tête  when he should be disengaged  and for that purpose desired me to come and drink a dish of chocolate with him tomorrow morning —This invitation  which did not a little flatter my vanity and expectation  I took care to observe  and went to his lordship s house at the time appointed  Having rapped at the gate  the porter unbolted and kept it half open  placing himself in the gap  like soldiers in a breach  to dispute my passage —I demanded to know if his lord was stirring —He answered with a surly aspect     No  —   At what hour does he commonly rise   said I  —   Sometimes sooner  sometimes later  said he  closing the door upon me by degrees   —  I then told him I was come by his lordship s own appointment  to which this Cerberus replied    I have received no orders about the matter    and was upon the point of shutting me out  when I recollected myself all of a sudden  and slipping a crown into his hand  begged as a favour that he would enquire and let me know whether or not the Earl was up  The grim janitor relented at the touch of my money  which he took with all the indifference of a tax gatherer  and shewed me into a parlour  where  he said  I might amuse myself till such time as his lord   160 should be awake —I had not sat ten minutes in this place  when a footman entered  and without speaking  stared at me  I interpreted this piece of his behaviour into   Pray  Sir  what is your business    and asked the same question I had put to the porter  when I accosted him first  The lacquey made the same reply  and disappeared before I could get any further intelligence —In a little time he returned  on pretence of poking the fire  and looked at me again with great earnestness  upon which I began to perceive his meaning  and tipping him with half a crown  desired he would be so good as to fall upon some method of letting the Earl know that I was in the house —He made a low bow  said    Yes  Sir    and vanished —This bounty was not thrown away  for in an instant he came back  and conducted me to a chamber  where I was received with great kindness and familiarity by his lordship  whom I found just risen  in his morning gown and slippers —After breakfast  he entered into a particular conversation with me about my travels  the remarks I had made abroad  and examined me to the full extent of my understanding —My answers seemed to please him very much  he frequently squeezed my hand  and looking at me with a singular complacency in his countenance  bid me depend upon his good offices with the ministry in my behalf    Young men of your qualifications  said he  ought to be cherished by every administration—For my own part  I see so little merit in the world  that I have laid it down as a maxim  to encourage the least appearance of genius and virtue  to the utmost of my power—You have a great deal of both  and will not fail of making a figure one day  if I   161 am not mistaken  but you must lay your account with mounting by gradual steps to the summit of your fortune —Rome was not built in a day —As you understand the languages perfectly well  how would you like to cross the sea  as secretary to an embassy  —  I assured his lordship  with great eagerness  that nothing could be more agreeable to my inclination  Upon which he bid me make myself easy  my business was done  for he had a place of that kind in his view —This piece of generosity affected me so much  that I was unable for some time to express my
