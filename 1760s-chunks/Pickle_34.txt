stood hallooing    Here s your kinsman  Perry  belike you won t come and bid him  welcome     Lord  Mr  Trunnion   said she   why will you continually  harass me in this manner with your impertinent intrusion    I harrow  you   replied the commodore    sblood  I believe your upper works are  damaged  I only came to inform you that here was your cousin  whom you  have not seen these four long years  and I ll be d  d if there is such  another of his age within the king s dominions  d ye see  either for  make or mettle  he s a credit to the name  d ye see  but  d   my eyes   I ll say no more of the matter  if you come  you may  if you won t   you may let it alone     Well  I won t come  then   answered his  yoke fellow   for I am at present more agreeably employed     Oho   you are  I believe so too   cried the commodore  making wry faces and  mimicking the action of dram drinking  Then  addressing himself to  Hatchway   Prithee  Jack   said he   go and try thy skill on that  stubborn hulk  if anybody can bring her about  I know you wool    The lieutenant accordingly  taking his station at the door  conveyed  his persuasion in these words   What  won t you turn out and hail little  Perry  It will do your heart good to see such a handsome young dog  I m  sure he is the very moral of you  and as like as if he had been spit out  of your own mouth  as the saying is  do show a little respect for your  kinsman  can t you   To this remonstrance she replied  in a mild tone of  voice   Dear Mr  Hatchway  you are always teasing one in such a manner   sure I am  nobody can tax me with unkindness  or want of natural  affection   So saying  she opened the door  and  advancing to the hall  where her nephew stood  received him very graciously and observed that  he was the very image of her papa   In the afternoon he was conducted by the commodore to the house of his  parents  and  strange to tell  no sooner was he presented to his mother   than her countenance changed  she eyed him with tokens of affliction and  surprise  and  bursting into tears  exclaimed her child was dead  and  this was no other than an impostor whom they had brought to defraud her  sorrow  Trunnion was confounded at this unaccountable passion  which had  no other foundation than caprice and whim  and Gamaliel himself was so  disconcerted and unsettled in his own belief  which began to waver   that he knew not how to behave towards the boy  whom his godfather  immediately carried back to the garrison  swearing all the way that  Perry should never cross their threshold again with his good will  Nay   so much was he incensed at this unnatural and absurd renunciation  that  he refused to carry on any further correspondence with Pickle  until he  was appeased by his solicitations and submission  and Peregrine owned as  his son and heir  But this acknowledgment was made without the privity    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of his wife  whose vicious aversion he was obliged  in appearance  to  adopt  Thus exiled from his father s house  the young gentleman was left  entirely to the disposal of the commodore  whose affection for him daily  increased  insomuch that he could scarcely prevail upon himself to  part with him  when his education absolutely required that he should be  otherwise disposed of   In all probability  this extraordinary attachment was  if not produced   at least riveted by that peculiar turn in Peregrine s imagination  which  we have already observed  and which  during his residence in the castle   appeared in sundry stratagems he practised upon his uncle and aunt   under the auspices of Mr  Hatchway who assisted him in the contrivance  and execution of all his schemes  Nor was Pipes exempted from a share in  their undertakings  for  being a trusty fellow  not without dexterity  in some cases  and altogether resigned to their will  they found him a  serviceable instrument for their purpose  and used him accordingly   The first sample of their art was exhibited upon Mrs  Trunnion  They  terrified that good lady with strange noises when she retired to her  devotion  Pipes was a natural genius in the composition of discords  he  could imitate the sound produced by the winding of a jack  the filing  of a saw  and the swinging of a malefactor hanging in chains  he could  counterfeit the braying of an ass  the screeching of a night owl  the  caterwauling of cats  the howling of
