 Why gave it a distinction  both in qualities and plumage  to the different sexes of the feathered race  Why in the courage of the male and female animals —The surly bull  the meek  the beneficent  cow  for one instance   We looked upon one another   There are exceptions to general rules  proceeded he    361 Mrs  Shirley surpasses all the men I ever knew  in wisdom—Mrs  Selby and Lady G —  What of us  brother  What of us—to the advantage of your argument   Heroic Charlotte —You are both very happily married—The men the women  the women the men  you can mutually assist and improve each other  But still—  Your servant  brother  interrupted I —Your servant  Sir Charles  said Mrs  Selby—And I say  Your servant too  said Mr  Selby   Who sees not that my sister Charlotte is ready to disclaim the competition in fact  tho  not in words  Can there be characters more odious than those of a masculine woman  and an effeminate man  What are the distinguishing characteristics of the two Sexes  And whence this odiousness  There are  indeed  men  whose minds  if I may be allowed the expression  seem to be cast in a Female mould  whence the fops  foplings  and pretty fellows  who buz about your Sex at public places  women  whose minds seem to be cast in a masculine one  whence your Barnevelts  my dear  and most of the women who  at such places  give the men stare for stare  swing their arms  look jolly  and those married women who are so kind as to take the reins out of their husbands hands  in order to save the honest men trouble   Your servant  Sir—Your servant  Sir—And some of them looked as if they had said  You cannot mean me  I hope  and those who spoke not  bowed and smiled thanks for his compliment to one fourth of the Sex   My Lord insultingly rubbed his hands for joy  Mr  Selby crowed  the other men slily smiled  tho  they were afraid of giving a more open approbation   O my Sister  said I  taking Harriet s hand  we women are mere Nothings—We are nothing at all     362 How  my Charlotte  Make you no difference between being Every thing and Nothing   Were it not  my dear Ladies  proceeded he  for male protectors  to what insults  to what outrages  would not your Sex be subject  Pardon me  my dearest Love  if I strengthen my argument by your excellencies  bowing to his Harriet  Is not the dear creature our good Mrs  Shirley s own Daughter  All the feminine graces are here  She is  in my notion  what all women should be—But wants she not a protector  Even a dream  a resverie—  O Sir  spare me  spare me  sweetly blushing  said the lovely Harriet  I own I should have made a very silly  a very pusilanimous man  It is not long since  you know  Lady G  that I brought this very argument in favour of—  Hush  Harriet  You will give up the Female cause   That is not fair  Charlotte  rejoined my brother  you should not intercept the convictions of an ingenuous mind—But I will spare my Harriet  if she will endeavour  for her own sake  to let nothing disturb her for the future but realities  and not any of these long  if they are inevitable ones   But pray  Sir  said I  proceed in your argument  if you have any more to say   O Charlotte  I have enough to say  to silence all your opposition  were I to give this subject its due weight  But we are only  for pleasantry sake  skimming over the surface of the argument  Weaker powers are given generally for weaker purposes  in the oeconomy of Providence  I  for my part  however  disapprove not of our venerable Mrs  Shirley s observation  That we are apt to consider the Sex too much as a species apart  Yet it is my opinion that both God and Nature have designed a very app•rent difference in the minds of both  as well as in the peculiar   363 beauties of their persons  Were it not so  their offices would be confounded  and the women would not perhaps so readily submit to those domestic ones in which it is their province to shine  and the men would be allotted the distaff  or the needle  and you yourselves  Ladies  would be the first to despise such  I  for my part  would only contend  that we men should have power and right given us to protect and serve your Sex  that we should purchase and build for them  travel and toil for them  run through  at the call of Providence  or of our King and Country  dangers and difficulties  and  at last  lay all our trophies  all our acquirements  at your feet  enough rewarded in the conscience of duty done  and your favourable acceptance   We were all of us again his humble servants  It was
