and equal in   trade  and I was wearied with congratulations on my being one of   the principal merchants in London before I had attained my   twentieth year      The obligations and advantages which this good man thus de    lighted to heap upon me  incited me to double application and   sagacity  and all the eyes of Argus were opened within me for   superintending and guarding the interests of my patron      I have often thought it somewhat romantic  that I should win   both my wives by a matter of adventure   so that their partiality   in my favour ought  perhaps  to be ascribed to a sentiment of   gratitude  rather than to any liking which they might take to   my person      On a day in summer I rode to Barnet to settle accounts with Mr    Fradgil  a correspondent of my master s  who was said to be in    disposed at his country seat  As I approached the town  I observed   an elderly gentlewoman walking leisurely towards me  attended by   an orderly train of young maidens  I observed  at the same time    two men in glittering apparel who hastily followed  and coming   quickly up  put all the females to a stand  and caused them to   gather in a group as for mutual defence  One of the men  however    no way daunted by the opposition of so numerous a company  rudely   caught one of the elder misses in his arms  and repeatedly kissed   her  Meanwhile the young lady shrieked and cried aloud for help     when  riding suddenly up  I struck the ruffian to the ground with   the heavy end of my whip  His companion hereupon drew his   sword and turned upon me   but  pushing my horse at him  I cast   hi also to the earth   then alighting  I broke their swords  and    leaving my gallants in a plight not suddenly to be dreaded  I   led my horse by the bridle till I saw my fair wards all safe to their   dwelling      Some months after this incident Mr  Golding called me aside    Harry  says he  my daughter is now drawing to woman s estate  and   should learn something more substantial than needle work  and   dancing  and harpsichords  and Frenchified phrases  I therefore   propose to take her home  where  by the help of our cook and   housekeeper  she may be taught how to make a Sunday s pudding   and to superintend a family      I regularly go to see her once in every month  accompanied by   some male or female acquaintance  but never called you to be of   the party  as we could not so conveniently be both from home      My child  though a plain girl  is very dutiful and good natured    Her fortune  as you are sensible  will entitle her to the first lord   of the land   yet I know not how it is  I would rather that my   girl should be happy than great  I do not wish to have her a   fine titled dame  I would rather  I say  see her married to some   honest and tender hearted man  whose love might induce him to   domesticate with her  and to live peaceably and pleasingly within   his family circle  than to see her mated with a prince of the blood      Now  Harry  as this affair of all affairs sits nearest at my heart    it is greatly in your power to oblige me beyond expression  On   my daughter s coming home  I conclude we shall be beset by a         184 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      number of courtiers   such an Argo  when freighted with such a   fleece  will unquestionably be held in chase by many a pirate    Wherefore  my son  I would have you keep a sharp and inquisitive   eye about you  and to take good note of the manners and dis    positions of such suitors as my daughter shall appear to regard  as   also to inquire minutely into their circumstances and characters    Your vigilance and penetration may save us from ruin  Should   my child be made unhappy  your friend must be most miserable    But I depend  my dear Harry  that while I live you will prove a   kind brother to her  and that you will prove a father to her in   case of my mortality  Here the good man  no longer able to   restrain his passion  put his handkerchief to his eyes and quitted   the chamber       Within a few days Mr  Golding set out  accompanied by a num    ber
