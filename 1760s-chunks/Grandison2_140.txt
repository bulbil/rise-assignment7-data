 on some fresh enormities committed by Lorimer  to the tribunal which the Christians have there  consisting of eight venerable men chosen out of the eight quarters of the city  to determine causes among Christians  and they taking cognizance of the facts  the wicked woman suborned wretches to accuse the Doctor to the Cadi  who is the Turkish judge of the place  as a dangerous and disaffected person  and the Cadi being  as it was supposed  corrupted by presents  got the Vayvode  or Governor  to interfere  and the Doctor was seized  and thrown into prison  His Christian friends in the place were forbidden to interpose in his favour  and pen and ink  and all access to him were prohibited        The vile woman  having concerted measures with the persons she had suborned  for continuing the Doctor in his severe confinement  set out with her paramour for Venice  and there they rioted as before        Mr  Beauchamp  a young man of learning and fine parts  happened to make an acquaintance with Mr  Grandison in the island of Candia  where they met as countrymen  which  from a sympathy of minds  grew immediately into an intimacy that will hardly ever end  This young gentleman  in the course of his travels  visiting Athens  about this time  was informed of the Doctor s misfortune  by one of the eight Christians  who constituted the tribunal above mentioned  and who was an affectionate friend of the Doctor  tho  forbidden to busy himself in his cause  And Mr  Beauchamp  who had heard Mr  Grandison speak of the Doctor with an uncommon affection  knowing that Mr  Grandison was then at Constantinople  dispatched a man on purpose  to acquaint him with the affair  and with all the particulars he could get of the case  authenticated as much as the nature of the thing would admit       351   Mr  Grandison was equally grieved and astonished at the information  He instantly applied to the English embassador at the Porte  as also to the French minister there  with whom he had made an acquaintance  They to the Grand Vizir  And an order was issued for setting the Doctor at liberty  Mr  Grandison  in order to urge the dispatch of the Chiaux  who carried it  accompanied him  and arrived at Athens  just as the Vayvode had determined to get rid of the whole affair in a private manner  the Doctor s finances being exhausted  by the bowstring  The danger endeared the Doctor to Mr  Grandison  a relief so seasonable endeared Mr  Grandison to the Doctor  to them both Mr  Beauchamp  who would not stir from Athens  till he had seen him delivered  having busied himself in the interim  in the best manner he could  tho  he was obliged to use caution and secrecy  to do him service  and to suspend the fatal blow        Here was a cement to a friendship  that had been begun between the young gentlemen from likeness of manners  between them and the Doctor  whom they have had the goodness ever since to regard  as their father  And to this day it is one of the Doctor s delights to write to his worthy son Beauchamp all that he can come at  relating to the life and actions of a man  whom the one regards as an example  the other as an honour to the human race        It was some time before the Doctor knew for certain  that the ungracious Lorimer had been consenting to the shocking treatment he had met with  for the wretches whom the vile woman had suborned  had made their escape from Athens before the arrival of Mr  Grandison and the Chiaux  the flagitious youth had written to his father  in terms of the deepest sorrow  an account of what had befallen his governor  and his father had taken the best measures that could be fallen upon at so great a distance  for   352 the Doctor s succour and liberty  But in all probability  he would have been lost before those measures could have taken effect        Lorimer s father  little thinking that his son had connived at the plot formed against his governor  besought him  when he had obtained his liberty  not to leave his son to his own devices  The Doctor  as little thinking then  that Lorimer had been capable of a baseness so very villainous  in compassion both to father and son  went to Venice  and got him out of the hands of the vile women  and then to Rome  But there  the unhappy wretch continuing his profligate courses  became at last a sacrifice to his dissoluteness  and his death was a deliverance to his Family  to the Doctor  and to the Earth        On his death bed he confessed the plot  which the infamous courtezan had meditated against the Doctor at Venice  as well as his connivance at that which she had carried into execution at Athens  He died in horror not to be described  begging for longer life  and promising reformation on that condition  The manner
