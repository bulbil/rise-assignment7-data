more of this  Let us join company  And  taking my hand  with the goodness of a real mother  yet her brow a little overclouded  she made apologies to them for taking me aside  and said  she could trust to their prudence  she was sure  as they must needs guess at her view  and therefore she offered not to put a limit to their conjectures  since denial or evasion would but  in this case  as it generally did  defeat its own end  and strengthen what it aimed to weaken   Is there no obtaining such a mother  thought I  without marrying Lord D  —And should I refuse to see him  if an interview is desired  especially when Lady L  has seemed to encourage the countess to think  that somebody has no thoughts—Indeed I don t desire that that somebody should—If—I don t know what I was going to add to that if  But pray tell my grandmamma  that I hope her Harriet will never give her cause to lament her being entangled in an hopeless passion  No  indeed   But  my Lucy  one silly question to you  who have been a little entangled  and more happily disentangled—I catch my self of late in saying him and he  and   82 writing to you somebody  and such like words  instead of saying and writing boldly  as I used to do  Sir Charles  and Sir Charles Grandison  which would sound more respectfully  and yet am sure I want not respect  What is the meaning of this —Is it a sign—Ah  my Lucy  you said you would keep a sharp look out  and did I not say I would upon myself  Surely I said truth  Surely you will think so  when you see such little silly things as these do not escape me  But when you think me too trifling  my dear  don t expose me  Don t read it out in the venerable circle  That to some may appear very weak and silly  which by others will be thought excusable  because natural  It would be wrong  as I yet never did it  to write separately to you  And what have I in my heart  were it to be laid open to all the world  that I should be—afraid—I was going to write  that I should be ashamed of  But I think I am a little ashamed  at times  for all that—Ah  Lucy  don t add  and so I ought   Lady D  repeated her desire of being acquainted with Sir Charles  She has no daughter  So it was purely for the sake of his great character  She heard  she said  that he was the politest of brothers  That was always a good sign with her  He gives you  Miss Grandison  I am told  a great deal of his company   Miss Grandison said  that their brother  she believed  was one of the busiest men in the kingdom  who was not engaged in public affairs  and yet the most of a family man  I endeavour  said she  to make home delightful to him  I never break in upon him when he is in his study  without leave  Indeed I seldom ask it  for when he is inclin d to give me his company  he sends his compliments to me  and requests  as a favour from me  what I am always ready to consider as one done to me  And I see he loves me  He is not uneasy in my company  He comes   83 for half an hour  and stays an hour—But don t set me into talking of him  for my heart always dilates  when I enter into the agreeable subject  and I know not where to stop   Lady L  Charlotte is a happy girl   Miss Gr  And Lady L  is a happy woman  for he loves her as well as he loves me  Indeed he is so good as to say  but I know it is to keep us from pulling caps  that he knows not which he loves best  We have different qualities  he says  and he admires in each what the other has not   Lady D  But what are his employments  What can he be so much busied in   M ss Gr  A continual round of good offices  He has a ward  She has a large fortune  The attention he pays to her affairs takes up a good deal of his time  He is his own steward  and then he has a variety of other engagements  of which we ask him not one word  yet long to know something about them —But this we are sure of  that  if he thinks any thing will give us pleasure  we shall hear of it  if the contrary  he is as secret as the night   Will nobody say one bad or one indifferent thing of this man  Lucy  There is no bearing these things  O my dear  what a Nobody is your poor Harriet   Lady D  He is one of the handsomest men in England  they tell me   Miss Gr  Sisters are not judges  They may be partial  His benignity
