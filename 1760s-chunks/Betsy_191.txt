a word  on which   Are you   not of our opinion  sister   cried he to her   Yes  brother   answered   she   Mr  Trueworth is certainly a very fine gentleman     How cold is   such an expression   resumed Sir Bazil   and even that extorted     You   would not  sure  Sir   said she  a little gaily   have me in raptures   about him  and speak as if I were in love with him         Indeed  but I would   cried Sir Bazil   and  what is more  would also   have you be so  he deserves it from you  and  as you must some time or   other be sensible of the tender passion  you cannot do it at more   suitable years     I see no necessity   replied she   for my being so at   any years         It is a sign  then   said he   that you have not consulted nature  Have   you never read what Lord Lansdown has wrote upon this subject  If you   have not  I will repeat it to you             In vain from Fate we strive to fly        For  first or last  as all must die        So   tis decreed by those above        That  first or last  we all must love          Poets are not always prophets   answered she  laughing   It depends   upon Mr  Trueworth himself   said Sir Bazil   to prevent you from giving   the lie to the prediction  If he fails  I shall believe no other man in   the world will ever have the power to engage you to fulfil it  he dines   here to day  Sister Wellair and I are obliged to go abroad in the   afternoon  so must desire you to make tea  and entertain him  as well as   you can  till we come back         I see you are both in the plot against me   cried she   but I shall   endeavour to behave so as not to affront your guest  yet  at the same   time  be far from making good your oracle        A gentleman coming in to Sir Bazil  broke off their discourse  and   relieved Miss Harriot from any farther persecution at this time  It was   not that she disliked either the person or conversation of Mr    Trueworth  or that she was tired with the praises given him by her   brother and sister  on the contrary  she found a thousand things which   they had not mentioned  to admire in him  in fine  he was  in reality    less indifferent to her than she herself imagined  but there was a   certain shyness in her disposition  which mingled some share of pain   with the pleasure of hearing him spoke of as her lover       She was sensible this propensity  which nature had implanted  was a   weakness in her  but  though she used her utmost efforts for overcoming   it  she found herself unequal to the task  In vain she considered  that   the addresses of a man of such perfect honour and politeness as Mr    Trueworth  could not but be accompanied with the most profound respect    in vain she called to mind the example of other ladies  whom she had   seen behave in the company of those who professed themselves their   lovers  with the greatest ease and sprightliness  the very sight of Mr    Trueworth  as she saw him from her chamber window  talking with her   brother in the garden  threw her heart into palpitations  which all the   reason she was mistress of could not enable her to quiet  but  when   obliged to go down and sit with him at table  her confusion increased    by being more near the object which occasioned it  She endeavoured to   treat him with the same freedom she had been accustomed  but it was not   in her power  in fine  never woman suffered more in constraining herself   to be silent and demure  than she did in constraining herself to be   talkative and gay       What  then  became of her  when Sir Bazil and Mrs  Wellair  after making   a formal excuse for a short absence  went out  and left her exposed to   the solicitations of a passion which her timid modesty had made her so   much dread       The moment Mr  Trueworth saw himself alone with her  he approached her
