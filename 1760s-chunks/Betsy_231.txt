  said that gentleman   longer than I   expected  my friend is going to have his picture drawn  and  knowing I   have been in Italy  would needs have my judgment upon the painter s   skill    I suppose  then   said Mr  Francis   your eyes have been   feasted with the resemblance of a great number of beauties  either real   or fictitious     No  faith   replied the other   I believe none of the   latter  the man seems to be too much an artist in his profession to   stand in any need of having recourse to that stale strategem of inviting   customers by exhibiting shadows  which have no substances but in his own   brain  and  I must do him the justice to say  that I never saw life   imitated to more perfection         Then you saw some faces there you were acquainted with   said the   younger Mr  Thoughtless   Two or three   answered the elder   but one    which more particularly struck me  as I had seen the original but   twice  but once  indeed  to take any notice of  it was of your friend    the gentleman we waited on this morning         What  Trueworth   demanded Mr  Francis   The same   resumed the other     never was there a more perfect likeness  he is drawn in miniature  I   believe  by the size of the piece  intended to be worn at a lady s   watch  but I looked on it through my magnifier  and thought I saw his   very self before me        He said much more in praise of the excellence of this artist  as    indeed  he was very full of it  having a desire his favourite mistress s   picture should be drawn  and was transported to have found a person who    he thought  could do it so much justice       Though Miss Betsy sat all this time in a pensive posture  and seemed not   to take any notice of this discourse  yet no part of it was lost upon   her   You extol this painter so much  brother   said she   that if I   thought my picture worth drawing  I would sit to him myself  Pray     continued she   where does he live  and what is his name   Mr    Thoughtless having satisfied her curiosity in these points  no more was   said on the occasion  and the brothers immediately entered into a   conversation upon the business which had brought them thither       The elder of them remonstrated to her  in the strongest terms he was   able  the perpetual dangers to which  through the baseness of this   world  and her own inadvertency  she was liable every day to be exposed     This last ugly incident   said he   I hope may be hushed up  Mr    Trueworth  I dare say  is too generous to make any mention of it  and   those concerned in it will be secret for their own sakes  but you may   not always meet the same prosperous chance  It behoves us  therefore    who must share in your disgrace  as well as have a concern in your   happiness  to insist on your putting yourself into a different mode of   life  Mr  Munden makes very fair proposals  he has given me leave to   examine the rent roll of his estate  which accordingly I have ordered a   lawyer to do  He will settle an hundred and fifty pounds per annum on   you for pin money  and jointure you in four hundred  and I think your   fortune does not entitle you to a better offer         Brother  I have had better   replied Miss Betsy  with a sigh   But you   rejected it   cried Mr  Francis  with some warmth   and you are not to   expect a second Trueworth to fall to your share     Let us talk no more   of what is past   said the elder Mr  Thoughtless   but endeavour to   persuade our sister to accept of that which at present is most for her   advantage        Both these gentlemen  in their different turns  made use of every   argument that could be brought on the occasion  to prevail on Miss Betsy   to give them some assurance  that as now there was no better prospect   for her  she would trifle no longer with the pretensions of Mr  Munden    but resolve to marry him  in case the condition of his affairs was   proved  upon enquiry  to be such
