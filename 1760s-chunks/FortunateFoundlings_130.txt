  is well deserving of a better wife  tho  I have   endeavoured to attone for my unknown transgression   by every act of duty in my power   nurse   stayed long enough in your part of the   world to be able to bring me an account how   the children were disposed of   That I never   gave you an account they were your own  was   occasioned by two reasons  first  the danger of   entrusting such a thing by the post  my nurse   soon after dying  and secondly  because  as I   was a wife  I thought it unbecoming of me to   remind you of a passage I was willing to forget   myself   A long sickness has put other thoughts   into my head  and inspired me with a tenderness   for those unhappy babes  which the shame   of being their mother hitherto deprived them   of   I hear  with pleasure  that you are not   married  and are therefore at full liberty to   make some provision for them  if they are yet   living  that may alleviate the misfortune of   their birth  Farewell  if I obtain this first and   last request  I shall dye well satisfied          P S   Burn this paper  I conjure you  the moment   you have read it  but lay the contents   of it up in your heart never to be forgotten           I now no longer wondered  pursued Dorilaus  at that impulse I had to   love you   I found it the simpathy of nature  and adored the divine   power   After having well fixed in my mind all the particulars of this   amazing secret  I performed her injunction  and committed it to the   flames  I had opportunity enough to inform her in what manner Horatio   had disposed of himself  and let her know you were gone with a lady on   her travels  I concealed indeed the motive  fearing to give her any   occasion of reproaching herself for having so long concealed what my   ignorance of might have involved us all in guilt and ruin       I stayed some few days at the castle  and then took my leave  she said   many tender things at parting concerning you  and seemed well satisfied   with the assurances I gave her of making the same provision for you  as   I must have done had the ceremony of the church obliged me to it  This   seemed indeed the only thing for which she lived  and  I was informed    died in a few days after       At my return to England I renewed my endeavours to discover where you   were  but could hear nothing since you wrote from Aix la Chappelle  and   was equally troubled that I had received no letters from your   brother   I doubted not but he had fallen in the battle  and mourned him   as lost   till an old servant perceiving the melancholy I was in    acquainted me that several letters had been left at my house by the post   during my absence  but that the kinsman I had left to take care of my   affairs had secreted them  jealous  no doubt  of the fondness I have   expressed for him   This so enraged me  when on examination I had too   much reason to be assured of this treachery  that I turned my whole   estate into ready money  and resolved to quit England for ever  and pass   my life here  this being a country I always loved  and had many reasons   to dislike my own       Here I soon heard news of my Horatio  and such as filled me with a   pleasure  which wanted nothing of being complete but the presence of my   dear Louisa to partake of it       Dorilaus then went on  and acquainted her with the particulars of   Horatio s story  as he had learned it from the baron de Palfoy  with   whom he now was very intimate  but as the reader is sufficiently   informed of those transactions  it would be needless to repeat them  so   I shall only say that Dorilaus arrived in France in a short time after   Horatio had left it to enter into the service of the king of Sweden  and   had wrote that letter  inserted in the eighteenth chapter  in order to   engage that young warrior to return  some little time before his meeting   with Louisa       Nothing now was wanting to the contentment of this tender father but the   presence of Horatio  which he was every day expecting  when  instead of   himself  those letters from him arrived which contained his resolution   of remaining with Charles XII
