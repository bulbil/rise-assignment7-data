this distress Strot cast his eyes on Taycho the monstertamer  who alone seemed able to over ballance the weight of all other opposition  and to him he made large advances accordingly  but his offers were still inadequate to the expectations of that Demagogue  who  nevertheless  put on a face of capitulation  He was even heard to say that Yak strot was an honest man and a good minister  nay  he declared he would ascend the highest pinnacle of the highest pagod in Japan  and proclaim that Yak strot had never  directly nor indirectly  meddled with administration since he resigned   171 the public office of minister  Finding him  however  tardy and phlegmatic in his proposals  he thought proper to change his phrase  and in the next assembly of the people swore  with great vociferation  that the said Yak strot was the greatest rogue that ever escaped the gallows  This was a necessary fillip to Yak strot  and operated upon him so effectually  that he forthwith sent a charte blanche to the great Taycho  and a treaty was immediately ratified on the following conditions  That the said Taycho should be raised to the rank of Quanbuku  and be appointed conservator of the Dairo s signet  that no state measure should be taken without his express approbation  that his creature the lawyer Prafffog should be ennobled and preferred to the most eminent place in the tribunals of Japan  and that all his friends and dependants should be   172 provided for at the public expence  in such a manner as he himself should propose  His kinsman Lob kob  however  was not comprehended in this treaty  the articles of which he inveighed against with such acrimony  that a rupture ensued betwixt these two originals  The truth is  Lob kob was now so full of his own importance  that nothing less than an equal share of administration would satisfy his ambition  and this was neither in Taycho s power nor inclination to grant   The first consequence of this treaty was a new shift of hands  and a new dance of ministers  The chair of precedency was pulled from under the antiquated Fika kaka  who fell upon his back  and his heels flying up  discovered but too plainly the melancholy truth of his metamorphosis  All his colleagues were discarded  except those who thought proper to   173 temporize and join in dancing the hay  according as they were actuated by the new partners of the puppet shew  This coalition was the greatest master piece in politics that ever Yak strot performed  Taycho  the formidable Taycho  whom in his single person he dreaded more than all his other enemies of Japan united  was now become his coadjutor  abettor  and advocate  and  which was still of more consequence to Strot  that Demagogue was forsaken of his good genius Legion   The many headed Monster would have swallowed down every other species of tergiversation in Taycho  except a coalition with the detested favourite  and the title of Quo  by which he formally renounced its society  but these were articles which the mongrel could not digest  The tidings of this union threw the Beast into a kind of stupor  from which it   174 was roused by blisters and cauteries applied by Gotto mio  Twitz er  Zan ti fic  with his understrapper Toks  now reinforced by Fika kaka  and his discarded associates  for their common hatred to Yak strot  like the rod of Moses  swallowed up every distinction of party  and every suggestion of former animosity  and they concurred with incredible zeal  in rousing Legion to a due sense of Taycho s apostacy  The Beast  so stimulated  howled three days and three nights successively at Taycho s gate  then was seized with a convulsion  that went off with an evacuation upwards and downwards  so offensive  that the very air was infected   The horrid sounds of the Beast s lamentation  the noxious effluvia of its filthy discharge  joined to the poignant remorse which Taycho felt at finding his power over Legion dissolved  occasioned a commotion   175 in his brain  and this led him into certain extravagancies  which gave his enemies a handle to say he was actually insane  His former friends and partizans thought the best apology they could make for the inconsistency of his conduct  was to say he was non compos  and this report was far from being disagreeable to Yak strot  because it would at any time furnish him with a plausible pretence to dissolve the partnership  at which he inwardly repined  for it was necessity alone that drove him to a partition of his power with a man so incapable of acting in concert with any collegue whatsoever   In the mean time Gotto mio and his associates left no stone unturned to acquire the same influence over Legion  which Taycho had so eminently possessed  but the Beast s faculties  slender as they were  seemed now greatly impaired  in consequence of   176 that arch empiric s practices upon its constitution  In vain did Gotto mio hoop and hollow  in vain did Twitz er tickle its long ears  in vain did Zan ti fic apply sternutatories  and his Bonze administer inflammatory glysters  the monster could never be brought to a right understanding  or at all concur with their designs  except in one instance  which was
