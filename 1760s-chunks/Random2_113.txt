of    Avast  avast—what ship  brother    Being satisfied in this particular  he cried    D—n the ship  I was in hopes it had been my own—where are you bound    We gratified his curiosity in this too  upon which he suffered himself to be taken on board  and after being comforted with a dram  told us  he belonged to the Vesuvio man of war  upon a cruize off the island of Hispaniola    341 that he had fallen over board about four and twenty hours ago  and the ship being under sail  they did not chuse to bring to  but tossed a hen coop over board for his convenience  upon which he was in good hopes of reaching the Cape next morning  howsomever  he was as well content to be aboard us  because he did not doubt that we should meet his ship  and if he had gone ashore in the bay  he might have been taken prisoner by the French —My uncle and father were very much diverted with the account of this fellow s unconcerned behaviour  and in two days  meeting with the Vesuvio  as he expected  he was sent him on board of her according to his desire     Having beat up successfully the windward passage  we stretched to the northward  and falling in with a westerly wind  in eight weeks arrived in soundings  and in two days after made the Lizzard —It is impossible to express the joy I felt at sight of English ground  Don Rodriguez was not unmoved  and Strap shed tears of gladness —The sailors profited by our satisfaction  the shoe that was nailed to the mast  being quite filled with our liberality —My uncle resolved to run up into the Downs at once  but the wind shifting when we were a breast of the isle of Wight  he was obliged to turn in to St  Helens  and come to an anchor at Spithead  to the great mortification of the crew  thirty of whom were immediately pressed on board of a man of war   My father and I went a shore immediately to Portsmouth  leaving Strap with the captain to go round with the ship and take care of our effects  and I discovered so much impatience to see my   342 charming Narcissa  that my father permitted me to ride across the country to her brother s house  while he should hire a post chaise for London  where he would wait for me at a place to which I directed him   Fired with all the eagerness of passion  I took post that very night  and in the morning reached an inn  about three miles from the Squire s habitation  here I remained till next evening  allaying the torture of my impatience with the rapturous hope of seeing that divine creature  after an absence of eighteen months  which so far from impairing  had raised my love to the most exalted pitch  Neither were my reflections free from apprehension  that sometimes intervened in spite of all my hope  and represented her as having yielded to the importunity of her brother  and blessed the arms of an unhappy rival —My thoughts were even maddened with the fear of her death  and when I arrived in the dark at the house of Mrs  Sagely  I had not for some time courage to desire admittance  lest my soul should be shocked with dismal tidings  At length  however  I knocked  and no sooner certified the good gentlewoman of my voice than she opened the door  and received me with a most affectionate embrace  that brought tears into her aged eyes     For heaven s sake  dear mother  cried I  tell me  how is Narcissa  is she the same that I left her    She blessed my ears with saying    She is as beautiful  in as good health  and as much yours as ever  —  Transported at this assurance  I begged to know if I could not see her that very night  when this sage matron gave me to understand that my   343 mistress was in London  and that things were strangely altered in the Squire s house since my departure  that he had been married a whole year to Melinda  who at first found means to wean his attention so much from Narcissa  that he became quite careless of that lovely sister  comforting himself with the clause in his father s will  by which she would forfeit her fortune  if she should marry without his consent —that my mistress being but indifferently treated by her sister in law  had made use of her freedom some months ago  and gone to town  where she was lodged with Miss Williams  in expectation of my arrival  and had been pestered with the addresses of Lord Quiverwit  who finding her heart engaged  had fallen upon a great many shifts  to perswade her that I was dead  but finding all his artifices unsuccessful  and despairing of gaining her affection  he had consoled himself for her indifference  by marrying another lady some weeks ago  who had already lest him on account of some family uneasiness —Besides this interesting information  she told me  that there was not a great deal of harmony between Melinda and the Squire  who was so much disgusted
