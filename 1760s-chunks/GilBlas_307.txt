Lirias  Scipio s agreeable intelligence  and a reform in the domestic arrangements   I PASSED a week at Valencia in the first company  living on equal terms with the best of the nobility  Plays  balls  concerts  grand dinners  ladies  parties  all things that heart could wish or vanity grow tall upon  were provided for me by the governor and his lady  to whom I paid my court so dexterously  that they were heartily sorry to see me set out on my return to Lirias  They even obliged me  before they would let me go  to engage for a division of my time between them and my hermitage  It was determined that I should spend the winter in Valencia  and the summer at my seat  After this bargain  my benefactors left me at liberty to tear myself from them  and go where their kindness would be always staring me in the face   Scipio  who was waiting impatiently for my return  was ready to jump out of his skin for joy at the sight of me  and his ecstasies were doubled at my circumstantial account of the journey  And now for your history  my friend  said I  taking breath  to what moral uses have you turned the solitary period of my absence  Has the time passed agreeably  As well  answered he  as it could with a servant to whom nothing is so dear as the presence of his master  I have walked over our little domain  circuitously and diagonally  sometimes seated on the margin of a fountain in our wood  I have taken pleasure in be holding the transparency of its waters  which are as pellucid as those of the sacred spring  whose projection from the rock made the vast forest of Albunea to resound with the roar of the cascade  sometimes lying at the foot of a tree  I have listened to the song of the linnet or the nightingale  At other times I have hunted or fished  and  what has given me more rational delight than all these pastimes  I have whiled away many a profitable hour in the improvement of my mind   I interrupted my secretary in a tone of eager inquiry  to ask where he had procured books  I found them  said he  in an elegant library here in the house  whither master Joachim took me  Heyday  in what corner  resumed I  can this said library be  Did we not go over the whole building on the day of our arrival  You fancied so  rejoined he  but you are to know that we only explored three sides of the square  and forgot the fourth  It was there that Don Caesar  when he came to Lirias  employed part of his time in reading  There are in this library some very good books  left as a never failing phylactery against the blue devils  when our gardens despoiled of Flora s treasure  and our woods of their leafy honours  shall no longer challenge those miscreant invaders to combat in the forest or the bower  The lords of Lena have not done things by halves  but have catered for the mind as well as for the body   This intelligence filled me with sincere rapture  I was shewn to the fourth side of the square  and feasted with an intellectual banquet Don Caesar s room I immediately determined to make my own  That nobleman s bed was still there  with correspondent furniture  consisting of historical tapestry  representing the rape of the Sabine women by the Romans  From the bed chamber  I went into a closet fitted up with low bookcases well filled  and over them the portraits of the Spanish kings  Near a window whence you command a prospect of a most bewitching country  there was an ebony writing desk and a large sofa  covered with black morocco  But I gave my attention principally to the library  It was composed of philosophers  poets  historians  and abounded in romances  Don Caesar seemed to give the preference to that light reading  if one might judge by the profusion of supply  I must own  to my shame  that my taste was not at all above the level of those productions  notwithstanding the extravagances they delight in stringing together  whether it was owing to my not being a very critical reader at that time  or because the Spaniards are naturally addicted to the marvellous  I must nevertheless plead in my own justification  that I was alive to the charms of a sprightly and popular morality  and that Lucian  Horace  and Erasmus became my favourite and standard authors   My friend  said I to Scipio  when my eyes had coursed over my library  here is wherewithal to feed and pamper our minds  but our present business is to reform our household  On that subject I can spare you a great deal of trouble  answered he  During your absence I have sifted your people thoroughly  and flatter myself it is no empty boast to say that I know them  Let us begin with master Joachim  I take him to be as great a scoundrel as ever breathed  and have no doubt but he was turned away from the archbishop s for errors which were too great to be excepted in the passing of his accounts  Yet we must keep him
