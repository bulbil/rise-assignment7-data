so you deserve to be   What means my Emily   Don t I see  don t I hear  what is designed to be brought about by Lord and Lady L  and Miss Grandison  And don t I hear from my Anne  what every body expects and wishes for   And does every body expect and wish  my Emily—  I stopped  She went on —And don t I see that my guardian himself loves you   Do you think so  Emily   O how he dwells upon your words  when you speak   You fansy so  my dear   You have not observed his eyes so much as I have done  when he is in your company  I have watched your eyes  too  but have not seen that you mind him quite so much as he does you —Indeed he loves you dearly —And then she sighed again   But why that sigh  my Emily —Were I so happy as you think  in the esteem of this good man  would you envy me  my dear   Envy you —I  such a simple girl as I  envy you  No  indeed  Why should I envy you —But tell me now  dear madam  tell me  Don t you love my guardian   Every body does  You  my Emily  love him   And so I do  But you love him  madam  with a hope that no one else will have reason to entertain—Dear now  place a little confidence in your Emily  My guardian shall never know it from me  by the least hint  I beg you will own it  You can t think how you will oblige me  Your confidence in me will give me importance with myself     49 Will you  Emily  be as frank hearted with me  as you would have me be with you   Indeed I will   I do  my dear  greatly esteem your guardian   Esteem  Is that the word  Is that the Ladies word for Love  And is not the word Love  a pretty word for women  I mean no harm by it  I am sure   And I am sure you cannot mean harm  I will be sincere with my Emily  But you must not let any one living know what I say to you of this nature  I would prefer your guardian  my dear  to a king  in all his glory   And so  madam  would I  if I were you  I should be glad to be thought like you in every thing   Amiable innocence  But tell me  Miss Jervois  Would you not have me esteem your guardian  You know he was my guardian too  and that at an exigence when I most wanted one   Indeed I would  Would you have me wish such a good young Lady  as Miss Byron  to be ungrateful  No  indeed —And again she sighed   Why then sighed my Emily  You said you would be frank hearted   So I will  madam  But I really can t tell why I sighed then  I wish my guardian to be the happiest man in the world  I wish you  madam  to be the happiest woman  And how can either be so  but in one another —But I am grieved  I believe  that there seems to be something in the way of your mutual happiness—I don t know whether that is all  neither—I don t know what it is—If I did  I would tell you—But I have such throbs sometimes at my heart  as make me fetch my breath hard—I don t know what it is—Such a weight here  as makes me sigh  and I have a pleasure  I think  because I have an ease in sighing—What can it be —  Go on  my dear  You are a pretty describer   Why now  if any body  as Anne did last time my   50 guardian came hither  was to run up stairs  in an hurry  and to say  Miss  Miss  Miss  your guardian is come  I should be in such a flutter  my heart would seem to be too big for my bosom  I should sit down as much out of breath  as if I had ran down an high hill —And  for half an hour  may be  so tremble  that I should not be able to see the dear guardian that perhaps I had wanted to see  And to hear him with a voice of gentleness  as if he pitied me for having so unhappy a mother  call me his Emily —Don t you think he has a sweet voice —And your voice  too  madam  is also so sweet—Every body says  that even in your common speech your voice is melody —Now Anne says—  O my agreeable little flatterer   I don t flatter  madam  Don t call me a flatterer  I am a very sincere girl  Indeed I am   I dare say you are  But you raise my vanity  my dear  It is not your fault to tell me what people say of me  but it is mine to be proud of their commendations—But you were going to
