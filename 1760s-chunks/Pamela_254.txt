sister  I know the whole trick of it  and so   tis my   opinion  dost thou  It is only thy little cunning  that it might look   like a cloak to thy yielding  and get better terms from him  Pr ythee    pr ythee  wench  thou seest I know the world a little   almost as much   at thirty two  as thou dost at sixteen   Remember that       I rose from the window  and walking to the other end of the room  Beat   me again  if you please  said I  but I must tell your ladyship  I scorn   your words  and am as much married as your ladyship       At that she ran to me  but her woman interposed again  Let the vain   wicked creature go from your presence  madam  said she  She is not   worthy to be in it  She will but vex your ladyship  Stand away  Beck    said she  That s an assertion that I would not take from my brother  I   can t bear it  As much married as I   Is that to be borne  But if the   creature believes she is  madam  said her woman  she is to be as much   pitied for her credulity  as despised for her vanity       I was in hopes to have slipt out at the door  but she caught hold of my   gown  and pulled me back  Pray your ladyship  said I  don t kill me   I   have done no harm   But she locked the door  and put the key in her   pocket  So  seeing Mrs  Jewkes before the window  I lifted up the sash    and said  Mrs  Jewkes  I believe it would be best for the chariot to go   to your master  and let him know  that Lady Davers is here  and I cannot   leave her ladyship       She was resolved to be displeased  let me say what I would       Said she  No  no  he ll then think  that I make the creature my   companion  and know not how to part with her  I thought your ladyship    replied I  could not have taken exceptions at this message  Thou knowest   nothing  wench  said she  of what belongs to people of condition  How   shouldst thou  Nor  thought I  do I desire it  at this rate       What shall I say  madam  said I  Nothing at all  replied she  let him   expect his dearest love  and be disappointed  it is but adding a   few more hours  and he will make every one a day  in his amorous   account   Mrs  Jewkes coming nearer me  and my lady walking about the   room  being then at the end  I whispered  Let Robert stay at the elms    I ll have a struggle for t by and by       As much married as I  repeated she   The insolence of the creature   And   so she walked about the room  talking to herself  to her woman  and   now and then to me  but seeing I could not please her  I thought I   had better be silent  And then it was  Am I not worthy an answer  If   I speak  said I  your ladyship is angry at me  though ever so   respectfully  if I do not  I cannot please  Would your ladyship tell me   but how I shall oblige you  and I would do it with all my heart       Confess the truth  said she  that thou art an undone creature  hast been   in bed with thy master  and art sorry for it  and for the mischief   thou hast occasioned between him and me  and then I ll pity thee  and   persuade him to pack thee off  with a hundred or two of guineas  and   some honest farmer may take pity of thee  and patch up thy shame  for   the sake of the money  and if nobody will have thee  thou must vow   penitence  and be as humble as I once thought thee       I was quite sick at heart  at all this passionate extravagance  and to   be hindered from being where was the desire of my soul  and afraid too   of incurring my dear master s displeasure  and  as I sat  I saw it was   no hard matter to get out of the window into the front yard  the parlour   being even with the yard  and so have a fair run for it  and after I had   seen my lady at the other end of the room
