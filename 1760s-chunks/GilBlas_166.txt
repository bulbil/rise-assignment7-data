cloud  to compare the whistling of the winds to the factions of a populace  and the rolling of the waves to the shock of conflicting hosts  with other such old fashioned phraseologies as have been heirlooms of Parnassus from time immemorial  But it is useless to be poetical without invention  Suffice it therefore to say  in slang metaphor  that the storm was a devil of a storm  and obliged us to stand in for the point of Cabrera  This is a desert island  with a small fort  at that time garrisoned by an officer and five or six soldiers  Our reception was hospitable and cordial   As it was necessary for us to stay there some days  for the purpose of refitting our sails and rigging  we devised various kinds of amusements to keep off the foul fiend  melancholy  Every one did as seemed good in his own eyes  some played at cards  others diverted themselves in other ways  but as for me  I went about exploring the island  with such of our gentry as had either a curiosity or a taste for the picturesque  We were frequently obliged to clamber from rock to rock  for the face of the country is rugged  and the soil scanty  presenting a scene difficult of access  but interesting from its wildness  One day  while we were speculating on these dry and barren prospects  and extracting a moral from the vagaries of nature  who can swell into the fruitful mother and the copious nurse  or shrink into the lean and loathsome skeleton as she pleases  our sense was all at once regaled with a most delicious fragrance  We turned as with a common impulse towards the east  whence the scented gale seemed to come  To our utter astonishment  we discovered among the rocks a green plat of considerable dimensions  gay with honeysuckles more luxuriant and more odorous than even those which thrive so greatly in the climate of Andalusia  We were not sorry to approach nearer these delicious shrubs  which were wasting their sweetness in such unchecked profusion  when it turned out that they lined the entrance of a very deep cavern  The opening was wide  and the recess in consequence partially illuminated  We were determined to explore  and descended by some stone steps overgrown with flowers on each side  so that it was difficult to say whether the approach was formed by art or nature  When we had got down  we saw several little streams winding over a sand  the yellow lustre of which outrivalled gold  These drew their sources from the continual distillations of the rock within  and lost themselves again in the hollows of the ground  The water looked so clear  that we were tempted to drink of it  and such was its freshness  that we made a party to return the next day  with some bottles of generous wine  which we were persuaded would acquire new zest from the retreat where they were to be quaffed   It was not without regret that we left so agreeable a place  nor did we omit  on our return to the fort  boasting among our comrades of so interesting a discovery  The commander of the fortress  however  with the warmest professions of friendship  warned us against going any more to the cavern  with which we were so much delighted  And why so  said I  is there anything to be afraid of  Most undoubtedly  answered he  The corsairs of Algiers and Tripoli sometimes land upon this island  for the purpose of watering at that spring  One day they surprised two soldiers of my garrison there  whom they carried into slavery  It was in vain that the officer assumed a tone of kind dissuasion  nothing could prevent us from going  We fancied that he meant to play upon our fears  and the day following I returned to the cavern with three adventurous blades of our establishment  We were even fool hardy enough to leave our fire arms behind as a sort of bravado  Young Moralez declined being of the party  the fort and the gaming table had more charms for him  as well as for his brother   We went down to the bottom of the cave  as on the preceding day  and set some bottles of the wine we had brought with us to cool in the rivulets  While we were enjoying them in all the luxury of elegant conviviality  our wits set in motion by the novelty of the scene  and the echo reverberating to the music of our guitars  we espied at the mouth of the cavern several abominable faces overgrown with whiskers  neither did their turbans and Turkish dresses render them a whit more amiable in our conceits  We nevertheless took it into our heads that it was a frolic of our own party  set on by the commanding officer of the fort  and that they had disguised themselves for the purpose of playing us a trick  With this impression on our minds  we set up a horse  laugh  and allowed a quiet entrance to about ten  without thinking of making any resistance  In a few moments our eyes were opened to that fatal error  and we were convinced  in sober sadness  that it was a corsair at the head of his crew  come to carry us away  Surrender  you Christian dogs  cried he
