insinuating the threat which he afterwards put into execution  Thinking  no doubt  he should by this intimidate my poor father so much  that upon reflexion he would use his endeavours to prevail on me to comply  and it was for this wicked purpose he was permitted  or rather compelled to pass the whole day with me  I would not  added my father relate this particular to you  for fear your tenderness to me might shake your virtue  but the trial God be praised  is now past  you are here my poor child at least in safety  We have some money to support us for a while  perhaps the wicked wretch may relent  If he gives me my liberty I may still obtain a livelihood  and if I can get you received into some worthy family  that will protect you from his violence  I shall be contented   My father  unwilling to expose his ungrateful pupil  and thinking when he cooled a little he would be ashamed of his conduct and release him  resolved not to apprise any of his friends in Berkshire of his situation  but wrote a long expostulatory letter to Mr Ware  which he concluded with requesting no other favour but his liberty   To this  Mr Ware wrote in answer  that he was still ready to make good his first proposals  and since he now found that he had got his daughter with him  he should obtain his liberty on no other terms   My father still loath to believe him so lost to humanity as to persist in this barbarous resolution  patiently waited another month  at the end of which he again wrote him a very affecting letter  but to this he received no answer  being told Mr Ware was gone into Berkshire  He wrote to two or three gentlemen of his acquaintance there  informing them of his deplorable situation  and begging them to use their influence with Mr Ware on his behalf  He did not disclose the enormity of his behaviour  but only said  that on a quarrel he had with him  he had confined him under colour of a debt  which it was not in his power to discharge  this he did as much in tenderness to Mr Ware’s character  as to avoid exasperating him more against him   He ordered me at the same time to write to an old maid servant  who took care of our little house in the country  to send me my clothes  my father’s books  and such other things as belonged to him  As I had come to town but for a month  and was in deep mourning for my mother  I had left the best part of my apparel behind me  and I had taken nothing with me from Mr Ware’s but a little bundle of    linnen  my father had been permitted to carry his with him to the prison   As the furniture in this little house was of no great value  my father having purchased it as it stood in the house of the former curate  he made a present of it to the old servant  who had lived with him from the time he married   He received no answer to any of the letters he wrote to the gentlemen  but I got a letter from this old servant  at the same time that she sent the things which I wrote for  And you will scarce believe  Madam  to what a height this abandoned wretch carried his crimes   Not contented with having plunged my poor father and me into the deepest distress  he endeavoured to blast and destroy our characters in the country  He gave out that my father  taking advantage of his  Mr Ware’s  being a little overcome with wine one night  had put his daughter to bed to him  and would have insisted the next day that he had married them  To punish the ungrateful designing old rogue  he said he had put him into jail where he intended to keep him a month or two till he repented   Though the respectable character my father bore in his neighbourhood made this story incredible  yet Mr Ware’s power and influence was such  that people seemed to believe it  and applauded Mr Ware’s clemency in my father’s punishment  No wonder then his letters were unanswered  they were shewn to Mr Ware  and laughed at  The old servant  who was sure we were both cruelly belied  lamented our unhappy fate  but poor creature she could do nothing but lament  This last blow quite subdued my father’s courage  he fell sick upon it  and languished many weeks in a most melancholy condition   When he recovered a little from his sickness  he was suddenly struck with the dead palsey on one side  by which he lost the use of his right hand  so that I am obliged to dress and undress him like a child   When the money which we had brought with us to the prison was spent  we were obliged to sell most of my father’s books  and the best of my clothes   We had repeated messages from the merciless man  by his vile house keeper  who used all her rhetoric to persuade us to compliance  but my father constantly repulsed her  with contempt and indignation  ’till at length Mr Ware  tired  I believe
