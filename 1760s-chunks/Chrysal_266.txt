to save the captain  for  if I mistake not greatly  that was not   the least object of your care          Very true  sir  and with good reason  too  let me tell you  as I   know that the interest of my family  which has promoted me thus   far  will not fail to raise me higher  Men of low birth  or whose   relations will not serve them  may set no value on their lives   but   that is not my case   I am akin to most of the nobility of my country    who always stand by their own blood  where any preferment or   advantage is to be gotten  Hem   hem             ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 309       I know their interest full well    retorted my master  scarce able   to suppress his indignation at such insolence    and the closeness   with which they hang together  but take care that you do not   depend upon them too far        Unabashed by the manner in which this was said  the captain   asked if he had any further commands  and  being answered in ths   negative  marched off in triumph      There are some crimes in the punishment of which all men are   more than ordinarily severe  in order to prove their own exemption   from them  One of the first of these is cowardice  which  though   often an involuntary defect of constitution  is justly reckoned a   crime in military men  from the consequences that may attend it    and as it makes them unable to perform the duties of  a profession   which they should not have entered into under a sense of such   incapacity  All the captains present were for punishing the offender   instantly  in the most exemplary manner  for so flagrant a breach   of duty  But my master  much as he detested the crime  and was   provoked at the insolence with which he strove to carry it off    thought it better to overlook it for the present  than by bringing   him to justice  throw a disgrace upon the forces  that might en    courage the enemy to exert themselves  in hopes of more instances   of the kind  But this moderation was disappointed by a common   cause  In a few days after  the captain  judging by himself that   nothing but fear of giving offence to his great family could have   prevented his being fallen upon directly  for  notwithstanding his   evasions  he was conscious of his crime   instead of improving that   precious respite to extenuate his guilt by some meritorious action    presumed  upon meeting some instances of contempt from the rest   of his corps  to demand the justification of a public trial  in order to   be formally acquitted of what he thought they dared not to convict   him  and also to escape being involved in any further dangers during   the expedition  as he knew the immediate consequence of such a   demand must necessarily be suspending him from his command till   he should be tried  which he knew could not be before the conclusion   of the siege   and in this latter particular his expectation was not   deceived      This directly put an end to the prudential reasons that had   hitherto saved Mm  and of which the successful progress of the   seige had also greatly lessened the force  Accordingly  to end his   Btory here in a few words  the trial he desired was granted  the   result of which was that he was broke with infamy  in contempt   of all his boasts and menaces of the power and resentment of his   family and friends          310 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XLIX     CHEYSAL ACCOUNTS POE THE PBCULIAE ANIMOSITIES WHICH SOME   NATIONS SHOW IN WAE â€” A NOBLE SPANIARD IS TAKEN PEISONBB   IN A SALLY â€” HE MAKES A PEOPOSAL TO THE GENEEAL  WHICH 13   ACCEPTED  AND OPENS A PEOSPECT OF PEACE â€” A BEUTAL OTTTEAGB   DISAPPOINTS HIS DESIGN  AND EMBEOILS MATTEES MOEE THAN   EVEE     Theeb is nothing suggests so disadvantageous an idea of mankind   as the more than brutal ferocity with which they destroy each other    when quarrels between nations set the animosity of individuals free   from those restraints of law with which necessity has taught human   prudence to enforce the observation of the general duties of social   and moral life      This animosity  though  is never seen in its most sanguine colours    but in wars between people of different modes of religion  In that   revelation of the wiU of Heaven  which should be the rule
