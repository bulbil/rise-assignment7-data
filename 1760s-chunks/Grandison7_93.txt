He stirred not from my chamber for half an hour together  for two whole days and nights  All the rest he took was in a chair by my bed side  and very little was his rest  Yet  blessed be God  his health suffered not  Every cordial  every medicine  did he administer to me with his own hands  He regarded not any body but his Harriet  The world  he told me  was nothing to him without his Harriet  So amiably has he appeared in this new light  not in my fond eyes only  but in those of all here  who are continually congratulating me upon it  and every one telling me little circumstances of his kind attention  and anxious fondness  as some happened to observe one  some another  that tho  I wanted not proofs before of his affection for me  I cannot account my indisposition an unhappiness  especially as it has gone off without the consequences  of which you were so very apprehensive —   Dear Sir  I obey you  But indeed  Sir  writing to my grandmamma does me good  But I obey    Only  let thus far as I have written  be dispatched to my Northamptonshire friends     From their ever dutiful HARRIET GRANDISON     239  LETTER XLIX  Lady GRANDISON  In Continuation   Sat  Night   I HAVE a constant attendant in Lady Clementina  She was not to be consoled when I was at worst  Wringing her hands  O that she had never come to England  was her frequent exclamation  And they apprehended  that her mind would be again disturbed  She has not yet recovered her former sedateness  She gets by herself  when she is not with me  She is often in tears  and wishes herself in Italy  Sir Charles is concerned for her  She has something upon her mind  he says  and asked me  if she had not disclosed it to me  He wondered she had not  expressing himself with pleasure on the confidence each has in the other   Sunday  May 13   SIGNOR Jeronymo has been pitying to me the Count of Belvedere  The poor man could not prevail upon himself to accompany Sir Charles and his noble guests down  He owned to Jeronymo  that he had twice set out for Grandison hall  but both times  being unable to pursue his intention  turned back   Jeronymo told me  that the Count had made his will  and left all that he could leave  and his whole personal estate  to their family  in case he should die unmarried  He would not leave it to Lady Clementina  left  if his bequests were to come to her knowledge  she should think he was so mean  as to expect that favour from his riches  of which he had no hope from her esteem   The generous Belvedere declares  said Jeronymo  that should her malady be renewed by means of our interesting ourselves in his favour  he should be the most miserable of men  My dear Jeronymo  said he  at parting in town  tell that Angel of a Woman  that   240 I never will solicit her favour  while I shall have reason to apprehend she has an aversion to me  May Clementina be happy  and Belvedere must have some consolation from knowing her to be so  however wretched he may be on the whole  But assure yourself  Jeronymo  that I will never be the husband of any other woman  while she is unmarried   I joined with Signor Jeronymo in pitying the Count  Yet  I must own  that my compassion is still more deeply engaged for Clementina  But I was affected not a little  however  when Jeronymo read a passage from a Letter of the Count  which  at my request  he lest with me  and which I English as follows —After his supplicatious put up to Heaven for her happiness  whatever became of him—   But can she be happy    says he    in her present situation  may there not be always a struggle between her exalted notion of duty  and her passion  tho  the noblest that ever warmed a human breast  which may renew the disorders of her mind —Were she mine— Let me indulge  for one moment  the rapturous supposition  I could hope to conduct  to guide  to compose  that noble mind  We would admire  with an equal affection  that best of men  whose goodness is not more the object of her Love  than of my veneration  Jealous as I am of my honour  I would satisfy the charmer of my soul  that I approved of her sisterly Love of a man so excellent  She would not then be left to the silent distress of her own heart      What say my Grandmamma  my Aunt  my Lucy  Shall I wish the noble Clementina may be prevailed upon in favour of this really worthy man  should I  do you think  be prevailed upon in her situation —A better question still—Ought I   Monday  May 14   MY Cousin James has seen me  and I have chid him too  for having been so hasty to carry
