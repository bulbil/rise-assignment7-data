description of all the female prisoners who had been for some weeks admitted into the jail  obtained not the least intelligence of his concealed charmer  but resolved to alleviate his disappointment by the gratification of his curiosity   Under the auspices of Mr  Norton  he made a tour of the prison  and  in particular  visited the kitchen  where he saw a number of spits loaded with a variety of provision  consisting of butchers  meat  poultry  and game  He could not help expressing his astonishment  with uplifted hands  and congratulating himself in secret upon his being a member of that community which had provided such a comfortable asylum for the unfortunate  His ejaculation was interrupted by a tumultuous noise in the street  and Mr  Norton declaring he was sent for to the lodge  consigned our hero to the care of one Mr  Felton  a prisoner of a very decent appearance  who paid his compliments with a good grace  and invited the company to repose themselves in his apartment  which was large  commodious  and well furnished  When Sir Launcelot asked the cause of that uproar  he told him that it was the prelude to a boxing match between two of the prisoners  to be decided in the ground or garden of the place   Captain Crowe  expressing an eager curiosity to see the battle  Mr  Felton assured him there would be no sport  as the combatants were both reckoned dunghills   but  in half an hour   said he   there will be a battle of some consequence between two of the demagogues of the place  Dr  Crabclaw and Mr  Tapley  the first a physician and the other a brewer  You must know  gentlemen  that this microcosm  or republic inn miniature  is like the great world  split into factions  Crabclaw is the leader of one party  and the other is headed by Tapley  both are men of warm and impetuous tempers  and their intrigues have embroiled the whole place  insomuch that it was dangerous to walk the street on account of the continual skirmishes of their partisans  At length  some of the more sedate inhabitants having met and deliberated upon some remedy for these growing disorders  proposed that the dispute should be at once decided by single combat between the two chiefs  who readily agreed to the proposal  The match was accordingly made for five guineas  and this very day and hour appointed for the trial  on which considerable sums of money are depending  As for Mr  Norton  it is not proper that he should be present  or seem to countenance such violent proceedings  which  however  it is necessary to connive at  as convenient vents for the evaporation of those humours  which  being confined  might accumulate and break out with greater fury in conspiracy and rebellion    The knight owned he could not conceive by what means such a number of licentious people  amounting  with their dependants  to above five hundred  were restrained within the bounds of any tolerable discipline  or prevented from making their escape  which they might at any time accomplish  either by stealth or open violence  as it could not be supposed that one or two turnkeys  continually employed in opening and shutting the door  could resist the efforts of a whole multitude    Your wonder  good sir   said Mr  Felton   will vanish  when you consider it is hardly possible that the multitude should co operate in the execution of such a scheme  and that the keeper perfectly well understands the maxim divide et impera  Many prisoners are restrained by the dictates of gratitude towards the deputy marshal  whose friendship and good offices they have experienced  some no doubt are actuated by motives of discretion  One party is an effectual check upon the other  and I am firmly persuaded that there are not ten prisoners within the place that would make their escape  if the doors were laid open  This is a step which no man would take  unless his fortune was altogether desperate  because it would oblige him to leave his country for life  and expose him to the most imminent risk of being retaken and treated with the utmost severity  The majority of the prisoners live in the most lively hope of being released by the assistance of their friends  the compassion of their creditors  or the favour of the legislature  Some who are cut off from all these proposals are become naturalised to the place  knowing they cannot subsist in any other situation  I myself am one of these  After having resigned all my effects for the benefit of my creditors  I have been detained these nine years in prison  because one person refuses to sign my certificate  I have long outlived all my friends from whom I could expect the least countenance or favour  I am grown old in confinement  and lay my account with ending my days in jail  as the mercy of the legislature in favour of insolvent debtors is never extended to uncertified bankrupts taken in execution  By dint of industry and the most rigid economy  I make shift to live independent in this retreat  To this scene my faculty of subsisting  as well as my body  is peculiarly confined  Had I an opportunity to escape  where should
