did wife love a husband better than I did Mr Arnold  his kindness merited  and did win my whole affections  nor could a temporary alienation of his heart  disposses him of the place he held in mine  His returning love  for which  with all thankful    ness  I own myself bound to you  Sir  made him still dearer to me than ever  and I now profess myself wedded to his memory  You have a right  Sir  to expect that I should explain myself at once to you on this subject  for your own sake  and for Miss Burchell’s I must not suffer you to entertain a doubt of my resolution  You compel me to repeat  that I think Miss Burchell deserves your love  and has a just right to your hand  She throws herself upon your honour  without pretending to have any lawful claim  if she had  I should not condescend to solicit the man who could refuse to do her justice   ‘My mother is firm in her first resolves  could you place a crown on my head  her integrity would still oblige her to reject it  nor would a crown tempt me to forfeit the duty which I owe to her   ‘See then  Sir  if that unexpected event  which you mention  a fatal event to me   has brought you nearer to your wishes  and here let me add  in justice to my own particular sentiments  that I think Mr Faulkland is the last man who ought to be my choice  even if my heart were disposed to make one  Reproach me not with ingratitude  or caprice  till I have explained myself  It is not long  Sir  blameless and unconscious as you were of the injury  and nobly as you repaired it  since you were the cause of a separation between me and my husband  I know you will say that our mutual innocence on this occasion  and the secret’s being known but to a few of our friends  makes that objection of little weight  I grant you  with many it might be so  all minds are not equally susceptible  ’tis my unhappiness to have a too resenting heart  My own honour  scrupulous you might call it  would not suffer me to let the man succeed Mr Arnold in my love  who was the occasion of so much uneasiness to him  and the cause of my being suspected in my fidelity  Would it not be an insult on his memory  Oh  Sir  what is the world’s opinion to the approbation of our own hearts  Mine has never yet reproached me  and this has been my support in all my trials  Thus much I say for the reverence I bear my dear Mr Arnold’s memory  but I have other reasons to offer in my excuse  refinements you will call them  but my heart feels their force  I am not the same woman you once loved  afflictions have impaired my health  and those little advantages of person which nature bestowed on me  have not been improved by time  my spirits  broken by misfortunes  have    left me languid and insensible to joy  Peace is the utmost of my wish  and all that I am now capable of relishing  The bride  whom Mr Faulkland once sought  was in the bloom of youth  admired and caressed  by a flattering world  unblemished in her character  her fortune equal to her wishes  her heart  her virgin heart  was then a present  with pride let me say it  worthy of any man’s acceptance  It was then in her power to bestow happiness  and Mr Faulkland would not have been matched unequally  But the scene is changed  what should I now bring to your arms  A person faded by grief  a reputation  though undeservedly  once called in question  a little helpless family without fortune  a widowed heart  dead to love and incapable of pleasure  Oh  Sir  could I bear to be your wife on such conditions  Indebted to you as I am  past a possibility of my ever making you a return  to what a mighty sum would you raise the obligation  How poor would you make me in my own eyes  Humbled as I am by adversity  my soul has still too much pride  or let me call it delicacy  to submit to this  No  if there was no Miss Burchell in the world  no parental sway to guide me  in my present circumstances  I never would be yours   ‘You have now before you my final determination  I shall trouble you no more on the subject  If your heart relents towards Miss Burchell  great will be your reward  In her you are sure of a tender  faithful  and charming friend  who will more than repay every act of kindness towards her  and he who is the author of justice and mercy will not fail to bless you   ‘I am   c’   Methinks  my dear friend  I have now eased my heart of a load that oppressed it  What can I say more  Mr Faulkland now knows my determined purpose in regard to myself  and if he is not quite insensible  I think Miss Burchell
