I will see how my poor nephew will take it  If it can be no otherwise  I will prevail upon him  I think  to go down with me to Caermarthen for a few months —But as to those two fine gentlemen  madam—It would grieve me   tis a folly to deny it  to say I have seen the man that is to supplant my nephew   I will act in character  Sir Rowland  As your daughter  you have a right to know my sentiments on this subject—You have not yet seen the man you seem to be afraid of   You are all goodness  madam—my daughter—and I cannot bear it   He spoke this loud enough to be heard  and Mr  Greville and the baronet both  with some emotion  rose  and turned about to us   Once more  Sir Rowland  said I  my compliments to my brother—Adieu   God in heaven bless you  madam  that s all—Gentlemen  your servant  Mrs  Reeves  your most obedient humble servant  Madam  to me  you will allow me  and my nephew too  one more visit  I hope before I set out for Caermarthen   I courtesied  and joined my cousins  Away went the knight  brushing the ground with his hat  at his going out  Mr  Reeves waited on him to the outward door    Bye   bye  to you  Mr  Reeves—with some emotion  as my cousin told me afterwards —A wonderful creature  By mercy  a wonderful creature —I go away with my heart full  yet am pleased  I know not why  neither  that s the jest of it— Bye  Mrs  Reeves  I can stay no longer   An odd mortal  said the man of the town—But he seems to know on which side his bread is buttered   A whimsical old fellow  said the man of the country  But I rejoice that he has not a son  that s all   A good many frothy things passed not worth relateing    130 I wanted them both to be gone  They seemed each to think it time  but looked as if neither cared to leave the other behind him   At last  Mr  Greville  who hinted to me  that he knew I loved not too long an intrusion  bowed  and  politely enough  took his leave  And then the Baronet began  with apoligizing for his behaviour at taking leave on his last visit   Some gentlemen  I said  had one way  some another  of expressing themselves on particular occasions  He had thought fit to shew me what was his   He seemed a little disconcerted  But quickly recovering himself  he could not indeed excuse himself  he said  for having then called me cruel—Cruel  he hoped he should not find me—Proud—I knew not what pride was  Ungrateful—I could not be guilty of ingratitude  He begged me to forgive his peremptoriness—He had hoped  as he had been assured  that my affections were absolutely disengaged  that the proposals he had to make  would have been acceptable  and so positive a resusal  without any one reason assigned  and on his first visit  had indeed hurt his pride  he owned  he said  that he had some pride  and made him forget that he was addressing himself to a woman who deserved  and met with  the veneration of every one who approached her  He next expressed himself with apprehensions on Mr  Greville s arrival in town  He spoke slightly of him  Mr  Greville  I doubt not  will speak as slightly of Sir Hargrave  And if I believe them both  I fansy I shall not injure either   Mr  Greville s arrival  I said  ought not to concern me  He was to do as he thought fit  I was only desirous to be allowed the same free agency that I was ready to allow to others   That could not be  he said  Every man who saw me must wish me to be his  and endeavour to obtain his wishes   And then making vehement professions of Love  he   131 offered me large settlements  and to put it in my power to do all the good that he knew it was in my heart to do—And that I should prescribe to him in every thing as to place of residence  excursions  even to the going abroad to France  to Italy  and whereever I pleased   To all which I answered as before  and when he insisted upon my reasons for resusing him  I frankly told him  tho  I owned it was with some reluctance  that I had not the opinion of his morals that I must have of those of the man to whom I gave my hand in marriage   Of my morals  madam   starting  and his colour went and came  My morals  madam —I thought he looked with malice  But I was not intimidated  And yet my cousins looked at me with some little surprize for my plain dealing  tho  not as blaming me   Be not displeased  Sir  with my freedom  You call upon me to make objections  I mean not to upbraid you
