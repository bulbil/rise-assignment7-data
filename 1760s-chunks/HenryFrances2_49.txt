at the same Time remember  that we are sensible of a certain Horror  during the Contemplation   Have you seen that Piece  which carried the last Premium at Dijon  upon this Thesis  Whether the Re establishment of Arts and Sciences has contributed to the Refinement of Manners  I have read it  and like the Side of the Question Page  183 he has chosen  by denying it  I think  the Subject might have been handled more at large  and to better Advantage  than the Author has done there    Quid juvat innumeros scire atque evolvere Casus   Si fugienda facis  et facienda fugis   What does it import us to know the Springs of Good and Ill  while we do those Things  which we ought not to have done  and leave undone those Things  which we ought to have done  I have not yet seen the Answer to it  but  when I have  I shall probably determine the Dispute like Sir Roger de Coverley  by concluding  that much may be said on both Sides      What the Genevan says of Learning with regard to Morals  I have often said of it with regard to Understanding — That it has so overloaded the Mind of Man  that  like too full a Stomach  the digestive Powers have not Room to exert themselves  or it has confined our Reflections  by setting Bounds to our Inquiries  or given us a Biass out of the right Road  by obliging us to think too much after one another  and following in a beaten Track  When Reason attempts to exercise herself in the Mind of the Learned  she finds it  like a Storehouse  so filled with the old Trumpery of the Antients  that she has hardly Room to stretch her Limbs  I am for recurring up to the Original of all Page  184 Things  and drinking Truth at the Fountain head  not quenching my Thirst of Knowledge in polluted Streams  Rivers  in passing through populous Cities  acquire indeed a Softness and a Richness  but lose the Sweetness and Purity  which they brought from their Spring  If you want to inform yourself of Art or Science  withdraw to your Study  if of Truth or Nature  retire within yourself  Reading should be your Exercise  but Reflection your Study  Sense is a Bottle of Essence  which loses it s Strength by Dilatation  or like a Wedge of Gold  which  hammered into Plates  or drawn into Wire  extends it s Dimensions  but weakens it s Substance   Adieu   my Life   Henry   LETTER CCXLIII  FRANCES to HENRY   ROchefoucault says    In the Adversity of our best Friends we find something that does not displease us   I will not absolutely say this Maxim is verified in you  yet I cannot help observing  with what vast Calmness you have endured my Misfortunes  I do indeed believe  Page  185 that the Distresses of others furnish the best Opportunity for exerting our Philosophy   When they are lash d  we kiss the Rod   Resigning to the Will of God   And then we have such a charming Superiority  by making light of those Misfortunes  which do not affect ourselves  But I should be glad to see one of our modern Philosophers endure the Loss of Health with that Indifference  they recommend to others     If Lady — stays in the Kingdom  which is yet doubtful  she will not come to London the whole Winter  I heartily wish she may hold her Resolution of staying at —  as I hope and believe I shall spend some Time with her  for I am absolutely determined not to continue here long  When we meet  you shall know my Reasons  which  I fancy  will be sufficient to make you entirely of my Opinion  In the mean Time  I shall exert the little Strength of Body and Mind  I have left  to bear up against the Distresses of both  without complaining  I must intreat  for the present  you will not desire any Explanation from me  for I am resolved not to enter into Particulars   till I see you  which I never so earnestly longed for  as now  I could almost wish  you were as impatient to see me  we should then meet before  the Beginning of Term   However  a few Page  186 Days will make no great Difference  and I am content to wait   till Business answers the same End as Inclination   Though I never wanted the Aid of Philosophy more than now  I find myself less qualified than ever to seek it s Help    In Pain  Philosophy is Spleen  in Health   tis only Ease   — Perhaps it is owing to my Want of Health  that I find my Mind a perfect Chaos  I have not Attention sufficient to read for a Quarter of an Hour  I perceive myself frequently absent in Company  without being able to recollect  what I was thinking of  Strange Situation  — When wilt thou recall me to myself  If you have fixed the Time of your coming to Town  let me know by Return of the Post  that I may be certified  not
