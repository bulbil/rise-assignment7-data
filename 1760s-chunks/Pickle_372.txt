colourable pretext to cut him off in the  beginning of his career    A man happening to lose his life by the accidental discharge of a piece  that chanced to be in a young gentleman s hands  the account of this  misfortune no sooner reached the ears of his uncle  than he expressed  the most immoderate joy at having found so good a handle for destroying  him  under colour of law  He immediately constituted himself prosecutor   set his emissaries at work to secure a coroner s inquest suited to his  cruel purposes  set out for the place in person  to take care that the  prisoner should not escape  insulted him in jail  in the most inhuman  manner  employed a whole army of attorneys and agents  to spirit up and  carry on a most virulent prosecution  practised all the unfair methods  that could be invented  in order that the unhappy gentleman should be  transported to Newgate  from the healthy prison to which he was at first  committed  endeavoured to inveigle him into destructive confessions   and  not to mention other more infamous arts employed in the affair of  evidence  attempted to surprise him upon his trial in the absence of  his witnesses and counsel  contrary to a previous agreement with the  prosecutor s own attorney  Nay  he even appeared in person upon the  bench at the trial  in order to intimidate the evidence  and browbeat  the unfortunate prisoner at the bar  and expended above a thousand  pounds in that prosecution  In spite of all his wicked efforts  however   which were defeated by the spirit and indefatigable industry of Mr   M    the young gentleman was honourably acquitted  to the evident  satisfaction of all the impartial  the misfortune  that gave a handle  for that unnatural prosecution  appearing to a demonstration to have  been a mere accident     6 22 15  3 45 PM    In a few months  his protector  who had now openly espoused his cause   taking with him two gentlemen to witness his transactions  conducted him  to his native country  with a view to be better informed of the strength  of his pretensions  than he could be by the intelligence he had  hitherto received  or by the claimant s own dark and almost obliterated  remembrance of the facts which were essential to be known  Upon their  arrival in Dublin  application was made to those persons whom Mr   A   had named as his schoolmasters and companions  together with  the servants and neighbours of his father  These  though examined  separately  without having the least previous intimation of what the  claimant had reported  agreed in their accounts with him  as well as  with one another  and mentioned many other people as acquainted with the  same facts  to whom Mr  M   had recourse  and still met with the same  unvaried information  By these means  he made such progress in his  inquiries  that  in less than two months  no fewer than one hundred  persons  from different quarters of the kingdom  either personally   or by letters  communicated their knowledge of the claimant  in  declarations consonant with one another  as well as with the accounts  he gave of himself  Several servants who had lived with his father  and  been deceived with the story of his death  so industriously propagated  by his uncle  no sooner heard of his being in Dublin  than they came  from different parts of the country to see him  and though great pains  were taken to deceive them  they  nevertheless  knew him at first  sight  some of them fell upon their knees to thank for his preservation   embraced his legs  and shed tears of joy for his return    Although the conduct of his adversary  particularly in the  above mentioned prosecution  together with the evidence that already  appeared  were sufficient to convince all mankind of the truth of the  claimant s pretensions  Mr  M    in order to be further satisfied   resolved to see how he would be received upon the spot where he was  born  justly concluding  that if he was really an impostor  the bastard  of a kitchen wench  produced in a country entirely possessed by his  enemy and his allies  he must be looked upon in that place with the  utmost detestation and contempt    This his intention was no sooner known to the adverse party  than their  agents and friends from all quarters repaired to that place with all  possible despatch  and used all their influence with the people  in  remonstrances  threats  and all the other arts they could devise  not  only to discountenance the claimant upon his arrival  but even to spirit  up a mob to insult him  Notwithstanding these precautions  and the  servile awe and subjection in which tenants are kept by their landlords  in that part of the country  as soon as it was known that Mr  A    approached the town  the inhabitants crowded out in great multitudes  to receive and welcome
