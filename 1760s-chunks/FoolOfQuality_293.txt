at him   and   again the noble animal  with an air of fond complacence  would   hold down his head  while the little creature licked his formidable   chops  Their history  as the keeper related  was this       It was customary for all who were unable or unwilling to pay   their sixpence  to bring a dog or cat as an oblation to the beast   in lieu of money to the keeper  Among others  a fellow had   caught up this pretty black spaniel in the streets  and he was   accordingly thrown into the cage of the great lion  Immediately   the little animal trembled and shivered  and crouched and threw   itself on its back  and put forth its tongue  and held up its paws  in   supplicatory attitudes  as an acknowledgment of superior power    and praying for mercy  In the mean time  the lordly brute  instead   of devouring it  beheld it with an eye of philosophic inspection    He turned it over with one paw  and then turned it with the   other   and smelled to it  and seemed desirous of courting a further   acquaintance      The keeper  on seeing this  brought a large mess of his own   family dinner   but the lion kept aloof  and refused to eat  keeping   his eye on the dog  and inviting him as it were to be his taster    At length  the little animal s fears being something abated  and   his appetite quickened by the smell of the victuals  he approached   slowly  and  with trembling  ventured to eat  The lion then ad    vanced gently and began to partake  and they finished their meal   very lovingly together      From this day the strictest friendship commenced between   them a friendship consisting of all possible affection and tender    ness on the part of the lion  and of the utmost confidence and   boldness on the part of the dog  insomuch that he would lay         318 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      himself down to sleep within the fangs and under the jaws of his   terrible patron      A gentleman who had lost the spaniel  and had advertised a re    ward of two guineas to the finder  at length heard of the adventure    and went to reclaim his dog  You see  sir  said the keeper  it   would be a great pity to part such loving friends  However  if you   insist upon your property  you must even be pleased to take him   yourself   it is a task that I would not engage in for five hundred   guineas  The gentleman rose into great wrath  but finally chose   to acquiesce rather than have a personal dispute with the lion      As Mr  Fenton had a curiosity to see the two friends eat together    he sent for twenty pounds of beef  which was accordingly cut in   pieces  and given into the cage   when immediately the little brute    whose appetite happened to be eager at the time  was desirous   of making a monopoly of the whole  and putting his paws upon the   meat  and grumbling and barking  he audaciously flew in the face   of the lion  But the generous creature  instead of being offended   by his impotent companion  started back  and seemed terrified at   the fury of his attack  neither attempted to eat a bit till his   favourite had tacitly given permission      When they were both gorged  the lion stretched and turned   himself  and lay down in an evident posture for repose  but this his   sportive companion would not admit  He frisked and gamboled   about him  barked at him  would now scrape and tear at his head   with his claws  and again seize him by the ear  and bite and pull   away   while the noble beast appeared affected by no other senti    ment save that of pleasure and complacence      But let us proceed to the tragic catastrophe of this extraordinary   story  still known to many  as delivered down by tradition from   father to son      In about twelve months the spaniel sickened and died  and left   his loving patron the most desolate of creatures  For a time  the   lion did not appear to conceive otherwise than that his favourite   was asleep  He would continue to smell to him  and then would   stir him with his nose  and turn him over with his paw   but  find    ing that all his efforts to awake him were vain  he would traverse   his cage from end to end at a swift and uneasy pace  then stop   and look down upon him with
