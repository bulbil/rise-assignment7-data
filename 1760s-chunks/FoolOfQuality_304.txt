scripture seems to intimate  where   it says   He was made man  like unto us in all things  sin only   excepted       This was only spoken  answered Mr  Fenton  with respect to his   outward humanity  His creaturely soul indeed  and the flesh   which he derived from his mortal mother  were even as ours are    sin only excepted  But these were only as the husk or case of   his internal and divine humanity  which was conceived from the   essence of the FATHEE  by the operation of the Hoi x SPIEIT in   the womb of a pure virgin  It was this humanity to which JESUS   was intimately united  and that became one with the ever blessed   TEINITY  And it was of the ubiquity of this humanity that Christ   speaketh  when he says to Nicodemus    No man hath ascended up   to heaven but he that came down from heaven  even the son of   man which is in heaven   But when the external humanity of   Jesus was  by sufferings and death  prepared to be swallowed up   in glory  the whole CHEIST was then assumed up into Godhead    He saw all things in Jesus  as they were and shall be from eternity   to eternity  And  though the glory of his personal appearance   may be visible in certain places  yet he is invisibly present in all   places and in all hearts  begetting in them a new birth of his own   divine humanity   that their bodies may also be fashioned like unto   his glorious body   and that  when our corruptible shall have put   on incorruption  and when that our mortal shall have put on   immortality    we all may be made one  as he is in the Father    and the Father in him  that we also may be one in them     An elevation sure  well worth the hardest striving  the highest   ambition      Thus I have shown you  my Harry  the inevitable necessity of   the sufferings of our innocent Christ for the salvation of guilty   sinners  And this also shows you the equal necessity of his taking   upon himself the external imputation of the sins for which he   suffered   that he might thereby be inwardly imputed to us  and   become to us  and in us  the LOED OUE EIGHTEOUSNESS   and be   to us a better Adam  a second and divine father  regenerating us   to a birth of his own heavenly nature  And thus  as the first   Adam died unto God  and lived to fallen nature  there was a   necessity that Christ  as well in his own person as his redeemed   progeny  should die to the fallen nature  that through him they   might live again unto God      I thank you  thank you  sir  cried Harry  I shall henceforth   be enabled to give an account  to all who ask  of the faith that   is in me  But  pray  did the divine humanity of our Christ suffer   in the crucifixion      I believe it did  Harry  even as our souls are found to suffer in   our bodies  though of a nature so very different from them  It   was the suffering of this divine humanity that caused such violent         332 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      repugnance and convulsions in nature   that shut up the world   from light even at mid day   that rent the rocks   that opened the   graves  and gave up the dead to attend their Lord  and revive in   the life of his resurrection      Will you be pleased  sir  to indulge me in one question more    Could not God  in his omnipotence  have effected the salvation of   man by some other means than the sufferings of our dear Christ    I think  were it to be done again  I would rather forfeit my salvation   than that he should endure such agony on my account      I will not pretend  my Harry  to give limits or directions to the   measures of my God  neither to say what he might or might not   do within his own world  and with regard to his own creatures    But it is certain that he chose the most effectual method for   compassing his great and eternal purpose that infinite love could   dictate  infinite wisdom contrive  and infinite power execute    O  my Harry   how unutterably endeared must this measure make   our God to the universe of his creatures  and that to all eternity     it is herein that the nature of our God is revealed   it is hereby   alone that he
