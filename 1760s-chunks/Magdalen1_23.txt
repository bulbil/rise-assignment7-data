 when the reputation of a considerable house  and my tranquility  were   137 at stake  that you would prove the worst of all assassins  and stab them both to the heart  The day after to morrow  Bob  I had set apart as the most fortunate of my life  but  alas  I am now to mark it only with my tears  and to lament it as the primary source of all my present afflictions   Your friend  Mr  Melmoth  has just left me  and  though I believ d I should not be able to write in the aggravated distress of a real indisposition  and an unexpected calamity  nevertheless my heart is too full to be silent  and  when I consider not only what has happened but what is likely to result from this melancholy affair  I am fearful of losing a single moment till I try whether there may be not yet a possibility of bringing an accommodation about  and preventing the present misfortune from producing any additional cause of distress     138Mr  Melmoth  who loves you with the most friendly affection  has shewn me what you wrote to him in consequence of this unhappy affair  and I find  that  notwithstanding the infamy of your conduct on one side of the question  you are yet candid enough on the other  to aim at no palliations  I am pleased to see you generous  though I bleed to find you guilty  and am still in hopes that this latent ember of principle may be fanned into something that will yet light us on to happiness   In the whole course of your narrative you have but one objection to Miss Mildmay  and that is even grounded upon a supposition no less ungenerous than unjust  You men  however  have very contracted notions on these occasions  and generally give up that very vanity  where a lady has shewn any fatal proofs of her regard  which first of all   139 leads you to think of gaining her affections  As long as she keeps you at a distance you think yourselves the only objects whom she can ever honour with her approbation  but if  in the ungarded fulness of heart  she should unfortunately lose sight of her circumspection  and sacrifice her honour through an extravagant tenderness  that moment you sink in your own opinion  that moment you construe what is the consequence of an unbounded partiality for yourselves  into a levity of sentiment  and imagine every body else must be indulged with an equal degree of familiarity   You  brother  who have so fine a person  and so finished an address  would think it strange if any body was to tell you  with a grave face  that you were utterly unable to engage a lady s affections  yet why may not you suppose that it was the influence which you had   140 over Miss Mildmay s heart  that drew her into this unhappy mistake—Had she been actuated by any illiberal levity of sentiment  do you imagine that she would have continued  through the most trying stages of a young woman s life  from sixteen up to twenty one  without making any lapse injurious to her reputation  Do you suppose that  surrounded with admirers  and every day solicited by some of the finest young fellows in the kingdom  she would not have fallen a victim to a vehemence of constitution  Undoubtedly she would  but constitution had nothing at all to do in her character  You know I have been intimate in her family from her infancy  though you became acquainted with her so lately  and my residence  during lord Haversham s life  upon the very spot with her  gave me numberless opportunities of knowing her thoroughly—In all this time  there never was a young   141 lady who behaved with a nicer rectitude of conduct  that had so many admirers  and you may be sure  if I had not the best opinion in the world  both of her head and her heart  I should not have been so desirous of having her for a sister   So far  in reality  was Miss Mildmay from an indiscreet girl  that I place no inconsiderable share of her ruin down to the account of her virtue  When she grew old enough to be distinguished by the addresses of the men  she always made me her confidant  and often  upon my asking her what objection she could have to such or such a person  she would reply    My dear lady Haversham  the men are well enough to be sure  and so are their estates  but I don t find any thing peculiarly striking in their characters       142As it was impossible but what  in the course of our intimacy  I should frequently talk of you  and dwell  with all the partiality of a sister  upon such of your actions as I thought worthy of approbation  Louisa would listen with a fixed attention  would declare you were a charming fellow  and wish that her papa could be prevailed upon to trust her up with me to town  or that the wildness of your disposition would permit you to make a visit to the country—She longed  she said  to see you  and begged I would contrive to bring you together  but I don t know
