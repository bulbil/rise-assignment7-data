Miss Grandison  Yet is she too superior  I think     9 What can a woman do  who is addressed by a man of talents inferior to her own  Must she throw away her talents  Must she hide her light under a bushel  purely to do credit to the man  She cannot pick and choose  as men can  She has only her negative  and  if she is desirous to oblige her friends  not always that  Yet it is said  Women must not encourage Fops and Fools  They must encourage Men of Sense only  And it is well said  But what will they do  if their lot be cast only among Foplings  If the Men of Sense do not offer themselves  And pray  may I not ask  if the taste of the age  among the men  is not Dress  Equi  and Foppery  Is the cultivation of the mind any part of their study  The men  in short  are sunk  my dear  and the women but barely swim   Lord G  seems a little too finical in his dress  And yet I am told  that Sir Walter Watkyns outdoes him in Foppery  What can they mean by it  when Sir Charles Grandison is before them  He scruples not to modernize a little  but then you see  that it is in compliance with the fashion  and to avoid singularity  a sault to which great minds are perhaps too often subject  tho  he is so much above it   I want to know  methinks  whether Sir Charles is very much in earnest in his favour to Lord G  with regard to Miss Grandison  I doubt not  if he be  but he has good reasons for it   Were this vile Sir Hargrave out of my head  I could satisfy myself about twenty and twenty things  that now and then I want to know   Miss Jervois behaved very discreetly  With what pleasure did she hang on every word that fell from the lips of her guardian  I thought more than once of Swift s Cadenus and Vanessa  Poor girl  how I should pity her  were she insensibly to suffer her gratitude to lead her to be in Love with her benefactor  Indeed  I pity every body who is hopelesly in Love   Now don t you shake your head  my uncle  Did I not   10 always pity Mr  Orme  and Mr  Fowler —You know I did  Lucy   Miss Jervois had a smile ready for every one  but it was not an implicit  a childish smile  It had distinction in it  and shewed intelligence  Upon the whole  she said little  and heard all that was said with attention  And hence I pronounce her a very discreet young Lady   But I thought to have done with the Men first  and here is Mr  Grandison  hardly mentioned  who  yet  in his own opinion  was not the last of the men at table   Mr  Grandison is a man of middling stature  not handsome in my eyes  but so near being handsome  that he may be excused  when one knows him  for thinking himself so  because he is liable to make greater mistakes than that   He dresses very gaily too  He is at the head of the fashion  as  it seems  he thinks  but  however  is one of the first in it  be it what it will  He is a great frequenter of the drawing room  of all manner of publick spectacles  a leader of the taste at a new Play  or Opera  He dances  he sings  he laughs  and values himself on all three qualifications  And yet certainly has sense  but is not likely to improve it much  since he seems to be so much afraid of suffering in the consequence he thinks himself of  that whenever Sir Charles applies himself to him  upon any of his levities  tho  but by the eye  his consciousness  however mild the look  makes him shew an uneasiness at the instant  He reddens  sits in pain  calls for favour by his eyes  and his quivering lips  and has  notwithstanding  a smile ready to turn into a laugh  in order to lessen his own sensibilty  should he be likely to suffer in the opinion of the company  But every motion shews his consciousness of inferiority to the man  of whose smiles or animadversions he is so very apprehensive     11 What a captious  what a supercilious husband  to a woman who should happen to have a stronger mind than his  would Mr  Grandison make  But he values himself upon his having preserved his liberty   I believe there are more bachelors now in England  by many thousands  than were a few years ago  And  probably  the numbers of them  and of single women  of course  will every year increase  The luxury of the age will account a good deal for this  and the turn our Sex take in un domesticating themselves  for a good deal more  But let not these worthy young women  who may think themselves destined to a single life
