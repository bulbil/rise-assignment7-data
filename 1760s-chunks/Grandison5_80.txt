him thither for a few days   Camilla came to me from her two Ladies  and the Marquis  All three  she told me  were indisposed  Their enquiries after my health were very tender  The Marquis bid her tell me  that he hoped to be well enough to make me a visit before I set out  Jeronymo wished to see me first  if I had opportunity  But  as I probably must  if I go  see Lady Clementina  and another solemn parting will follow  I think it will be best  for both our sakes  as well as for Jeronymo s  not to obey him  and so I hinted by Camilla   The Count of Belvedere has made me a visit  He is setting out for Parma  Not one word passed his lips about Lady Clementina  or her family  He was very earnest with me  to promise him a visit at his palace  I gave him room to expect me  By his silence on a subject so near his heart  as well as by the very great respect he paid me  I have no reason to doubt but he knows the situation I am in with Clementina  She will have his prayers  I dare say  for perseverance in her present way of thinking  Indeed now  everybody s of her family—for who can doubt the General s  Page  200 She would have had mine to the same purpose  the more sincerely  had not they all joined to indulge my hopes  and had she not given such instances of the noblest of female minds   But  how great soever may be the occasion given me for fortitude  by a resolution so unexpected by every body from Lady Clementina  I cannot be deprived of all pleasure  since the contents of my last pacquets  as well those from Paris as from England  afford me a great deal   Every thing is done at Paris  that I could have wished  in relation to Mr  Danby s legacy   Lord W  lets me know  that he thinks himself every day happier than in the past with his Lady  who also subscribes to the same acknowledgment   Our Beauchamp tells me  that he wants only my company to make him the happiest of men  He requests me to write a Letter of thanks  in my own name  to Lady Beauchamp  on his dutiful acknowledgment to me of her kindness to him  I will with pleasure comply  and the sooner  as I am sure that gratitude for past benefits  and not expectation of new ones  is his motive   He laments in postscript  that his father is taken with a threatening disorder  I am sorry for it  Methinks I am interested in the life and health of Sir Harry Beauchamp  I hope he will long enjoy the happiness  of which his son says he is extremely sensible  Should he die  the Lady will be a great deal in my Beauchamp s power  large as her jointure is  If he be not  on such an event  as obliging to her  as he now is  and forget not all past disobligations  I shall not have the opinion of his heart that I now have  Our Beauchamp wants but the trial of prosperity  a much more arduous one than that of adversity  to be upon full proof an excellent man   Lady Mansfield  with equal joy and gratitude  acquaints me  that my presence in England is only Page  201 wanting to bring to a decision every point that now remains in debate with her adversaries  the Keelings  they having shewn themselves inclinable  by the mediation of Sir John Lambton  to compromise on the terms I had advised she should get proposed  as from me  and the wicked Bolton having also made proposals  that perhaps ought to be accepted if he cannot be brought to amend them   Two of Emily s Letters of distant date are come together  I will write to the dear girl by the next mail  and let her know how much absence endears to me my friends   You give me joy my dear Dr  Bartlett  in acquainting me with the happiness of Lord and Lady G  I will write to my Charlotte upon it  and thank her for the credit she does me by her affectionate behaviour to that honest and obliging man   How happy are you  my dear friend  and Lord and Lady G  and Emily  at Miss Byron s  I am charmed with the characters you give me of her family   But I have Letters brought by the same mail  that are not so agreeable as those I have taken notice of  They are from Lady Olivia  and my poor cousin Grandison   That unhappy woman is to be my disturbance  She is preparing  she says  to come back to Italy  She execrates  She threatens  Poor woman  But no more of her at present   My cousin is by this time  I suppose  at Paris  He writes  that he was on the point of setting out  in pursuance of my advice  and will wait there for my direction to proceed to Italy  or not  I shall write to him to continue there till he hears further
