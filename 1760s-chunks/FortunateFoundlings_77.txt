an admirable duetto  and begs you would   employ your genius on that score and send it by me       Poor Louisa  who took his words literally  and thought her present   circumstances too discordant for the fulfilling his request  opened the   supposed piece of music with an aking heart  but when she had perused   it  and found the artifice her lover had made use of to communicate his   generous intentions to her  it is extremely fine  said she to the valet    and I will do what he requires to the best of my power  but fear I shall   not be able to give it such a turn as he may expect  If you please    continued she  to wait a little  I shall not be long before I dispatch   you  In speaking these words she went into her closet  and read over and   over the offers he had made  in which  with the strictest examination    she could find nothing but what indicated the most perfect love  honour    and generosity  In the first transports of her soul she was tempted to   comply  but her second thoughts were absolutely against it   Those very   reasons which would have prevailed with almost any other woman  made her   obstinate to refuse   the more she found him worthy  the less could she   support the thoughts of giving him a beggar for a wife  and the more she   loved him  the less could she content to be obliged to him  so she took   but a small time for consideration  before she returned an answer in   these terms        To the most accomplished  and most generous monsieur  DU PLESSIS           As it was not owing to my pride or vanity    but merely compliance with the will of   Melanthe  that my real meanness was made a   secret  I find it revealed without any mortification    but  monsieur  the distance between us   is not shortened by being known  as the consciousness   of my unworthiness remains with   me  and ever must do so  I again repeat the   impossibility of accepting your too generous passion    and  after this  you will not wonder I   should refuse those other obliging offers you are   so good to make   I left my native country   with Melanthe  devoted myself to her service   while she was pleased to continue me in it  and   only wait her commands for my doing so  or to   return to England   I believe  by what her   woman told me this day  the latter will be my   fate   Think not  however  most truly worthy   of your whole sex  that I want eyes to distinguish   your merits  or a heart capable of being   influenced by them  perhaps too deeply for my   own future peace   this is a confession I would   not have made  were I ever to see you more    but as I am determined to shut myself from all   the world during my abode at Venice  I thought   I owed this little recompence to the generous   affection you express for me  and had rather you   should think any thing of me  than that I am   ungrateful       LOUISA        P S   I beg  monsieur  after this  you will not   attempt either to speak or write to me           When she had sent this away  she fell into fresh complainings at the   severity of her fate  which constrained her to refuse what most she   languished for   the uncertainty how she should be disposed of was also   a matter of grief   she was at this time a prisoner in Melanthe s house    she had sent several messages to that lady  by her woman  entreating to   know in what she had offended  but could receive no other answer than   abuses  without one word which gave her the least light into the cause   of this strange treatment  but that morning she was informed  by the   same woman  that her Lady protested she should never more come into her   presence  and that she would send her home  this  as she had wrote to   monsieur du Plessis  seemed highly probable  as there was no appearance   of a reconciliation  and the thoughts in what manner she should begin   her life again  on her return  filled her with many anxieties  which    joined to others of a different nature  rendered her condition   truly pitiable       It was in the midst of these perplexing meditations that word was   brought her from Melanthe  that she must
