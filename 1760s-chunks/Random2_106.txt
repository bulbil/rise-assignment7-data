words are incapable of doing justice to this affecting circumstance  I am obliged to draw a veil over it  and observe  that I returned in the dark to the house of Mrs  Sagely  who was overjoy d to hear of my success  and opposed the tumults of my grief with such strength of reason  that my mind regained in some measure its tranquility  and that very night  after having forced upon this good gentlewoman a purse of twenty guineas  as a token of my gratitude and esteem  I took my leave of her  set out on foot for the inn  where my arrival freed honest Strap from the horrors of unutterable dread   We took horse immediately  and alighted early next morning at Deal  where I found my uncle in great concern on account of my absence  because he had received his dispatches  and must have weighed with the first fair wind  whether I had been on board or not —Next day  a brisk easterly gale springing up  we set sail  and in eight and forty hours got clear of the Channel   When we were about 200 leagues from the Land s end  the captain taking me apart into the cabbin  told me  that  now he was permitted by his instructions  he would disclose the intent and destination of our voyage     The ship  said he  which has been fitted out at a great expence  is bound for the coast of Guinea  where we shall exchange part of our cargo for slaves and gold dust  from thence we will transport our negroes to Buenos Ayres in New Spain  where  by virtue of passports obtained from our own court  and that of Madrid  we will dispose of them and the goods that remain on board for silver  by means of our supercargo  who is perfectly well acquainted   320 with the coast  the lingo and inhabitants  —  Being thus let into the secret of our expedition  I borrowed of the supercargo a Spanish grammar  dictionary  and some other books of the same language  which I studied with such application  that before we arrived in New Spain  I could maintain a conversation with him in that tongue —Being arrived in the warm latitudes  I ordered  with the captain s consent  the whole ship s company to be blooded and purged  myself undergoing the same evacuation  in order to prevent those dangerous fevers to which northern constitutions are subject in hot climates  and I have reason to believe that this precaution was not unserviceable  for we lost but one sailor during our whole passage to the coast     One day  when we had been about five weeks at sea  we descried to windward a large ship bearing down upon us with all the sail she could carry  Upon which  my uncle ordered the studding sails to be hoisted  and the ship to be cleared for engaging  but finding  that  to use the seamen s phrase  we were very much wronged by the ship which had us in chace  and which by this time had hoisted French colours  he commanded the studding sails to be taken in  the courses to be clewed up  the main top sail to be backed  the tompions to be taken out of the guns  and every man to repair to his quarters  While every body was busied in the performance of these orders  Strap came upon the quarter deck  trembling  and and looking aghast  and  with a voice half suppressed by fear  asked if I thought we were a match for the vessel in pursuit of us  Observing his consternation  I said     What  are you afraid  Strap     Afraid   he replied  n n no    321 what should I be afraid of  I thank God I have a clear conscience —but I believe it will be a bloody battle  and I wish you may not have occasion for another hand to assist you in the cockpit  —  I immediately perceived his drift  and making the captain acquainted with his situation  desired he might be stationed below with me and my mates  My uncle  incensed at his pusilanimity  bid me send him down instantly  that his fear might not insect the ship s company  whereupon I told the poor steward  that I had begg d him for an assistant  and desired him to go down and help my mates to get ready the instruments and dressings —Notwithstanding the satisfaction he must have felt at these tidings  he affected a shyness of quitting the upper deck  and said  he hoped I did not imagine he was afraid to do his duty above board  for he believed himself as well prepared for death as any man in the ship  no disparagement to me or the captain —I was disgusted at this affectation  and in order to punish his hypocrisy  assured him  he might either go down to the cockpit  or stay upon deck during the engagement  Alarmed at this indifference  he replied    Well  to oblige you  I ll go down  but remember it is more for your sake than my own    So saying  he disappeared in a twinkling  without waiting for an answer —By this time we could
