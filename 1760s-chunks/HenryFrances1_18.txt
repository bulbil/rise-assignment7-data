 therefore  for the Sake of Peace and Friendship  let our Correspondence end here   Adieu   Frances     46  LETTER XXXIII  HENRY to FRANCES   YOU began your last with a Quotation which aptly describes the Life  we have led for some Time past  but that I think our s is more unaccountable  for  tho  a Dog and Cat begin with Squabbling  yet Use soon reconciles them to each other  and I have seen them  in a short Time  quietly occupy each a Chimney Corner  as becomes domestick Animals to do  While  on the contrary  we met  at first with that mutual Love and good Liking  which might promise a long and constant Harmony  yet were not one Month acquainted  before Puss  in her Majesty  had her Back up  and Curr fell a Snarling  as if Use  Habit  or Custom  whose constant Strife is against Nature  made a Sport of reconciling Antipathies  and destroying Sympathies   But  to quit this Allegory  I beg my Dear  you will consider  that I never reprimanded you for any Thing  but what I thought some Injury to your Fortune  Character  or Health  mostly the Last  for the First is too small for Oeconomy  and the Second too good for Scandal  But you are constantly complaining of bad Health  and yet always doing the very Things which destroy it  you are eternally taking Medicines    47 and  at the same Time  doing irregular Things  to prevent their Operation  Now it is probable that there are but few Drugs in an Apothecary s Shop  which may be said  if they do no Good  to do no Harm  so that you may find the best Medicines  without a Regimen  turn to Poison  and  tho  frequent Parties to Ranelagh may be extremely agreeable to the Rules of a Novel —they are  I assure you  quite contrary to the Laws of Physick  Such Irregularities  or Excess of any Kind  may not probably  so soon as you imagine  answer the End you have sometimes so wickedly wished for  the End of Life  but may  perhaps  take that shocking Turn  I mentioned to you lately  from an Hint of your Physicians  who said you sometimes spoke like a Person who was going mad  and  with Regard to your Health  you acted like one that was so   If  from all these Apprehensions  I should endeavour to exert  perhaps  a little too roughly  the Power and Influence I thought I had over you  and which I never will make Use of  but for your own Advantage  I was in Hopes of having the Reason and Nature of the Thing calmly and dispassionately considered  and expected your Thanks  tho  I acted not on so poor a Motive  rather than your Resentment   But I have done  and do here promise you  that I will never give you any farther Offence   48 this Way  for I find you will have no Regard to your Health  for your own Sake  and am afraid you have not Kindness enough to take Care of it  for mine  so I shall  at least  keep the Sentiments of my Heart to myself  however I may be made uneasy with the Affections of it   Adieu   Henry   LETTER XXXIV   My dearest FANNY   I VENTURED no farther than this  To day  for I had a great deal of Rain on the Road  and was afraid to push on  thro  the Night Air  for the three Reasons I gave you this Morning  as the sole Things which could make me uneasy at the Thoughts of Death  I am now very well  thank your asking  have just dined  and am drinking your Health   I thought  with great Pleasure  of your Meeting me at — upon my Return  but I do hereby release you from that Promise  for  coming by the House  I saw  even this bad Day  three genteel Coaches  two Hacks  a Post Chaise  and two Four wheeled Chairs unharnessed before the Door  now it is possible  and very probable  that some Person  in every one of these   49 Equis  know both you and me  and the Pleasures I enjoy  in your Love  are not from open Vanity  but secret Pride  and    Like a good Conscience  solid Joy supplies     Of which  whoever could boast  never knew the Sweets  I would steal to your Love  as Misers to their Wealth  lest the Suspicion of it might tempt others to   where my Treasure is  for there  indeed my Heart is also   You see  what a Platonick you have made me  for I speak of intellectual Joys now  as warmly  as I used to do of the Pleasures of Sense  But  in short  what I mean by all this  is  that  since our Meeting at — would not have the charming Consequences of such a frolick Appearance  I should not chuse to act  Hypocrisy against the Devil   and leave the World Room
