Esq       Dear Sir  The trial of our recreant knight is at hand  and  if   you insist upon it  shall be prosecuted to the utmost extent of our   laws  The wretch  indeed  deserves to be gibbeted  But he has   relations of worth and consideration among us  They have be    sought me to shield them from shame on this occasion   and I join   them in requesting you to accept the enclosed order for three   thousand pounds in favour of your client  together with his farm   and effects  which attorney Snack shall immediately restore        Let me have your answer within three days   and believe me   Your true  as well as obliged servant    PORTLAND       The day following Mr  Fenton sent Harry in his chariot  attended   by Mr  James and two servants in livery  to return his acknow    ledgments to the favourite of the king      Lord Portland received our hero with pleasure and surprise   equally evident in his countenance  As he piqued himself on being   one of the finest personages in the nation  he secretly respected his   own resemblance in another      After a few mutual compliments  and some occasional discourse    the earl told Harry that he must take a private dinner with him    We are quite alone  says he  only two viscounts  a baronet  and four   or five gentlemen of the ministerial quill  Pray  my lord  said   Harry smiling  is a dinner the whole of their pension  Not so  sir    I confess   they are the Swiss of the lettered world  and fight for   pay  They were formerly of the opposite junto  but they have   changed their opinions along with their party  and our honour   obliges us to give them at least as much in the cause of the crown    as they formerly got in the cause of the populace  I doubt  my   lord  returned Harry  that their silence would answer your ends   full as well as their oratory  unless your treasury could hold out in   bribing people to read also  Very pleasantly severe  indeed  replied   the laughing earl  But come  the bell calls us to dinner      When dinner was over  and cheerfulness circulated with the   bottle I would give a good deal to know  Mr  Harry  said the earl    what you and your father think of his majesty and his ministers    Should I speak my downright sentiments  my lord  answered   Harry  in some things I might offend  and in others appear to flatter    0  you cannot offend in the least  cried the earl   we are daily   accustomed to be told of all the faults whereof we are  or may be    or might have been guilty   and  as to flattery  you know it is the   food of us courtiers  Why  my lord  you want no champion for the   present  said Harry   you are all  as I perceive  on one side of the   question   and if some one does not appear  however impotent  to   oppose you  the shuttlecock of conversation may fall to the ground    Right  very right  my sweet fellow  rejoined his lordship  pro    ceed  you shall have nothing but fair play  I promise you      To be serious then  said Harry  my father thinks  in the first   place  for I have no manner of skill in such matters  he thinks  I   say  that his majesty is one of the greatest warriors and one of the   wisest statesmen that ever existed  He thinks  however  that he         300 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      has attachments and views that look something further than the   mere interests of the people by whom he has been elected   but he   says that those views ought  in a measure  to be indulged in return   for the very great benefits that he has done us  lie is therefore   grieved to find  that his majesty has met with so much reluctance   and coldness from a nation so obliged      You are a darling of a politician   exclaimed the earl   but we   will not thank you for your compliments till we know what you   have further to object against us      My father admits  my lord  that his majesty and his ministers have   re established and exhibited  in a fair and open light  the most   glorious constitution that ever was constructed  But then he ap    prehends that you are beginning to sap the foundations of the pile
