threading a narrow pass between two mountains  when we came within sight of a gentleman defending himself bravely against three men  who all fell upon him together  I did not hesitate about going to his aid  but hastened forward and planted myself by his side  I remarked while we were fighting  that our enemies were masked  and that we had to do with expert swordsmen  But we triumphed over the united advantages of their skill and disparity  I ran one of the three through the body  he fell from his horse  and the two others immediately betook themselves to flight  The victory indeed was scarcely less fatal to us than to the wretch whom I had killed  for we were both dangerously wounded  But conceive my surprise  when I discovered the gentleman to be Combados  the husband of Donna Helena  He was no less astonished at recognizing me as his defender  Ah  Don Gaston  exclaimed he  was it you  then  who came to my assistance  When you took my part so generously  you little thought it was the person who had snatched your mistress from you  I really did not know it  answered I  but though I had  do you think I could have wavered about doing as I have done  Can you entertain so ill an opinion of me  as to believe my soul so sordid  No  no  replied he  I think better of you  and should I die of my wounds  it will be my prayer that yours may not disable you from profiting by my death  Combados  said I  though I have not yet forgotten Donna Helena  know that I do not pant after the possession of her charms at the expense of your life  so far from it  that I congratulate myself on having contributed to your rescue from assassination  since by so doing I have performed an acceptable service to your wife  While we were communing together  my servant dismounted  and drawing near to the gentleman stretched at his length  took off his mask  when Combados  with sensations of gratitude for his deliverance  distinctly traced the features  It is Caprara  exclaimed he  that treacherous cousin who  in mere disgust at having missed a rich inheritance which he had unjustly disputed with me  has long since cherished a murderous design against my life  and fixed on this day to put it in execution  but heaven has turned him over to its determined vengeance  and made him the victim of his own attempt   While this conversation was going on  our blood was flowing at the same rate  and we were becoming more exhausted every minute  Nevertheless  disabled as we were  we had strength enough to reach the town of Villaréjo  which lies within gun shot or two from the field of battle  At the very first house of call we sent for surgeons  The most expert came at our summons  He examined our wounds  and reported them as dangerous  After taking off the bandages and dressing them a second time  he pronounced those of Don Blas to be mortal  Of mine he thought more favourably  and the event corresponded with his prognostic   Combados  finding himself consigned to the grave  thought only of due preparation for a most serious event  He sent an express to his wife  with an account for what had happened  particularizing his present sad condition  Donna Helena soon arrived at Villaréjo  Her mind was drawn different ways by two opposite occasions of distress  the hazard of her husband s life  and the fear of feeling the revival of a half extinguished flame at the sight of me  This sight occasioned her to experience a terrible agitation  Madam  said Don Blas  when she appeared in his presence  you are come just in time to receive my farewell  I am at the point of death  and I consider my fate as a punishment from heaven for having taken you from Don Gaston by a feint  far from murmuring at it  I exhort you with my last breath to restore to him a heart which I had stolen from him  Donna Helena answered him only by her tears  and indeed it was the best answer she could make  for she had neither forgotten her first love  nor the artifices whereby she had been influenced to renounce her plighted faith   It happened as the surgeon had anticipated  that in less than three days Combados died of his wounds  while mine on the contrary wore the appearance of convalescence  The young widow  whom no earthly considerations could detach from the care of transporting her late husband s remains to Coria  that they might be deposited with due honours in the family vault  left Villaréjo on her return  after inquiring  merely as a matter of course  how I was going on  As soon as I was well enough to be removed  I bent my course to Coria  where my recovery was soon ascertained  My aunt  Donna Eleonora  and Don George de Galisteo  were determined that my marriage with Helena should take place forthwith  lest some new caprice of fortune should part us once more  The ceremony was privately performed  on account of the late melancholy event  and within a few days I returned to Madrid with Donna Helena
