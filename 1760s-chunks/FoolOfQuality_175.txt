be my little Fanny Goodall     Yes  my dearest cousin  answered the countess  as surely as you   are the still too amiable Harry Clinton      Hereupon they both rose suddenly  and Mr  Fenton  catching   his quondam Fanny in his arms  pressed her to his bosom with   warm and kindred affection  But the agitation of the countess was   too big for utterance   till  resuming her chair  she gave scope to   her passion  and burst into a violent flood of tears      After a mutual and affecting silence Ah   cries Mr  Fenton  in   a voice expressive of much emotion  how am I  my lovely cousin    to interpret these tears  Am I to consider them as further proofs   of your ancient aversion to me  or as kindly and dear instances   of your returning affection  The countess answered not  and   Mr  Fenton continued      You may remember  my cousin  that I had very few relations    My only brother ever continued to behave himself towards me as   an alien and an enemy   and my only uncle and guardian  who in   his later years became your father  was no way agreeable to my   taste or disposition  In you  therefore  from your infancy in   you alone  my amiable cousin I had centred all my sensations   of fatherhood  brotherhood  all the affections and tender feelings   that naturally arise from kindred and consanguinity  How have   I been delighted with your infantine prattle   how have I exulted   in your opening charms   On the death of my first wife you were   my only consolation   and in your innocent caresses and attractive   endearments I felt a sweetness of emotion that I never felt before      On my return from France  with what transports did you receive   me   we grew  as it were  in our embracements to each other  You   were then  as I apprehend  about ten years of age  But on my next   visit you refused to be seen by me  Soon after you were taken ill    I daily went with an aching heart to inquire after your health   but   your mamma peremptorily refused me admission to your presence    till  on your recovery  you were conveyed from me  and secreted   into the country      Though this unkindness went near my heart  it did not alter my   affections   I still continued to inquire after you  I still continued   to be interested in you  and I preferred my ardent wishes and   prayers to heaven for your prosperity      Mr  Fenton  said Lady Maitland  you have unquestionably your         174 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      reasons for choosing to be so called   I am very sensible  sir  I say    of your extraordinary partiality to me from my earliest years  Your   tenderness  as you mentioned  was that of the fondest of fathers   or brothers  You knew the degree and kind of affection that was   suitable between such relations  and you kept yourself precisely   within the limits  But  alas  for my part I knew no such dis    tinctions  I was as a piece of virgin wax  warmed and willingly   yielding to the first kindly impression  You made that impression    my cousin you made it deep and entire  As I had but the one   heart  so I had but the one love   and that love was all your own    without distinction or degree      Gracious heaven   exclaimed Mr  Fenton  what is this you tell   me  madam   Is it possible that  at your years  you should actually   conceive a passion for one who might almost have been your grand    father   Ah   if that be the case  what have I not to answer for   indulging you and myself in those innocent caresses  which at that   time fondly constituted the most pleasing sensations of my life      Alas  replied the countess  if you have any thing to answer   for on that account  the charge indeed is very weighty which   I have to bring against you      I was not eight years old when I begged this picture from you    which you generously enriched with this circlet of diamonds    Soon after  you went to France   and during your absence this   picture was my constant companion  whom I caressed  whom I   talked to  and to whom alone I made my complaints in all my little   matters of grievance      I know not by what instinct or kind of cunning it was  that
