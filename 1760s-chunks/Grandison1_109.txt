arrival  in two conversations  he drew in his horns  as we say  and now reverences those good qualities which  however  he has not the grace to imitate  Now I will not answer  but you may have a visit from him  to see the loveliest woman in England  If he comes  see him  or not  as you please  and think not yourself under any civil obligation to my brother  or me  to go out of your own way  But I hope he will not be so impertinent  I don t wish you to see him out of my brother s company  because you will see him then to his own advantage  And yet he has such a notion that we women love to be admired  and to have handsome things said to us  that he imagines  the visit of a man  made for that purpose  will give him as free a welcome to the finest woman in the world  as painters give to those who come to see their pictures  and for the like reason  But no more of Mr  Grandison  Yet I thought proper to prepare you  if he should take so confident a liberty   I thanked her   Well but  my dear  you seem to have a long parcel of writing before you  One  two  three  four—Eight leaves—Upon my word —But Mr  Reeves told me you are a writer  and that you gave an account of all that befel you  to our grandmother Shirley  to our  268 uncle and aunt Selby  to our cousins Lucy and Nancy—You see I remember every name  And will you one day let me see what you write   Most willingly  madam—  Madam  interrupted she  So formal  Charlotte say  With all my heart  my ever amiable  my everkind  Charlotte   So  so—Well may the men say  we love flattery  when rather than want it  we will flatter one another   I was going to disclaim flattery  Hush  hush  hush  my dear  I doubt not your sincerity  You are a grateful and good girl  But dare you  will you  shew me all and every thing about that Greville  that Orme  that Fowler  that Fenwick —You see  I forget none of the names that your cousin Reeves told me of on Saturday last  and which I made you talk of last Sunday   All and every thing  Miss Grandison  But will you tell me of your gentleman   Will I  No doubt of it  How can young women be together one quarter of an hour  and not lead one another into talk of their Lovers  Lord  my dear  those secrets  Sir Charles once said  are the cement of young womens friendships   And could Sir Charles—  Could Sir Charles —Yes  yes  yes  Do you think a man can be a judge of human nature  and leave women out of the question  Why  my dear  he finds us out in a minute  Take care of yourself  Harriet—If—  I shall be afraid of him—  What if you have a good conscience  my dear —She then looked very archly  She made me blush  She look d more archly  I blush d  I believe  a deeper dye   Did I not tell you  Lucy  that she could do what she pleased with her eyes —But what did she mean by this     269 In my conscience  my Harriet  little or much  I believe we women are all rogues in our hearts   And does Miss Grandison say that from her own conscience   I believe I do  But I must fly  I have ten more visits to pay before I go home to dress  You will tell me all about your fellows  you say   And you will tell me about your entanglement  as you called it   Why that s a difficulty upon me  But you must encourage me by your freedom  and we will take up our wretches and lay them down again  one by one  as we run them over  and bid them lie still and be quiet till we recal them to our memory   But I have not one Lover  my Charlotte  to tell you of  I always gave them their dismission—  And I have but two  that at present I care to own  and they won t be dismissed  But then I have half a dozen  I believe  that have said extravagant things to me  and we must look upon them as Lovers elect  you know  who  only want to be coquetted with   Miss Grandison  I hope  cannot think of coquetting   Not much  only a little now and then  to pay the men in their own coin   Charming vivacity  said I  I shall be undone  if you don t love me   No fear  no fear of that —I am a whimsical creature  but the sun is not more constant in his course than I am steady in my friendships  And these communications on both sides will rivet us to each other  if you treat me not with reserve   She arose
