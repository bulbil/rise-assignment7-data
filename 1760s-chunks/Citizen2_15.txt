becomes great  Does a poet string up trite sentiments in rhyme  he also becomes the great man of the hour  How diminutive soever the object of admiration  each is followed by a crowd of still more diminutive admirers  The shout begins in his train  onward he marches toward immortality  looks back at the pursuing crowd with self satisfaction  catching all the oddities  the whimsies  the absurdities  and the littlenesses of conscious greatness  by the way   I was yesterday invited by a gentleman to dinner  who promised that our entertainment should consist of an haunch of venison  a turtle  and a great man  I came  according to appointment  The venison was fine  the turtle good  but the great man insupportable  The moment I ventured to speak  I was at once contradicted with a snap  I attempted  by a second and a third assault  to retrieve my lost reputation  but was still beat back with confusion  I was resolved to attack him once more from entrenchment  and turned the conversation upon the government of China  but even here he asserted  snapped  and contradicted as before  Heavens  thought I  this man pretends to know China even better than myself  I looked round to see who was on my side  but every eye was fixed in admiration on the great man  I therefore  at last thought proper to sit silent  and act the pretty gentleman during the ensuing conversation   When a man has once secured a circle of admirers  he may be as ridiculous here as he thinks proper    42 and it all passes for elevation of sentiment  or learned absence  If he transgresses the common forms of breeding  mistakes even a tea pot for a tobacco box  it is said  that his thoughts are fixed on more important objects  to speak and act like the rest of mankind is to be no greater than they  There is something of oddity in the very idea of greatness  for we are seldom astonished at a thing very much resembling ourselves   When the Tartars make a Lama  their first care is to place him in a dark corner of the temple  here he is to sit half concealed from view  to regulate the motion of his hands  lips  and eyes  but  above all  he is enjoined gravity and silence  This  however  is but the prelude to his apotheosis  a set of emissaries are dispatched among the people to cry up his piety  gravity  and love of raw flesh  the people take them at their word  approach the Lama  now become an idol  with the most humble prostration  he receives their addresses without motion  commences a god  and is ever after fed by his priests with the spoon of immortality  The same receipt in this country serves to make a great man  The idol only keeps close  sends out his little emissaries to be hearty in his praise  and straight  whether statesman or author  he is set down in the list of fame  continuing to be praised while it is fashionable to praise  or while he prudently keeps his minuteness concealed from the public   I have visited many countries  and have been in cities without number  yet never did I enter a town which could not produce ten or twelve of those little great men  all fancying themselves   43 known to the rest of the world  and complimenting each other upon their extensive reputation  It is amusing enough when two of those domestic prodigies of learning mount the stage of ceremony  and give and take praise from each other  I have been present when a German doctor  for having pronounced a panegyric upon a certain monk  was thought the most ingenious man in the world  till the monk soon after divided this reputation by returning the compliment  by which means they both marched off with universal applause   The same degree of undeserved adulation that attends our great man while living  often also follows him to the tomb  It frequently happens that one of his little admirers sits down big with the important subject  and is delivered of the history of his life and writings  This may properly be called the revolutions of a life between the fireside and the easy chair  In this we learn  the year in which he was born  at what an early age he gave symptoms of uncommon genius and application  together with some of his smart sayings  collected by his aunt and mother  while yet but a boy  The next book introduces him to the university  where we are informed of his amazing progress in learning  his excellent skill in darning stockings  and his new invention for papering books to save the covers  He next makes his appearance in the republic of letters  and publishes his folio  Now the colossus is reared  his works are eagerly bought up by all the purchasers of scarce books  The learned societies invite him to become a member  he disputes against some foreigner with a long Latin name  conquers in the controversy  is complimented by several authors of   44 gravity and importance  is excessively fond of egg sauce with his pig  becomes president of a literary club  and dies in the meridian of his glory  Happy they
