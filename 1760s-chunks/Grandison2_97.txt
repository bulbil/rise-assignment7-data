present my own  I am  and will be ever  my dear Lucy   Your affectionate HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXVI  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Monday  Mar  13   I WILL now tell you  who the Lady is  to whom the two sisters have given their interest   It is Lady Anne S  the only daughter of the Earl of S  A vast fortune  it seems  independent of her father  and yet certain of a very great one from him  She is to be here this very afternoon  on a visit to the two Ladies  With all my heart  I hope she is a very agreeable Lady  I hope she has a capacious mind  I   242 hope—I don t know what to hope—And why  Because I find myself out to be a selfish wretch  and don t wish her to be so fine and so good a woman  as I say I do  Is Love  if I must own Love  a narrower of the Heart —I don t know whether  while it is in suspense  and is only on one side  it be not the parent of jealousy  envy  dissimulation  making the person pretend generosity  disinterestedness  and I cannot tell what  but secretly wishing  that her rival may not be so worthy  so lovely  as she pretends to wish her to be —Ah  Lucy  were one sure  one could afford to be generous  One might then look down with pity upon a rival  instead of being mortified with apprehensions of being looked down upon   But I will be just to the education given me  and the examples set me  Whatever I shall be able to do  or to wish  while I am in suspense  when any happy woman becomes the wife of Sir Charles Grandison  I will revere her  and wish her  for his sake as well as her own  all the felicities that this world can afford  and if I cannot do this from my heart  I will disown that heart   The two Ladies set upon Mr  Grandison on Sunday  to get out of him the business that carried Sir Charles so often of late to Canterbury  But tho  he owned  that he was not injoined secrecy  he affected to amuse them  and strangely to romance  hinting to them a story of a fine woman in love with him  and he with her  yet neither of them thinking of marriage  Mr  Grandison valued not truth  nor scrupled solemn words  tho  ludicrously uttered  to make the most improbable stuff perplexing and teazing  and then the wretch laughed immoderately at the suspense he supposed he had caused   What witless creatures  what mere nothings  are these beaux  fine fellows  and laughers  of men —how silly must they think us women —And how   243 silly indeed are such of us  as can keep in countenance  at our own expence  their folly   He was left alone with me for half an hour last night  and  in a very serious manner  besought me to receive his addresses  I was greatly displeased with the two sisters  for I thought they intended to give him this opportunity  by their manner of withdrawing  Surely  thought I  I am not sunk so low in the eyes of the Ladies of such a family as this  as to be thought by them a fit wise to the only worthless person in it  because I have not the fortune of Lady Anne S  I will hear  thought I  what Miss Grandison says to this  and  altho  I had made excuses to my cousin Reeves s  at their request  for staying here longer than I had intended  I will get away to town as fast as I can  Proud as they are of the name of Grandison  thought I  the name only won t do with Harriet Byron  I am as proud as they   I said nothing of my resentment  But told both Ladies  the moment I saw them  of Mr  Grandison s declaration  They expressed themselves highly displeased with him for it  and said  they would talk to him  Miss Grandison said  She wondered at his presumption  His fortune was indeed very considerable  she said  notwithstanding the extravagance of his youth  But it was an high degree of confidence  in a man of such free principles  to think himself intitled to countenance from—in short  from such a Lady  as your Harriet  Lucy  whatever you may think of her in these days of her humiliation   She added the goodness of my heart to her compliment  I hope it is not a bad one  Then it was that I told them of my thoughts of going to town on the occasion  And the two Ladies instantly went to their cousin  and talked to him in such a manner  that he promised  if no more notice were taken of the matter  never again to give occasion for them to reprimand him on this subject  He had indeed  he   244 owned  no very strong aspirations after matrimony  and had balanced about it a good while  before he could allow himself to
