very learned men affirm that   God  in whom is the disposal of all lives and all properties  has given   to some a right of ruling over others  that governors are his   vicegerents and representatives upon earth   and that he hath   appointed the descendible and hereditary rights of fathers over   families  of patriarchs over tribes  and of kings over nations      In a qualified sense  my Harry  their affirmation may be just     all the agents and instruments and dispensers of beneficence    whether their sphere be small or great  are God s true representa    tives and vicegerents upon earth   he hath given authority to the   tenderness of parents over their progeny   and he hath invested   patriarchs and kings with the rights of protection  But God never   gave the vulture a right to rule over the dovecot never gave up   the innocent many for a prey to the tyrannous few  God never   can take pleasure in the breaches of the law of his own righteous    ness and benignity  Arbitrary regents are no further of his ap    pointment than the evils of earthquakes and hurricanes as  where         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  265     he is said   to give the wicked a king in his anger  and to set over   the nations the basest of men       The God of all right cannot will wrong to any     His service   is perfect freedom   It is his pleasure to deliver from  the land   of slavery and the house of bondage     he is the God of equity   and good will to all his creatures   he founds his own authority    not in power but beneficence  The law  therefore  of safety and   well being to all  is founded in the nature of God himself eternal    immutable  and indispensable      One man may abound in strength  authority  possessions   but no   man may have greater right than another  The beggar has as   much right to his cloak and his scrip  as the king to his ermines   and crown lands      To fence and establish this divinely inherent right  of security   to the person and property of man  has been the study and attempt   of Hermes  Confucius  Minos  Lycurgus  Solon  Numa  and of all   the legislators and systems of civil polity that ever warmed the   world with a single ray of freedom      But so strong is the propensity to usurpation in man   so dan    gerous is it to tempt trustees with the investiture of power   so   difficult to watch the watchers to restrain the restrainers from   injustice that  whether the government were committed to the   One  the Few  or the Many  the parties intrusted have generally   proved traitors  and deputed power has almost perpetually been   seized upon as property      Monarchy has ever been found to rush headlong into tyranny   aristocracy into faction and multiplied usurpation and democracy   into tumult  confusion  and violence  And all these  whether   distinct or compounded with each other  have ended in the supre    macy of some arbitrary tyrant  enabled by a body of military   mercenaries to rule  oppress  and spoil the people at pleasure      How England hath come  after the many wrecks and ruins which   you have read of in history  to survive  to recover  to grow sounder   from her wounds  and mightier from her discomfitures  and to rise   superior  as we trust  to all future external and internal attempts   hath been owing to the peculiarity of her constitution      Her constitution  it is true  is not yet quit  perhaps never ought   to be quit  of some intestine commotions  For  though liberty has   no relation to party dissension or cabal against government  there   is yet a kind of yeast observable in its nature  which may be   necessary to the fermentation and working up of virtue to the   degree that is requisite for the production of patriotism and public   spirit  But when this yeast of liberty happens to light upon weak   or vapid tempers  they are immediately affected like small beer   casks  and rave and boil over in abundance of factious sputter and   turbulence  Party and faction therefore  being the scum and   ebullition of this animating yeast  are sure signs and proofs of the   life of liberty  though they neither partake nor communicate any   portion of its beneficence   as rank weeds are the proof of a hot snn   and luxuriant soil  though they are the detestable consequence of   the one and the other       Salus
