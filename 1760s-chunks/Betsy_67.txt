 I   love him excessively  You could not have made me a more obliging   present         How  Madam   cried he   I should be miserable  indeed  if I had nothing   in my power to offer more worthy your acceptance than that animal  What   think you  Madam  of an adoring and passionately devoted heart         A heart   rejoined she   oh  dear  a heart may be a pretty thing  for   aught I know to the contrary  but there is such an enclosure of flesh   and bone about it  that it is utterly impossible for one to see into it    and  consequently  to know whether one likes it or not         The heart  Madam  in the sense I mean   said he   implies the soul    which being a spirit  and invisible  can only be known by its effects    If the whole services of mine may render it an oblation  such as may   obtain a gracious reception from the amiable Miss Thoughtless  I shall   bless the hour in which I first beheld her charms  as the most fortunate   one I ever had to boast of   In ending these words he kissed her hand    with a look full of the greatest respect and tenderness       She then told him  the services of the soul must needs be valuable    because they were sincere  but  as she knew not of what nature those   services were he intended to render her  he must excuse her for not so   readily accepting them  On which  it is not to be doubted  but that he   assured her they should be only such as were dictated by the most pure   affections  and accompanied by the strictest honour       He was going on with such protestations as may be imagined a man  so   much enamoured  would make to the object of his wishes  when he was   interrupted by Miss Flora  who came hastily into the room  and told him   that her mamma  hearing that he was in the house  expected he would not   leave it without letting her have the pleasure of seeing him  that they   were just going to tea  and that her ladyship intreated he would join   company with those friends she had already with her       Mr  Trueworth would have been glad to have found some plausible pretence   for not complying with this invitation  but as he could not make any   that would not be looked on as favouring of ill manners  and Miss Betsy   insisted on his going  they all went together into the dining room       The lover had now no farther opportunity of prosecuting his suit in this   visit  but he made another the next day  more early than before  and   found nobody but Mr  Goodman with Miss Betsy  Lady Mellasin and Miss   Flora being gone among the shops  either to buy something they wanted    or to tumble over goods  as they frequently did  merely for the sake of   seeing new fashions  Mr  Trueworth having never been seen by Mr    Goodman  Miss Betsy presented him to him with these words   Sir  this   is a gentleman from Oxford  an intimate friend of brother Frank s  and   who did me the favour to bring me a letter from him   There needed no   more to make Mr  Goodman know  both who he was  and the business on   which he was come  He received him with a great deal of good manners    but  knowing his absence would be most agreeable  after some few   compliments  pretended he was called abroad by urgent business  and took   his leave       How much it rejoiced the sincerely devoted heart of Mr  Trueworth  to   find himself once more alone with the idol of his wishes  may easily be   conceived by those who have had any experience of the passion he so   deeply felt  but his felicity was of short continuance  and he profited   but little by the complaisance of Mr  Goodman       He was but just beginning to pour forth some part of those tender   sentiments  with which his soul overflowed  when he was prevented from   proceeding  by a second interruption  much more disagreeable than the   former had been       Mr  Staple  and Captain Hysom  for whom Miss Betsy had not left the same   orders she had done the day before  came both to visit her  the former   had the advantage of being there somewhat sooner than the other  and   accosted her with an air which made the enamoured heart of Mr  Trueworth
