was in those moments doing for him by those who   were waking for his interest       Mrs  Wellair  who was extremely cautious how she undertook any thing    without being fully convinced it was right  and no less industrious in   accomplishing whatever she had once undertook  had employed all the time   she had with her sister  before dinner  in representing to her  in the   most pathetick terms  the passion Mr  Trueworth had for her  the   extraordinary merits he was possessed of  and the many advantages of an   alliance with him  but Miss Harriot was modest to that excess  that to   be told  though from the mouth of a sister  she had inspired any   inclinations of the sort she mentioned  gave her the utmost confusion    She had not considered the difference of sexes  and could not hear that   any thing in her had reminded others of it  without blushing  The   effects of her beauty gave her rather a painful than a pleasing   sensation  and she was ready to die with shame at what the most part of   women are studious to acquire  and look on as their greatest glory       She offered nothing  however  in opposition to what Mrs  Wellair had   said concerning the person or amiable qualities of Mr  Trueworth    neither  indeed  had she a will to do it  She had been always highly   pleased with his conversation  and had treated him with the same   innocent freedom she did her brother  and she was now afraid  that it   was her behaving to him in this manner that had encouraged him to think   of making his addresses to her as a lover  She looked back with regret   on every little mark of favour she had shewn him  lest he should have   construed them into a meaning which was far distant from her thoughts    and these reflections it was that occasioned that unusual pensiveness   which Sir Bazil had observed in her at dinner  and which had given him   some apprehensions proceeded from a cause less favourable to his friend       Mrs  Wellair was not at all discouraged by the manner in which her   sister had listened to this overture  she knew that several proposals of   the same nature had been made to her in the country  all which she had   rejected with disdain  a certain air of abhorrence widely different to   what she testified on account of Mr  Trueworth  and this prudent lady   rightly judged  that he had little else to combat with than the   over bashfulness of his mistress       At night  on going to bed  she renewed the discourse  and pursued the   theme she had begun with such success  that she brought Miss Harriot to   confess she believed there was no man more deserving to be loved than   Mr  Trueworth   But  my dear sister   said she   I have no inclination   to marry  nor to leave you  I am quite happy as I am  and desire to be   no more so   To which the other replied  that was childish talking  that   she would  doubtless  marry some time or other  that she might  perhaps    never have so good an offer  and could not possibly have a better    therefore advised her not to slip the present opportunity  but  whenever   Mr  Trueworth should make a declaration of his passion to herself  to   receive it in such a manner as should not give him any room to imagine   she was utterly averse to his pretensions       Miss Harriot suffered her to ruge her on this point for a considerable   time  but at last replied  in a low and hesitating voice  that she would   be guided by her friends  who  she was perfectly convinced  had her   interest at heart  and knew much better than herself what conduct she   ought to observe  To which Mrs  Wellair replied  that she doubted not   but the end would abundantly justify the advice that had been given   her       The first thing this lady did in the morning  was to go to her brother s   chamber  and acquaint him with all that had passed between herself and   Miss Harriot  after which they agreed together  that Mr  Trueworth   should have an opportunity that very day of making his addresses to her       Though Sir Bazil thought it needless to add any thing to what was   already done  yet he could not forbear taking an occasion  when they   were at breakfast  to mention Mr  Trueworth s name  and the many good   qualities he was possessed of  Mrs  Wellair joined in the praises her   brother gave him  but Miss Harriot spoke not
