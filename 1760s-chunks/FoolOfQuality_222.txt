here give you my hand and word to make up a   hundred and fifty pounds more for you   and for this I will not   accept the smallest thanks  as I think it is no more than an act of   common honesty  And I  cried Mr  Fenton  I hold myself indebted   to you a thousand pounds  my noble Harry  for that single senti    ment  That s well that s well  sir   cried Harry  leaping up and   clapping his hands   I shall now be clear in the world with all my   poor creditors       Thus  sir  continued he  it rejoiced my heart greatly to send poor   Mr  Vindex away in such triumph   while my tutor and I went   two or three doors off to see a mighty pretty young creature  who   was said to be confined with her ancient father  And I will tell   you their story  with two or three other stories more  on account         230 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      of the incidents that happened while we were there  than of any   thing else that was wonderful or uncommon in them      On tapping at the door  we were desired to walk in  and saw   a female with her back to us  weaving bone lace on a cushion    while an elderly man  with spectacles on  read to her in Thomas a   Kempis  They both rose to salute us  Mr  Clement then stepped   up  and seeing what they were about  cried God cannot but   prosper your work  good people  since you employ your time to   his purposes  both on earth and in heaven  As an earnest of his   kindness to you  he sends you by us a considerable charity  which   you shall receive as soon as you inform us who and what you are    and how you came here  Blessed be the messengers of my God     cried out the father  whether they come with happy or with heavy   tidings  I say  with old Eli  It is the Lord  let him do what   seemeth him good       father  I was quite charmed when the daughter turned to   me   there was such a sweetness  such a heavenly harmlessness    in her face  that I could have kissed her  and kissed her  again and   again      As I had brought a glass and the remainder of our bottle with   me  we all got about a board that was half stool and half table    and  after a round or two  the good man began his story      My father s name was Samuel Stern  He had a clear estate of   nine hundred and fifty pounds a year in Sussex   and had by my   mother three daughters and four sons  of whom I was the second      My father  unhappily  was a loyalist   and when the troubles   broke out between King Charles and the parliament  he took up   all the money he could at any interest  and raised a company at his   own cost  which he headed on the part of his royal master      After some successful skirmishes  his head was split in two by   the broadsword of a trooper at the battle of Naseby  Immediately   all our servants forsook us  each carrying away with him whatever   came to hand   and quickly after the soldiers of the Commonwealth   came  carried off all the cattle  and left nothing of our house except   the bare walls      In the mean time  we poor children huddled together into the   garden  and there separating  ran and crept under bushes and   hedges  as so many chickens endeavouring to gain shelter from   the kite      As soon as the noise of the tumult was over  we rose and looked   about fearfully   and  getting together again  we helped one another   through the garden hedge  and made as fast as we could to the   cottage of a neighbouring farmer  who had been our father s tenant    Here we were received coldly  and fared but very hardly for that   night  On the next day  however  in order to get quit of us  as I   suppose  the man went among our relations  and prevailed on one   to take a son  and on another to take a daughter  till we were all   divided among them  and so we entered on a kind of service to our   kindred a service  as I believe  that is found on experience to be   much harder and more insulting than any service to a stranger
