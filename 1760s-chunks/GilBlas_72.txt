you may see me in my true light  and assure yourself  whatever might be the abilities of your old usher  you will not fare the worse for going further  If he was a benefit to you  I shall be a blessing   You may judge for yourself  Diego  continued Mergelina  how well I took it of the duenna  that she laid herself open so frankly  I had taken her virtue to be of the impenetrable cast  Look you now  how much women are liable to be scandalized  But her character of plain dealing won my heart at once  I threw my arms about her neck in a rapture  which bespoke my warm and tender feelings at the thoughts of such a mother abbess  I gave her carte blanche of all my private thoughts  and put in for a speedy tête à tête with your own dear self  She met me on my own ground  This very morning she engaged the old woman who spoke to you  to take the field  she is an old stager  a veteran in the service of the apothecary s wife  But the best of the joke in this comedy  added she in a paroxysm of laughter  is that Melancia  on my assurance that my husband s habit is to pass the night without stirring  is gone to bed by his side  and drones out my useless office at this moment  So much the worse  madam  said I then to Mergelina  your device is more plausible than profitable  Your husband is very likely to wake  and discover the fraud  He will not discover anything about it  replied she with no little urgency  set your heart at rest about that  and let not an empty fear poison the fountains of a pleasure  which ought to drown every vulgar and earthly consideration in the arms of a young lady who is yours for ever and ever   The old doctor s help mate  finding that her assurances had little effect upon my courage  left no stone unturned to put me in heart again  and she had so many encouraging ways with her  that a very coward must have plucked up a little  My thoughts were all with Jupiter and Alcmena  but at the very moment that the urchin Cupid  with his train of smiles and antics  was weaving a garland to compliment the crisis of our endeavours  we were stopped in our career by an importunate knocking at the street door  In a moment  away flew love and all his covey  like game at the report of a fowling piece  Mergelina popped me like an article of household furniture under the hall table  blew out the lamp  and  by previous agreement with her governess  in the event of so unlucky an accident  placed herself at the door of her husband s bedchamber  In the mean time  the knocking continued with reiterated violence  till the whole house resounded  The physician awoke suddenly  and called Melancia  The duenna flung herself out of bed  though the doctor  taking her for his wife  begged of her not to disturb herself  She ran to her mistress  who  catching hold of her in the dark  began calling Melancia  and told her to go and see who was at the door  Madam  answered the directress  here I am at your service  go to bed again if you please  you shall soon know who it is  During this parley  Mergelina having undressed  got into bed to the doctor  who had not the least suspicion of the farce that was playing  To be sure the stage was darkened  and the actresses had very little occasion for a prompter  one of them was familiar with the boards  and the other wanted only a rehearsal or two to be perfect in her part   The duenna  in her night gown  made her appearance soon after  with a candle in her hand    Good doctor  said she to her master  have the goodness to get up  Our neighbour Fernandez de Buendia  the bookseller  is in an apoplectic fit  you are sent for  time presses  The physician got on his clothes as fast as he could  and went out  His wife  in her bed gown  came into the hall with the duenna  They dragged me from under the table more dead than alive  You have nothing to fear  Diego  said Mergelina  put yourself in proper order  At the same time she told me how things were in two words  She had half a mind to renew our amorous intercourse  but the directress knew better  Madam  said she  your husband may possibly be too late to help the bookseller to the other world  and then he will return immediately  Besides  added she  observing me benumbed with fright  it would be all lost labour upon this poor youth  He is not in a condition to answer your demands  You had better send him home  and defer the debate till to morrow evening  Donna Mergelina was sorry for the delay  as well knowing that a bird in hand is worth two in the bush  and I flatter myself she was disappointed at not putting a cuckold s night cap on the doctor s head   As for
