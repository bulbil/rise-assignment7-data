confident it will never succeed—You are too honest and too ignorant of the town  to practice the necessary cheats of your profession  and detect the conspiracies that will be formed against you—Besides  you are downright bashful—what the devil  set up for a fortune hunter  before you have conquered the sense of shame —Perhaps you are entitled by your merit  and I believe you are  to a richer and better wife than Melinda  but take my word for it  she is not to be won at that rate —or  if you are so lucky as to carry her  between you and me  you may say  as Teague did  By my soul I have gained a loss  She would take care to spend her own fortune in a twinkling  and soon make you sick of her extravagance  —  I was alarmed by his discourse  while I resented the freedom of it  and expressed my disgust  by telling him  he was mistaken in my intentions  and desiring he would give me leave to regulate my conduct according to the dictates of my own reason —He made an apology for the liberty he had taken  and ascribed it to the warmth of his friendship for me  as an uncommon instance of which  he borrowed five guineas  assuring me  there were very few people in the world whom he would so far favour with his confidence —I gave him the money  and professed myself so well convinced of his sincerity  that he had no   125 occasion to put it to such extraordinary proofs for the future —   I thought  said he  to have asked five pieces more  but hearing you was bubbled of eighteen last night  I presumed you might be out of cash  and resolved to model my demand accordingly    I could not help admiring the cavalier behaviour of this spark  of whom I desired to know his reason for saying I was bubbled —Whereupon he gave me to understand  that before he came to my lodgings  he had beat up Tom Tossle  who having been present  informed him of the particulars  rehearsed all the fine things I said to Melinda  with which he proposed to entertain the town  and among other circumstances  assured him  my mistress cheated with so little art  that no body but a meer novice could have been imposed upon     The thoughts of becoming a subject of raillery for coxcombs  and losing my money to boot  stung me to the quick  but I made a virtue of my indignation  and swore that no man should with impunity  either asperse the character of Melinda  or turn my behaviour into ridicule  He replied in a dry manner  that I would find it a Herculean task to chastise every body who should laugh at my expence  and as for the character of Melinda  he did not see how it could suffer by what was laid to her charge  for that cheating at cards  so far from being reckoned a blemish among people of fashion  was looked upon as an honourable indication of superior genius and address —   But let us wave this subject  said he  and go to the coffee house  in order to make a party for dinner        126  CHAP  XLVIII    We repair to the coffee house  where we overhear a curious dispute between Wagtail and Medlar  which is referred to our decision—the doctor gives us an account of his experiment—Medlar is roasted by Banter  at the ordinary—the old gentleman s advice to me   BEING as willing to drop the theme  as he to propose it  I accompanied him thither  where we found Mr  Medlar and doctor Wagtail  disputing upon the word Custard  which the physician affirmed should be spelled with a G  because it was derived from the Latin verb gustare   to taste  —But Medlar pleaded custom in behalf of C  observing  that by the doctor s rule  we ought to change pudding into budding  because it is derived from the French word boudin  and in that case  why not retain the original orthography and pronounciation of all the foreign words we have adopted  by which means our language would become a dissonant jargon without standard or propriety  The controversy was referred to us  and Banter  notwithstanding his real opinion to the contrary  decided it in favour of Wagtail  Upon which  the peevish annuitant arose  and uttering the monosyllable  pish  with great emphasis  removed to another table     127 We then enquired of the doctor  what progress he had made in the experiment of distilling tinderwater  and he told us  he had been at all the glass houses about town  but could find no body who would undertake to blow a retort large enough to hold the third part of the quantity prescribed  but he intended to try the process on as much as would produce five drops  which would be sufficient to prove the specific  and then he would make it a parliamentary affair —that he had already purchased a considerable weight of rags  in the reducing of which to tinder  he had met with a misfortune which had obliged him to change his lodgings  For he had gathered them in a heap on the floor  and set fire to
