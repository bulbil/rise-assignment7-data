desired  his company in France with a view of promoting his interest  not for any    6 22 15  3 45 PM   emolument he could expect from his instruction  This being the case  he  was at liberty to consult his own inclinations  with regard to going or  staying  though he could not help owning himself obliged by the concern  he expressed for his safety  and would endeavour  for his own sake  to  avoid giving him any cause of disturbance in time to come   No man was more capable of moralizing upon Peregrine s misconduct than  himself  his reflections were extremely just and sagacious  and attended  with no other disadvantage but that of occurring too late  He projected  a thousand salutary schemes of deportment  but  like other projectors   he never had interest enough with the ministry of his passions to bring  any of them to bear  He had  in the heyday of his gallantry received a  letter from his friend Gauntlet with a kind postscript from his charming  Emilia  but it arrived at a very unseasonable juncture  when his  imagination was engrossed by conquests that more agreeably flattered his  ambition  so that he could not find leisure and inclination  from that  day  to honour the correspondence which he himself had solicited  His  vanity had  by the time  disapproved of the engagement he had contracted  in the rawness and inexperience of youth  suggesting  that he was born  to such an important figure in life  as ought to raise his ideas  above the consideration of any such middling connections  and fix his  attention upon objects of the most sublime attraction  These dictates  of ridiculous pride had almost effaced the remembrance of his amiable  mistress  or at least so far warped his morals and integrity  that he  actually began to conceive hopes of her altogether unworthy of his own  character and her deserts   Meanwhile  being destitute of a toy for the dalliance of his idle hours   he employed several spies  and almost every day made a tour of the  public places in person  with a view of procuring intelligence of Mr   Hornbeck  with whose wife he longed to have another interview  In this  course of expectation had he exercised himself a whole fortnight  when   chancing to be at the Hospital of the Invalids with a gentleman lately  arrived from England  he no sooner entered the church than he perceived  his lady  attended by her spouse  who at sight of our hero changed  colour and looked another way  in order to discourage any communication  between them  But the young man  who was not so easily repulsed   advanced with great assurance to his fellow traveller  and taking him by  the hand  expressed his satisfaction at this unexpected meeting  kindly  upbraiding him for his precipitate retreat from Chantilly  Before  Hornbeck could make any reply he went up to his wife  whom he  complimented in the same manner  assuring her  with some significant  glances  he ass extremely mortified that she had put it out of his power  to pay his respects to her on his first arrival at Paris  and then   turning to her husband  who thought proper to keep close to him in this  conference  begged to know where he could have the honour of waiting  upon him  observing at the same time  that he himself lived a l Academie  de Palfrenier   Mr  Hornbeck  without making any apology for his elopement on the road   thanked Mr  Pickle for his complaisance in a very cool and disobliging  manner  saying that as he intended to shift his lodgings in a day or  two  he could not expect the pleasure of seeing him  until he should be  settled  when he would call at the academy  and conduct him to his new  habitation   Pickle  who was not unacquainted with the sentiments of this jealous    6 22 15  3 45 PM   gentleman  did not put much confidence in his promise  and therefore  made divers efforts to enjoy a little private conversation with his  wife  but he was baffled in all his attempts by the indefatigable  vigilance of her keeper  and reaped no other immediate pleasure from  this accidental meeting  than that of a kind squeeze while he handed her  into the coach  However  as he had been witness to some instances of  her invention  and was no stranger to the favourable disposition of  her heart  he entertained some faint hopes of profiting by her  understanding  and was not deceived in his expectation  for the very  next forenoon  a Savoyard called at the academy  and put the following  billet in his hand           Coind Sur   Heaving the playsure of meating with you at the       osspital of awilheads  I take this lubbertea of latin you       know  that I lotch at the hottail de May cong dangle rouy       Doghouseten  with two postis at the gait  naytheir of um very
