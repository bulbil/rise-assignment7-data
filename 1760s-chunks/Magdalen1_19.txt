humanity I must own  that it would have no way   113 displeased me had she shewn a little stronger sensibility in our separation   Being thus left alone  I rang for Edwards  and ordering him to get the chaise ready in an instant  I set out from Mr  Mildmay s  without taking leave of a single soul  leaving only one of the footmen to bring the portmanteau after me  and ordering Ned to distribute  agreeable to the inhospitable customs of this country  twenty guineas among the servants   The interval from quitting Mr  Mildmay s till my arrival at Reading  was one of the most disagreeable passages in my whole life—Shame and remorse harrowed up my bosom alternately  and  when I reflected upon what Louisa was likely to suffer  I was tortured to distraction  The pitiful figure I made  thus stealing away from a house  in which  but the day before  I was absolutely idolized    114 gave me the severest mortification  and  in short  the universal distress which I knew must result from my behaviour  operated so strongly upon my humanity  that I was a thousand times ready to turn back  with a resolution of sacrificing my own peace of mind to preserve the quiet of my ever amiable sister  the beautiful Louisa  and her respectable family  But when I considered what had passed  when I considered what might probably happen  every thing fell before the arguments of my pride  and I continued invincibly attached to my first determination   O Melmoth  did these women but know how we worship them for refusing to gratify our wishes—did they but know how me doat upon the indignation of a fine eye  when fired into a blaze of conscious virtue  and striking an instant confusion upon the   115 presumptuous addresses of a designing lover  how few of them would listen to an improper solicitation —But  ridiculously confident of their own fortitude  or preposterously imagining that those concessions are most like to secure an admirer  which are most apt to excite his contempt  they constantly betray their own cause  and oblige him in a manner to despise and desert them  But a truce with reflections   When I came to my inn at Reading  the first thing I did was to write a short letter to Mr  Mildmay  thanking him for the many civilities which he had shewn me  and informing him that it was with inexpressible regret I quitted his house  at a time when I fondly flattered myself with the hope of speedily becoming so near a part of his family  but that  as I had reasons to believe a union with me  would be no way conducive   116 to the happiness of his amiable daughter  I had determined to make a sacrifice of my own felicity  rather than be the least impediment to her s  and concluded with the customary round of common place compliments  that tingle very prettily on the ear  though they seldom interest either the heart or the understanding  This letter I dispatched by Edwards  for two reasons  because  in the first place  a special messenger carried an air of greater respect  than if I had sent it by the post  and because  in the second  I knew Edwards would give a sharp look out  and bring me a pretty exact account of every thing which had happened since my departure   And now  Melmoth  what say you to the part which I have acted in this affair  Don t you think my dexterity in getting off a masterpiece  and my fortitude   117 in resisting the importunate remonstrances of my own heart  an exertion of philosophy  which is at least equal to any thing in all antiquity  To be serious  however  though I think you will in the main approve both of my prudence and my resolution  I am nevertheless fearful of hearing your sentiments  As to lady Haversham  I know she will for some time be in the pouts  and fancy that I have behaved with the greatest impropriety  but as there is no likelihood of her ever becoming acquainted with the real cause of my proceeding  and as I am conscious her brother is the person on earth who holds the highest place in her affections  I am satisfied the storm must in a little time blow over  and that a few days will reinstate me perfectly in her esteem   Poor Louisa  was her peace of mind a little established  I could with the   118 more chearfulness submit to my part of the anxiety  but some how her distress is continually present to my imagination  and my own feelings are perpetually aggravated by the recollection of her sufferings  Women  however  though their sensibility may be more piercingly exquisite than ours  are nevertheless much readier to conquer the remembrance of misfortune  they feel more deeply indeed at first  but from the osier like pliability of their minds  the moment the first hurry of the tempest is sustained  they gradually rise to their former situation  the anguish inperceptibly softens from affliction into melancholy  from melancholy into languor  and from languor into tranquility  whereas  the masculine mind  like the oak in the fable  is shattered in the severity of a conflict  when it might easily have recovered the most violent shock by
