safety  and their own  When the parties were all snugly housed  we gave ourselves as much credit for the negotiation as if we had patched up a marriage with a princess   The next morning the Duke of Lerma desired to know all the particulars  Just as I had finished relating them  the Count de Lemos came in and said    The Prince of Spain is so engrossed by Catalina  he has taken so decided a fancy to her  that he actually proposes to be constant  He wanted to have sent her jewels to the amount of two thousand pistoles to day  but his finances wee aground  My dear Lemos  said he  addressing himself to me  you must absolutely get me that sum  I know it is very inconvenient  you have pawned your credit for me already  but my heart owns itself your debtor  and if ever I have the means of returning your kindness by more than empty words  your fortunes shall not suffer by your complaisance  In answer  I assured him that I had friends and credit  and promised to bring him what he wanted   There is no difficulty about that  said the duke to his nephew  Santillane will bring you the money  or  to save trouble  he may purchase the jewels  for he is an admirable judge  especially of rubies  Are you not  Gil Blas  This stroke of satire was of course designed to entertain the count at my expense  and it was successful  for his curiosity could not but be excited to know the meaning of the mystery  No mystery at all  replied his uncle with a broad laugh  Only Santillane took it into his head one day to exchange a diamond for a ruby  and the barter operated equally to the advantage of his pocket and his penetration   Had the minister stopped there  I should have come off cheaply  but he took the trouble of dressing out in aggravated colours the trick that Camilla and Don Raphael played me  with a most provoking enlargement of the circumstances most to the disadvantage of my sagacity  His excellency having enjoyed his joke  ordered me to attend the Count de Lemos to a jeweller s  where we selected trinkets for the Prince of Spain s inspection  and they were intrusted to my care to be delivered to Catalina   There can be little doubt of my kind reception on the following night  when I displayed a fine pair of drop ear rings  as the presents of my embassy  The two ladies  out of their wits at these costly tokens of the prince s love  suffered their tongues to run into a gossiping strain  while they were thanking me for introducing them into such worshipful society  In the excess of their joy  they forgot themselves a little  There escaped now and then certain peculiar idioms of speech  which made me suspect that the party in question was no such dainty morsel for royalty to feed upon  To ascertain precisely what degree of obligation I had conferred on the heir apparent  I took my leave with the intention of coining to a right understanding with Scipio       CH  XII     Catalina s real condition a worry and alarm to Gil Blas  His precautions for his own ease and quiet   ON coming home  I heard a devil of a noise  and inquired what was the meaning of it  They told me that Scipio was giving a supper to half a dozen of his friends  They were singing as loud as their kings could roar  and threatening the stability of the house with their protracted peals of laughter  This meal was not in all respects the banquet of the seven wise men   The founder of the feast  informed of my arrival  said to his company  Sit still  gentlemen  it is only the master of the house come home  but that need not disturb you  Go on with your merry  making  I will but just whisper a word in his ear  and be back again in a moment  He came to me accordingly  What an infernal din  said I  What sort of company do you keep below  Have you  too  got in among the poets  Thank you for nothing  answered he  Your wine is too good to be given to such gentry  I turn it to better account  There is a young man of large property in my party  who wishes to lay out your credit and his own money in the purchase of a place  This little festivity is all for him  For every glass he fills  I put on ten pistoles  in addition to the regular fee  He shall drink till he is under the table  If that is the case  replied I  go to your presidentship  and do not spare the cellar   Then was no proper time to talk about Catalina  but the next morning I opened the business thus  Friend Scipio  the terms we are upon entitle me to fair dealing  I have treated you more like an equal than a servant  consequently you would be much to blame to cheat me on the footing of a master  Let us  therefore  have no secrets towards each other  I am going to tell
