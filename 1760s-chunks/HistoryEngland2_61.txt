the commencement of the war  four hundred and seven ships  belonging to the subjects of Great Britain  The English  though at immense expence in equipping fleets  seemed tamely to lie down under every blow  and suffered one loss after another without reprisal  This general discontent had a manifest influence upon the election of members for the new parliament  All the adherents of the Prince of Wales  who now lived  retired from the court as a private gentleman  concurred in the opposition to the ministry  Obstinate struggles were maintained in all parts of the kingdom  and such a national spirit of opposition prevailed  that the Country interest seemed  at length  to preponderate n the house of commons  It was soon seen that the nterest of the minister was in the wane  and that   164 opinion  once established  began to deprive him of even those who had determined to act with neutrality    In proclinantes  as Ovid says  omne recumbit onus      Sir Robert now tottered on the brink of ruin  He was sensible that nothing but a division in the opposition could give him safety  The Prince was his most formidable rival  a Prince revered by the whole nation  for his humanity  benevolence  and candour These were only private virtues  but these were al he had then a liberty of exercising  The minister s first attempt was  to endeavour taking him from the party  a message therefore was carried to his roya highness by the Bishop of Oxford  importing  that i the Prince would write a letter to the King  he and all his counsellors should be taken into favour  fifty thousand pounds should be added to his revenue  two hundred thousand given him to pay his debts  and suitable provision should be made  in due time  for all his followers  This  to a Prince already involved in debt  from the necessity of keeping up his dignity was a tempting offer  but his royal highness generously disdained it  declaring he would accept no such conditions which were dictated to him under the influence of Sir Robert Walpole  The minister now therefore saw that no arts could dissolve the combination against him  he resolved  as an expiring struggle  to try his strength once more in the house of commons upon a disputed election  but he had the mortification to see the majority still increased against him by sixteen voices  He then declared he would never sit in that house more  The parliament was adjourned the next day  and Sir Robert being created Earl of Orford  resigned all his employments  Never was a joy more universal and sincere than this resignation produced  The people now flattered themselves that all their domestic grievances would find redress  that their commerce would be protected abroad  that the war would be carried on with vigour    165 and that the house of commons would be unanimous in every measure  But they were disappointed in most of their expectations  The misconduct of a minister is more likely to affect his successor than himself  as a weak reign ever produces a feeble succession  The house of commons had been for a long time increasing in power  and Walpole  with all his arts  was  in fact  rather weakening than extending the prerogative  By his method of bribing opposition he had taught the venal to oppose him  and  by his increasing the national debt  he weakened the vigour of the crown in war  and made it more dependant upon parliament in times of peace  A part of those who succeeded him were therefore sensible of this  and still resolved to support the crown  which they regarded as the only declining branch of the constitution  Another part  who clamoured from motives of self interest  having now attained the object of their desires  blundered on in the former measures  studious of fortune and not of fame  In short  his successors pursuing all the former schemes of the deposed minister  presented the political part of the nation with the mortifying prospect of pretended patriotism unstripped of its mask  and shewed the little certainty there is in all political reasonings   I am   c   LETTER XXI   THE war with Spain had now continued for several years  with but indifferent success  Some insuccessful expeditions were carried on in the West Indies under Admiral Vernon  Commodore Knowles  and others  and these were all aggravated by a set of worthless and mercenary things  called Political Writers  A class of beings first employed against   166 Walpole  and afterwards encouraged by him  at the expence  as it is said  of not less than thirty thousand a year  These were men naturally too dull to shine in any of the politer kinds of literature  which might adorn either a scholar or a gentleman  and therefore they turned their thoughts to politics  a science on which they might declaim without knowledge  and be dull without detection  These men  I say  had  for some time  embarrassed the constitution  inflamed the people  and were paid with large pensions from the crown  It was upon this occasion that they exaggerated every misconduct  and drew frightful pictures of the distress and misery which they foreboded to posterity  This clamour  and want of success in a naval war  in
