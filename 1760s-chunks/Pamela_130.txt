earnest to wish myself safe  and out of   danger   And then  how long am I to stay  And to what purpose  And   in what light must I appear to the world  Would not that censure me    although I might be innocent  And you will allow  sir  that  if there be   any thing valuable or exemplary in a good name  or fair reputation  one   must not despise the world s censure  if one can avoid it       Well  said he  I sent not for you on this account  just now  but for two   reasons  The first is  That you promise me  that for a fortnight to come   you will not offer to go away without my express consent  and this I   expect for your own sake  that I may give you a little more liberty  And   the second is  That you will see and forgive Mrs  Jewkes  she takes   on much  and thinks that  as all her fault was her obedience to me    it would be very hard to sacrifice her  as she calls it  to your   resentment       As to the first  sir  said I  it is a hard injunction  for the reasons   I have mentioned  And as to the second  considering her vile  unwomanly   wickedness  and her endeavours to instigate you more to ruin me  when   your returning goodness seemed to have some compassion upon me  it is   still harder  But  to shew my obedience to your commands   for you know    my dear parents  I might as well make a merit of my compliance  when   my refusal would stand me in no stead   I will consent to both  and to   every thing else  that you shall be pleased to enjoin  which I can do    with innocence       That s my good girl  said he  and kissed me  This is quite prudent  and   shews me  that you don t take insolent advantage of my favour for you    and will  perhaps  stand you in more stead than you are aware of       So he rung the bell  and said  Call down Mrs  Jewkes  She came down    and he took my hand  and put it into hers  and said  Mrs  Jewkes  I am   obliged to you for all your diligence and fidelity to me  but Pamela  I   must own  is not  because the service I employed you in was not so very   obliging to her  as I could have wished she would have thought it  and   you were not to favour her  but obey me  But yet I ll assure you  at the   very first word  she has once obliged me  by consenting to be friends   with you  and if she gives me no great cause  I shall not  perhaps  put   you on such disagreeable service again   Now  therefore  be you once   more bed fellows and board fellows  as I may say  for some days longer    and see that Pamela sends no letters nor messages out of the house  nor   keeps a correspondence unknown to me  especially with that Williams    and  as for the rest  shew the dear girl all the respect that is due to   one I must love  if she will deserve it  as I hope she will yet  and let   her be under no unnecessary or harsh restraints  But your watchful care   is not  however  to cease  and remember that you are not to disoblige   me  to oblige her  and that I will not  cannot  yet part with her       Mrs  Jewkes looked very sullen  and as if she would be glad still to do   me a good turn  if it lay in her power       I took courage then to drop a word or two for poor Mr  Williams  but he   was angry with me for it  and said he could not endure to hear his name   in my mouth  so I was forced to have done for that time       All this time  my papers  that I buried under the rose bush  lay there   still  and I begged for leave to send a letter to you  So I should  he   said  if he might read it first  But this did not answer my design  and   yet I would have sent you such a letter as he might see  if I had been   sure my danger was over  But that I cannot  for he now seems to take   another method  and what I am more afraid of  because  may be  he may   watch an
