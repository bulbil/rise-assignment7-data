 he should prove his sincerity he knew not  and as he was utterly   unpracticed in the affairs of love  lamented the absence of his good   friend the baron de la Valiere  who he thought might have been  able to   give him same advice  how to proceed       He remained buried  as it were  in these cogitations  when a lady   plucked back the curtain which screen d him  and without seeing any one   was there  threw herself on the sopha almost in his lap   Oh heaven    cried she  perceiving what she had done  and immediately rose  but   Horatio starting up  would not suffer her to quit the place  telling   her  that since she chose it  it was his business to retire  and leave   her to indulge whatever meditations had brought her thither  She thank d   him in a voice which  by its trembling  testified her mind was in some   very great disorder  and added  if your good nature  said she  be equal   to your complaisance  you will do me the favour to desire a lady    dressed in pink and silver  with a white sattin scarf cross her   shoulder  to come here directly   you cannot  continued she  be mistaken   in the person  because there is no other in the same habit  Tho  Horatio   was very loth to engage himself in the lady s affairs  fearing to give a   second umbrage to mademoiselle Charlotta  yet he knew not how to excuse   granting so small a request  and therefore assured her of his   compliance       Accordingly he sent his eyes in quest  which soon pointed out to him the   person whom she had described  having delivered his message to her    Horatio  cried she  somewhat astonished  how came you employed in this   errand  he knew her voice  and that it was mademoiselle de Coigney  the   mistress of his friend the baron  on which he immediately told her how   the lady had surprized him  she laughed heartily  and said no more but   left him  and went to the window he had directed       For a long time he sought in vain for an opportunity of speaking to the   object of his affections  she was still engaged either in dancing or in   different parties  and as his eyes continually followed her  he easily   perceived she purposely avoided him  A magnificent collation being   prepared in a great drawing room next to that in which the company were    they all went in to partake of it  The entertainment was served up on   two large tables  but as every one was mask d  and the vizards so   contriv d  that those who wore them could eat without plucking them off    they sat down promiscuously without ceremony or any distinction of   degrees  none being obliged to know another in these disguises  only the   attendants of the Chevalier St  George  and the princess Louisa  took   care not to place themselves at the same they were  so by this means sat   together  but a great number of others being mingled with them  no   particular conversation could be expected       Supper being over  they all returned to the ballroom  and Horatio having   contrived it so as to get next Charlotta  she could not refuse the offer   he made her of his hand to lead her in  but as he was about saying   something to her in a low voice  a man came hastily to him  and taking   him a little on one side  presented him with a letter  and then retired   with so much precipitation  that Horatio could neither ask from whom it   came  nor well discern what sort of person it was that gave it him  He   put it however in his pocket  designing to read it at more leisure  his   curiosity for the contents not equalling his desire of entertaining   mademoiselle Charlotta  but that young lady  whose jealousy received new   fewel from this object  had slipt away before he could turn from the   man  and had already mixed with a cluster of both sexes who had got into   the room before them       Horatio finding all attempts to speak to her that night would be   ineffectual  went back into the drawing room where they supped  and   where but few people remaining he might examine the letter with more   freedom  He saw it had no superscription  but supposing the inside would   give him some satisfaction  he broke it open hastily and found in it   these lines           Whether false or faithful still are you dear to   me  and if I am in the least so to you
