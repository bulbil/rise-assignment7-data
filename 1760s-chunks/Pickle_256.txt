in a small town  extremely ill accommodated  to partake of diversions  that were bad imitations of plays  concerts  and masquerades  If the  world should place to the account of my indiscretion my travelling in  this manner with gentlemen to whom I had no particular attachment  let  it also be considered  as an alleviation  that I always lived in terror  of my lord  and consequently was often obliged to shift my quarters  so  that  my finances being extremely slender  I stood the more in need of  assistance and protection  I was  besides  young  inconsiderate  and so  simple  as to suppose the figure of an ugly man would always secure  me from censure on his account  neither did I ever dream of any man s  addresses  until he made an actual declaration of his love    Upon my return to Bath  I was again harassed by Lord     who came  thither accompanied by my father  whom I was very glad to see  though  he importuned me to comply with my husband s desire  and for the future  keep measures with the world  This remonstrance about living with  my lord  which he constantly repeated  was the only instance of his  unkindness which I ever felt  But all his admonitions were not of force  sufficient to shake my resolution in that particular  though the debate  continued so late  that I told his lordship  it was high time to  retire  for I could not accommodate him with a bed  He then gave me to  understand  that he would stay where he was  upon which my father took  his leave  on pretence of looking out for a lodging for himself  The    6 22 15  3 45 PM   little gentleman being now left with me  began to discover some signs of  apprehension in his looks  but  mustering up all his resolution  he  went to the door  called up three of his servants  whom he placed as  sentinels upon the stairs  and flounced into my elbow chair  where he  resigned himself to rest  Intending to go to bed  I thought it was but  just and decent that I should screen myself from the intrusion of his  footmen  and with that view bolted the door  Lord     hearing himself  locked in  started up in the utmost terror and consternation  kicked the  door with his heel  and screamed aloud  as if he had been in the hands  of an assassin  My father  who had not yet quitted the house  hearing  these outcries  ran upstairs again  and  coming through my bedchamber  into the dining room where we were  found me almost suffocated with  laughter  and his heroic son in law staring like one who had lost his  wits  with his hair standing on end    When my father asked the meaning of his exclamations  he told him  with  all the symptoms of dismay  that I had locked him in  and he did not  understand such usage  But I explained the whole mystery  by saying  I  had bolted the door because I did not like the company of his servants   and could not imagine the cause of his panic  unless he thought I  designed to ravish him  an insult than which nothing was farther from my  intention  My father himself could scarce refrain from laughing at his  ridiculous fear  but  seeing him in great confusion  took pity on his  condition  and carried him off to his own lodgings  after I had given  my word that I would not attempt to escape  but give him audience next  morning  I accordingly kept my promise  and found means to persuade  them to leave me at my own discretion  Next day I was rallied upon  the stratagem I had contrived to frighten Lord     and a thousand idle  stories were told about this adventure  which happened literally as I  have related it    From Bath I betook myself to a small house near Lincoln  which I had  hired of the d   of A    because a country life suited best with my  income  which was no more than four hundred pounds a year  and that  not well paid  I continued some months in this retirement  and saw  no company  except Lord R   M    who lived in the neighbourhood  and  visited me twice  till  finding myself indisposed  I was obliged to  remove to London  and took lodgings in Maddox street  where my garrison  was taken by storm by my Lord    and his steward  reinforced by Mr  L    V    who  as my lord told me  had a subsidy of five and twenty pounds  before he would take the field  and a couple of hardy footmen  This  formidable band rushed into my apartment  laid violent hands upon me   dragged me down stairs without gloves or a cloak  and  thrusting me into  a coach that stood at the
