succeeding misfortunes  Instead of fighting  he entered upon a treaty  a suspension was concluded upon  and terms agreed to  that neither side intended to preserve  This suspension  and disbanding the armies    13 was a fatal step to the King  the Scotch forces could be again mustered at pleasure  the English troops  not without time  difficulty  and expence  Of this the malecontents were sensible  and the negotiations met with obstructions in proportion as they were confident of their power  In short  after much altercation  and many treaties signed  and broken  both parties once more resolved upon a war   War being resolved on  the King now took every method to raise money for maintaining it  Ship money was levied as before  some other arbitrary taxes were exacted with great severity  but one method of increasing supplies reflects immortal honour upon those who granted them  His counsellors and servants lent the King whatever sums they could spare  and distressed their private fortunes to serve the state  Laud  Archbishop of Canterbury  and the Marquis of Hamilton  contributed very large sums  but particularly Thomas Wentworth  Earl of Strafford  gave his Majesty twenty thousand pounds  Wentworth was one of those great characters which marked those celebrated times  Upon his first appearance in the state he was foremost in the opposition to the crown  but  finding his confederates had mixed a spirit of enthusiasm with their regards for liberty  he left their side to take that of the King  which he fancied in greatest danger  He was brave  wise  and loyal  and followed the King from principle  yet without entirely approving his conduct   These were the resources of the crown to prepare for a Scotch war  but they were still insufficient  and there was but one method more to furnish larger supplies  namely  by calling a parliament  It was now eleven years since Charles had called any  The ungovernable spirit of the last had taught him to hate and to fear such an assembly  His wants  however  at length  induced him to constrain his indignation    14 and  by the advice of his Council  he called another  the members of which were still more turbulent than the former  as they now had still stronger reasons for their discontent  The house of commons could not be induced to treat the Scotch  who were of the same principles  and contended for the same cause  as their enemies  They looked upon them as friends and brothers  who only rose to teach them how to defend their privileges  The King could reap no other fruits  therefore  from this assembly  but murmurings and complaints  every method he had taken to supply himself with money was declared an abuse  Tonnage and poundage  shipmoney  the sale of monopolies  the billetting soldiers upon the citizens were all voted stretches at arbitrary power  The Star chamber gave particular offence  and instead of subsidies the house presented the King with nothing but their grievances  Charles once more dissolved this parliament  and thus aggravated the discontents of the people   He had now made enemies of the Scotch nation  and of the commons of England  it remained to offend the city of London  upon their refusing to lend him a sum of money to carry on the war  he sued them in the Star chamber for some lands in Ireland  and made them pay a considerable fine  He continued to exact all the taxes against which the parliament had so frequently remonstrated  even had he been despotic  such a conduct would have shook him on the throne  but  limited as he was  it served to complete his overthrow  He could expect little assistance from England  and the Scotch  sensible of their own influence in that part of his dominions  led an army of twenty thousand men as far as Newcastle upon Tyne  in order to seize upon  or to dethrone him  Having thus prepared his misfortunes  he found himself again obliged to call the last parliament  which completed his ruin     15 Instead of granting money  this new parliament  as all the rest had done  began by demanding to have their grievances redressed  they desired an abolition of the Star chamber  exclaimed against arbitrary taxes  and particularly ship money  and  in fine  demanded that a new parliament should be called every three years  Charles was now obliged to grant those demands from necessity  which in the beginning of his reign he might have bestowed as a favour  He expected to regain his authority by complying  but he was deceived  nothing could satisfy the commons but the total abolition of his power  He expected that his English subjects would repress the insolence of those of Scotland  but had the mortification to find the house of commons approve their conduct  and repay their irruption with a reward of three hundred thousand pounds  He hoped to repress the Puritanical party in England  but found  to his surprize  almost the whole house of commons of that persuasion  He loved the Earl of Strafford with tenderness  and esteemed his wisdom  and the house of commons  conscious of his regards  accused the Earl of high treason  When we attempt innovation  we seldom know how far our schemes will extend at
