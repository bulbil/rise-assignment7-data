in his person  which was very  agreeable  as well as in his behaviour  a certain naivete that was very  pleasing  and  at this first interview  we relished each other s company  so well  that a sort of intimacy immediately commenced  and was carried  on in a succession of parties of pleasure  in the course of which I    6 22 15  3 45 PM   found him fraught with all the tenderness and sentiment that render  the heart susceptible of the most refined love  a disposition that  immediately made me partial to him  while it subjected his own heart to  all the violent impressions of a passion  which I little imagined our  correspondence would have produced    Nevertheless  I was far from being displeased with my conquest  because  his person and qualifications  as well as his manner of address  were  very much to my liking  and recommended him in a particular manner to  my affection  Indeed  he made greater progress in my heart than I myself  suspected  for there was something congenial in our souls  which  from  our first meeting  I believe  had attracted us  unknown to ourselves   under the notions of friendship and regard  and now disclosed itself in  the most passionate love    I listened to his addresses  and we were truly happy  His attachment  was the quintessence of tenderness and sincerity  while his generosity  knew no bounds  Not contented with having paid twelve hundred pounds on  my account  in the space of one fortnight  he would have loaded me  with present after present  had I not absolutely refused to accept  such expensive marks of his munificence  I was even mortified at those  instances of his liberality  which my situation compelled me to receive   lest  being but little acquainted with my disposition  he should suspect  me of being interested in my love  and judge my conduct by the malicious  reports of common fame  which  he afterwards owned  had at first  obtained such credit with him  that he believed our mutual attachment  would not be of long duration  But  in this particular  he was soon  undeceived  His heart  though naturally adapted for the melting passion   had hitherto escaped untouched by all the ladies of Italy and France   and  therefore  the first impressions were the more deeply fixed  As he  was unpractised in the ways of common gallantry and deceit  the striking  simplicity in his character was the more likely to engage the heart of  one who knew the perfidy of the world  and despised all the farce and  bombast of fashionable profession  which I had always considered as the  phrase of vanity and ostentation  rather than the genuine language  of love  Besides  gratitude had a considerable share in augmenting my  affection  which manifested itself in such a warm  cordial  artless  manner  as increased his esteem  and riveted his attachment  for he  could easily perceive  from the whole tenor of my conduct  that my  breast was an utter stranger to craft and dissimulation  yet I was at  first fearful of contracting any engagement with him  because  being  younger than me  he might be more apt to change  and the world might be  malicious enough to suppose I had practised upon his inexperience  but   conscious of my own integrity  I set slander at defiance  trusting to my  own behaviour  and his natural probity  for the continuance of his love   Though we did not live together in the same house  the greatest part of  our time was spent in each other s company  we dined and supped at the  same table  frequented public places  went upon parties to the country   and never parted  but for a few hours in the night  which we passed in  the utmost impatience to meet again    In this agreeable manner did the days roll on  when my felicity was  interrupted by a fit of jealousy with which I happened to be seized  I  had contracted an acquaintance with a young married lady  who  though  her personal attractions were but slender  was upon the whole an  agreeable  cheerful  good natured companion  with a little dash of  the coquette in her composition  This woman being in very indigent    6 22 15  3 45 PM   circumstances  occasioned by some losses her husband had sustained  no  sooner had an opportunity of seeing and conversing with my lover   than she formed the design of making a conquest of him  I should have  forgiven her for this scheme  whatever pangs it might have cost me  had  I believed it the effect of real passion  but I knew her too well to  suppose her heart was susceptible of love  and accordingly resented it   In the execution of her plan  she neglected nothing which she thought  capable of engaging his attention  She took all opportunities of sitting  near him at table  ogled him in the most palpable manner  directed her  whole discourse to him  trod
