of fiction now   popular is the only right form  if artistic method consists merely in   dramatic unity of interest  in weaving a plot which shall keep the   reader expectant and amused  without demanding of him even a   moment s reflection   if knowledge of human nature is to signify   merely its everyday and pettiest passions  failings  motives   if  in   a word  the canons which are necessary for a successful stage play   are also to limit fiction of eveiy kind   then this book  as a fiction    is a very bad one  and its editors must succumb to the too probable   verdict of an age which seems determined that art shall confine   itself more and more exclusively to the trivial  the temporary  and   the vulgar  which has made up its mind to have its novels written   by young ladies  and its pictures painted by pre Raphaelites   and   in which ideal art  whether in fiction or hi painting  seems steadily   dying out perhaps for want of that very realistic tone of thought   which is to be found in Henry Brooke          PREFACE  Iv     If  again  theology  properly so called  is to be henceforth an   extinct science   if nothing can be known of God s character  even   from the person of Jesus Christ  save that he will doom to endless   torture the vast majority of the human race  while he has made    for the purpose of delivering a very small minority  a certain highly   artificial arrangement  to be explained by no human notions of   justice or of love   if the divine morality be utterly different from   the ideal of human morality   if generosity  magnanimity  chivalry   all which seems most divine in man is to have no likeness in   God  no place in the service of God   if the motives of religion   are to be confined henceforth to the most selfish of human hopes    and the basest of human fears  if  in a word  Spurgeonism    whether Protestant or Catholic  is the only fit creed for mankind     then  indeed  all the seemingly noble teaching of this book  however   much it may seem to reflect the life of Christ  or the teaching of   St  Paul  is superfluous   and its diatribes may be passed over as   impertinent interferences with the dramatic unity of the plot      But if an ideal does exist of the human soul as of the human   body   if it be good to recollect that ideal now and then  and to   compare what man is with what man might be   if the heroic   literature of every nation  and above all these  the New Testament   itself  are witnesses for that spiritual ideal  just as Greek statuary   and the paintings of the great Italian masters are witnesses for   the physical ideal   if that ideal  though impossible with man  be   possible with God  and therefore the goal toward which every man   should tend  even though he come short of it   then it may be   allowable for some at least among the writers of fiction to set   forth that ideal  and the author of the  Fool of Quality  may be   just as truly a novelist in his own way  as the authoress of    Queechy  and the  Wide Wide World   There are those  in    deed  still left on earth who believe the contemplation of the actual    easy and amusing as it is  to be pernicious to most men without   a continual remembrance of the ideal   who would not put into   young hands even that Shakspeare who tells them what men are    without giving them  as a corrective  the Spenser and the Milton   who tell them what men might be   who would even  theological   questions apart  recommend to the philosophical student of mere   human nature the four Gospels rather than Balzac  But such are    doubtless  as Henry Brooke was  dreamers and idealists      And if  again  a theology be possible  and an anthropology not   contradictory to  but founded on  that theology  if the old   Catholic dogma that the Son of Man was the likeness of his   Father s glory  and the express image of his person  may be believed   still  as it is by a lingering few among Christians   hi any honest   and literal practical sense   if that be true which Mr  J  Stuart          vi PREFACE      Mill says in his late grand Essay upon Liberty  that  our popular   religious ethics  by holding out the hope of heaven and
