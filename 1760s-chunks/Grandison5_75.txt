I answer then  as supposing myself in your situation—I cannot expect that you will urge an interest  which I  by having put myself into that Page  187 of Lady Clementina  have promised not to urge  unless she change her mind  What plea can a parent make use of  but that of filial duty  And where the child can plead conscience in answer  ought it to be insisted on   And now  resuming MYSELF  let me presume to advise you to give the dear Lady full time to consider and re consider the case  Her imagination may be heated  In other words  her malady may have a share in the heroism she has so nobly exerted  And yet I am afraid she will persevere  Permit me  my Lords  to say afraid  I cannot wholly divest myself of Self  in this very affecting case  We will not therefore take her at her word  I will absent myself for some time from Bologna  but  as she has the goodness to acknowlege an esteem for me  with her leave  I will return at my time  I will repeat my absences  if we have the least shadow of doubt  But if she hold her purpose  and shall not be visibly worse in her health or mind  we may conclude her resolution unalterable  In this case  I shall have one or two requests to make you  and  if granted  will endeavour to make myself as happy as a man in such a situation can be   They applauded my advice  They declared themselves unwilling to think of giving up the pleasure they had brought themselves to have  in considering me as one of their family  and assured me  that it would have been impossible  that any the least difficulty should have arisen from them  after they had brought themselves to dispense with the most material one   They were earnest with me to pass the evening with them  But I excused myself  I wanted to be at my own lodgings  in order to revolve all that had passed  But having not taken leave of Lady Clementina  I imagined she might think I went away in ill humour  if I forbore it  My whole study  I told them  should be to make Lady Clementina easy  And if the Marchioness Page  188 would be so good as to permit me to take leave of her for the evening  in her presence  I would depart  only making my compliment to Signor Jeronymo  by Mr  Lowther  knowing that he would be grieved for my disappointment  and my mind not being at present easy enough  to contend with his concern for me   The Michioness said  she would see the way her Clementina was then in  and acquaint me  by Camilla  with her wishes  and then withdrew  leaving the Marquis  the Count  and me together   Before we could renew our discourse  the Bishop and Father Marescotti joined us  both in high spirits  They were excessively complaisant to me  It was easy to guess at the occasion of their good humour  I could not be greatly delighted with it  But when the Count told them what had passed  before they joined us  the Bishop embraced me  the Father unawares snatched my hand  and kissed it   I was glad to be relieved from their compliments  by the expected message from the Marchioness and Clementina   The young Lady met me  as I entered at the door of her apartment  She held out her hand to me  I respectfully took it  I saw she had been in tears  But she looked with a serenity  that I was glad to see  tho  I doubted not but it was partly owing to the conversation she had had since I left her  with her brother and her confessor  as well as to what might have passed between her mother and her   She led me to a chair between them both  She withdrew not her hand  and aimed at a more chearful countenance than I had a heart  I congratulated her on her serenity  It is in your power  Sir  said she  to make me still more serene—Can you  of a truth  and from your heart  approve of my present way of thinking  Can you  Chevalier —  I can admire you for it  madam  You have exalted yourself  in my opinion  But I must regret it— Page  189 Because—But I have promised not to urge you  Your conscience  madam  is concerned—To endeavour but to persuade against conscience  if you have no doubt of your motive  is not warranted  even in a parent   I am  I think I am  returned she  absolutely sure of my motive  But  my dear mamma  be pleased to put the questions I wished you to put to the Chevalier   She still suffered me to with hold her hand  and with the other took out her handkerchief  not to wipe away her tears  but to hide her blushes  She wept not  Her bosom heaved with the grandeur of her sentiments   The question  my dear Grandison  said the Marchioness  is this—We have all of us told my Clementina  that you are invincible
