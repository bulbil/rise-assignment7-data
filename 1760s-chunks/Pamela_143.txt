and sent safe to you        These  down to the execution of my unfortunate plot to escape  are    to the best of my remembrance  the contents of the papers  which this   merciless woman seized  For  how badly I came off  and what followed  I   still have safe  as I hope  sewed in my under coat  about my hips       In vain were all my prayers and tears to her  to get her not to shew   them to my master  For she said  It had now come out  why I affected to   be so much alone  and why I was always writing  And she thought herself   happy  she said  she had found these  for often and often had she   searched every place she could think of  for writings  to no purpose   before  And she hoped  she said  there was nothing in them by what any   body might see  for  said she  you know you are all innocence   Insolent   creature  said I  I am sure you are all guilt   And so you must do your   worst  for now I can t help myself  and I see there is no mercy to be   expected from you       Just now  my master being come up  she went to him upon the stairs  and   gave him my papers  There  sir  said she  you always said Mrs  Pamela   was a great writer  but I never could get at any thing of hers before    He took them  and  without coming to me  went down to the parlour again    And what with the gipsy affair  and what with this  I could not think   of going down to dinner  and she told him that too  and so I suppose I   shall have him up stairs  as soon as his company is gone          Saturday  six o clock       My master came up  and  in a pleasanter manner than I expected    said  So  Pamela  we have seized  it seems  your treasonable papers    Treasonable  said I  very sullenly  Ay  said he  I suppose so  for you   are a great plotter  but I have not read them yet       Then  sir  said I  very gravely  it will be truly honourable in you not   to read them  but to give them to me again  To whom  says he  are they   written   To my father  sir  but I suppose you see to whom   Indeed    returned he  I have not read three lines yet  Then  pray  sir  don t   read them  but give them to me again  That I will not  said he  till   I have read them  Sir  said I  you served me not well in the letters   I used to write formerly  I think it was not worthy your character   to contrive to get them in your hands  by that false John Arnold  for   should such a gentleman as you mind what your poor servant writes   Yes    said he  by all means  mind what such a servant as my Pamela writes       Your Pamela  thought I  Then the sham marriage came into my head  and   indeed it has not been out of it  since the gipsy affair   But  said   he  have you any thing in these papers you would not have me see  To   be sure  sir  said I  there is  for what one writes to one s father and   mother  is not for every body to see  Nor  said he  am I every body       Those letters  added he  that I did see by John s means  were not to   your disadvantage  I ll assure you  for they gave me a very high opinion   of your wit and innocence  And if I had not loved you  do you think I   would have troubled myself about your letters       Alas  sir  said I  great pride to me that  For they gave you such an   opinion of my innocence  that you was resolved to ruin me  And what   advantage have they brought me   Who have been made a prisoner  and used   as I have been between you and your housekeeper       Why  Pamela  said he  a little seriously  why this behaviour  for my   goodness to you in the garden   This is not of a piece with your conduct   and softness there  that quite charmed me in your favour  And you must   not give me
