a maroding party   129 in one of our modern gazettes  It is sufficient to observe  that several skirmishes only drew on the great and decisive victory of Cressy  which every honest Englishman boasts of to this very hour  In this memorable battle  Philip was at the head of an hundred thousand men  and Edward only of thirty thousand  The Black Prince  his son  as yet but a youth of fifteen  commanded the first line of the English army  The second was conducted by the Earls of Northampton and Arundel  and the body of reserve was headed by the King in person  He and the Prince of Wales had that morning received the sacrament with great devotion  and his behaviour denoted the calm intrepidity of a man resolved on conquest or death  The army being thus arranged  the King rode from rank to rank  with a chearful countenance  bad his soldiers remember the honour of their country  while his eloquence animated the whole army to a degree of enthusiastic expectation  To oppose the English  Philip had drawn up his formidable army in three divisions also  the first commanded by John of Luxembourg  the blind King of Bohemia  the second was led by the Count of Alencon  and  Philip  in person  commanded the body of reserve  This was the first battle that the Black Prince had seen  but he now appeared foremost in the very shock  and continued  for some time  to turn the fortune of the day  but his courage would have been soon oppressed by numbers  had not the Earl of Northampton come to his relief  The very thickest of the battle was now gathered round him  and the valour of a boy filled even veterans with astonishment  but their surprize at his courage could not give way to their sears for his person  apprehensive that some misfortune might happen   130 to him in the end  they sent the King word to hasten to the Prince s relief  Edward  who had all this time viewed the engagement from a windmili  with great deliberation asked if his son was dead  and  being answered  that he still lived and was giving astonishing instances of valour    Then tell my Generals  cried the King  that he shall have no assistance from me  the honour of this day shall be his  and he shall be indebted to his own merit alone for victory    Upon this occasion thirty thousand of the French were killed in the field of battle  and the day after they experienced another defeat  This victory is partly ascribed to four pieces of artillery  which the English first made use of here  and the use of which had been but lately discovered  Edward  after two victories gained in two days  took Calais  of which the English remained in possession two hundred and ten years     This war  which was at once carried on in three different counties of France  thinned the inhabitants of the invaded country  and drained that of the invaders  But a destruction  still more terrible than that of war  contributed  at this time  to desolate the wretched inhabitants of Europe  A pestilence more terrible than any mentioned in former history  which had already almost dispeopled Asia and Afric  came to settle upon the western world  with increased malignity  The fourth part of the people were cut off by it  in London it raged with such violence  that in one year s space there were buried  in Charter house churchyard  above fifty thousand persons  It was in the midst of this terrible scourge of nature  that the ambition of Edward and Philip were contending for new conquests  and adding to the calamities of mankind  These ravages  however  were silently   131 repaired by commerce and industry  those arts  which were then despised by Princes  were laying the seeds of future opulence and increased population  These arts were travelling  gradually  from Italy  and had begun to find harbour in England  the refinements and the pleasures of sense every day began to improve  but intellectual refinement was yet unknown  sensual enjoyments must ever be carried to some height  before mankind can find leisure or taste for entertainments of a more delicate nature   During the English victories on the continent  the Scotch  ever willing to embrace a favourable opportunity of rapine or revenge  invaded England with a numerous army  This unexpected invasion  at such a juncture  alarmed the English  but  however  was not capable of disheartening them  Lionel  Edward s son  who was left guardian of England during his father s absence  was yet but a boy  incapable of commanding an army  but the victories on the continent even seemed to inspire women with ardour  Philippa  Edward s Queen  took upon her to repulse the enemy  in person  to that end  heading the troops drawn together from all parts  with wonderful expedition  she marched directly against the Scots  and offered them battle  The Scotch King was no less impatient to engage  he imagined a victory would be easy against undisciplined troops  and headed by a woman  but he was miserably deceived  he had not only the mortification to lose the day  but to be made a prisoner by the
