 292 intended  However  he wrote a very strong letter to the manager in my favour  and put him in mind of the promise he had made in behalf of my play   As soon as I was certified of Brayer s return  I went to his house with this letter  but was told he was gone out —I called again next day early in the morning  received the same answer  and was desired to leave my name and business  I did so  and returned the day after  when the servant still affirmed that his master was gone abroad  though I perceived him  as I retired  observing me through a window —Incensed at this discovery  I went to a coffee house hard by  and inclosing his lordship s letter in one from myself  demanding a categorical answer  I sent it to his house by a porter  who returned in a few minutes  and told me Mr  Brayer would be glad to see me at that instant —I obeyed the summons  and was received with such profusion of compliments and apologies  that my resentment immediately subsided  and I was even in pain for the concern which this honest man shewed at the mistake of his servant  who  it seems  had been ordered to deny him to every body but me —He expressed the utmost veneration for his good and noble friend Lord Rattle  whom he should always be proud to serve  promised to peruse the play with all dispatch  and give me a meeting upon it  and as a testimony of his esteem  made me a present of a general order for the season  by which I would be admitted to any part of the theatre —This was a very agreeable compliment to me  whose greatest pleasure consisted in seeing dramatic performances  and you need not doubt that I often availed myself of my privilege    293 As I had an opportunity of being behind the scenes when I pleased  I frequently conversed with Mr  Brayer about my play  and asked when he intended to put it into rehearsal  but he had always so much business upon his hands  that it remained with him unopened a considerable while  and I became very uneasy about the season  that wasted apace  when I saw in the papers  another new play advertised  which had been written  offered  accepted and rehearsed in the compass of three months  without my knowledge or suspicion —You may easily guess how much I was confounded at this event  I own to you  that in the first transports of my anger  I suspected Mr  Brayer of having acted towards me in the most pitiful  perfidious manner  and was actually glad at his disappointment in the success of his favourite piece  which by the strength of art  lingered till the third night  and then died in a deplorable manner  But now that passion has no share in my reflection  I am willing to ascribe his behaviour to his want of memory or want of judgment  which  you know  are natural defects  that are more worthy of compassion than reproach   About this time  I happened to be in company with a gentlewoman  who having heard of my tragedy  told me  she was acquainted with the wife of a gentleman  who was very well known to a lady  who had great interest with a person who was intimate with Earl Sheerwit  and that if I pleased  she would use her influence in my behalf —As this nobleman had the character of a Maecenas in the nation  and could stamp a value upon any work by his sole countenance and approbation  I accepted her offer with eagerness  in full confidence of seeing my reputation established    264 and my wishes fulfilled in a very short time  provided that I should have the good fortune to please his Lordship s taste  I withdrew the manuscript from the hands of Mr  Brayer  and committed it to the care of this gentlewoman  who laboured so effectually in my interest  that in less than a month it was conveyed to the Earl  and in a few weeks after  I had the satisfaction to hear  that he had read  and approved it very much  Transported with this piece of intelligence  I flattered myself with the hopes of his interesting himself in its favour  but hearing no more of the matter in three whole months  I began  God forgive me  to suspect the veracity of the person who brought me the good tidings  for I thought it impossible  that a man of his rank and character  who knew the difficulty of writing a good tragedy  and understood the dignity of the work  should read and applaud an essay of this kind  without feeling an inclination to befriend the author  whom his countenance alone could raise above dependance —But it was not long before I sound my friends very much wronged by my opinion   You most know  that the civilities I had received from Lord Rattle  and the desire he manifested to promote the success of my play  encouraged me to write an account of my bad fortune to his Lordship  who condescended so far as to desire  by letter  a young Squire of a great estate  with whom he was intimate  to espouse my cause  and in particular
