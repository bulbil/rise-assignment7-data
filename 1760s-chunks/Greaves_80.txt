reason as much as it would outrage the laws of my country  If he who calls himself knight of the Griffin is really desirous of treading in the paths of true chivalry  he will not want opportunities of signalising his valour in the cause of virtue —Should he  notwithstanding this declaration  offer violence to me in the course of my occasions  he will always find me in a posture of defence  Or  should he persist in repeating his importunities  I shall without ceremony chastise the messenger   His declining the combat was interpreted into fear by Mr  Sycamore  who now became more insolent and ferocious  on the supposition of our knight s timidity  Sir Launcelot meanwhile went to breakfast with his friends  and  having put on his armour  ordered the horses to be brought forth  Then he paid the bill  and walking deliberately to the gate  in presence of Squire Sycamore and his attendants  vaulted at one spring into the saddle of Bronzomarte  whose neighing and curveting proclaimed the joy he felt in being mounted by his accomplished master   Though the knight of the Griffin did not think proper to insult his rival personally  his friend Dawdle did not fail to crack some jokes on the figure and horsemanship of Crowe  who again declared he should be glad to fall in with him upon the voyage  Nor did Mr  Clarke s black patch and rueful countenance pass unnoticed and unridiculed  As for Timothy Crabshaw  he beheld his brother squire with the contempt of a veteran  and Gilbert paid him his compliments with his heels at parting  But when our adventurer and his retinue were clear of the inn  Mr  Sycamore ordered his trumpeter to sound a retreat  by way of triumph over his antagonist   Perhaps he would have contented himself with this kind of victory  had not Dawdle further inflamed his envy and ambition  by launching out in praise of Sir Launcelot  He observed that his countenance was open and manly  his joints strong knit  and his form unexceptionable  that he trod like Hercules  and vaulted into the saddle like a winged Mercury  Nay  he even hinted it was lucky for Sycamore that the knight of the Crescent happened to be so pacifically disposed  His patron sickened at these praises  and took fire at the last observation  He affected to undervalue personal beauty  though the opinion of the world had been favourable to himself in that particular  He said he was at least two inches taller than Greaves  and as to shape and air  he would make no comparisons  but with respect to riding  he was sure he had a better seat than Sir Launcelot  and would wager five hundred to fifty guineas  that he would unhorse him at the first encounter   There is no occasion for laying wagers   replied Mr  Dawdle   the doubt may be determined in half an hour—Sir Launcelot is not a man to avoid you at full gallop   Sycamore  after some hesitation  declared he would follow and provoke him to battle  on condition that Dawdle would engage Crowe  and this condition was accepted  For  though Davy had no stomach to the trial  he could not readily find an excuse for declining it  Besides  he had discovered the captain to be a very bad horseman  and resolved to eke out his own scanty valour with a border of ingenuity  The servants were immediately ordered to unpack the armour  and  in a little time  Mr  Sycamore made a very formidable appearance  But the scene that followed is too important to be huddled in at the end of a chapter  and therefore we shall reserve it for a more conspicuous place in these memoirs             CHAPTER NINETEEN  CONTAINING THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE KNIGHTS OF THE GRIFFIN AND CRESCENT   Mr  Sycamore  alias the knight of the Griffin  so denominated from a griffin painted on his shield  being armed at all points  and his friend Dawdle provided with a certain implement  which he flattered himself would ensure a victory over the novice Crowe  they set out from the George  with their attendants  in all the elevation of hope  and pranced along the highway that led towards London  that being the road which our adventurer pursued  As they were extremely well mounted  and proceeded at a round pace  they  in less than two hours  came up with Sir Launcelot and his company  and Sycamore sent another formal defiance to the knight by his trumpeter  Dawdle having  for good reasons  declined that office   Our adventurer hearing himself thus addressed  and seeing his rival  who had passed him  posted to obstruct his progress  armed cap a pee  with his lance in the rest  determined to give the satisfaction that was required  and desired that the regulations of the combat might be established  The knight of the Griffin proposed  that the vanquished party should resign all pretensions to Miss Aurelia Darnel  in favour of the victor  that  while the principals were engaged  his friend Dawdle should run a tilt with Captain Crowe  that Squire Crabshaw and Mr  Sycamore s servant should keep themselves in readiness to assist their respective masters occasionally  according to the law of arms  and that Mr
