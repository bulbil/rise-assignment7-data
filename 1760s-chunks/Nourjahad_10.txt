the reason of all this  cried he out in a rage  are ye all leagued in combination against me  Be quick and explain to me the cause of this distraction which appears amongst you     Hasem  who had run in amongst the other domestics  took upon him to answer for the rest  It is not to be wondered at  my lord  said he  that your slaves seem surprised at seeing you thus  Page  60  as it were raised from the dead  but if they are amazed  their joy doubtless is equal to their wonder  mine I am sure is unutterable  to behold my lord once more restored to his faithful servants  after we had almost despaired of your ever more unclosing your eyes     You talk strangely  said ← Nourjahad →   a little staggered at what he saw and heard  He just then recollected the terms on which he had received the important gift from the genius  and began to suspect that he had endured one of those preternatural slumbers  to which he had subjected himself  How long may I have slept  said he  Four years and twenty days exactly  answered Hasem  I have reason to know  for I counted  Page  61  the melancholy hours as they passed  and seldom quitted your bed side  It may be so  said ← Nourjahad →   I have been subject to these trances from a boy  but this has lasted rather longer than usual  He then commanded all his slaves to withdraw  retaining only Hasem  with whom he wanted to have some discourse     Tell me now  said he   when they were alone  and tell me truly  is all I have heard real  and is Mandana actually dead  Too true  my lord  replied Hasem  Mandana died in childbed  and dying left her infant son to my care  Is my child alive  said ← Nourjahad → eagerly  He is  my lord  answered Hasem  and you shall see him presently  Mandana  Page  62  called me to her  continued he  when she found herself dying     Hasem  said she  be careful of your lord  Heaven will one day restore him to you again  See that you manage his household with the same prudence and regularity that you would if he himself were to inspect into your conduct  for be assured he will sooner or later exact a just account of your proceedings  Here are the keys of his coffers  I ventured to take them from under his pillow  where I knew he kept them  I have husbanded his fortune with oeconomy  and have hitherto kept order and harmony in his family  On you it rests to preserve it in the same condition  ← Nourjahad → will not fail to reward your  Page  63  diligence and fidelity  It is not expedient that any one should know the condition to which he is reduced  His life is governed by a strange fatality  You have nothing to do therefore  but to give out that he is seized with a lingering distemper  which confines him to his bed  Let no impertinent enquirers see him  and all curiosity about him will soon cease  These  proceeded Hasem  were almost the last words that my beloved mistress spoke  I have punctually complied with her orders  Your condition has been kept a profound secret from every one but your own family  and they all love you too well to betray their trust  Your women are all immured within the sacred walls of your seraglio  and though they murmur at  Page  64  their situation  they fail not to offer up their daily prayers that Heaven would restore you to them  I will now  continued he  present your son to you  it will be some consolation to you to see that charming pledge of Mandana s love  Saying this  he withdrew  but soon returned leading in the child  who was as beautiful as a little cherub     ← Nourjahad → melted into tears at the sight of him  and renewed his complaints for the loss of his adored Mandana  He saw that the child s age seemed to agree exactly with the account he had received  and now fully convinced of the truth of his misfortune  Oh Heaven  cried he  clasping the young boy to his bosom  what would I give that my dear  Page  65  Mandana were now here to partake of the pleasure I feel in this infant s caresses  gladly would I consent to have three ages cut off from the number of my years  to have her more precious life restored  But my felicity would then be too great  and I must submit to the destiny which I myself have chosen  Prudent Hasem  said he  observing he looked surprised  thou dost wonder at the words which thou hast heard me speak  but I will not conceal from thee the marvellous story of my life  Thy sidelity and zeal deserve this confidence  besides  it is requisite that I should trust some discreet person with my important secret  since Mandana  on whose tenderness and loyalty I could depend  is no more     Page  66
