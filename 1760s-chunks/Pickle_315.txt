the passage into  St  James s  the mischievous youth interrupted him all at once  saying    I see you are for the end of the walk  this is my way   With these  words he took leave of the saunterer  who would have delayed his  retreat  by calling to him aloud  that he had not yet described the  situation of his castle  But Peregrine  without stopping  answered  in the same tone   Another time will do as well   and in a moment  disappeared  leaving the projector very much mortified with his  disappointment  for his intention was to close the description with a  demand of twenty pieces  to be repaid out of the first remittance he  should receive from his estate   It would have been well for our hero  had he always acted with the same  circumspection  But he had his unguarded moments  in which he fell a  prey to the unsuspecting integrity of his own heart  There was a  person among the number of his acquaintances  whose conversation he  particularly relished  because it was frank  agreeable  and fraught with  many sensible observations upon the craft and treachery of mankind  This  gentleman had made shift to discuss a very genteel fortune  though  it was spent with taste and reputation  and now he was reduced to his  shifts for the maintenance of his family  which consisted of a wife  and child  Not that he was destitute of the necessaries of life  being  comfortably supplied by the bounty of his friends  but this was a  provision not at all suited to his inclination  and he had endeavoured   by divers unsuccessful schemes  to retrieve his former independency     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Peregrine happened one evening to be sitting alone in a coffee house   where he overheard a conversation between this schemer and another  gentleman  touching an affair that engaged his attention  The stranger  had been left trustee for fifteen hundred pounds bequeathed to the  other s daughter by an aunt  and was strongly solicited to pay the money  to the child s father  who assured him  he had then an opportunity to  lay it out in such a manner as would greatly conduce to the advantage of  his family  The trustee reminded him of the nature of his charge  which  made him accountable for the money until the child should have attained  the age of eighteen  but at the same time gave him to understand   that  if he could procure such security as would indemnify him from the  consequences  he would forthwith pay the legacy into his hands  To this  proposal the father replied that it was not to be supposed he would  risk the fortune of his only child upon any idle scheme or precarious  issue  and therefore he thought it reasonable  that he should have the  use of it in the meantime  and that  as to security  he was loth to  trouble any of his friends about an affair which might be compromised  without their interposition  observing  that he would not look upon his  condescension as a favour  if obtained by security  on which he could  borrow the same sum from any usurer in town   After much importunity on one side  and evasion on the other  the  moneyed gentleman told him  that  though he would not surrender the sum  deposited in his hands for the use of his daughter  he would lend him  what he should have occasion for in the meantime  and if  upon her being  of age  he should be able to obtain her concurrence  the money should be  placed to her account  provided he could find any person of credit  who  would join with him in a bond  for the assurance of the lender  This  proviso was an obstruction which the other would not have been able to  surmount  without great difficulty  had not his cause been espoused by  our hero  who thought it was a pity a man of honour and understanding  should suffer in his principal concerns on such a paltry consideration   He therefore  presuming on his acquaintance  interposed in the  conversation as a friend  who interested himself in the affair  and   being fully informed of the particulars  offered himself as a security  for the lender  This gentleman being a stranger to Peregrine  was  next day made acquainted with his funds  and  without further scruple   accommodated his friend with one thousand pounds  for which he took  their bond payable in six months  though he protested that the money  should never be demanded  until the infant should be of age  unless some  accident should happen which he could not then foresee  Pickle  believed this declaration sincere  because he could have no interest in  dissembling  but what he chiefly depended upon  for his own security   was the integrity and confidence of the borrower  who assured him   that happen what would  he should be able to stand between him and all  danger  the nature of his plan being such as would infallibly treble
