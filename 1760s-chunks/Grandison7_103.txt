among us  yet  that every beneficent scheme is going on  Not one improvement stands still  He knows not what it is to be one moment idle   Dr  Bartlett tells me  that some gentlemen of prime consideration in the county  have been offering my brother their interest against the next election  He modestly acknowleged the grateful sense he had of the honour done him  but declined it for the pre sent  as having been too little a while returned into his own country  after so long an absence  to be as yet fit for a trust so important  We young men  said he  are apt to be warm  When we have not studied a point throughly  we act upon hasty conclusions  and sometimes support  sometimes oppose  on insufficient grounds  I would not be under Engagements to any party  Neither can I think of contributing to destroy the morals and health of all the country people round me  to make myself what is called an Interest  Forgive me  gentlemen  I mean not to slight your favours  But on such an occasion  I ought to be explicit   But  after the gentlemen were gone  There is a county  Dr  Bartlett  said he  of which I should be ambitious to be one of the representatives  had I a natural interest in it  because of the reverence I bear to the good man  to whom in that case I should have the honour to call myself a collegue  When I can think myself more worthy than at present I am  of standing in such a civil relation to him  I shall consider him  as another Gamaliel  at whose feet  so   265 long absent as I have been from my native country  I shall be proud to be initiated into the service of the public   It is not difficult to guess  who my brother—But my Marmouset is squalling for me  and I must fly to silence it   Now  Lucy  that I have pacified my Brat  do I wish you with me at my window  My Brother and his Harriet only  at this instant walking almost under it  engaged in earnest conversation  Seemingly  how pleasing a one  admiration and tenderness mingled in his looks  In her  while he speaks  the most delighted attention  When she answers  love  affiance  modest deference  benevolence  compassion  an expression that no pen can describe—Knowing them both so well  and acquainted with their usual behaviour to each other  I can make it all out  She is pleading  I am sure  for Clementina  Charming pleader —Yet  my dear Mrs  Shirley  I fear her reasonings are romantic ones  Our Harriet  you know  was always a little tinctured with Heroism  and she goes back in her mind to the time that she thought she could never be the wife of any other man than my brother  tho  then hopeless that he could be hers   and supposes Clementina in the same situation   When I looked first  I dare say  he was giving her an account of the conversation that passed an hour ago  between him and Clementina  He had his arm round her waist  sometimes pressing her to him as they walked  sometimes standing still  and  on her replies  raising her hand to his lips  with such tender possion—But here she comes   Harriet  if I am a witch  let Lucy know it  Here—read this last paragraph—Have I guessed right at your subject of discourse —You will tell me  you say  in a Letter by itself—Do so     266  LETTER LIII  Lady GRANDISON  To Miss SELBY     In Continuation of Lady G s Subject    YOU need not be told  my dear Lucy  that our charming Lady G  is mistress of penetration  Your happy Harriet had been engaged in the most pleasing conversation  The best of husbands conceals not from her one emotion of his excellent heart  He is greatly distressed for Clementina  It would be unworthy of his character  if he were not  Yet he seems to think she may be happy with the Count of Belvedere  That is the point we have been debating  As Sir Charles would have been the man of her choice  but for an invincible obstacle  is it not owing  partly to his delicate modesty  that he thinks she may be so  What think you  Lucy   Lady G  says  I make Clementina s case my own  Be it so  because so it ought to be  Could I have been happy with Lord D —Call it romantic  if you please  Lady G   I think it impossible that I could  even tho  I could not form to myself  that Sir Charles Grandison himself would make the tender  the indulgent husband he makes to the happiest of women   Sir Charles gave me the particulars of the conversation that passed between him and Lady Clementina in the garden  He observed  that she is not a stranger to the Count s resolution  never to marry while she remains unmarried  and that it is the intention of that nobleman to return to Italy  and not go to Spain at all
