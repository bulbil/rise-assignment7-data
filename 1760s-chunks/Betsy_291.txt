  them  The pride of subduing hearts is mine no more  no man can now   pretend to love me but with the basest and most shameful views  The man   who dares to tell me he adores me  contradicts himself by that very   declaration  and while he would persuade me he has the highest opinion   of me  discovers he has in reality the meanest        In fine  she now saw herself  and the errors of her past conduct  in   their true light   How strange a creature have I been   cried she   how   inconsiderate with myself  I knew the character of a coquette both silly   and insignificant  yet did every thing in my power to acquire it  I   aimed to inspire awe and reverence in the men  yet  by my imprudence    emboldened them to the most unbecoming freedoms with me  I have sense   enough to discern real merit in those who professed themselves my   lovers  yet affected to treat most ill those in whom I found the   greatest share of it  Nature has made me no fool  yet not one action of   my life has given any proof of common reason        Even in the greatest and most serious affair of life  that of   marriage   added she with a deep sigh   have I not been governed wholly   by caprice  I rejected Mr  Trueworth only because I thought I did not   love him enough  yet gave my hand to Mr  Munden  whom  at that time  I   did not love at all  and who has since  alas  taken little care to   cultivate that affection I have laboured to feel for him        In summing up this charge against herself  she found that all her faults   and her misfortunes had been owing either to an excess of vanity  a   mistaken pride  or a false delicacy  The two former appeared now too   contemptible in her eyes for her not to determine utterly to extirpate    but the latter she found less reason to correct  since it happened only   in regard to Mr  Trueworth  and could never happen again  as both their   marriages had put a total end to all tender communication between them       This change in Mrs  Munden s humour  great and sudden as it was  did   not  however  prove a transient one  every day  every hour  confirmed   her in it  and if at any time her natural vivacity made her seem a   little pleased on hearing her wit  her beauty  or any other perfection   or accomplishment  too lavishly extolled  she presently checked herself   for it  and assumed a look of reserve  which  though less haughty than   she had sometimes put on upon different occasions  had not the less   effect  and seldom failed to awe the flatterer into silence  a proof of   which the reader will be immediately presented with                CHAPTER XV       Contains such things as will be pleasing to those whose candid   dispositions interest them in favour of the heroine of this history          Nothing so much encourages an unwarrantable passion for a married woman    as to know she has a husband regardless of her charms  A young gay   gentleman  a companion of Mr  Munden s  privy to most of his secrets    and partner with him in many a debauch  had seen Mrs  Munden at Miss   Airish s  where she still continued to visit  He had entertained a kind   of roving flame for her  which his friendship for her husband could not   prevent him from wishing to gratify  but  though they often met  he   never could get an opportunity of declaring himself  all he could do was   sometimes to whisper in her ear that she was divinely handsome  that he   adored her  and that he died for her  and such like stuff  which she was   too often accustomed to hear to take much notice of       The indifferent opinion which most men of pleasure  or  in other words    genteel rakes of the town  have of women in general  joined to the too   great gaiety he had observed in Mrs  Munden s behaviour  made him   imagine there required little more for the gaining her than the making   his addresses to her  The means of speaking to her in private seemed to   him the sole difficulty he had to get over  and  in order to do so  he   wrote to her in the following terms             To Mrs  Munden            Madam
