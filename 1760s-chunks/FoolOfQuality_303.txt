JESUS  the good SAMARITAN    had compassion upon them  and bound up their wounds  pouring   therein the oil of his grace and the wine of his gladness   and ex    pended twopence  even the two precious pence of his own body   and blood  for perfecting their recovery      But  my dearest sir  said Harry  if my question does not intrude    pray  how was it consistent with justice that the sufferings of the         330 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      innocent should atone both for  and instead of  the guilty  For   this also was one of Mole s cardinal objections      Your question  said Mr  Fenton  falls aptly in its place  When   Adam  as I have told you  apostatized from his God  and lusted   after the gross and sensual fruits of this world  and fed upon them    and thereupon became a partaker of their nature and malignity     he fell from his paradise and sovereignty together  and he became   a poor subject  and miserable slave  to all the evils and inclemencies   of that temporary nature  over which he had been constituted a   throned lord and controller      Here was a deep and woful fall  my Harry  from sovereignty   to slavery  from eternity into time  from immortality into corrup    tion  from bliss into misery  and from life into death   The very    state in which the wretched heirs of his fallen nature find them    selves at this day  How then was he to rise  if ever to rise again     Could this be effected by any powers of his own  If he did not   stand in the state of his strength  how shall he recover and be   able to re ascend in the state of his weakness  How think you    my Harry   A self evident impossibility  answered Harry      Here then  continued Mr  Fenton  we find the universe of man   depraved  fallen and sunk into the darkness of sin and error  into   the dungeon of gross and corruptible flesh  and circled about and   closed in by the barriers and gates of death  And these prisons   were to be broken through  these gates were to burst open  before   he could re enter upon light and immortality  All the enemies   who had conquered man  sin  Satan  and temptation  were also to   be conquered      But how was this to be done  A world lay at stake  and the   great question was  Whether the whole race of man should continue   in endless guilt and misery  or be restored to ever  enduring purity   and blessedness  Wherefore  what all the powers of creation   were not able to attempt  Jesus  in the humanity  undertook to   accomplish      Here you see  my child  that justice had little to do in the case    It was not the justice of punishment  but the mercy of deliverance    that the love of our heavenly Father required  Justice indeed   affirmed that suffering was due to sin  and was the necessary   attendant and consequence thereof  and this also the love of our   Christ willingly took upon himself  He conquered suffering through   sufferings  and was thereby made the perfect and accomplished   captain of our salvation  He entered into our flesh  he went   through all the passages of this vale of tears and region of misery   into which we are fallen   through poverty  contempt  rejection    reproach   through all that the rage and rancour of men and devils   could inflict  his bloody sweat and horrors of hell  bonds  buffetings    spittings  scourgings  the bloody mockery of a thorny crown  and   all the soul rending tortures of an agonizing crucifixion  till at last   he triumphantly cried   It is finished     and gave up the ghost    From the cross he descended into the grave   from the grave again   he rose in glory  and ascended into heaven  where he led captivity   captive  and showed the powers of darkness bound   that he might   lead all the followers of his beatific cross  in his own divine process          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  331     to conquest through sufferings  to glory through abasement  to   exaltation through humiliation   through death into life  and   through the calamities of time to a never ending  ever blessing    ever joyful eternity       But  sir  said Harry   was the humanity of our blessed Saviour   the same as ours is   for so the
