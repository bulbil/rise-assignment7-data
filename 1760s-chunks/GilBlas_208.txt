if he did not write a good hand  But  happily  he has the pen of a ready scribe  and keeps his head above water by the exercise of that talent  I was curious to see whether this boasted hand writing was so much better than my own  The licentiate  who had a specimen in his pocket  shewed me a sheet which I admired very much  it had all the regularity of a writing master s copy  In looking over this model of penman ship  an idea occurred to me  I begged Garcia to leave this paper in my hands  saying  that I might be able to do something with it which should turn out to his advantage  that I could not explain myself at that moment  but would tell him more the next day  The licentiate  to whom the steward had evidently talked big about my capacity to serve him  withdrew in as good spirits as if he had already been restored to his functions   I was in earnest in my endeavour that he should be so  and lost no time in setting to work  Happening to be alone with the archbishop  I produced the specimen  My patron was delighted with it  Seizing on this favourable opportunity  May it please your grace  said I  since you are determined not to put your homilies to the press  I should very much like them at last to be transcribed in this masterly manner   I am very well satisfied with your performance  answered the prelate  but yet I own that it would be a pleasant thing enough to have a copy of my works in that hand  Your grace  replied I  has only to signify your wishes  The man who copies so well is a licentiate of my acquaintance  It will give him so much the more pleasure to gratify you  as it may be the means of interesting your goodness to extricate him from the melancholy situation to which he has the misfortune at present to be reduced   The prelate could not do otherwise than inquire the name of this licentiate  I told him it was Lewis Garcias  He is in despair at having drawn down your censure upon him  That Garcias  interrupted he  if I am not mistaken  was chaplain in a convent of nuns  and has been brought into the ecclesiastical court as a delinquent  I recollect some very heavy charges which have been sent me against him  His morals are not the most exemplary  May it please your grace  interrupted I in my turn  it is not for me to justify him in all points  but I know that he has enemies  He maintains that the authors of the informations you have received are more bent on doing him an ill office than on vindicating the purity of religion  That very possibly may be the case  replied the archbishop  there are a great many firebrands in the world  Besides  though we should take it for granted that his conduct has not always been above suspicion  he may have repented of his sins  in short  the mercies of heaven are infinite  however heinous our transgressions  Bring that licentiate before me  I take off his suspension   Thus it is that men of the most austere character descend from their altitudes  when interest or a favourite whim reduces them to the level of the frail  The archbishop granted  without a struggle  to the empty vanity of having his works well copied  what he had refused to the most respectable applications  I carried the news with all possible expedition to the steward  who communicated it to his friend Garcias  That licentiate  on the following day  came to return me thanks commensurate with the favour obtained  I presented him to my master  who contented himself with giving him a slight reprimand  and put the homilies into his hand  to copy them out fair  Garcias performed the task so satisfactorily  that he was reinstated in the cure of souls  and was afterwards preferred to the living of Gabia  a large market town in the neighbourhood of Grenada       CH  IV     The Archbishop is afflicted with a stroke of apoplexy  How Gil Blas gets into a dilemma  and how he gets out   WHILE I was thus rendering myself a blessing first to one and then to the other  Don Ferdinand de Leyva was making his arrangements for leaving Grenada  I called on that nobleman before his departure  to thank him once more for the advantageous post he had procured me  My expressions of satisfaction were so lively  that he said    My dear Gil Blas  I am delighted to find you in such good humour with my uncle the archbishop  I am absolutely in love with him  answered I  His goodness to me has been such as I can never sufficiently acknowledge  Less than my present happiness could never have made me amends for being at so great a distance from Don Caesar and his son  I am persuaded  replied he  that they are both of them equally chagrined at having lost you  But possibly you are not separated for ever  fortune may some day bring you together again  I could not hear such an idea started without being moved by it  My sighs would find
