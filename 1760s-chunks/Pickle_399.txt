if she  did not quietly retire to her chamber  and behave as became a person  in her present situation  he should insist upon her removing to another  lodging without delay  for he was determined to be master in his own  family  The lady  who  in all probability  expected that he would  endeavour to appease her with all the tenderness of filial submission   was so much exasperated at his cavalier behaviour  that her constitution  could not support the transports of her spirits  and she was carried off  by her women in a fit  while the officious clergyman was dismissed after  his pupil  with all the circumstances of disgrace   Our hero having thus made his quarters good  took possession of the best  apartment in the house  and sent notice of his arrival to Mr  Clover   who  with his wife  visited him in less than an hour  and was not a  little surprised to find him so suddenly settled in his father s house     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The meeting of Julia and her brother was extremely pathetic  She had  always loved him with uncommon tenderness  and looked upon him as the  ornament of her family  but she had heard of his extravagances with  regret  and though she considered the stories that were circulated  at his expense  as the malicious exaggerations of his mother and her  darling son  her apprehension had been grievously alarmed by an account  of his imprisonment and distress  which had been accidentally conveyed  to that country by a gentleman from London  who had been formerly of his  acquaintance  she could not  therefore  without the most tender emotions  of joy  see him  as it were  restored to his rightful inheritance  and  re established in that station of life which she thought he could fill  with dignity and importance   After their mutual expressions of affection  she retired to her  mother s chamber  with a view to make a second offer of her service  and attendance  which had been already rejected with scorn since her  father s death  while Peregrine consulted his brother in law about the  affairs of the family  so far as they had fallen within his cognizance  and observation  Mr  Clover told him  that  though he was never favoured  with the confidence of the defunct  he knew some of his intimates  who  had been tampered with by Mrs  Pickle  and even engaged to second the  remonstrances by which she had often endeavoured to persuade her husband  to settle his affairs by a formal will  but that he had from time  to time evaded their importunities with surprising excuses of  procrastination  that plainly appeared to be the result of invention  and design  far above the supposed pitch of his capacity  a circumstance  from which Mr  Clover concluded  that the old gentleman imagined his  life would not have been secure  had he once taken such a step as would  have rendered it unnecessary to the independence of his second son   He moreover observed  that  in consequence of this information  he no  sooner heard of Mr  Pickle s death  which happened at the club  than he  went directly with a lawyer to his house  before any cabal or conspiracy  could be formed against the rightful heir  and  in presence of witnesses  provided for the purpose  sealed up all the papers of the deceased   after the widow had  in the first transports of her sorrow and vexation   fairly owned  that her husband had died intestate   Peregrine was extremely well satisfied with this intelligence  by which  all his doubts were dispelled  and  having cheerfully supped with his  friends on a cold collation  which his brother in law had brought in his  chariot  they retired to rest  in different chambers  after Julia had  met with another repulse from her capricious mother  whose overflowing  rage had now subsided into the former channel of calm inveteracy  Next  morning the house was supplied with some servants from the garrison  and  preparations were made for the funeral of the deceased  Gam having taken  lodgings in the neighbourhood  came with a chaise and cart to demand  his mother  together with his own clothes  and her personal effects   Our hero  though he would not suffer him to enter the door  allowed  his proposal to be communicated to the widow  who eagerly embraced the  opportunity of removing  and was  with her own baggage  and that of  her beloved son  conveyed to the place which he had prepared for her  reception  Thither she was followed by her woman  who was desired by  Peregrine to assure her mistress  that  until a regular provision could  be settled upon her  she might command him  in point of money  or any  other accommodation in his power     6 22 15  3 45 PM   CHAPTER CV    He performs the last Offices to his Father  and returns to London  upon  a very interesting Design   Suits of mourning being provided for
