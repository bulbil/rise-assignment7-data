authority with which you were invested  entailed a reproach upon your office  and  instead of being revered as a blessing  you are detested as a curse among your fellow creatures  This indeed is generally the case of low fellows  who are thrust into the magistracy without sentiment  education  or capacity    Among other instances of your iniquity  there is now in prison an unhappy woman  infinitely your superior in the advantages of birth  sense  and education  whom you have  even without provocation  persecuted to ruin and distraction  after having illegally and inhumanly kidnapped her only child  and exposed him to a violent death in a foreign land  Ah  caitiff  if you were to forego all the comforts of life  distribute your means among the poor  and do the severest penance that ever priestcraft prescribed for the rest of your days  you could not atone for the ruin of that hapless family  a family through whose sides you cruelly and perfidiously stabbed the heart of an innocent young woman  to gratify the pride and diabolical malice of that wretched lowbred woman  who now sits at your right hand as the associate of power and presumption  Oh  if such a despicable reptile shall annoy mankind with impunity  if such a contemptible miscreant shall have it in his power to do such deeds of inhumanity and oppression  what avails the law  Where is our admired constitution  the freedom  the security of the subject  the boasted humanity of the British nation  Sacred Heaven  if there was no human institution to take cognisance of such atrocious crimes  I would listen to the dictates of eternal justice  and  arming myself with the right of nature  exterminate such villains from the face of the earth    These last words he pronounced in such a strain  while his eyes lightened with indignation  that Gobble and his wife underwent the most violent agitation  the constable s teeth chattered in his head  the jailor trembled  and the whole audience was overwhelmed with consternation   After a short pause  Sir Launcelot proceeded in a milder strain   Thank Heaven  the laws of this country have exempted me from the disagreeable task of such an execution  To them we shall have immediate recourse  in three separate actions against you for false imprisonment  and any other person who has been injured by your arbitrary and wicked proceedings  in me shall find a warm protector  until you shall be expunged from the commission with disgrace  and have made such retaliation as your circumstances will allow for the wrongs you have done the community    In order to complete the mortification and terror of the justice  the lawyer  whose name was Fenton  declared that  to his certain knowledge  these actions would be reinforced with divers prosecutions for corrupt practices  which had lain dormant until some person of courage and influence should take the lead against Justice Gobble  who was the more dreaded  as he acted under the patronage of Lord Sharpington  By this time fear had deprived the justice and his helpmate of the faculty of speech  They were indeed almost petrified with dismay  and made no effort to speak  when Mr  Fillet  in the rear of the knight  as he retired with his company  took his leave of them in these words   And now  Mr  Justice  to dinner with what appetite you may    Our adventurer  though warmly invited to Mr  Fenton s house  repaired to a public inn  where he thought he should be more at his ease  fully determined to punish and depose Gobble from his magistracy  to effect a general jail delivery of all the debtors whom he had found in confinement  and in particular to rescue poor Mrs  Oakley from the miserable circumstances in which she was involved   In the meantime he insisted upon entertaining his friends at dinner  during which many sallies of sea wit and good humour passed between Captain Crowe and Dr  Fillet  which last had just returned from a neighbouring village  whither he was summoned to fish a man s yard arm  which had snapt in the slings  Their enjoyment  however  was suddenly interrupted by a loud scream from the kitchen  whither Sir Launcelot immediately sprung  with equal eagerness and agility  There he saw the landlady  who was a woman in years  embracing a man dressed in a sailor s jacket  while she exclaimed   It is thy own flesh and blood  so sure as I m a living soul —Ah  poor Greaves  poor Greaves  many a poor heart has grieved for thee   To this salutation the youth replied   I m sorry for that  mistress —How does poor mother  how does Suky Sedgemoor    The good woman of the house could not help shedding tears at these interrogations  while Sir Launcelot  interposing  said  not without emotion   I perceive you are the son of Mrs  Oakley —Your mother is in a bad state of health  but in me you will find a real parent   Perceiving that the young man eyed him with astonishment  he gave him to understand that his name was Launcelot Greaves   Oakley no sooner heard these words pronounced  than he fell upon his knees  and seizing the knight
