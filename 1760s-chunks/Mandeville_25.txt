advances to Fondville  which  knowing your capricious sex as I do  rather alarmed me  I therefore determined to destroy the effect if her arts by playing off  in opposition  a more refined species of coquetry  which        1 126       turned all Fondville s attention on myself  and saved Harry from the snare she was laying for him  a snare of all others the hardest to escape      When I saw I had by the most delicate flattery chained Fondville to my carr for the night  and by playing off a few quality airs inspired him with the strongest contempt for his city partner  and threw myself into a chair  where  affecting an excess of languor and fatigue  and wondering at the amazing constitutions of the country Ladies  I declared my attention of dancing no more        Sir Charles Mellifont  who danced with me  sat down on one side  and Fondville on the other  pouring forth a rhapsody of tender nonsense  vowing all other women were only foils to me  envying Sir Charles s happiness  and kissing my hand with an affectation of transport  which pleased me          1 127       as I saw it mortified the cit  who sat swelling with spite in a window near us  in a situation of mind which I could almost have pitied      I sat a full hour  receiving the homage of both my adorers  my head reclined  and my whole person in an attitude of the most graceful negligence and inattention  when  observing the Cittadina ready to faint with envy and indignation  turning my eye carelessly on her  Oh  Heavens  Fondville  said I  you are in inhuman creature  you have absolutely forgot your partner  then  starting with Sir Charles  rejoined the dance with an air of easy impertinence  which she could not stand  but burst into tears  and withdrew        You most know this affair was all of my contriving  I was determined to try the reality of the girl s passion  to quiet Harry s conscience as to cruelty of rejecting her suit           1 128       and remove those apprehensions for her life  which seemed so infinitely to distress him      Full of these ideas  I wrote by one of my servants to Fondville  immediately after Harry communicated to us the Cittadina s tragedy letter  commanding him to be at this ball  drest for conquest  to enquire out Miss Westbrook  whom he had never seen  to pretend a sudden and violent passion for her  and to entreat the honor of being her partner  that it was a whim I had taken into my head  that I would explain my reasons another time  but insisted on his implicit obedience         He came  he saw  he conquered   as I imagined he would  I knew her rage for title  tinsel  and  people of a certain rank   and that Fondville was exactly calculated for the meridian of her taste  understanding  and education  The overcharged splendor          1 129       of his dress and equipage must have infinite advantages  with one who had so long breathed city air  over the genuine elegance of Harry Mandeville s  nor was it possible in the nature of things for the daughter of an exchange broker to prefer even personal perfection to the dazzling blaze of a coronet  Harry s charms gave way before the flattering idea of a title  and the gentle God resigned his place to the greater power  Ambition      Things to be sure have taken rather a disagreeable turn  but she must thank her own inconstancy  and be content for the future with making love to one man at a time        I have only one more scene of mortification in view for her  and my malice will be satisfied  I would invite her to a ball at Belmont  let Harry dance with Lady Julia           1 130       take Fondville myself  and pair her with the most disagreeable fellow in the room      You have no notion how Harry s vanity is hurt  though he strives all he can to hide it  piqued to death  just like one of us  who are pleased with the love  though we dislike the lover  he begins to think it possible she may survive his cruelty        Lady Julia is all astonishment  had no idea of such levity    the amiable ignorant    how little she knows us    the character of half the sex  Adio  I am going  with Lady Julia  to pay some morning visits in the environs     Three o Clock     Till this morning I had no notion how much Lord and Lady Belmont were beloved  or  to speak with more
