    unnumbered   THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON   IN A SERIES of LETTERS Published from the ORIGINALS  By the Editor of PAMELA and CLARISSA   In SEVEN VOLUMES   VOL  VI   LONDON  Printed by S  RICHARDSON  AND DUBLIN  Re printed  and sold by the Book sellers  M  DCC  LIII      unnumbered   THE HISTORY OF Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  Bart   LETTER I  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Mansfield house  Thursday  Sept  14    YOU will be so good  my dear friend  as to let my neighbours  particularly the gentlemen you mention  know  that the only reason I forbear paying my compliments to them  now I am so near  is  because I cannot as yet enjoy their company with that freedom and ease which I hope in a little while to do  Tell them  that I purpose  after some particular affairs are determined  which will for a little while longer engross me  to devote the greatest part of my time to my native place  and that then I will endeavour to make myself as good a neighbour  and as social a friend  as they can wish me to be   On Sunday I had a visit from the two Hartleys     2 They gave me very satisfactory proofs of what they were able to do  as well as willing  in support of the right of the Mansfields to the estate of which they have been despoiled  and shewed me a paper  which nobody thought was in being  of the utmost consequence in the cause   On Monday  by appointment  I attended Sir John Lambton  Two lawyers of the Keelings were with him  They produced their demands  I had mine ready  but theirs were so extravagant  that I would not produce them  But  taking Sir John aside  I love not  said I  to affront men of a profession  but I am convinced  that we never shall come to an understanding  if we consider ourselves as Lawyers and Clients  I am no lawyer  but I know the strength of my friends cause  and will risque half my estate upon the justice of it  The Mansfields will commission me  if the Keelings will you  and we perhaps may do something  If not  let the Law take its course  I am now come to reside in England  I will do nothing for myself  till I have done what can be done to make all my friends easy   Sir John owned  that he thought the Mansfields had hardships done them  Mr  Keeling senior  he said  had heard of the paper in the Hartley s hands  and  praising his honesty  told me in confidence  that he had declared  that if such a paper could have been produced in time  he would not have prosecuted the suit  which he had carried  But Sir John said  that the younger Keeling was a furious young man  and would oppose a compromise on the terms he supposed the Mansfields would expect to be complied with  But what are your proposals  Sir   These  Sir John  The Law is expensive  delays may be meditated  appeals may be brought  if we gain our point —What I think it may cost us to establish the right of the injured  which cannot be a small sum  that will I prevail upon the Mansfields to   3 give up to the Keelings  I will trust you  if you give me your honour  with our proofs  and if you and your friends are satisfied with them  and will consent to establish our right by the form only of a new trial  then may we be agreed  Otherwise  not  And I leave you and them to consider of it  I shall hear from you within two or three days  Sir John promised I should  but hoped to have some talk first with the Hartleys  with whom  as well as with me  he declared he would be upon honour   Wednesday Evening   I HAD a message from Sir John last night  requesting me to dine with him and the elder Mr  Keeling this day  and to bring with me the two Mr  Hartleys  and the proofs I had hinted at   Those gentlemen were so obliging  as to go with me  and took the important paper with them  which had been deposited with their grandfather  as a common friend  and contained a recognition of the Mansfields right to the estates in question  upon an amicable reference to persons long since departed  An attested copy of which was once in the Mansfields possession  as by a memorandum that came to hand  but which never could be found  The younger Keeling was not intended to be there  but he forced himself upon us  He behaved very rudely  I had once like to have forgot myself  This meeting produced nothing  But as the father is a reasonable man  as we have obtained a re hearing of the cause  as he is much influenced by Sir John Lambton  who seems convinced  and to whose honour I have submitted an abstract of our proofs
