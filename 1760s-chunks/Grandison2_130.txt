 Miss Gr  COUD be —Could be  said each   And COULD be  said the fool to Miss Grandison  when she repeated it  her heart quite sunk   Dr  B   smiling  You hinted  Ladies  that you are not sure that Miss Byron is absolutely disengaged  But  to be open and above board  I have reason to believe  that your brother would be concerned  if he knew it  that you should think of putting such a question as this to any body but himself  Why don t you  He once complained to me  that he was afraid his sisters looked upon him as a reserved man  and condescended to call upon me to put him right  if I thought his appearance such as would give you grounds for the surmise  There are two or three   325 affairs of intricacy that he engaged in  and particularly one  that hangs in suspence  and he would not be fond  I believe  of mentioning it  till he can do it with certainty  But else  Ladies  there is not a more frank hearted man in the world  than your brother   See  Lucy  how cautious we ought to be in passing judgment on the actions of others  especially on those of good men  when we want to fasten blame upon them  perhaps with a low view  envying their superior worth  to bring them down to our own level —For are we not all apt to measure the merits of others by our own standard  to give praise or dispraise to actions or sentiments  as they square with their own   Lord L  Perhaps  Doctor Bartlett  you don t think yourself at liberty to answer  whether these particular affairs are of such a nature  as will interfere with the hopes we have of bringing to effect a marriage between my brother and Miss Byron   Dr  B  I had rather refer to Sir Charles himself on this subject  If any man in the world deserves from prudence and integrity of heart to be happy in this life  that man is Sir Charles Grandison  But he is not quite happy   Ah  Lucy —The Doctor proceeded  Your brother  Ladies  has often said to me  That there was hardly a man living who had a more sincere value for the Sex than he had  who had been more distinguished by the favour of worthy women  yet who had paid dearer for that distinction than he had done   Lady L  Paid dearer  Good Heaven   Miss Gr  How could that be   Lord L  I always abroad heard the Ladies reckon upon Sir Charles  as their own man  His vivacity  his personal accomplishments  his politeness  his generosity  his bravery —Every woman who spoke of him  put him down for a man of gallantry  And is he not a truly gallant man —I never mentioned it   326 before—But a Lady Olivia  of Florence was much talked of  when I was in that city  as being in love with the handsome Englishman  as our brother was commonly called there—  Lady Olivia  Lady Olivia  repeated each sister  and why did not your Lordship —  Why  Because  tho  she was in love with him  he had no thoughts of her  And  as the Doctor says  she is but one of those who admired him where ever he set his foot   Bless me  thought I  what a black swan is a good man —Why  as I have often thought  to the credit of our Sex  will not all the men be good   Lady L  My Lord  you must tell us more of this Lady Olivia   Lord L  I know very little more of her  She was reputed to be a woman of high quality and fortune  and great spirit  I once saw her  She is a fine figure of a woman  Dr  Bartlett can  no doubt  give you an account of her   Miss Gr  Ah  Doctor  What an history could you give us of our brother  if you pleased —But as there is no likelihood that this Lady will be anything to my brother  let us return to our first subject   Lady L  By all means  Pray Dr  Bartlett  do you know what my brother s opinion is of Miss Byron   Dr  B  The highest that man can have of woman   Lady L  As we are so very desirous to see my brother happily married  and think he never could have a woman so likely to make him happy  would you advise us to propose the alliance to him  We would not to her  unless we thought there were room to hope for his approbation  and that in a very high degree   Dr  B  I am under some concern  my dear Ladies  to be thought to know more of your brother s heart  than sisters do whom he loves so dearly  and who equally love him  I beseech you  give me not so   327 much more consequence with him than you imagine you have yourselves  I shall be afraid  if you do  that the favour
