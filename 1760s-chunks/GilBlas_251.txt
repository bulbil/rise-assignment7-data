the person of Gil Blas   THE minister s growing partiality towards me was soon noticed  He displayed it ostentatiously  by committing his portfolio to my custody  which it was his habit to carry in his own hand when he went to council  This novelty causing me to be looked upon as a rising favourite  excited the envy of certain persons  so that I was preciously sprinkled with the hellish dew of court malevolence  My two neighbours the secretaries were not the last to compliment me on my budding honours  and invited me to supper at the widow s  not so much by way of returning my hospitality  as with an eye to business in the cultivation of my acquaintance  Parties were made for me everywhere  Even the haughty Don Rodrigo was cap in hand to me  He now called me nothing less than Signor de Santillane  though the moon had scarcely changed her face since he thee d and thou d me  without ever bethinking him that he was talking to something above a pauper  He heaped me up and pressed me down with civilities  especially within eyeshot of our common patron  But the fool was wiser than to be caught with chaff  The good breeding of my returns was nicely proportioned to my thorough detestation of my humble servant  a rascal who had lived in court all his life could not have played the rascal better than I did   I likewise accompanied my lord duke when he had an audience of the king  which was usually three times a day  In the morning he went into his majesty s chamber as soon as he was awake  There he dropped down on his marrow bones by the bed side  talked over what was to be done in the course of the day  and put into the royal mouth the speeches the royal tongue was to make  He then withdrew  After dinner he came back again  not for state affairs  but for what  what  and a little gossip  He was well instructed in all the tittle tattle of Madrid  which was sold to him at the earliest of the season  Lastly  in the evening he saw the king again for the third time  put whatever colour he pleased on the transactions of the day  and  as a matter of course  requested his instructions for the morrow  While he was with the king  I kept in the ante chamber  where people of the first quality  sinking that they might rise  threw themselves in the way of my observation  and thought the day not lost if I had deigned to exchange a few words of common civility with them  Was it to be wondered at  if myself importance fattened upon such food  There are many folks at court  who stalk about on stilts of much frailer materials   One day my vanity was still more highly pampered  The king  to whom the duke had puffed off my style  was curious to see a sample of it  His excellency made me bring the register of Catalonia and myself into the royal presence  telling me to read the first memorial I had digested  If so catholic a critic overpowered my modesty at first  the minister s encouragement recalled my scattered spirits  and I read with good tone and emphasis what his majesty deigned to hear with some symptoms of approbation  He spoke handsomely of my performance  and recommended my fortunes to the special care of his minister  My humility was not the greater for the augmentation of my consequence  and a particular conversation some days afterwards with the Count de Lemos swelled high the spring tide of all my ambitious anticipations   I waited on that nobleman from his uncle at the Prince of Spain s court  and presented credentials from the duke  directing him to deal unreservedly with me  as with a man who was embarked in their design and selected by himself exclusively as their go  between  The count then took me to a room  where he locked the door  and then spoke as follows  Since you are confidential with the Duke of Lerma  I doubt not you deserve to be so  and shall unbosom myself to you without hesitation  You are to know that matters go on just as we could wish  The Prince of Spain distinguishes me above the most assiduous of his courtiers  I had a private conversation with him this morning  wherein he expressed some disgust at being restrained by the king s avarice from following the inclinations of his liberal heart  and living on a scale befitting his august rank  On this head I chimed in with his regrets  and taking advantage of the opportunity  promised to carry him a thousand pistoles early to morrow morning  as an earnest of larger sums with which I have engaged to feed his necessities forthwith  He was in ecstasy at my promises  and I am certain of securing his grace and favour in tail  if I can but fulfil my engagement Acquaint my uncle with these particulars  and come back in the evening with his sentiments on the subject   I left the Count de Lemos with the last words still quivering on his lips  and went back to the Duke of Lerma  who  on my report  sent to ask Calderona for a thousand pistoles  which he charged me to carry to the count in
