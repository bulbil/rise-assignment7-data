find me upon any future occasion  she would attend her home  and continue with her till her mistress was willing to part with her   The girl upon this consented to stay  and received Mrs Gerrarde’s orders to prepare for their departure the next day   In the morning I made Pivet a present for his travelling charges  and Rachael another  telling her  according to the account I had of her behaviour  that I would be kind to her  She made me all the promises that I could desire  assuring me  that it was purely to oblige me that she staid with Mrs Gerrarde   Pivet told me  that he would send the sum which his wife had  in bills to me  to be appropriated in the manner agreed on  for he said  that having that morning mentioned to her my generosity  in relation to the bond  she had owned  that  notwithstanding her resentment to me  she had no distrust of my honour in those particulars   I took this opportunity of telling Pivet  that when he could get his wife in the humour  he might prevail on her to give an instrument  impowering my steward to receive the little income of her jointure at Ashby  which I would take care should be remitted to him  for  trifling as it was  it might be serviceable   When they were ready to set forward on’ their journey  I begged leave to speak a few words to madam Pivet by herself  She seemed not inclined to the conference  but her husband very obligingly pressing her not to part with me in enmity  and at the same time quitting the room  she was obliged to hear me     I then very frankly asked her pardon for the lengths I had gone  telling her  that I hoped time  and her own good sense  would convince her that she was more obliged to me  than her passion would then give her leave to see  Remember  madam  I have kept my word with you  You are now married to a very deserving young man  you have a competent support during your life  Happiness is in your power if you do not wilfully cast it away from you  Shew now that greatness of mind of which you have so often boasted  by forgiving the man  who has  as you think  injured you  and resolving at once on a behaviour that shall  in your turn  intitle you  not only to the forgiveness  but even to the esteem  of those whom you have injured   I would have preached on  and given her more good advice  but she cut me short  with this decisive answer  Sir  I neither desire your counsel nor your good opinion  Mr Pivet may deserve some regard from me  but you I will never forgive  and she flung from me   I called in Pivet  and telling him I was infinitely pleased at the good disposition I found his lady in  I wished him all happiness and a safe journey  and they set out directly for Dijon   And now  my dear Bidulph  stop  to praise  to admire  to wonder at my virtue  I  who have had one of the finest women in England in my possession  for so many days  and by the way was not her aversion  to yield up her  by me  unpolluted charms to the arms of another  Add to this  that it has cost me more to make one woman honest  than it need have done to have made half a dozen—otherwise  I had like to have writ a strange ugly word  that was just at the nib of my pen   If you relate my story with the laudable partiality of a friend  judiciously abolishing the context  for which you may have many precedents   and neatly splicing together the useful fragments  shall I not appear to posterity as great as Scipio himself  Ah  Sir George  if we knew the secret springs of many of those actions which dazzle us  in the histories of the renowned heroes of old  it is not impossible but the wonderous page might dwindle into as insignificant a tale as mine is   Well  I thank my good genius that has led me safely through such a labyrinth as I had got into  In getting rid of that woman  and not disgracefully neither   I feel as if I had shaken off a great load  But what a graceless baggage it is  not to thank me for my kindness  I  who have been more than a father to her  in saving her first from perdition  and then settling her well in the world—but there is no obliging some tempers     I shall leave this place to morrow  for I must hasten to Paris  to put every thing on a good footing for the new married pair  and then I will go and ramble I do not care whither  for another year  I shall lodge at Paris  where I did before  and desire you will write to me directly an account of all that passes within the circle of your family  Let your sister and my lady Bidulph know in what manner I have disposed of Mrs Gerrarde  but
