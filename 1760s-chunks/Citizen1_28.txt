and ignorant of truth  Mankind wanders  unknowing his way from morning till the evening  Where shall we turn after happiness  or is it wisest to desist from the pursuit  Like reptiles in a corner of some stupendous palace  we peep from our holes  look about us  wonder at all we see  but are ignorant of the great   86 architect s design  O for a revelation of himself  for a plan of his universal system  O for the reasons of our creation  or why we were created to be thus unhappy  If we are to experience no other felicity but what this life affords  then are we miserable indeed  If we are born only to look about us  repine and die  then has heaven been guilty of injustice  If this life terminates my existence  I despise the blessings of providence  and the wisdom of the giver  If this life be my all  let the following epitaph be written on the tomb of Altangi  By my father s crimes I received this  By my own crimes I bequeath it to posterity   LETTER XXIII  To the same   YET while I sometimes lament the cause of humanity  and the depravity of human nature  there now and then appear gleams of greatness that serve to relieve the eye oppressed with the hideous prospect  and resemble those cultivated spots that are sometimes found in the midst of an Asiatic wilderness  I see many superior excellencies among the English  which it is not in the power of all their follies to hide  I see virtues  which in other countries are known only to a few  practised here by every rank of people   I know not whether it proceeds from their superior opulence that the English are more charitable than the rest of mankind  whether by being possessed of all the conveniencies of life themselves    87 they have more leisure to perceive the uneasy situation of the distressed  whatever be the motive  they are not only the most charitable of any other nation  but most judicious in distinguishing the properest objects of compassion   In other countries the giver is generally influenced by the immediate impulse of pity  his generosity is exerted as much to relieve his own uneasy sensations  as to comfort the object in distress  in England benefactions are of a more general nature  some men of fortune and universal benevolence propose the proper objects  the wants and the merits of the petitioners are canvassed by the people  neither passion nor pity find a place in the cool discussion  and charity is then only exerted when it has received the approbation of reason   A late instance of this finely directed benevolence forces itself so strongly on my imagination  that it in a manner reconciles me to pleasure  and once more makes me the universal friend of man   The English and French have not only political reasons to induce them to mutual hatred▪ but often the more prevailing motive of private interest to widen the breach  a war between other countries is carried on collectively  army fights against army  and a man s own private resentment is lost in that of the community  but in England and France the individuals of each country plunder each other at sea without redress  and consequently feel that animosity against each other which passengers do at a robber  They have for some time carried on an expensive war  and several captives have been taken on both sides  Those made prisoners by the French have   88 been used with cruelty  and guarded with unnecessary caution  Those taken by the English  being much more numerous  were confined in the ordinary manner  and  not being released by their countrymen  began to feel all these inconveniencies which arise from want of covering and long confinement   Their countrymen were informed of their deplorable situation  but they  more intent on annoying their enemies than relieving their friends  refused the least assistance  The English now saw thousands of their fellow creatures starving in every prison  forsaken by those whose duty it was to protect them  labouring with disease  and without cloaths to keep off the severity of the season  National benevolence prevailed over national animosity  Their prisoners were indeed enemies  but they were enemies in distress  they ceased to be hateful  when they no longer continued to be formidable  forgetting therefore their national hatred  the men who were brave enough to conquer  were generous enough to forgive  and they  whom all the world seemed to have disclaimed  at last found pity and redress from those they attempted to subdue  A subscription was opened  ample charities collected  proper necessaries procured  and the poor gay sons of a merry nation were once more taught to resume their former gaiety   When I cast my eye over the list of those who contributed on this occasion  I find the names almost entirely English  scarce one foreigner appears among the number  It was for Englishmen alone to be capable of such exalted virtue  I own  I cannot look over this catalogue of good men and philosophers without thinking better of myself  because   89 it makes me entertain a more favourable opinion of mankind  I am particularly struck with one who writes these words upon the paper that enclosed his benefaction  The mite of an Englishman  a citizen of the world
