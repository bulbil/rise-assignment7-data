that the   business having been communicated to him  he approved of the match  and   his sister had consented  Mr  Munden received this information with all   the seeming transport of a man passionately in love  he made them a   thousand retributions for the part they had taken in his interest  and   they expressed no less satisfaction in the accomplishment of his   desires  After some few compliments on both sides  the elder Mr    Thoughtless informed him  that Miss Betsy was to stay the whole day with   Sir Ralph and Lady Trusty  that himself and brother had promised to   return thither in the evening  and that he should be glad if he would   accompany them  in order that when they were all together  every thing   might be settled for the completion of the nuptials       It is not to be doubted but that the lover readily embraced this   proposition  and an hour for his waiting on them being prefixed  he took   his leave  the company that was to dine with Mr  Thoughtless that   instant coming in                CHAPTER III       Will not let the reader fall asleep          I believe the reader will easily perceive  that it was owing to the   apprehensions of Miss Betsy s fluctuating disposition  that her brothers   testified so great an impatience for bringing the affair of her marriage   to a conclusion  and also  that it was to confirm her in her resolution    and reconcile her to the promise she had made  that Lady Trusty had kept   her with her that whole day       The arguments urged by that worthy lady  the obliging and chearful   manner in which they were delivered  joined to the facetious and   entertaining remarks which Sir Ralph had occasionally made  had indeed a   great effect  for the present  on the too wavering and uncertain mind   they were intended to fix       Though she was far from expecting Mr  Munden could come that evening   with her brothers  or even from imagining he could as yet be informed of   what had passed in his favour  yet she was not displeased when she saw   him enter  and if she looked a little confounded  it was rather to be   attributed to modesty than anger       That gentleman having made his first compliments to Sir Ralph and Lady   Trusty  on his being presented to them  flew directly to Miss Betsy  and   expressed his sense of the happiness her brothers had made him hope  in   terms the most passionate that words would form  She received what he   said to her  on this occasion  with a sweetness which must have   infinitely charmed a heart truly sensible of the tender passion  that   even Mr  Munden  though less delicate than he pretended  could not but   be greatly affected with it       In fine  the behaviour of both towards each other  gave great   contentment to all the friends of Miss Betsy  and her elder brother  for   form s sake  recapitulating the proposal of Mr  Munden  concerning her   settlement and jointure  Sir Ralph gave that approbation in publick   which he before had done in private  the intended bridegroom and Mr    Thoughtless agreed to go the next morning to Mr  Markland the lawyer    and give him the necessary instructions for drawing up the marriage   articles       They broke not up company till the night was pretty far advanced  and   Mr  Thoughtless not having his own coach there  a hackney set them all   down at their respective habitations       Thus far all went extremely well  the parties chiefly concerned seemed   perfectly satisfied with each other  and with themselves  for the   agreement they had mutually entered into  and there appeared not the   least likelihood of any future difficulty that would arise to interrupt    or delay the consummation of the so much desired nuptials       Miss Betsy had not as yet had time to meditate on what she had given her   promise to perform  the joy she found her compliance had given all her   friends  the endearing things they said to her upon the occasion  and   the transport Mr  Munden had expressed  on seeing himself so near the   end of all his wishes  had kept up her spirits  and she imagined  while   in their presence  that her inclination had dictated the consent her   lips had uttered       But when she was alone  shut up in her own apartments  when she no   longer received the kind caresses of her smiling friends  nor the   flattering raptures of her future husband  all the
