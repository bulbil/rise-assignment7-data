in it  or even was acquainted with either   of the parties he mentioned       Miss Betsy said nothing  but had her own reflections on what he had   been saying  she  however  had the satisfaction of hearing her two   brothers ask those questions she longed to put to him herself  By the   answers he made  she doubted not but the deceased had been courted by   Mr  Trueworth  had loved him  and was to have been married to him  by   her having made him so considerably a legacy       The rest of their conversation that whole day was chiefly on matters   concerning the late Mr  Goodman  the baseness of Lady Mellasin  and the   measures that were taken to detect the fraud she had been guilty of  all   which was very dry and insipid to Miss Betsy at this time  as  indeed    it would have been had it turned on any other subject  She was not    therefore  very sorry when the company broke up  that she might be at   home  and at full liberty to indulge meditations which promised her more   satisfaction than any thing she could hear abroad       She had set it down in her mind  from what the lawyer had said  as a   sure fact  that Mr  Trueworth  since his desisting his courtship to her    had loved another  and also  that her rival in his affection was now no   more   He need not   said she to herself   be at the trouble of sitting   a second time for his picture in compliment to her  nor can what I have   done be a subject of disquiet to either of them        She then would take his picture out of the cabinet  where she had   concealed it  and examine it attentively   Good God   cried she   how   uncertain is the heart of man  How little dependence ought we to place   on all the professions of love they make us  Just so he looked  with all   this tenderness in his eyes  when his false tongue protested he never   could think of marrying any woman but myself   But these uneasy  and    indeed  unjust reflections  lasted not above a minute   Mrs    Blanchfield   said she   had a large fortune  it was that  perhaps  he   was in love with  and finding no hope of gaining me  he might be   tempted  by his ambition  to make his addresses to her  but whatever   were his thoughts on her account  she is now dead  and who knows what   may happen  That he once loved me is certain  if he should return to his   first vows  the obligation I have received from him would not permit me   to treat him with the same indifference I have done  I am not in love   with any man   continued she   but if ever I marry  he certainly    exclusive of what he has done for me  deserves  in every respect  to   have the preference  and I should  with less regret  submit to the yoke   of wedlock with him than any other I have seen        Thus she went on  forming ideal prospects all that night  and part of   the ensuing day  when the elder Mr  Thoughtless came in  and gave her   the most unwelcome interruption she could receive       He told her that he had just received an account  to his entire   satisfaction  in every thing relating to Mr  Munden  and that no   reasonable objection could be made  either as to the family  the estate    or the character of that gentleman   Therefore   said he   as you have   thought fit to encourage his pretensions  and he has continued them a   sufficient length of time to defend you from the censure of a too quick   consent  you cannot  I think  in honour  but reward his passion without   delay        Miss Betsy was  at present  in a disposition very unfit to comply with   her brother s advice  but  after all that had been urged by him  and by   Mr  Francis  she could not assume courage wholly to refuse       She hesitated  she began a sentence without ending it  and when she did    her answers were not all of a piece with that ready wit which she had   always testified on other occasions       Mr  Thoughtless  perceiving she was rather studious to evade giving any   determinate answer  than willing to give such a one as he desired she   should  began to expostulate with her on the capriciousness
