 she reclined her head gently on the pillow  and turning on her right side  she died with all the calmness of a composed mind without even uttering a groan  in the twentyseventh year of her age   Her father and sister had not the mournful satisfaction of embracing her before she expired  When her death was announced  he seized his remaining child by the hand  and pointing to her sister s emaciated body  pathetically exclaimed    Look there   and immediately sunk down into a swoon  from which he was with great difficulty recovered     167Thus lived  thus died  the beautiful  the kind  the sensible  the frail NANNY ELLIOT   Mr  M—y was desired by all who were present to take the charge of her funer•l on himself  which  however  he reluctantly complied with  and she was  by her own desire  buried in a private manner  in order to avoid the confusion of a crowd  who would all flock to see so noted a person interred  There was a funeral sermon preached at her burial  and the few friends  together with her domestics who attended her to the church yard  shed abundance of tears  testifying the most intense sorrow at her decease   The following is a genuine copy of a letter  written by our heroine  two days before her death  and delivered by her particular desire  after her interment  as directed   168  To A—M—y  Esq  DEAR SIR   I have too great a regard for your and my own peace of mind  to see you in my present situation  as such an interview must be equally distresting  I cannot leave the world  however  without thanking you for the many favours I have from time to time received from you  as well as through your means  They are too many to be mentioned at present  I must  however  particularize two  which breathe an air of generosity  that  I think  must exalt your character in the estimation of the worthy  as much as it did you in mine  who was the immediate gainer  the first was your literary present  which  tho  I was a sufferer by it  manifested your good intentions to serve me  and the other  your introducing me to the notice of a personage  by whom I might have made  had my days been lengthened  a genteel independence     169I have left you my executor in my will  and a small present  tho  I hope the remembrance of me need not be supported by any other assistance than our past connexions   Adieu for ever  A  E   This letter Mr  M—y preserves as the dearst pledge he ever had of the love Miss ELLIOT had for him  He refused the executorship of her will  and it devolved on one of her nearest relations  who acquitted himself with the greatest honour and integrity  The bulk of her fortune  amounting to near ten thousand pounds  she bequeathed to her indigent relations   I cannot take leave of my readers without making some few moral reflections on the miserable condition of those unhappy women  whose circumstances oblige them to owe their subsistence to prostitution  They may be considered in two classes  The first are those  who  lost to every   170 sense or virtue  are engaged in this detestable way of life by choice  others are under the cruel necessity of submitting to all the evils which attend the life of prostitutes  because they are abandoned by their parents  relations  friends  and acquaintance  for having too easily listened to the delusive persuasions of the deceiver  man  which generally terminate in the destruction of those unhappy girls  who are too easily persuaded to their own ruin  How many are there now in our streets  who once knew the happiness of treading the paths of virtue  but who are now immerged in the gulph of wickedness  deserred by all who knew them  for one false step  which perhaps was more owing to the influence which some villain had over their innocent and inexperienced minds  than to a natural inclination for vice  Many of these would with joy embrace any opportunity which offers of getting bread in some other shape  rather than continue any longer in their present misery  The wisdom of our legislature has taken this into consideration  and a proper place has been provided for the reception of such as were found willing to reform their abandoned   171 lives  and we see the salutary efeffects of this institution  by the rapid progress already made in the reclaiming of a great many  Oh man  how canst thou with such glaring impudence look up to heaven  the seat of the Almighty  after having so shamefully effected the ruin of the fairest part of the creation  by robbing  them of the most inestimable treasure they possessed  their virtue  and thereby subjected them to a life of disorder and misery  which must inevitably terminate in despair  How deplorable is the situation of those who have been hurried on to their own ruin in this world  and eternal perdition in the next  I could wish that a law were enacted  obliging every man who thus seduces a virtuous girl  either to marry the object of
