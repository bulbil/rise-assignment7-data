tall  thin   genteel young French nobleman  an officer in the army  who  chancing  to come in  asked with great politeness  what I would please to have  I  then repeated my desire  and produced my passports  by which he learned  who I was  He immediately gave orders that my coach should pass  and  afterwards visited me at Paris  having obtained my permission  and  taken my address at parting  while the others  understanding my name and  quality  asked pardon for their impolite carriage  which they told  me was owing to the representation of the soldier  who gave them to  understand that I was a strolling actress    I could not help laughing heartily at this mistake  which might have  proceeded from the circumstances of my appearance  my footman having  been obliged to change hats with the peasant  and myself being without  buckles on my shoes and buttons on my riding skirt  while my countenance  still retained marks of the fear and confusion I had undergone  After  all  perhaps the fellow was a droll  and wanted to entertain himself at  my expense  The day was so far consumed in these adventures  that I was  obliged to take up my lodgings at Mechlin  where I addressed myself to  the intendant  giving him an account of the disaster I had met with  and  desiring I might have credit at the inn  as our whole company could not  raise the value of a sixpence  This gentleman  though a provincial  was  polite in his way  and not only granted my request  but invited me to  lodge at his own house  I accordingly gave him my company at supper  but  did not choose to sleep at his quarters  because he appeared to be what  the French call un vieux debauche    Next day  he sent a trumpet to the general  with a detail of my  misfortune  in hopes of retrieving what I had lost  but  notwithstanding  all possible search  I was fain to put up with my damage  which  in  linen  laces  clothes  and baubles  amounted to upwards of seven hundred  pounds  a loss which never deprived me of one moment s rest  for  though  I lodged at a miserable inn  and lay in a paltry bed  I slept as sound  as if nothing extraordinary had happened  after I had written to London  and Paris  directing that the payment of my bills of credit might    6 22 15  3 45 PM   be stopped  Indeed  I know of but two misfortunes in life capable of  depressing my spirits  namely  the loss of health and friends  all  others may be prevented or endured  The articles of that calamity which  I chiefly regretted  were a picture of Lord W    and some inimitable  letters from Mr  B      From Mechlin I proceeded to Brussels  where  being known  I got credit  for some necessaries  and borrowed twenty guineas to defray the expense  of my journey to Paris  Having consulted with my friends about the  safest method of travelling through Flanders  I was persuaded to take  places in the public voiture  and accordingly departed  not without  fears of finding one part of the country as much infested with robbers  as another  Nor were these apprehensions assuaged by the conversation  of my fellow travellers  who  being of the lower sort of people  that  delight in exaggerating dangers  entertained me all the way with an  account of all the robberies and murders which had been committed on  that road  with many additional circumstances of their own invention   After having been two days exposed to this comfortable conversation   among very disagreeable company  which is certainly one of the most  disagreeable situations in life  I arrived at Lisle  where  thinking the  dangerous part of the journey was now past  I hired a post chaise  and  in two days more reached Paris without any further molestation    Upon my arrival in the capital  I was immediately visited by my old  acquaintances  who  hearing my disaster  offered me their clothes  and  insisted upon my wearing them  until I could be otherwise provided  They  likewise engaged me in parties  with a view of amusing my imagination   that I might not grow melancholy in reflecting upon my loss  and desired  me to repeat the particulars of my story forty times over  expressing  great surprise at our not being murdered  or ravished at least  As for  this last species of outrage  the fear of it never once entered my head   otherwise I should have been more shocked and alarmed than I really  was  But it seems this was the chief circumstance of my companion s  apprehension  and I cannot help observing  that a homely woman is always  more apt to entertain those fears  than one whose person exposes her to  much more imminent danger  However  I now learned  that the risk I  ran was much greater than I imagined it to
