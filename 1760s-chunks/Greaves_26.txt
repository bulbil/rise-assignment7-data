was the case with that very individual person who now serves him as squire  He was so frightened that he could not rise  but lay roaring in such a manner that the knight came up and gave him a thwack with his lance across the shoulders  which roused him with a vengeance  For my own part I freely own I was not unmoved at seeing such a figure come stalking out of a church in the grey of the morning  for it recalled to my remembrance the idea of the ghost in Hamlet  which I had seen acted in Drury Lane  when I made my first trip to London  and I had not yet got rid of the impression    Sir Launcelot  attended by the other knight  proceeded to the stable  from whence  with his own hands  he drew forth one of his best horses  a fine mettlesome sorrel  who had got blood in him  ornamented with rich trappings  In a trice  the two knights  and the other two strangers  who now appeared to be trumpeters  were mounted  Sir Launcelot s armour was lacquered black  and on his shield was represented the moon in her first quarter  with the motto  Impleat orbem  The trumpets having sounded a charge  the stranger pronounced with a loud voice   God preserve this gallant knight in all his honourable achievements  and may he long continue to press the sides of his now adopted steed  which I denominate Bronzomarte  hoping that he will rival in swiftness and spirit  Bayardo  Brigliadoro  or any other steed of past or present chivalry   After another flourish of the trumpets  all four clapped spurs to their horses  Sir Launcelot couching his lance  and galloped to and fro  as if they had been mad  to the terror and astonishment of all the spectators    What should have induced our knight to choose this here man for his squire  is not easy to determine  for  of all the servants about the house  he was the least likely either to please his master  or engage in such an undertaking  His name is Timothy Crabshaw  and he acted in the capacity of whipper in to Sir Everhard  He afterwards married the daughter of a poor cottager  by whom he has several children  and was employed about the house as a ploughman and carter  To be sure  the fellow has a dry sort of humour about him  but he was universally hated among the servants  for his abusive tongue and perverse disposition  which often brought him into trouble  for  though the fellow is as strong as an elephant  he has no more courage naturally than a chicken  I say naturally  because  since his being a member of knight errantry  he has done some things that appear altogether incredible and preternatural    Timothy kept such a bawling  after he had received the blow from Sir Launcelot  that everybody on the field thought that some of his bones were broken  and his wife  with five bantlings  came snivelling to the knight  who ordered her to send the husband directly to his house  Tim accordingly went thither  groaning piteously all the way  creeping along  with his body bent like a Greenland canoe  As soon as he entered the court  the outward door was shut  and Sir Launcelot coming downstairs with a horsewhip in his hand  asked what was the matter with him that he complained so dismally  To this question he replied  that it was as common as duck weed in his country for a man to complain when his bones were broke   What should have broke your bones   said the knight   I cannot guess   answered the other   unless it was that delicate switch that your honour in your mad pranks handled so dexterously upon my carcass   Sir Launcelot then told him  there was nothing so good for a bruise  as a sweat  and he had the remedy in his hand  Timothy  eyeing the horsewhip askance  observed that there was another still more speedy  to wit  a moderate pill of lead  with a sufficient dose of gunpowder   No  rascal   cried the knight   that must be reserved for your betters   So saying  he employed the instrument so effectually  that Crabshaw soon forgot his fractured ribs  and capered about with great agility    When he had been disciplined in this manner to some purpose  the knight told him he might retire  but ordered him to return next morning  when he should have a repetition of the medicine  provided he did not find himself capable of walking in an erect posture    The gate was no sooner thrown open  than Timothy ran home with all the speed of a greyhound  and corrected his wife  by whose advice he had pretended to be so grievously damaged in his person    Nobody dreamed that he would next day present himself at Greavesbury Hall  nevertheless  he was there very early in the morning  and even closeted a whole hour altogether with Sir Launcelot  He came out  making wry faces  and several times slapped himself on the forehead  crying   Bodikins  thof he be crazy  I an t  that I an t
