notice of me  and yet in such a way  as to have me think  that the approbation of so excellent a judge as himself  did me no small honour   Mr  Barnet is a young man  that I imagine will be always young  At first I thought him only a fop  He affected to say some things  that  tho  trite  were sententious  and carried with them the air of observation  There is some degree of merit in having such a memory  as will help a person to repeat and apply other mens wit with some tolerable propriety  But when he attempted to walk alone  he said things that it was impossible a man of common sense could say  I pronounce therefore boldly about him  Yet by his outward appearance he may pass for one of your pretty fellows  for he dresses very gaily  Indeed if he has any taste  it is in dress  and this he has found out  for he talked of little else  when he led the talk  and boasted of several parts of his  What finished him with me  was  that as often as the conversation seemed to take a serious turn  he arose from his seat  and hummed an Italian air  of which  however  he knew nothing  But the sound of his own voice seemed to please him   This fine gentleman recollected some high flown compliments  and  applying them to me  looked as if he expected I should value myself upon them   No wonder that men in general think meanly of   21 us women  if they believe we have ears to hear  and folly to be pleased with  the frothy things that pass under the name of compliments from such randomshooters as these   Miss Stevens paid us a visit this afternoon  She is daughter of Colonel Stevens  a very worthy man  She appears sensible and unaffected  has read  my cousin says  a good deal  and yet takes no pride in shewing it   Miss Darlington came with her  They are related   This young Lady has  I find  a pretty taste in poetry  Mrs  Reeves prevailed on her to shew us three of her performances  And now  as it was with some reluctance that she shewed them  is it fair to say any thing about them  I say it only to you  my friend —One was  on the parting of two Lovers  very sensible  and so tender  that it shewed the fair writer knew how to describe the pangs that may be innocently allowed to arise on such an occasion —One on the Morning dawn  and Sun rise  a subject that gave credit to herself  for she is  it seems  a very early riser  I petitioned for a copy of this  for the sake of two or three of my dear cousins  as well as to confirm my own practice  but I was modestly refused —The third was on the death of a favourite Linnet  a little too pathetic for the occasion  since were Miss Darlington to have lost her best and dearest friend  I imagine that she had in this piece  which is pretty long  exhausted the subject  and must borrow from it some of the images which she introduces to heighten her distress for the loss of the little songster  It is a very difficult matter  I believe  for young persons of genius to rein in their imaginations  A great flow of spirits  and great store of images crouding in upon them  carry them too frequently above their subject  and they are apt rather to say all that may be said on their favourite topics  than what is proper to be said  But it is a pretty piece  however     22  Thursday Morning   Lady Betty Williams supped with us the same evening  She is an agreeable woman  the widow of a very worthy man  a near relation of Mr  Reeves  She has a great and just regard for my cousin  and consults him in all affairs of importance  She seems to be turned of Forty  has a son and a daughter  but they are both abroad for education   It hurt me to hear her declare  that she cared not for the trouble of education  and that she had this pleasure  which girls brought up at home seldom give their mothers  that she and Miss Williams always saw each other  and always parted  as Lovers   Surely there must be some fault either in the temper of the mother  or in the behaviour of the daughter  and if so  I doubt it will not be amended by seeing each other but seldom  Do not Lovers thus cheat and impose upon one another   The young gentleman is about Seventeen  his sister about Fifteen  And  as I understand  she is a very lively  and   tis feared  a forward girl  shall we wonder  if in a few years time she should make such a choice for her husband as Lady Betty would least of all choose for a son in law  What influence can a mother expect to have over a daughter from whom she so voluntarily estranges herself  and from whose example the daughter can receive only hearsay benefits
