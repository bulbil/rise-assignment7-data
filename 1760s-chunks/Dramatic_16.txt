are vain  the labourers of genius  and the lollers in a coach and six  are no more analogous  than politics and plain dealing     Honestly and bona side I speak  if they do call me names  I can t help it  but ‚Öù of all the rich people in England  were it not for their money  would have no more sense  no more wit  no more taste  no more generosity  no more humanity  no more learning  no more affability  nor more of any more  mores  than we have  who are obliged to mind our books  to make the pot boil     Yet writers  who pretend to satyrise rich folks  are to blame  nor should any pen and ink dealers call the expectants and dependants of wealthy men  who are known by the name of toad eaters  to an account for their behaviour     To be sure  the members of the toad eating club will give his honour vast applause  if his honour says but any thing bordering upon common sense  and they will also lift up their hands and eyes  with theatrical astonishment  if her ladyship should make an observation pertinent to the subject  and extol the vastness of their patron s capacities  Now I cannot see any flattery in all this  for it is wonderful  considering rich peoples education  The ductility of their tutors  the venality of their menials  and the libertinisms they are indulged in  how they can ever say  think  or do any thing  to the purpose     Heirs to great fortunes are born as well minded  very often  as the poorest tenant s child under them  but the understanding of the eldest  Page  45  hope of great families  is either totally neglected  or else cultivated in an improper manner     The reason why men of genius are so seldom rewarded by men of fortune  is  because men of fortune don t understand genius  therefore rich people are more proper objects for pity than satire  It is the want of having their minds justly improved by arts and sciences  which makes them such strangers  to the happiness of knowing what to do with their time     To be a man of fashion  they think  is the excellence of perfection  or they would not lavish such vast sums for the encouragement of grooms  gamblers  prostitutes and rare shows  when so many works of public utility become abortive  and so many artists pine away for want of the hand of bounty  to bring them to life  for the service of their country     Is it not a shame  that in so noble a nation as England  renowned throughout the world for arts and arms  the major part of those  who should set a better example  only exhaust themselves and their fortunes  in an eternal round of visits  cards  auctions  foreign fidlers  and ballad singers     As to ballad singers and ballad makers  the difference is trifling in regard of their merit  but the reward is not proportionable  This Stevens  to my knowledge  has wrote upwards of 200 songs  yet never was so well paid for any  nay  for all the rest  as for that one he made the Corporal     Page  46    The POET S BILL   Received as earnest for making a love song upon Madam Chloe  to consist of four verses 0 0 6  Paid the remainder of my demand as soon as I had finished my work 0 0 6  Received overplus  or by way of premium 0 0 3  Sum total for Poetry 0 1 3  All the rest of this man s songs  I am certain  the weight of paper excepted  would not now sell for so much money     For the entertainment of the curious  we insert the verses that Mr  Knott bespoke  printed from the author s original copy     And as this song comprehends all that has been  or can be comprehended  in the composition of love song writing  according to the method at present of the public garden poets  the Editor presumes  this may serve as a pattern  or measure  for all future amorous stanza makers  to cut out their works by  who intend to write for the amusements of the summer parties  that swarm from Ranelagh Rotunda  to the New Tunbridge     Page  47  A New SONG     Call d CHLOE LLWHYDDWHUYDD  An lambic  Sapphic and Lyric     by G  A  Stevens   Embellished with Notes  by H  Howard  Esq Author and Etcher in Ordinary   STROPHE I     DOWN the Parnassian heights I soar   Upon Pegasus  back my fancy I bore   Bright Phoebus  with Apollo here  attend   Be all ye Muses nine the poet s friend   A Poet  as I ll show ye   From France to Philadelphia s climes   No haberdasherer of rhimes   Can boast a Toast like Chloe   Notes on the first Verse   Soar and Bore
