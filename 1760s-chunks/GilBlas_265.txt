is stripping them of all their beauty and excellence  In the magic lanthorn of plenty  pleasure  and preferment  they appear with all their brightest gloss  Figure to yourself the heir to the monarchy at the happy Catalina s feet  fancy him all rapture and lavish bounty  nor doubt but that from her shall spring a hero  who shall immortalize his mother s name  by enrolling his own in the unperishable records of eternal fame   Though the aunt desired no better sport than to take me at my word  she affected not to know what she had best do  and Catalina  who longed to have a grapple with the Prince of Spain  affected not to care about the matter  which made it necessary for me to press the siege closer  till at length Signora Mencia  finding me chop fallen and ready to withdraw my forces  sounded a parley  and agreed to a convention  containing the two following articles  Imprimis  if the Prince of Spain  on the fame of Catalina s charms  should take fire  and determine to pay her a nightly visit  it should be my care to let the ladies know when they might expect him  Secondo  that the prince should be introduced to the said ladies as a private gentleman  accompanied only by himself and his principal purveyor   After this capitulation  the aunt and niece were upon the best terms possible with me  they behaved as if we had known one another from our cradles  on the strength of which I ventured on some little familiarities  which were not taken at all unkindly  and when we parted  they embraced me of their own accord  and slabbered me over with inexpressible fondness  It is marvellous to think with what facility a tender connection is formed between persons in the same line of trade  but of opposite sexes  It might have been suspected by an eye witness of my departure  in all the plenitude of warm and repeated salutation  that my visit had been more successful than it was   The Count de Lemos was highly delighted when I announced the long expected discovery  I spoke of Catalina in terms which made him long to see her  The following night I took him to her house  and he owned that I had beat the bush to some purpose  He told the ladies  he had no doubt but the Prince of Spain would be fully satisfied with my choice of a mistress  who  on her part  would have reason to be well pleased with such a lover  that the young prince was generous  good tempered  and amiable  in short  he promised in a few days to bring him in the mode they enjoined  without retinue or publicity  That nobleman then took leave of them  and I withdrew with him  We got into his carriage  in which we had both driven thither  and which was waiting at the end of the street  He set me down at my own door  with a special charge to inform his uncle next day of the new game started  not forgetting to impress strongly how conducive a good bag of pistoles would be to the successful accomplishment of the adventure   I did not fail on the following morning to go and give the Duke of Lerma an exact account of all that had passed  There was but one thing kept back  I did not mention Scipio s name  but took credit to myself for the discovery of Catalina  One makes a merit of any dirty work in the service of the great   Abundant were the compliments paid me on this occasion  My good friend Gil Blas  said the minister with a bantering air  I am delighted that with all your talents you have that besides of discovering kind hearted beauties  whenever I have occasion for such an article  you will have the goodness to supply me  My lord  answered I with mock gravity like his own  you are very obliging to give me the preference  but it may not he unseasonable to observe that there would be an indelicacy in my administering to your excellency s pleasures of this description  Signor Don Rodrigo has been so long in possession of that post about your person  that it would be manifest injustice to rob him of it  The duke smiled at my answer  and then changing the subject  asked whether his nephew did not want money for this new speculation  Excuse my negligence  said I  he will thank you to send him a thousand pistoles  Well and good  replied the minister  you will furnish him accordingly  with my strict injunction not to be niggardly  but to encourage the prince in whatever pleasurable expenses his heart may prompt him to indulge       CH  XI     The Prince of Spain s secret visit  and presents to Catalina   I WENT to the Count de Lemos on the spur of the occasion  with five hundred double pistoles in my hand  You could not have come at a better time  said that nobleman  I have been talking with the prince  he has taken the bait  and burns with impatience to see Catalina  This very night he intends to slip privately out of the palace  and pay her a visit  it is a measure determined on
