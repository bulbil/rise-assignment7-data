her Brother and her Husband  for affronting his Lordship  but  that my Lord was her intimate Acquaintance   Just as Madam Illicit came to Goo y Wen s Door  where Junior was earnestly attending to the fair Unfortunate s Narration  she met Mr  Seap  one of the Parish Officers  who was coming to pay the strange Lady a Visit  but not out of an idle  unwarrantable  or impertinent Curiosity  no  Junior s Liberality had been mentioned all over the Town  and  according to ancient gossipping Custom  was encreased by arithmetical Progression —Therefore Mr  Seap  having the Good of his Parish at Heart  came to wait upon the Gentleman  to know concerning   92the Woman and the Child  not that he imagined they would increase the Town s Poor rates  but Accidents that might happen  ought to be provided against  besides  as the Gentleman was known to be so generous a Gentleman  it was doing his Duty to try  at least  if by threatening the Wench about Security  he could not get Junior to make him a Present for the Benefit of the Parish   Seneca observes  doing Duty is duplex   There is a Duty we owe our Neighbours  and a Duty we owe ourselves   Now  to attempt one of these Duties  Mr  Seap came invested with an Authority to punish or protect  as Justice should find it right  necessary  equitable and best  For Justice—but here I must beg Leave to observe  that the Symbols of Justice and Janus are quite wrong  and that they should be shifted   For  as every School boy knows  the Temple of Janus was relative to War and Peace  Janus should certainly be blind folded  to shew  that War is sometimes but a Game of Blindman s buff  and in Peace making  we should take Care not to be hood wink d   Justice should wear two Faces  one to smile at her Friends  with the other to frown upon her Enemies     93The Utility  Erudition  and Occasion of this Digression  will be a sufficient Atonement for its Introduction   As the Superintendant of the Workhouse was going to lift up the Latch  the Lawyer s Lady seized him by the Cuff of his Coat  and in a very hasty Sort of a Tone  demanded to know what he wanted in that House   Seap   I come  Madam  to look after some Parish Business   Madam   Then I insist upon knowing what that Parish Business is  for I and my Husband should know  because I and my Husband do most of the Parish Business   Seap   But  Madam  this is concerning a Woman and a Child  and you can have no Business   Madam   How  Sirrah  do you think me past Child bearing  You Rascal—I no Business with Children—Junior was that Instant opening the Door  to know what was the Matter  when  at the very Moment  backwards Mr  Seap fell into the House  driven down by a violent Blow on the Nose  given him by Madam Illicit   94for his Imporence  as she said  to contradict her in so vulgar a Manner   Like a Corpse  ready for the Coroner s Inquest  Mr  Seap lay all at his Length  on his Back  cross the Brick floor  which his Head had hit hard against  But Madam Illicit  regardless of his Fate  straddled athwart him unconcerned  and addressed herself to Junior and the Lady  with   I beg your Honour s Pardon  my Lord  and her Ladyship s Honour s Pardon  but this Fellor was a coming to insult your Honour s  and your Ladyship s Honour s Child—She was going on  impatient to express herself  curtsying at every other Word  to shew her Breeding  when poor Seap  in one of her Sinkings  seized her by the Gown tail  and cut short her Compliments  by pulling her bump upon his Breast   He lay breathless for some Time with the Blow  and she sat speechless for some Time upon him  staring wildly  confounded at her Disgrace  but Junior  who new enough of her Temper  to judge what must become of the Victim underneath her  lifted her up  and led her to her Ladyship  then assisted the Parish Officer  and by the friendly Interposition of the strange Lady  my   95Lord s Authority  Mr  Seap s Submission  and three or four Glasses of genuine Coniac  Madam Illicit returned Home in good Humour  and Mr  Seap with her  leaving the Lady at Leisure to go on with her Adventures   The Story of the Lady continued   I fear  Sir  my Tale is already grown tiresome  the Remainder of it  I doubt  you will think more so  since I shall be obliged to mention several Facts  wherein the Vanity and Ingratitude of Mankind are conspicuous —From what already I had known of your Sex  you must not suppose they could be much in my Esteem  and what afterwards happened to me  corroborated the Contempt I entertained for them  and was  as I then thought  a sufficient Excuse for the Manner in which afterwards
