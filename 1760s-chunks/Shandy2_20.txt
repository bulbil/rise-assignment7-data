wicked and abandoned a wretch as you represent him —if he robs —if he stabs —will not conscience  on every such act  receive a wound itself  Aye —but the man has carried it to confession —the wound digests there  and will do well enough  and in a short time be quite healed up by absolution  O Popery  what hast thou to answer for —when  not content with the too many natural and fatal ways  thro  which the heart of man is    every day thus treacherous to itself above all things —thou hast wilfully set open this wide gate of deceit before the face of this unwary traveller  too apt  God knows  to go astray of himself  and confidently speak peace to himself  when there is no peace    Of this the common instances which I have drawn out of life  are too notorious to require much evidence  If any man doubts the reality of them  or thinks it impossible for a man to be such a bubble to himself —I must refer him a moment to his own reflections  and will then venture to trust my appeal with his own heart    Let him consider in how different a degree of detestation  numbers of wicked actions stand there  tho  equally    bad and vicious in their own natures —he will soon find that such of them  as strong inclination and custom have prompted him to commit  are generally dress d out and painted with all the false beauties  which a soft and a flattering hand can give them —and that the others  to which he feels no propensity  appear  at once  naked and deformed  surrounded with all the true circumstances of folly and dishonour    When David surprized Saul sleeping in the cave  and cut off the skirt of his robe —we read his heart smote him for what he had done —But in the matter of Uriah  where a faithful and gallant servant  whom he ought to have loved and honoured  fell to make way for his lust —where conscience    had so much greater reason to take the alarm  his heart smote him not  A whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that crime  to the time Nathan was sent to reprove him  and we read not once of the least sorrow or compunction of heart which he testified  during all that time  for what he had done    Thus conscience  this once able monitor —placed on high as a judge within us  and intended by our maker as a just and equitable one too —by an unhappy train of causes and impediments  takes often such imperfect cognizance of what passes —does its office so negligently —sometimes so corruptly —that it is not to be trusted alone  and therefore we find there is a necessity  an absolute necessity of    joining another principle with it to aid  if not govern  its determinations    So that if you would form a just judgment of what is of infinite importance to you not to be misled in —namely  in what degree of real merit you stand either as an honest man  an useful citizen  a faithful subject to your king  or a good servant to your God —call in religion and morality —Look —What is written in the law of God —How readest thou —Consult calm reason and the unchangeable obligations of justice and truth —what say they    Let CONSCIENCE determine the matter upon these reports —and then if they heart condemns thee not  which is the case the Apostle supposes —the    rule will be infallible    Here Dr  Slop fell asleep   thou wilt have confidence towards God —that is  have just grounds to believe the judgment thou hast past upon thyself  is the judgment of God  and nothing else but an anticipation of that righteous sentence which will be pronounced upon thee hereafter by that Being  to whom thou art finally to give an account of thy actions    Blessed is the man  indeed then  as the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus expresses it  who is not prick d with the multitude of his sins  Blessed is the man whose heart hath not condemn d him  whether he be rich  or whether he be poor  if he have a good heart  a heart thus guided and informed  he shall at all times rejoice in a chearful countenance  his mind shall tell him more than    seven watch men that sit above upon a tower on high  — A tower has no strength  quoth my uncle Toby  unless  tis flank d    In the darkest doubts it shall conduct him safer than a thousand casuists  and give the state he lives in a better security for his behaviour than all the clauses and restrictions put together  which lawmakers are forced to multiply —Forced  I say  as things stand  human laws not being a matter of original choice  but of pure necessity  brought in to fence against the mischievous effects of those consciences which are no law unto themselves  well intending  by the many provisions made —that in all such corrupt and misguided cases  where principles and the checks of conscience will not make us upright —to    supply their force  and  by the terrors of goals
