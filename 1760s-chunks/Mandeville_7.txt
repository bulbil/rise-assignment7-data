for so valuable a present  and intreated her to pity a friendship too tender for my peace  but as respectful and as pure as she herself could wish it      The Abbate Camilli here joined us  and once more saved me a scene too interesting for the present situation of my heart  The Count entered the room soon after  and our conversation turned on the other cities of Italy  which I intended visiting  to most of which he gave me letters of recommendation to the noblest families  wrote in terms so polite and affectionate as stabbed me to the heart with a sense of my own ingratitude  He did me the honor to accept my picture  which I had not the courage to offer the Countess  After protracting till morning a parting so exquisitely painful  I tore myself from all I loved  and  bathing with tears her hand which I pressed eagerly to my lips  threw myself into my          1 34       chaise  and  without going to bed  took the road to Naples  But how difficult was this conquest  How often was I tempted to return to Rome  and throw myself at the Countess s feet  without considering the consequences of so wild an action  You  my dearest Mordaunt  whose discerning spirit knows all the windings  the strange inconsistences  of the human heart  will pity rather than blame your friend  when he owns there were moments in which he formed the infamous resolution of carrying her off by force      But when the mist of passion a little dispersed  I began to entertain more worthy sentiments  I determined to drive this lovely woman from my heart  and conquer an inclination  which the Count s generous unsuspecting friendship would have made criminal even in the eyes of the most abandoned libertine  rather owing this resolution however to an absolute despair of success          1 35       than either to reason or a sense of honor  my cure was a work of time  I was so weak  during some months  as to confine my visits to the families where the Count s letters introduced me  that I might indulge my passion by hearing the lovely Countess continually mentioned      Convinced at length of the folly of thus feeding so hopeless a flame  I resolved to avoid every place where I had a chance of hearing that adored name  I left Italy for France  where I hoped a life of dissipation would drive her for ever from my remembrance  I even profaned my passion for her  by meeting the advances of a Coquette  but disgust succeeded my conquest  and I found it was from time alone I must hope a cure  I had been near a year at Paris  when  in April last  I received a letter from my father  who pressed my return  and appointed me to meet him immediately at the Hague  from whence we returned together  and          1 36       after a few days stay in London  came down to Belmont  where the charms of Lady Julia s conversation  and the esteem she honors me with  entirely compleated my cure  which time  absence  and the Count s tender and affectionate letters  had very far advanced  There is a sweetness in her friendship  my dear Mordaunt  to which love itself must yield the palm  the delicacy  yet vivacity of her sentiments  the soft sensibility of her heart  which without fear listens to vows of eternal amity and esteem    O Mordaunt  I must not  I do not hope for  I do not indeed wish for  her love  but can it be possible there is a man on earth to whom heaven destines such a blessing   H  Mandeville           1 37         To Col  Bellville   Tuesday  Belmont      OH  you have no notion what a reformation  Who but Lady Anne Wilmot at chapel every Sunday  grave  devout  attentive  scarce stealing a look at the prettiest fellow in the world  who sits close by me  Yes  you are undone  Bellville  Harry Mandeville  the young  the gay  the lovely Harry Mandeville  in the full bloom of conquering three and twenty  with all the fire and sprightliness of youth  the exquisite symmetry and easy grace of an Antinous  a countenance open  manly  animated  his hair the brightest chesnut  his complexion brown  flushed with the rose of health  his eyes dark  penetrating  and full of fire  but when he addresses our sex softened into a sweetness which is almost irresistible  his nose inclining to the aquiline  his lips full and red  and his teeth of the most pearly whiteness            1 38         There  read and die with envy     You with envy  I with love       Fond of me too  but
