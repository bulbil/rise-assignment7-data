Let me be kept in countenance as I might  by scores of still more ridiculous figures  what  thought I  are other people s follies to me  Am I to make an appearance that shall want the countenance of the vainest  if not the silliest part of the creation  What would my good grandfather have thought  could he have seen his Harriet  the girl whose mind he took pains to form and enlarge  mingling in a habit so preposterously rich and gaudy  with a croud of Satyrs  Harlequins  Scaramouches  Fauns  and Dryads  nay  of Witches and Devils  the graver habits striving which should most disgrace the characters they assumed  and every one endeavouring to be thought the direct contrary of what they appeared to be   Miss Gr  Well  then  the Devils  at least  must have been charming creatures   Lady L  But  Sir Charles  might not a masquerade  if decorum were observed  and every one would support with wit and spirit the assumed character—  Mr  Gr  Devils and all  Lady L    Lady L  It is contrary to decorum for such shocking characters to be assumed at all  But might it not  Sir Charles  so regulated  be a rational and an almost instructive entertainment   Sir Ch  You would scarcely be able  my dear sister  to collect eight or nine hundred people  all wits  and all observant of decorum  And if you could  does not the example reach down to those who are capable of taking only the bad and dangerous part of a diversion  which you may see by every common news paper is become dreadfully general   Mr  Gr  Well  Sir Charles  and why should not the poor devils in low life divert themselves as well as their betters  For my part  I rejoice when I see advertised   303 an eighteen penny masquerade  for all the pretty  prentice souls  who will that evening be Arcadian Shepherdesses  Goddesses  and Queens   I blushed at the word Arcadian  yet Mr  Grandison did not seem to have my masquerade dress in his thoughts   Miss Gr  What low profligate scenes couldst thou expatiate upon  good man  if thou wert in proper company  I warrant those Goddesses have not wanted an adorer in our cousin Everard   Mr  Gr  Dear Miss Charlotte  take care  I protest  you begin to talk with the spite of an old maid   Miss Gr  There  brother  Do you hear the wretch  Will not you  knight errand like  defend the cause of a whole class of distressed damsels  with our good Yorkshire aunt at the head of them   Sir Ch  Those general prejudices and aspersions  Charlotte  are indeed unjust and cruel  Yet I am for having every body marry  Bachelors  cousin Everard  and maids  when long single  are looked upon as houses long empty  which no body cares to take  As the houses in time  by long disuse  will be thought by the vulgar haunted by evil spirits  so will the other  by the many  be thought possessed by no good ones   The transition was some how made from hence to the equitableness that ought to be in our judgements of one another  We must in these cases  said Sir Charles  throw merit in one scale  demerit in the other  and if the former weigh down the latter  we must in charity pronounce to the person s advantage  So it is humbly hoped we shall finally be judged ourselves  For who is faultless   Yet  said he  for my own part  that I may not be wanting to prudence  I have sometimes where the merit is not very striking  allowed persons  at first acquaintance  a short lease only in my good opinion  some for three  some for six  some for nine  others for twelve months  renewable or not  as they answer   304 expectation  And by this meane I leave it to every one to make his own character with me  I preserve my charity  and my complacency  and enter directly  with frankness  into conversation with him  and generally continue that freedom to the end of the respective person s lease   Miss Gr  I wonder how many of your leases  brother  have been granted to Ladies   Sir Ch  Many  Charlotte  of the friendly sort  But the kind you archly mean  are out of the question at present  We were talking of esteem   They insensibly led the conversation to Love and Courtship  and he said  What do you think he said  Lucy   That he should not  perhaps  were he in Love  be over forward to declare his passion by words  but rather shew it by his assiduities and veneration  unless he saw  that the suspense was painful to the object  and in this case it would be equally mean and insolent not to break silence  and put himself in the power of her  whose honour and delicacy ought to be dearer to him than his own   What say you to this  Lucy   Some think  proceeded he  that
