 I attend you     THE two Miss Nedhams  Miss Watson  Miss Barclay  the two Miss Holles s  Mr  Deane—   So  so  so  Harriet  said I  what is the meaning of this    —My uncle s doings  I have no spirits  Sir Charles should not have been so passive  He  and no body else  could have prevailed upon my uncle  My aunt has held him in  till her arms aked  O the dear restiff man  She has now let go  and you see how he prances over the whole meadow  the reins upon his neck     Dear girl  said I  I am glad you are so fanciful   I would fain be lively  if I could  said she  Never any creature had more reason  Lady G —My heart is all Gratitude  and  I will say  Love   Good girl  hold up your head  my dear  and all will be as it should be   Sir Charles staid to attend hither the most venerable of women  Mr  and Mrs  Revees are to come with them  You must  as you expect me to be minute  be content with bits and scraps  written by snatches of time  I pity you for your still life  my dear Lady L  and think your request  that I will so write  as to make you suppose yourself on the spot  a reasonable one   Here is come the man of men   WITH what respect  all his Respect has Love in it  did he attend Mrs  Shirley to her seat  And then hastening to Lord and Lady W  he saluted them both  and acknowleged the honour done him by their presence    307 an hour  he said  that he could not have expected  nor therefore had the thought  the distance so great  of asking for it   He then paid his compliments  in the most affectionate manner  to his amiable friend Beauchamp  who  on his thanking him for his uninvited presence  said  He could not deny himself being present at a solemnity that was to complete the happiness of the best of men  and best of friends   Sir Charles addressed himself to the young Ladies who were most strangers to him  apologizing to them  as they were engaged with Mr  Selby  Mr  Deane and Lord G  that he did not at first  He sat a few minutes with them  What he said  I heard not  but they smiled  blushed  and looked delighted upon each other  Every body followed him in his motions  with their eye  So much presence of mind  never met with so much modesty of behaviour  and so charming a vivacity   The young Ladies came only intendedly to breakfast  and that at Mr  Selby s odd invitation  They had the good sense to apologize for their coming this day  as they were to make part of the cavalcade  as I may call it to morrow  But the odd soul had met the four at a neighbouring Lady s  where he made a gossiping visit  and would make them come with him   I observed  that nobody cared to find fault with him  so I began to rate him  and a very whimsical dialogue passed between us at one end of the room  while Sir Charles  Mrs  Shirley  Mrs  Selby  Lady W  and Harriet  were in close talk at the other   I made the honest man ashamed of himself  and every body in our circle was pleased with us  This misled me to go on  and so  by attending to his nonsense  and pursuing my own  I lost the opportunity of hearing a conversation  which  I dare say  would have been worth repeating to you by pen and ink  Harriet shall write  and give it you     308 Mr  Orme and his Sister  we are told  set out yesterday for London  Mrs  Selby and Harriet are yet afraid of Greville   The gentlemen and some of the Ladies  myself  but not Harriet  among them  have been to look at the preparations made in the lesser Park  for the reception of the tenants  Mr  Selby prided himself not a little on his contrivances there  When we returned  we found Harriet at one end of the great parlour  sitting with Emily  her grandmother  Mr  Selby  Lucy  in conversation at the other  the good girl s hand in hers  Emily blushing  looking down  but delighted  as it seemed  Harriet  with sweetness  love  and compassion  intermingled in her aspect  talking to her  and bending over her  her fine neck  I thought I never saw her look so lovely  Elder sister like  and younger  one instructing in love  the other listening with pleasure  They  unobserved by themselves  took every body s attention  as the room filled with the company  who all crouded about Mrs  Shirley  affecting not to heed the two friends  What would I give  said Lady W  to Sir Charles and her Lord
