over a bottle of wine  and Fabrice reads to his friend a sonnet which Gil Blas finds absurdly obscure   A poet capable of producing such rubbish as that   he says   can deceive only his time   and he adds   your sonnet is merely pompous nonsense   The tortured  involved  affected style disgusts Gil Blas as such a style always disgusted Lesage  whose one ambition was to be an  écrivain naturel qui parle comme le commun des hommes   and who detested  le langage précieux  which the great ladies and certain wits of his time took to be the mark of genius and a password for immortality  Fabrice becomes angry   Tu n es qu une bête avec ton style naturel   he exclaims  and he maliciously reminds Gil Blas of what befell him with the Archbishop of Granada  The allusion makes the two old friends laugh  and they finish the evening over a third bottle   Yes  Gil Blas  who is a kind of joyous jack of all trades  capable  as Fabrice on another occasion puts it  of fulfilling all kinds of employment  since he possesses  l outil universel   is interesting and sympathetic quite as much because of his sound sense and ready wit as because of his amusing adventures  But this good sense and this wit  it should be remembered  are the fruits of his experience  Gil Blas s character is slowly formed by life under the reader s eye  Successively the dupe of the habits and the manners  the prejudices and the ideals of each social condition which he traverses in his advance towards the stable equilibrium of middle age  he is too intelligent ever to remain dazzled by his surroundings for more than a brief period  You constantly hear him  after each fresh round with Fate  saying in his natural French way   ça n est pas ça  there must be some thing better than that in store for me   Even the seduction of life at Court ceases eventually to charm him  and one of his most poignant regrets is the fact that he had forgotten under that corrupting influence his father and mother and the old canon  his uncle  He does his best later on to make amends for this neglect  On his way to his country place at Lirias he is suddenly filled with remorse  and he turns aside towards Oviedo  where his parents live  His own dream now is to watch over their last years  and he looks forward  on arriving home  to inscribing in gold letters on the door of his father s house the Latin verses    Inveni portum  Spes et Fortuna  valete  Sat me lusistis  ludite nunc alios    Alas  it is almost too late  for he arrives just in time to bury his father  He had previously entered the country inn  where he had been recognised by the inn keeper with lively joy   By Saint Anthony of Padua   his host had exclaimed   here is the son of the good Blas de Santillane   and his wife had chimed in with   Why  yes  so it is  Oh  I recognise him  He is hardly changed  It s that wide awake little Gil Blas who had more intelligence than inches  I can still see him dropping in here for a bottle of wine for his uncle s supper   Gil Blas has changed  nevertheless  Fabrice is too keen not to perceive it some time afterwards when Gil Blas visits him at the hospital  Fabrice remarks upon his modest bearing and observes   You haven t the vain and insolent air that prosperity is wont to give   Gil Blas explains the reason why   Les disgraces ont purifié ma virtu  et j ai appris a l école de l adversité à jouir des richesses sans m en laisser posséder   He is now and then to be a backslider still  but we know that he has learned the essential lesson of life  Really  as the Italians say   il tempo è galantuomo      III  The rapidity of the narrative enhances the effect of optimism which is so inspiriting throughout the whole book  The transitions from the episodes of bad luck to those of good fortune take place  as Smollett has already pointed out  so suddenly that the reader positively has no time to pity Gil Blas  He is speedily inspired with a firm confidence in Lesage s ingenuity  which somehow manages to extricate his hero from every possible embarrassment  Lesage s point of view  as an observer of life  is thus quickly revealed to be a lively sense of life s chronic succession of ups and downs  and of the merely relative importance of its plights  When Gil Blas loses his place with Count Galiano  he remarks    I began to lose courage when I found myself back again in so miserable a case  I had grown accustomed to the conveniences of existence  and I could no longer  as before  regard indigence with cynicism  Yet I will confess I was wrong to indulge in sadness after having so many times discovered that no sooner had Fortune upset me than it put me on my feet again    Lesage accepts the stoical ideal of patience in adversity  but he
