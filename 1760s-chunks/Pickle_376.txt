in all places of resort  which is a kind of cowardly  assassination that there is no guarding against  yet  in spite of all  these machinations  and the shameful indifference of mankind  who  stand aloof unconcerned  and see this unhappy gentleman most inhumanly  oppressed by the weight of lawless power and faction  M    far from  suffering himself to be dejected by the multiplying difficulties  that crowd upon him  still exerts himself with amazing fortitude and  assiduity  and will  I doubt not  bring the affair he began and  carried on with so much spirit  while his finances lasted  to a happy  conclusion    It would exceed the bounds of my intention  and  perhaps  trespass too  much upon your time  were I to enumerate the low artifices and shameful  quibbles by which the usurper has found means to procrastinate the  decision of the contest between him and his hapless nephew  or to give  a detail of the damage and perplexity which Mr  M   has sustained  and  been involved in  by the treachery and ingratitude of some who listed  themselves under him in the prosecution of this affair  and by the  villainy of others  who  under various pretences of material discoveries  they had to make  etc   had fastened themselves upon him  and continued  to do all the mischief in their power  until the cloven foot was  detected    One instance  however  is so flagrantly flagitious  that I cannot  resist the inclination I feel to relate it  as an example of the most  infernal perfidy that perhaps ever entered the human heart  I have  already mentioned the part which H  n acted in the beginning of M   s  connection with the unfortunate stranger  and hinted that the said H    lay under many obligations to that gentleman before Mr  A   s arrival    6 22 15  3 45 PM   in England  He had been chief agent to Lord A    and  as it afterwards  appeared  received several payments of a secret pension which that  lord enjoyed  for which he either could not or would not account   His lordship  therefore  in order to compel him to it  took out writs  against him  and his house was continually surrounded with catchpoles  for the space of two whole years    Mr  M   believing  from H   s own account of the matter  that the poor  man was greatly injured  and prosecuted on account of his attachment to  the unhappy young gentleman  did him all the good offices in his power   and became security for him on several occasions  nay  such was his  opinion of his integrity  that  after Mr  A   was cleared of the  prosecution carried on against him by his uncle  his person was  entrusted to the care of this hypocrite  who desired that the young  gentleman might lodge at his house for the convenience of air  M   s own  occasions calling him often into the country    Having thus  by his consummate dissimulation  acquired such a valuable  charge  he wrote a letter to one of Lord A   s attorneys  offering to  betray Mr  A    provided his lordship would settle his account  and give  him a discharge for eight hundred pounds of the pension which he had  received and not accounted for  Mr  M    informed of this treacherous  proposal  immediately removed his lodger from his house into his own   without assigning his reasons for so doing  until he was obliged to  declare it  in order to free himself from the importunities of H    who  earnestly solicited his return  This miscreant finding himself detected  and disappointed in his villainous design  was so much enraged at his  miscarriage  that  forgetting all the benefits he had received from M    for a series of years  he practised all the mischief that his malice  could contrive against him  and at length entered into a confederacy  with one G    and several other abandoned wretches  who  as before said   under various pretences of being able to make material discoveries  and  otherwise to serve the cause  had found means to be employed in some  extra business relating to it  though their real intention was to betray  the claimant    These confederates  in conjunction with some other auxiliaries of  infamous character  being informed that Mr  M   was on the point of  securing a considerable sum  to enable him to prosecute Mr  A   s right   and to bring it to a happy conclusion  contrived a deep laid scheme  to disappoint him in it  and at once to ruin the cause  And  previous  measures being taken for that wicked purpose  they imposed upon the  young gentleman s inexperience and credulity by insinuations equally  false  plausible  and malicious  to which they at length gained his  belief  by the mention of some circumstances that gave
