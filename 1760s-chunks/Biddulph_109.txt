she should come to know the situation he had been in  I bid him not be discouraged  telling him I should set off that circumstance of his having been my gentleman  for so I chose to call him  in the most favourable light  I presented him with a very elegant suit of cloaths  which I had never worn  and which fitted him very well  as you know he is nearly my size  You cannot imagine how handsome the fellow looked when he was dressed  for he had linnen and every thing else suitable to his cloaths   I then desired him to wait on his goddess  but he  who had been so eager a little before  was now quite abashed at the thoughts of making his pretensions known to the lady  and intreated me to present him to    her  I saw he was quite disconcerted at the serious scene he was going to engage in   I pitied him  and told him I would go with him to Mrs Gerrarde  but that it was proper first to prepare her a little   He said he thought so too   I immediately sent for Rachael  and speaking to her at the door  without letting her see Pivet  I bid her tell her mistress that I purposed making her a visit in half an hour  and should introduce the gentleman  whom I expected she would  according to her promise  receive at my hands for her husband  reserving to herself still the liberty of chusing the other alternative  in case she disliked him   Pivet shewed the sollicitude of a lover  after this message was sent to his mistress  Poor dear lady  said he  how I pity her  What must she suffer in this interval  But your presence  Monsieur Pivet  said I  will dispel all her fears  and make her the happiest of women   The poor fellow was out of countenance  and I dare say as anxious as Mrs Gerrarde   As I received no answer from her to my message  I construed her silence as leave to attend her  and accordingly  at the appointed time  I entered her apartment  leading Pivet by the hand   She was sitting at a table  leaning her head on one of her hands  she cast a look of scorn at me  and immediately withdrew her eyes  not so much as deigning to glance them at Pivet  little imagining that it was he who accompanied me  though she knew it was her intended bridegroom   Pivet was not able to speak  he trembled  and  like a true inamorato  ran to her  clapt one knee to the ground  and ventured  though with great diffidence  to take one of her hands   This action obliged the haughty fair one to vouchsafe him a glance at her eye   Her surprize  spite of her assumed airs of grandeur  was not to be concealed  it was apparent  she coloured  and though she intended to have been solemn and lofty  she even stared  and I could discover a little gleam of pleasure dance over her countenance   What  Monsieur Pivet  And then she looked at me  as if for an explanation   Yes  madam  said I  Monsieur Pivet is the man   I was going to say the happy man  but I did not mean to compliment her  my business was to make her think I was doing her a favour   It has been your good fortune to make a conquest of him  and in the hope of your making    him a good wife  as I am sure he will make you a good husband  I have consented to the match  and I spoke this in the tone of one  who thinking he has conferred a great obligation on an undeserving object  expects to be thanked for it   The woman  with all her art and assurance to boot  was quite confounded  I did not give her time to recover herself  but taking the settlement out of my pocket  and reading it to her  Look there  madam  and see if I have injured you in the disposal of your person and your fortune   Mrs Gerrarde  always alert when her interest was in the question  took the paper  and notwithstanding her confusion  read it entirely over  Pivet’s handsome appearance  joined to her former prepossessions  had made so good an impression on her  that she began to think the matter worth attending to  When she had read the paper  she put it into Pivet’s hands  Sir  said she  it should appear by this that you have acted generously  but as I have already been imposed upon by that gentleman  looking at me  all this may  for ought I know  be a deceit  but as it is not in my power to make terms for myself  it is to no purpose for me to make objections  or to enquire any farther  I am ready to accept your offer  only I should be glad to know who the man is  that I am to make my husband   She spoke this with such an air of disdain  that the poor lover  shrunk up and diminished in his own
