expence of the public  to teach English to the rising generation  nothing is a stronger tie of brotherhood and affection  a greater cement of union  than speaking one common language       The want of attention to this circumstance has  I am told  had the worst effects possible in the province of New York  where the people  especially at a distance from the capital  continuing to speak Dutch  retain their affection for their ancient masters  and still look on their English fellow subjects as strangers and intruders       The Canadians are the more easily to be won to this  or whatever else their own  or the general good requires  as their noblesse have the strongest attachment to a court  and that favor is the great object of their ambition  were English made by degrees the court language  it would soon be universally spoke       Of the three great springs of the human heart  interest  pleasure  vanity  the last appears to me much the strongest in the Canadians  and I am convinced the most forcible tie their noblesse have to France  is their unwillingness to part with their croix de St  Louis  might not therefore some order of the same kind be instituted for Canada  and given to all who have the croix  on their sending back the ensigns they now wear  which are inconsistent with their allegiance as British subjects       Might not such an order be contrived  to be given at the discretion of the governor  as well to the Canadian gentlemen who merited most of the government  as to the English officers of a certain rank  and such other English as purchased estates  and settled in the country  and  to give it additional lustre  the governor  for the time being  be always head of the order        Tis possible something of the same kind all over America might be also of service  the passions of mankind are nearly the same every where  at least I never yet saw the soil or climate  where vanity did not grow  and till all mankind become philosophers  it is by their passions they must be governed       The common people  by whom I mean the peasantry  have been great gainers here by the change of masters  their property is more secure  their independence greater  their profits much more than doubled  it is not them therefore whom it is necessary to gain       The noblesse  on the contrary  have been in a great degree undone  they have lost their employs  their rank  their consideration  and many of them their fortunes       It is therefore equally consonant to good policy and to humanity that they should be considered  and in the way most acceptable to them  the rich conciliated by little honorary distinctions  those who are otherwise by sharing in all lucrative employs  and all of them by bearing a part in the legislature of their country       The great objects here seem to be to heal those wounds  which past unhappy disputes have left still in some degree open  to unite the French and English  the civil and military  in one firm body  to raise a revenue  to encourage agriculture  and especially the growth of hemp and flax  and find a staple  for the improvement of a commerce  which at present labors under a thousand disadvantages       But I shall say little on this or any political subject relating to Canada  for a reason which  whilst I am in this colony  it would look like flattery to give  let it suffice to say  that  humanly speaking  it is impossible that the inhabitants of this province should be otherwise than happy       I have the honor to be   My Lord   c   WILLIAM FERMOR     LETTER CXXXIX   139   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  May 20   I CONFESS the fact  my dear  I am  thanks to papa  amazingly learned  and all that  for a young lady of twenty two  yet you will allow I am not the worse  no creature breathing would ever find it out  envy itself must confess  I talk of lace and blond like another christian woman       I have been thinking  Lucy  as indeed my ideas are generally a little pindaric  how entertaining and improving would be the history of the human heart  if people spoke all the truth  and painted themselves as they really are  that is to say  if all the world were as sincere and honest as I am  for  upon my word  I have such a contempt for hypocrisy  that  upon the whole  I have always appeared to have fewer good qualities than I really have       I am afraid we should find in the best characters  if we withdrew the veil  a mixture of errors and inconsistencies  which would greatly lessen our veneration       Papa has been reading me a wise lecture  this morning  on playing the fool  I reminded him  that I was now arrived at years of indiscretion  that every body must have their day  and that those who did not play the fool young  ran a
