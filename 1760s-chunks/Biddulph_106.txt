me of it  had been ordered to inform her that Monsieur Pivet was not at home   The doctor  after leaving his patient  came to me  and confirmed the character I had received of him  both for skill in his profession  and integrity in his practice  for he told me very honestly  that he thought the lady was in perfect health  I thought the doctor deserved a double fee  and accordingly gave it to him  requesting him  however  to continue his visits  for I told him  that  though the lady might really be very well  she was  however  a little vapourish   I left her to her reflections the whole day  Rachael inquired three or four times of the footman if Mr Pivet was come in  but was always answered in the negative  I was pleased at her sollicitude about him   I desired him to wait on her the next day  at the time the doctor paid his visit  and instructed Pivet to ask the doctor  in her presence  what he thought of her case  and to report his answer fairly to her  for I was resolved not to let her imagine that she imposed on me   The doctor  by Pivet’s means  discoursed with her more readily than he had done the day before  Pivet asked his opinion of her disorder  and the physician declared it as freely as he had done to me     adding  he should not have repeated his visit  if I had not insisted on it   Pivet could not help smiling  Mrs Gerrarde observed it  for  I suppose  she watched his countenance  and asked him what the doctor had said  He says  Madam  what gives me a vast deal of pleasure  which is  that your disorder is intirely imaginary  He is an ignorant fellow  said Mrs Gerrarde  and you may tell him I desire to see him no more  The poor doctor  who knew not what she said  made her half a dozen scrapes  and withdrew   She then threw back her curtain  and re assuming the subject she had been upon the day before with Pivet  asked him if he had had any conversation with me about her  and what resolution I had come to   Pivet  who had begged I would leave this conference intirely to his management  seemed to hesitate a little  and appeared melancholy  We have had some talk about you  Madam  said he  and Mr Faulkland tells me  if you reject the nunnery scheme  which I think he seems to be fondest of   that he has a person in his thoughts  who  he believes  will be a suitable match for you  if you are willing to accept of him  if not—here he stop’d  What if I should not  Sir  Pray speak  I hope  Madam  he will not carry matters to an extremity  Extremity  Sir  Do you think he can be brutal enough to force me into a nunnery  Are there no laws in France  I hope he will not  Madam  but I can’t pretend to answer for him  he is a strange man  he seems out of temper too  the doctor told him nothing ailed you  he believes him  and spoke harshly on the occasion  And what  said she  is the match that he calls suitable  One of his footmen perhaps  or his barber   Pivet affected to look concerned  He tells me  Madam  he has cast his eyes on a young man  well born  and genteelly educated  not contemptible in his personal accomplishments  and one who he is sure will make you a fond and obliging husband   Pivet sighed deeply  and cast his eyes languishingly on her  You seem concerned  Sir  said she  Do you know the person  It is my doubts on that occasion  Madam  that is the cause of my uneasiness  Pray explain yourself  Mr Pivet  Madam  I dare not  he replied  with great solemnity  I will only assure you  that whoever the person be  whom Mr Faulkland has not yet named to me  I think him the happiest man in the world  What can be his meaning  asked Mrs Gerrarde  for telling you so much  and yet concealing the person’s name  He says  he has not proposed it yet to the gentleman  Madam     and as  he tells me  he can’t in honour conceal any part of your story  he is fearful—I beg your pardon  Madam  you will excuse me if I do not repeat his scruples on this occasion  I understand you  Sir  He supposes his friend will reject me  Some such insinuation he threw out  Madam  said Pivet  I told him  that he need only permit the gentleman to see you  and if he then made any objection  he must be the blindest and most insensible man alive  He spoke this with a warmth that seemed highly pleasing to the lady  She bowed  and answered  All men  Sir  are not as generous as you  But what did Mr Faulkland say to this  He only smiled  and said
