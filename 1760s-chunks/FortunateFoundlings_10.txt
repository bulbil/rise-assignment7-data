you now mention  If there   wanted no more  said he  than to prove the sincerity of my wishes in   this point to gain your approbation of them  my chaplain should this   moment put it past a doubt  and confirm my proposal   but  pursued he  I   will not put your modesty to any farther shock at present   all I   intreat is  that you will consider on what I have said  and what the   passion I am possessed of merits from you  In concluding these words he   kissed her with the utmost tenderness  and quitted her to speak to some   men who were at work in another part of the garden  leaving her to   meditate at liberty on this surprizing turn in her affairs       It was indeed necessary he should do so  for the various agitations she   laboured under were so violent  as to be near throwing her into a   swoon   She no sooner found herself alone  than she flew to her   chamber  and locked herself in  to prevent being interrupted by any of   the servants  and as in all emotions of the mind  especially in that of   a surprize  tears are a very great relief  her s found some ease from   the sources of her eyes   Never had the most dutiful child loved the   tenderest of fathers more than she did Dorilaus  but then it was only a   filial affection  and the very thoughts of his regarding her with that   sort of passion she now found he did  had somewhat in them terribly   alarming   All she could do to reconcile herself to what seemed to be   her fate was in vain   This generous man who offers me his heart  said   she  is not my father  or any way of my blood   he has all the   accomplishments of his whole sex centered in him   I could wish to be   for ever near him   All that I am is owing to his goodness   How   wretched must I have been but for his bounty   What unaccountable   prejudice is this then that strikes me with such horror at his   love   what maid of birth and fortune equal to his own but would be   proud of his addresses  and shall I  a poor foundling  the creature of   his charity  not receive the honour he does me with the utmost   gratitude   shall I reject a happiness so far beyond my expectation      so infinitely above any merit I can pretend to   what must he think of   me if I refuse him   how madly stupid  how blind to my own interest  how   thankless to him must I appear   how will he despise my folly   how   hate my ingratitude       Thus did her reason combat with her prejudice  and she suffered much the   same agonies in endeavouring to love him in the manner he desired  as he   had done to conquer the inclination he had for her  and both alike were   fruitless  Yet was her condition much more to be commiserated  he had   only to debate within himself whether he should yield or not to the   suggestions of his own passion  she to subdue an aversion for what a   thousand reasons concurred to convince her she ought rather to be   ambitious of  and which in refusing she run the risque of being cast   off  and abandoned to beggary and ruin  and what was still more hateful   to her  being hated by that person who  next to her brother  she loved   above the world  tho  in a different way from that which could alone   content him       Dorilaus  who had taken the disorder he perceived in her for no other   than the effects of a surprize  which a declaration  such as he had   made  might very well occasion  was perfectly contented in his mind  and   passed that night with much more tranquility than he had done many   preceding ones  while he suffered his cruel reason to war against the   dictates of his heart  but having now wholly given himself up to the   latter  the sweet delusion filled him with a thousand pleasing ideas    and he thought of nothing but the happiness he should enjoy in the   possession of the amiable Louisa  But how confounded was he  when the   next day accosting her with all the tender transports of a lover  she   turned from him  and burst into a flood of tears  How is this  Louisa    said he  do the offers I make you merit to be treated with disdain  has   my submitting to be your lover forfeited that respect you were wont to   pay me as a guardian  O do not  sir  accuse me of
