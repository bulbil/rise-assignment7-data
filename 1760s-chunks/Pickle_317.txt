with the  disposition of our hero  may easily conceive how he relished this  adventure  At first  all the faculties of his soul were swallowed up in  astonishment and indignation  and some minutes elapsed before his nerves  would obey the impulse of his rage  which manifested itself in such an  application to the temples of the plaintiff  as laid him sprawling on  the floor  This assault  which was committed in a tavern  whither he  had been purposely decoyed  attracted the regard of the bailiff and his  followers  who  to the number of four  rushed upon him at once  in  order to overpower him  but his wrath inspired him with such additional  strength and agility  that he disengaged himself from them in a trice   and  seizing a poker  which was the first weapon that presented itself  to his hand  exercised it upon their skulls with incredible dexterity  and execution  The officer himself  who had been the first that presumed  to lay violent hands upon him  felt the first effects of his fury in a  blow upon the jaws  in consequence of which he lost three of his teeth   and fell athwart the body of the receiver  with which he formed the  figure of a St  Andrew s cross  One of his myrmidons  seeing the fate  of his chief  would not venture to attack the victor in front  but   wheeling to one side  made an attempt upon him in flank  and was  received obliquely by our hero s left hand and foot  so masterly  disposed to the right side of his leg  and the left side of his neck   that he bolted head foremost into the chimney  where his chin was  encountered by the grate  which in a moment seared him to the bone  The  rest of the detachment did not think proper to maintain the dispute   but  evacuating the room with great expedition  locked the door on the  outside  and bellowed aloud to the receiver s servants  beseeching them  to come to the assistance of their master  who was in danger of his  life   Meanwhile  this gentleman having recollected himself  demanded a parley   which having with difficulty obtained of our incensed candidate  in  consequence of the most submissive application  he complained grievously  of the young gentleman s intemperance and heat of disposition  and very  calmly represented the danger of his rashness and indiscretion  He told  him  that nothing could be more outrageous or idle  than the resistance  he had made against the laws of his country  because he would find it  impracticable to withstand the whole executive power of the country   which he could easily raise to apprehend and secure him  that  over and  above the disgrace that would accrue to him from this imprudent conduct   he would knock his own interest on the head  by disobliging his friends  in the administration  who were  to his knowledge  at present very well  disposed to do him service  that  for his own part  what he had done  was by the express order of his superiors  and not out of any desire of  distressing him  and that  far from being his enemy  notwithstanding  the shocking insult he had sustained  he was ready to withdraw the writ   provided he would listen to any reasonable terms of accommodation   Peregrine  who was not more prone to anger than open to conviction   being appeased by his condescension  moved by his arguments  and chid    6 22 15  3 45 PM   by his own reflection for what he had done in the precipitation of his  wrath  began to give ear to his remonstrances  and the bailiffs being  ordered to withdraw  they entered into a conference  the result of which  was our adventurer s immediate departure for London  so that next day  his competitor was unanimously chosen  because nobody appeared to oppose  his election  The discontented Pickle  on his arrival in town  went  directly to the house of his patron  to whom  in the anguish of his  disappointment  he bitterly complained of the treatment he had received   by which  besides the disgrace of his overthrow  he was no less than two  thousand pounds out of pocket  exclusive of the debt for which he  stood engaged to the receiver  His lordship  who was prepared for this  expostulation  on his knowledge of the young man s impetuous temper   answered all the articles of his charge with great deliberation  giving  him to understand the motives that induced the minister to quit his  interest in that borough  and soothing him with assurances that his  loss would be amply rewarded by his honour  to whom he was next day  introduced by this nobleman  in the warmest style of recommendation  The  minister  who was a pattern of complaisance  received him with the  most engaging affability  thanked him very kindly for his endeavours  to support and strengthen the interest of the administration  and  faithfully promised to lay hold on the first opportunity to express the  sense he
