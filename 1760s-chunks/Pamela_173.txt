deference  may his   beneficence be said to be Godlike  and that is the highest that can be   said       The chariot brought us home at near the hour of two  and  blessed be   God  my master is pure well  and cheerful  and that makes me hope he   does not repent him of his late generous treatment of me  He handed me   out of the chariot  and to the parlour  with the same goodness  that   he shewed when he put me into it  before several of the servants  Mrs    Jewkes came to inquire how he did  Quite well  Mrs  Jewkes  said he    quite well  I thank God  and this good girl  for it   I am glad of it    said she  but I hope you are not the worse for my care  and my doctoring   of you   No  but the better  Mrs  Jewkes  said he  you have much obliged   me by both       Then he said  Mrs  Jewkes  you and I have used this good girl very   hardly   I was afraid  sir  said she  I should be the subject of her   complaints   I assure you  said he  she has not opened her lips about   you  We have had a quite different subject to talk of  and I hope she   will forgive us both  You especially she must  because you have   done nothing but by my orders  But I only mean  that the necessary   consequence of those orders has been very grievous to my Pamela  And now   comes our part to make her amends  if we can       Sir  said she  I always said to madam  as she called me   that you was   very good  and very forgiving  No  said he  I have been stark naught    and it is she  I hope  will be very forgiving  But all this preamble is   to tell you  Mrs  Jewkes  that now I desire you ll study to oblige her    as much as  to obey me  you was forced to disoblige her before  And   you ll remember  that in every thing she is to be her own mistress       Yes  said she  and mine too  I suppose  sir  Ay  said the generous   gentleman  I believe it will be so in a little time   Then  said she    I know how it will go with me  And so put her handkerchief to her   eyes   Pamela  said my master  comfort poor Mrs  Jewkes       This was very generous  already to seem to put her in my power  and I   took her by the hand  and said  I shall never take upon me  Mrs  Jewkes    to make a bad use of any opportunities that may be put into my hands by   my generous master  nor shall I ever wish to do you any disservice  if   I might  for I shall consider  that what you have done  was in obedience   to a will which it will become me also to submit to and so  if the   effects of our obedience may be different  yet as they proceed from one   cause  that must be always reverenced by me       See there  Mrs  Jewkes  said my master  we are both in generous hands    and indeed  if Pamela did not pardon you  I should think she but half   forgave me  because you acted by my instructions   Well  said she    God bless you both together  since it must be so  and I will double my   diligence to oblige my lady  as I find she will soon be       O my dear father and mother  now pray for me on another score  for   fear I should grow too proud  and be giddy and foolish with all these   promising things  so soothing to the vanity of my years and sex  But   even to this hour can I pray  that God would remove from me all these   delightful prospects  if they were likely so to corrupt my mind  as to   make me proud and vain  and not acknowledge  with thankful humility    the blessed Providence which has so visibly conducted me through the   dangerous paths I have trod  to this happy moment       My master was pleased to say  that he thought I might as well dine with   him  since he was alone  But I begged he would excuse me  for fear  as   I said  such excess of goodness and condescension  all at once  should   turn my head   and that he would
