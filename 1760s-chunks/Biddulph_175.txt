been quite improper  You might have writ  said he  interrupting me  Ah Sir   shaking my head  if I had—and I stopped short  ‘You might not have been much the better for it  is that what you would say   with a contemptuous half sneer   In short  Sir  I can do nothing for you  what is it that you expect I should do ’ I do not mean to be a burden on you  Sir  I replied  I was bred to business  I write a good hand  and understand accompts  I hope to get into some merchant’s house  but in the mean time I am starving  I am an utter stranger here  though in my own country  I observed he had slipped his hands into his breeches pocket  and seemed to be feeling for a bit of money  Sir George  said the lady   who had observed him as well as I  ’tis to no purpose to give any thing to these sort of people  assist one  and They will send another to you  and so there is no end to such claims  Your brother withdrew his hand from his pocket  as if checked by his lady’s looks  ‘Sir  it is not in my power to assist you ’ I then asked him if you were living  and where I could find you  for though you were not born when I left England  I heard afterwards    that Sir Robert Bidulph had a daughter  Your brother replied peevishly he knew nothing of you  as you preferred the friendship of strangers to that of your relations  He then rang the bell  and calling his man to dress him  went out of the room without casting a look at me  I ventured to ask his lady your name  if you had changed it  and where you lived  She told me your name  but said she knew not where you lodged  adding I might spare myself the trouble of enquiring you out  for to her knowlege you could do nothing for me   I took my leave  but enquiring of a footman whom I found in the hall  he directed me to St Alban’s Street  where you formerly lodged  I went there  and it was with difficulty that I could prevail on the woman of the house to tell me where you now lived  but my necessities made me urgent  and I waited on you this morning  Madam  to make my distress known to you  but I am afraid the information I had from your sister in law concerning you has but too much truth in it  As he spoke this he cast his eyes round my meanly furnished parlour  looked at the poor equipage of my tea table  and again sipped his unfinished and now cold dish of coffee   Sir  said I  when my sister informed you that I was poor  it is certain she spoke truth  I am not  however  I thank God  so poor but that I can spare you a little  if you will take a cheap lodging near me  I will supply you with enough to pay for it  and if you can eat as I and my little family do  you shall be welcome to us every day till something can be done for you  I see but very few people  but I will speak to such as come in my way to try to have you recommended to some one for employment  I then put my hand in my pocket  and taking out five shillings  all the silver I had  I put it into his hand  Sir  you may owe some little trifle where you have slept these two nights  I fear your lodging has been but poor  but if this will not discharge it tell me freely   He suffered me to drop the shillings into his unclosed hand  He fixed his eyes eagerly on my face  but instead of replying to what I said  he only cried out  Good God  good God  and undoing two or three buttons at his breast  he sobbed as if his bosom was bursting  I was affected with his gratitude  and tried to disperse the tears that mounted to my eyes  I wish I could weep  said he  but I can’t  and may these be the last tears that ever you shall have occasion to shed  my worthy  my generous  my pious relation  God forgive me for trying such a heart  but I will reward it  amply will I reward your goodness     He then drew a red letter case out of his bosom  and  opening it  he put a bill into my hand for two thousand pounds on the bank of England  Think  my dear  how I started at such a vision  Sir  you amaze me  was all I could say  I beg your pardon for deceiving you  said he  but it was with a good intent  I suppose it is needless to tell you that I am not that poor forlorn wretch that I represented myself to you  Hear the real truth of my circumstances  You see before you  of a private man  one of the richest subjects in these dominions  You have heard that my
