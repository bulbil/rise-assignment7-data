Mildmay s     Thus far  lady Blandford  Mr  and Mrs  Villars s story seemed to account for their separation  but still there wanted some probable causes for old Mr  Villars s conduct  as well as for his daughter in law s assuming the name of Beauclerk  Most of us  therefore  honestly   225 expressed our surprize  that the consideration of Mr  Melmoth s marrying a young lady without a fortune  could induce his father to practise so barbarous a deceit upon an only son  and Mr  Melmoth himself seemed astonished  that his lady should  without any reasonable foundation  sacrifice his name  while she continued to dedicate herself so religiously to his memory —Mrs  Melmoth blushed  and only said  she had her reasons —   That she had   cried out Mrs  Dobson   who had been in the house some time  and now eagerly thrust herself forward   I was amazed at the good woman  and  indeed  so was all the company —but as she appeared pregnant with something of importance  Mr  Melmoth entreated she would go on —    226 I will  Sir   answered she    but  first of all  give me leave to ask you a question or two —Pray  do you recollect one William Dobson  who formerly was a favourite servant of your father s   —     Yes  very well   returned Mr  Melmoth —    And pray  don t you recollect  that  before your marriage with Miss Nancy Markham  the lady who now stands here  was publicly known  the same William Dobson one day told you  in confidence  that your father was in love with Miss Markham  and intended to offer very advantageous settlements  in hopes that the greatness of the proposal  might obviate the difference of his age  and induce her to accept of him as a husband  Pray  Sir  do you remember this       227 Yes  Madam   replied Mr  Melmoth   I remember it perfectly well      Why then  Sir  the whole affair is nothing more than this—Your father  stung almost to madness  at finding himself cut off from the first wish of his heart  resolved upon the barbarous method of separating you  and making each believe that the other was dead  An assurance of this nature coming from a father  could admit of no doubt  and you might either of you have entered into a second marriage  even before accident had undeceived you  In either case  the discovery of the deceit would have only increased your distress  and in the former  so long as it remained undiscovered  so long he was certain of making you miserable —This was not  however  the whole of his design —If he could make your lady   228 entertain a belief of your demise  he thought it still possible for himself  at some opportunity  to gratify the horrid purposes of his imagination —Though she was his daughter  he still continued to love her  and once  I believe  actually insinuated a proposition that must be shocking to humanity —This was at a time when her necessities were extreme  and when he hoped the severity of her situation would lessen the horror of his overture —But let me hurry from this dreadful part of my narrative—When he found himself treated with the abhorrence which he merited—when your lady even threatened to expose him to the world  and talked of applying instantly to a magistrate  if he ever more came within her doors  he grew outrageous—he hired ruffians to insult her  and omitted no opportunity of slandering her reputation    229 When  therefore  she retired from London  she found it I suppose necessary to change her name  for fear of his infamous machinations —This was what he told my husband he was fearful of  and it is very fortunate the lady took that precaution  for I have been well assured  he made every possible enquiry  to discover the place of her retreat   —     Gracious God   exclaimed Mr  Melmoth    and can there be such fathers —But pray  Madam  tell me by what means you have gained this information   —      From the repository of all his secrets  William Dobson  Sir  whom  after the death of a former husband  once the object of lady Haversham s benevolence  I married —Mr  Dobson often told me the story  and severely   230 reproached himself at times  for continuing in the old gentleman s service —But it seems he was a liberal master  and therefore William  I suppose  endeavoured to check the pungency of his reflections —Mr  Dobson  Sir  died about six months ago  and  on his death bed  conjured me  if ever I found a proper opportunity  to make this discovery —I would not disturb the ashes of the dead unnecessarily  but the surprize which you expressed at your lady s change of name  affecting me in a very particular manner  I could conceal the circumstance no longer —Perhaps I have been presumptuous —I beg pardon of the honourable company  and hope they will excuse my impertinence  from
