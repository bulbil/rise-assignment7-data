seeming magnanimity of refusing it  and thus to confirm his real power   His private life was no less worthy our observation  he led an obscure life in the palace assigned for his habitation  without pomp  without luxury  When he sent his son Henry into Ireland  he allowed him but one servant in his retinue  His manners   54 were naturally austere  and he preserved the dignity and distance of his character in the midst of the coarsest familiarity  He was cruel from policy  just and temperate from inclination  laborious and exact in all his designs  without eloquence he had the talent of persuading  and without sincerity the art of making sincere adherents  his dexterity equally satisfied every sect  with Presbyterians  a Presbyrian  with Deists a Deist  only an Independant in principle  It was by these arts he continued his authority  first cemented by blood  and maintained by hypocrisy and usurpation   Yet  notwithstanding this conduct  which contributed to render him truly formidable at home  he was  after a few years reign  become truly miserable to himself  He knew that he was detested by every party in the kingdom  he knew the fierce spirit of the people whom he had made slaves  and he was incessantly haunted by the terrors of an assassination  To increase his calamity  a book was published  intitled  Killing no murder  in which it was proved to be just to destroy him at any rate    Shall we  said this popular declaimer  who would not suffer the lion to invade us  tamely stand to be devoured by the wolf    Cromwell read this spirited treatise  and it is said was never seen to smile afterwards  He wore armour under his cloaths  and always kept a loaded pistol in his pocket  his aspect became cloudy  and he regarded every stranger with a glance of timid suspicion  He always travelled with hurry and precipitation  and never slept two nights successively in the same apartment  A tertian ague came at last to deliver him from a life of horror and misery  He died at Whitehall  after having nominated his son Richard Cromwell as his successor  Notwithstanding the evident approaches of death  his fanatical chaplains affirmed that he would recover  and thanked God for the undoubted assurances they had   55 received of his safety  He was even of the same opinion himself   I tell you  cried he to the physicians that attended him  I shall not die of this distemper  favourable answers have been returned from Heaven  not only to my own supplications  but likewise to those of the godly  who carry on a more intimate correspondence with the Lord    This behaviour  at his death  is an undeniable proof that he was in reality more the enthusiast than an hypocrite  and  in fact  we are more frequently deceived ourselves  than we attempt to deceive others     Whatever were the differences of interest after the death of the Usurper  the influence of his name was still sufficient to get Richard his son proclaimed Protector  The parties  however  were now grown too headstrong to be controlled by greater abilities  what then could Richard do who had nothing active in his disposition  no talents for business  no knowledge of government  no ambition  no importance  Oliver  by means of the army  had long governed the kingdom  they were now left to govern alone  They first therefore presented a petition to the new Protector  demanding that no member of the army should be subject to the civil power  and that the officers should enjoy the privilege of chusing their own general  Richard  shocked at their presumption  rejected their requests  and even threatened to dismiss them the service  The parliament attempted to support these measures of Richard  but the army prevailed  the parliament was dissolved by their menaces  and the Protector again reduced to a private station  The officers  once more being thus left to themselves  determined to replace the remnant of the old parliament which had beheaded the King  and which the late Protector had so disgracefully dismissed  This was called The good old cause  and such of the higher officers as seemed unwilling to give up their authority to this parliament  were intimidated by their subalterns into a compliance     56 The Rump parliament  as it was called  being thus once again established  began by vigorously attempting to lessen the power of that very army which had just now given them all their authority  They new modelled a part of the forces  cashiered such officers as they feared  and placed others in their room  These attempts  however  did not pass without vigorous efforts in the principal officers who were at London to oppose them  They held several conferences together to strengthen their power  and lessen that of their opposers  They at length came to the usual resource of these turbulent times  they first presented a seditious petition  and  upon finding it rejected  conducted by general Lambert  they entered the house  excluded the members  dissolved the parliament by their own authority  and formed a council of ten to provide for the safety of the commonwealth  During these transactions  general Monck was at the head of twelve thousand veterans in Scotland  Monck
