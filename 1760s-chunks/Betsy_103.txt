 and   undeceive Mr  Staple in the opinion he had of her being so silly as to   fall in love with Mr  Trueworth       Miss Betsy  on hearing this  and not doubting but she would do as she   had said  turned towards her  and  looking full upon her  with a   countenance composed enough  but which had yet in it somewhat between   the ironical and severe  replied in these terms   Since you are so much   bent   said she   on making a visit to Mr  Staple  far be it from me    Miss Flora  to deprive that gentleman of the favour you intend him    provided you give me your promise  in the presence of Mr  Goodman   and   he will be your security for the performance of it  that you will   mention neither my name  nor that of Mr  Trueworth  and  above all  that   you will not pretend to have any knowledge of affairs you never have   been trusted with        However inconsiderate or incautious Miss Betsy may appear to the reader    as to her conduct in general  it must be acknowledged  that at this time   she shewed an uncommon presence of mind  This was  indeed  the only way   to put a stop to  and quash at once  that scheme which her false friend   had formed to do her a real prejudice under the pretence of serving her       It is not in words to express the confusion Miss Flora was in  on   hearing Miss Betsy speak in this manner  Bold as she was by nature  and   habituated to repartee  she had not now the power of uttering one word    Innocence itself  when over awed by authority  could not have stood more   daunted and abashed  while the other  with a careless air  added   As   soon as we go down stairs  I shall speak to Mr  Goodman about this   matter        Whether Miss Betsy really intended to put this menace in execution  or   not  is uncertain  for Miss Flora recovering her spirits  and her   cunning  at the same time  affected to burst into a violent fit of   laughter   Mr  Goodman   said she   mighty pretty  indeed  You would   trouble Mr  Goodman with the little impertinences we talk on between   ourselves  But do so  if you think proper  I shall tell him the truth    that I made this proposal to you only to try you  and but acted the   second part of what Mr  Chatfree had begun  You did not imagine  sure     continued she  with a malicious sneer   that I loved you so well  that    for your sake  I would hazard my person and reputation  by going to see   a young gay fellow at his own lodgings         As for that   cried Miss Betsy  with a look as contemptuous as she   could possibly assume   I am equally well acquainted with the modesty   and sincerity of Miss Flora  and know how to set a just value upon   both   In speaking these words  having now got on her cloaths  she flung   out of the room without staying to hear what answer the other would have   made       After this  these two high spirits had little intercourse  never   speaking to each other  but on such common affairs as were unavoidable   between persons who lived in the same house  eat at the same table  and   lay in the same bed  How Miss Flora employed her thoughts will very   shortly be seen  but we must first examine what effects these late   occurrences had on the mind of Miss Betsy       Young as she was  she might be said to have seen a great deal of the   world  and  as she had a fine understanding  and a very just notion of   things  wanted only to reflect on the many follies and deceits which   some of those who call themselves the beau monde are guilty of  to be   enabled to despise them  The last letter she had received from Lady   Trusty made a strong impression on her  and casting a retrospect on   several past transactions she had been witness of  as well as those she   had been concerned in herself  began to wonder at  and condemn the   vanity of  being pleased with such shadowy things  such fleeting    unsubstantial delights  accompanied with noise and hurry in the   possession  and attended with weariness and vexation of spirit  A   multitude of admirers seemed now to her among this number  her soul   confessed  that to encourage the addresses of
