her felonious intents and malice are fully expressed    in the very peculiar use and inhumanity of the weapon with which   she perpetrated this most desperate deed  You need not therefore      fntlemen  go out of your box to bring her in guilty of the murder    will not affirm with equal certainty touching the robbery   and   yet to me it is apparent  that she could not have enterprised so   barbarous a fact  if she had not done it in prospect of plundering   the deceased  But  as she is capitally punishable in the first   instance  I leave ye  gentlemen  to determine of the second at   pleasure  First permit us  my lord  replied the foreman  to examine   what we have got in these hats  He then drew a long purse from   among the relics of Kobert  and  having counted out seventy   guineas  Mr  Longfield  says he  would you know my lord s purse    If it is my master s purse  said Longfield  it is of green silk  and   has  toward the top  a coronet and the letter S  wrought under it   in silver twist  The very same  sir  indeed  rejoined the foreman    And now let us see what Mrs  Deborah might have got in her   honest keeping   So saying  he took from the second hat a small   wooden box neatly stuffed with cotton  in which he found my lord s   diamond ring  three gold medals  and the ends of the handles of   several silver spoons  Mrs  Clement  says he  I imagine we may   have got some of your property among us  Pray had you any mark   to your silver spoons   Yes  sir  said she  scarce audibly   a G at   top for Graves  and a D and a A below for Dorothy and Arabella    I wish  madam  replied this gentleman  that we were equally   enabled to find an equivalent for your merits  as to restore to you   this trifling remnant of your rights      Come  gentlemen  cried the judge  the day wears apace  It is time   for you to retire  and consult on the verdict ye are to bring in      My lord  answered the foreman  you truly observed that we need   not leave our box for the purpose you require  We are already   agreed and unanimous in our verdict  And I would to heaven   that we were not confined  on this occasion  to literal precedents   and forms of law  that we might give a verdict some way adequate   to the merits of the prisoner  who  however depressed by fortune    is superior in all excellencies  whom we judge to be an honour   to human nature  and the first grace and ornament of her own sex    But since we are limited by custom in these matters  we do say    with one voice  and a conscience that compels us to utterance    Not guilty  my lord not guilty       The words were scarce pronounced when the court house was   almost split by a sudden peal  Hats  caps  and wigs universally   filled the air  and jostled against each other  The triumph was   caught and echoed by the crowds without  and the sound was         108 TEE FOOL OF QUALITY      repeated  and floated from street to street  till it seemed to die   away in distant parts of the city      My wife then turned  gracefully curtsying to the foreman   I thank you  sir  says she   I thank ye  gentlemen  says she  again   curtsying to the rest of the jury  And then  glancing modestly   round  she saluted the assembly  and sat down  But I could not   contain my gratitude  my transport overpowered me   and falling   on my knees  and lifting my hands towards the jury God alone   can reward ye  gentlemen   I cried  May he for ever preserve the   properties  honours  and families of the worthy citizens of London   from violation and insult       I then rose hastily  I slipped out of the bar   and rushing up to   Mr  Longfield  I catched him eagerly about the neck  I could not   speak  I hid my face in his bosom  and broke into tears  He   attempted to disengage himself  but I held him fast  1 believe    said he  you must be Mr  Clement  I congratulate you  sir  with   all my soul  But you owe me nothing   I barely did my duty      O  my friend my brother my
