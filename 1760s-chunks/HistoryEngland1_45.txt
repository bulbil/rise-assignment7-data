hands of the English   These conquests abroad were  however  no way favourable to the cause of liberty at home  As the King became victorious  he necessarily increased in independence  The barons  clergy    132 and people  balanced each other s power  the royal power alone was growing beyond its bounds  Yet Edward was too sensible a Monarch to give open disgust  he was only laying a foundation of despotism for his successor to build upon  and  had he been of equal capacity with his father  he might have seized upon public liberty with impunity  But I have transgressed the bounds of a letter  without coming to the conclusion of this Prince s reign  I must therefore refer you to my next   I am   c   LETTER XIX   Dear Charles   YOU have already seen how unjustly the people distribute titles to Kings  before they have deserved them  you have seen the second Edward called the Father of his country  in the beginning of his reign  and yet fall  in the end  a miserable sacrifice to its resentment  You have seen Philip Valois  sirnamed the Fortunate  upon coming to the crown  suffering the most signal defeats  but some time after   John succeeded Philip in the throne of France  but had his pretensions contested by Edward the Black Prince  who commanded the army of his father  This young Prince s gallantry  bravery  and modesty  had won the affections of his soldiers  and he almost became invincible at their head  John  in the mean time  was at the head of a divided and factious nobility  the government   133 of France  being under this John  exactly what that of England had been under a Prince of the same name some reigns before  They had their parliaments of barons  despotic over their own hereditary possessions  and they obliged John of France to sign a charter  very much resembling the Magna Charta  which had been signed by the English Monarch  The warlike resources of France and England were  therefore  at this time very unequal  John was at the head of a nobility which acknowledged no subordination amongst each other  they led their dependant slaves to the fight  and obeyed superior command only as it suited their inclination  their King might more justly be said to command a number of small armies under distinct leaders  than one vast machine operating with uniformity and united force  The French barons paid their own soldiers  punished their transgressions  and rewarded their fidelity  But very different were the forces of England  the main body of the English army was composed of the people  indiscriminately levied  paid by the King  and regarding him as the source of preferment or disgrace  Instead of personal attendance  the nobility contributed supplies in money  and there was only such a number of nobles in the army  as might keep the spirit of honour alive  without diminishing military subordination   With an army thus composed  the Black Prince advanced to Poictiers  and ravaged a country that once belonged to his ancestors  King John  at the head of sixty thousand men  came up to give him battle  the English army was in such a situation  that he might readily have starved it into any terms he thought proper  but he was impatient of such a delay  both generals committed   134 unpardonable faults  the one in being led thus into a defile  the other in not taking a proper advantage of the situation  But  at this age  we must not expect Caesars or Hannibals to conduct armies  ignorant generals were opposed by generals still more ignorant  The battle of Poictiers  which soon followed  very much resembled that of Cressy  the superior discipline of the English army came off victorious  the flower of the French were cut off  and the King  being wounded in the face  was taken prisoner  A particular  worth noting  is  that he surrendered himself to one of his own subjects  whom he had formerly banished  and who now fought for his enemies  Of four sons the King of France had with him  the three eldest quickly fled  and  by their cowardice  contributed to the defeat of the army  his fourth and youngest son  as yet but thirteen years old  still fought by his father  stuck near him in all the vicissitudes of the field  and  at length  was taken prisoner by his side  This is a remarkable instance of the education Princes then gave their children   This victory was  in a great measure  owing to the valour of the Black Prince  but his modesty  after conquest  was still more remarkable  In the most humble manner he remonstrated with his royal captive  who was complaining of his misfortunes  that still he had the comfort left to reflect  that though he lost the victory  yet his courage deserved it  and that a submissive deference to his person should never be wanting to make him forget his captivity  In April following  the Prince arrived in England  bringing his prisoner with him  entering into London in a remarkable manner  The Prince  upon the left  rode a little black horse  while the royal prisoner was mounted
