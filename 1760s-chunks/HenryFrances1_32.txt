even in the blackest Hour of all my Life  when my Spirits were sunk to such an Ebb  together with my own Uneasiness  and Fears for you  that nought within this sublunary Sphere  but thou alone  could raise them   Now  give me Leave to tell you  that nothing  but the Joy I feel at your returning Health  could make me bear the Remainder of your Letter with Patience  if your Physicians had not pronounced you out of Danger  I should have done it  from your Writing in so peevish a Manner  for you say of yourself  and I have once or twice remarked it  that  when you are ill  you feel more Tenderness  Humanity  and Good nature about you  than at any other Time  which is contrary to the general Observation  that Persons in Sickness  Pain  or Age  even at those Seasons when they most stand in Need of the Comforts of Society  and the Assistance of Friends  do then more particularly  and absurdly too  contrive to deprive themselves of both  by Ill humour and Perverseness   101 of Temper  Perhaps  Providence has wisely implanted this Weakness in human Nature  to take off somewhat of the Concern  we should otherwise be too sensible of  for the Sickness or Death of our Friends  or Parents  which is something like the good natured Expedient  I heard made Use of by a Gentleman  who frequently retired to the Country to see his Father  during his Vacation of Business at London  and had a little Brother there  who was so extremely fond of him  as to cry for a Week after his Departure  being informed thereof  he ever after contrived to pick some Quarrel with the Boy  the Morning he was to go away  this succeeded so well  that the little Fellow used to call for his Horses  and cry    Well  I am glad you are not to stay here another Day   But  indeed  I generally observe  you scold me when you find me melancholy  at least  I perceive it more then  as if I was a cross Child  to be chid into good Humour  If the Messenger neglected to deliver your Things  I can t help it  and  as I thought mine the quicker Method of Conveyance  I am no farther answerable for the Delay  I shall not answer your Inquiry about the Matter I hinted at  for  if I had thought proper to write it  I should have done so at first  without waiting for your peremptory Commands  and I must be  for once  as absolute as you  in desiring that you will not mention   102 it to Tom  Let it suffice to tell you  that the Storm is now blown over  and that Prince Volscius was the Person who raised it  you shall know more when we meet  if you rest content with this for the present     You did not tell me whether you would have the Callicoe  Yard  or Yard and half wide  so I shall not buy it   till you are more explicit  lest you should please to be angry at another innocent Blunder of mine   Adeiu   LETTER LIX   Dear FANNY   YOU rejoice me extremely  by saying the Affair of Prince Volscius is blown over  And I approve myself for my own Forecast  as  I own  I suspected something relative to him  in the Matter —I perceive by Part of your Letter  and by Recollection of several others  that you are very fond of an Amusement the French call faire Laguerre  and often imagine Unkindness in me  for the Pride of forgiving it  And indeed  without some such Contrivance as this  that noble Faculty in you could never have an Opportunity of exerting itself  from any Occasion offered by me  I only meant to rally you about the Disappointment of my Things  which   103 I have since received safe  and well approved of  And wanted to tempt you to let me know the Affair you hinted at  which you have not told me  but I am easy  because you say  you are so  I shall not call on Tom for any farther Explanation  nor press you on that Head more   till I see you  and I am sorry to say  that will not be so soon as I designed  for I shall not be able to leave the Country this Fortnight yet  on Account of some Business which has occurred since I wrote last  The Callicoe is to be but Yard wide   My Health is almost established  Thanks to your good Wishes  I hope I may preserve it at our Assizes  to which I am just summoned  Health and Happiness attend my dear Fanny  and take me in their Train   LETTER LX   Dear FANNY   I Received yours  and hope my last Letter will sufficiently explain the Mistake of the Post   I do assure you that you have no Rival at Belvidere  but one  which is at present sitting on the Table  and endeavouring to snatch the Pen out of my Hand  but  according to the Fashion of the World  you have nothing
