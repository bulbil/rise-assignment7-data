was disturbed and painful  all  the inhabitants of the castle plainly perceived that something  extraordinary had occured  something to disorder their Lord  and to  perplex his designs  The Countess alone felt some degree of comfort  she  fondly imputed the sudden retreat of her persecutors to some happy  event which the flight of Oswald had produced  some appearance of her  friends  or some accounts of their motions  Hence was her harassed mind  enabled to recover from the violent shock which it had just now  received   In the mean time  the vigilant and crafty Grey  once more  sought the  messengers of Earl William  who by this time were much alarmed at the  manner of their reception  He met them with courteous looks  and  declared  that the Countess  who was now ill at ease  and could not  admit them to her presence  had sent to inform herself particularly of  the intelligence which they brought  They related briefly the landing  of William  the place of his present residence  and his intention of  speedily returning to his own castle  Grey received the account with  coldness and affected diffidence  he observed  that        the most positive assurances had been received that Earl William had  perished in France  that  if he really was approaching he must be  received with due respect  but  if envy or malice sought to disturb the  approaching happiness of Lord Raymond by false intelligence  his power  was great  and his resentment would be violent  By his directions  they  were for a short time to be strictly guarded  lest they should alarm the  minds of his friends by rumours which might possibly prove groundless   if otherwise  a few days would release them         â€”They gazed upon each other with surprise  but it was in vain to  expostulate  they  appealed to time to confirm the truth of their declarations  and Grey  then proceeded to summon some of the boldest and most zealous of the  attendants on Raymond  who were conducted to their Lord  and by him  commanded to receive their orders from his favourite  and implicitly to  follow his direction   These commands Grey pretended to explain more fully  He told them  that   from advices lately received  their Lord had good reason to apprehend a  false design to drive him from those possessions  which he so justly  claimed  and from whence alone he hoped to derive the power of rewarding  his faithful followers  that they were to arm themselves with speed   and carefully to guard all the approaches to the castle  against force  or treachery  Nor were they slow to express their zeal and chearsul  obedience  And now this wicked minion stood prepared at the head of a  resolute and well appointed band  to oppose the entrance of Lord  William  and to plunge a dagger in his heart     Long they waited in anxious expectation of their invaders  but in vain   no invaders appeared  no danger threatened them  Grey began indeed to  hope that these strangers had been employed to deceive them  and to  raise these false alarms for some purpose yet undiscovered  perhaps by  some friends of the Countess  who had learned or suspected her present  condition  He visited the messengers frequently  insulted them on the  appearance of falsehood which their intelligence now seemed to wear   menaced  and endeavoured to terrify them into a confession of the real  purpose of their coming  They steadily adhered to their former  declarations  and related such circumstances of the fortunes  the  dangers  and the arrival of Lord William on the coast of England  as but  too plainly demonstrated their truth and integrity  Grey was convinced   but dissembled his conviction  He waited impatiently for the approach of  the Earl  but no intelligence could be received  no unusual appearance   no arrival of strange and unexpected visitants  had  broke in upon the silence and tranquillity of the adjacent lands  The  disappointment served but the more to perplex and alarm him  his  vigilance was not relaxed  he kept his force collected about him  and  still stood resolved to meet his danger  and confirmed in his bloody  purpose         End of BOOK IV                           BOOK V              SECT  I     THE three faithful followers of Earl WILLIAM who had determined to  return to their Lord  found him just issuing forth from the hall of  Randolph  at the head of a small body of attendants  At sight of them  his mind was silled with sad presages  He turned upon his ancient  friend with surprize  then both rushed forward  impatient to learn the  cause of this unexpected return  and instantly received the melancholy  tidings  that whilst their companions had brought the news of the Earl s  arrival to the castle of Salisbury  they
