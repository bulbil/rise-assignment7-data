the disease  and instead of resisting putrefaction  promoted a total degeneracy of the vital fluid —When my friend Morgan  therefore  brought his diaphoretic boluses  I put them in my mouth   tis true  but without any intention of swallowing them  and when he went away  spit them out  and washed my mouth with water gruel  I seemingly complied in this manner  that I might not affront the   300 blood of Caractacus  by a refusal which might have intimated a diffidence of his physical capacity  for he acted as my physician  doctor Macshane never once enquiring about me  or even knowing where I was —When my distemper was at the height  Morgan thought my case desperate  and after having applied a blister to the nape of my neck  squeezed my hand  bidding me  with a woful countenance  recommend myself to Got and my reteemer  then taking his leave  desired the chaplain to come and administer some spiritual consolation to me  but before he arrived  I had made shift to rid myself of the troublesome application the Welchman had bestowed on my back —The parson having felt my pulse  enquired into the nature of my complaints  hemmed a little  and began thus     Mr  Random  God out of his infinite mercy hath been pleased to visit you with a dreadful distemper  the issue of which no man knows —You may be permitted to recover  and live many days on the face of the earth  and  which is more probable  you may be taken away and cut off in the flower of your youth  It is incumbent on you  therefore  to prepare for the great change  by repenting sincerely of your sins  of this there cannot be a greater sign  than an ingen ous confession  which I conjure you to make  without hesitaton or mental reservation  and when I am convinced of your sincerity  I will then give you such comfort as the situation of your soul will admit of  Without doubt  you have been guilty of numberless transgressions  to which youth is subject  as swearing  drunkenness  whoredom  and adultery  tell me therefore  without   301 reserve  the particulars of each  especially of the last  that I may be acquainted with the true state of your conscience  For no physician will prescribe for his patient until he knows the circumstances of his disease    As I was not under any apprehensions of death  I could not help smiling at the doctor s inquisitive remonstrance  which I told him savoured more of the Roman than of the Protestant church  in recommending auricular confession  a thing  in my opinion  not at all necessary to salvation  and which  for that reason  I declined —This reply disconcerted him a little  however  he explained away his meaning  in making learned distinctions between what was absolutely necessary  and what was only convenient  then proceeded to ask what religion I professed  I answered  that I had not as yet considered the difference of religions  consequently had not fixed on any one in particular  but that I was bred a Presbyterian —At this word the chaplain discovered great astonishment  and said  he could not comprehend how a Presbyterian was entitled to any post under the English government —Then he asked if I had ever received the Sacrament  or taken the oaths  to which I replying in the negative  he held up his hands  assured me he could do me no service  wished I might not be in a state of reprobation  and returned to his mess mates  who were making merry in the ward room  round a table well stored with bumbo  and wine —This insinuation  terrible as it was  had not such an effect upon me  as the fever  which  soon after he had   302 left me  grew outragious  I began to see strange chimeras  and concluded myself on the point of becoming delirious  But before that happened  was in great danger of suffocation  upon which I started up in a kind of frantic fit  with an intention to plunge myself into the sea  and as my friend the serjeant was not present  would certainly have cooled myself to some purpose  had I not perceived a moisture upon my thigh  as I endeavoured to get out of my hammock  The appearance of this revived my hopes  and I had reflection and resolution enough to take the advantage of this favourable symptom  by tearing the shirt from my body and the sheets from my bed  and wrapping myself in a thick blanket  in which inclosure  for about a quarter of an hour  I felt the pains of hell  but it was not long before I was recompensed for my suffering by a profuse sweat  that bursting from the whole surface of my skin  in less than two hours  relieved me from all my complaints  except that of weakness  and left me as hungry as a kite —I enjoyed a very comfortable nap  after which I was regaling myself with the agreeable reverie of my future happiness  when I heard Morgan  on the outside of the curtain  ask the serjeant  if I was still alive    Alive   cried the other  God forbid he should be otherwise  he
