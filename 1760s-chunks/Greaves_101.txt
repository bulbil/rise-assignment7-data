resources than that of the seaman  he suggested an advertisement  which was accordingly inserted in the daily papers  importing that   Whereas a gentleman of considerable rank and fortune had suddenly disappeared  on such a night  from his house near Golden Square  in consequence of a letter delivered to him by a porter  and there is great reason to believe some violence hath been offered to his life  any person capable of giving such information as may tend to clear up this dark transaction  shall  by applying to Mr  Thomas Clarke  attorney  at his lodgings in Upper Brook Street  receive proper security for the reward of one hundred guineas  to be paid to him upon his making the discovery required    The porter who delivered the letter appeared accordingly  but could give no other information  except that it was put into his hand with a shilling  by a man muffled up in a greatcoat  who stopped him for the purpose  in his passing through Queen Street  It was necessary that the advertisement should produce an effect upon another person  who was no other than the hackney coachman who drove our hero to the place of his imprisonment  This fellow had been enjoined secrecy  and  indeed  bribed to hold his tongue  by a considerable gratification  which  it was supposed  would have been effectual  as the man was a master coachman in good circumstances  and well known to the keeper of the madhouse  by whom he had been employed on former occasions of the same nature  Perhaps his fidelity to his employer  reinforced by the hope of many future jobs of that kind  might have been proof against the offer of fifty pounds  but double that sum was a temptation he could not resist  He no sooner read the intimation in the Daily Advertiser  over his morning s pot at an alehouse  than he entered into consultation with his own thoughts  and  having no reason to doubt that this was the very fare he had conveyed  he resolved to earn the reward  and abstain from all such adventures in time coming  He had the precaution  however  to take an attorney along with him to Mr  Clarke  who entered into a conditional bond  and  with the assistance of his uncle  deposited the money  to be forthcoming when the conditions should be fulfilled  These previous measures being taken  the coachman declared what he knew  and discovered the house in which Sir Launcelot had been immured  He  moreover  accompanied our two adherents to a judge s chamber  where he made oath to the truth of his information  and a warrant was immediately granted to search the house of Bernard Shackle  and set at liberty Sir Launcelot Greaves  if there found   Fortified with this authority  they engaged a constable  with a formidable posse  and  embarking them in coaches  repaired with all possible expedition to the house of Mr  Shackle  who did not think proper to dispute their claim  but admitted them  though not without betraying evident symptoms of consternation  One of the servants directing them  by his master s order  to Sir Launcelot s apartment  they hurried upstairs in a body  occasioning such a noise as did not fail to alarm the physician  who had just opened the door to retire  when he perceived their irruption  Captain Crowe conjecturing he was guilty from the confusion that appeared in his countenance  made no scruple of seizing him by the collar as he endeavoured to retreat  while the tender hearted Tom Clarke  running up to the knight  with his eyes brimful of joy and affection  forgot all the forms of distant respect  and throwing his arms round his neck  blubbered in his bosom   Our hero did not receive this proof of attachment unmoved  He strained him in his embrace  honoured him with the title of his deliverer  and asked him by what miracle he had discovered the place of his confinement  The lawyer began to unfold the various steps he had taken with equal minuteness and self complacency  when Crowe  dragging the doctor still by the collar  shook his old friend by the hand  protesting he was never so overjoyed since he got clear of a Sallee rover on the coast of Barbary  and that two glasses ago he would have started all the money he had in the world in the hold of any man who would have shown Sir Launcelot safe at his moorings  The knight having made a proper return to this sincere manifestation of goodwill  desired him to dismiss that worthless fellow  meaning the doctor  who  finding himself released  withdrew with some precipitation   Then our adventurer  attended by his friends  walked off with a deliberate pace to the outward gate  which he found open  and getting into one of the coaches  was entertained by the way to his own house with a detail of every measure which had been pursued for his release   In his own parlour he found Mrs  Dolly Cowslip  who had been waiting with great fear and impatience for the issue of Mr  Clarke s adventure  She now fell upon her knees  and bathed the knight s hands with tears of joy  while the face of this young woman  recalling the idea of her mistress
