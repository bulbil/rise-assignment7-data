  dinner with these good ladies  and so prepared myself instantly  with   all the pleasure in the world  Lady Darnford and miss said I was their   dear   Look you  said miss  did I not tell you  stately one  that   something must have happened  But  O these tyrants  these men       Why  what hindered it  my dear  said he  give yourself time  you seem   out of breath   O sir  said I  out of breath  well I may   For  just as   I was ready to come away  who should drive into the court yard  but Lady   Davers   Lady Davers  Nay  then  my sweet dear  said he  and saluted me   more tenderly  hast thou had a worse trial than I wish thee  from one   of the haughtiest women in England  though my sister   For  she too  my   Pamela  was spoiled by my good mother   But have you seen her       Yes  sir  said I  and more than seen her   Why sure  said he  she has   not had the insolence to strike my girl   Sir  said I  but tell me you   forgive me  for indeed I could not come sooner  and these good ladies   but excuse me  and I ll tell you all another time  for to take up the   good company s attention now  will spoil their pleasantry  and be to   them  though more important to me  like the broken china you cautioned   me about       That s a dear girl  said he  I see my hints are not thrown away upon   you  and I beg pardon for being angry with you  and  for the future    will stay till I hear your defence  before I judge you  Said Miss   Darnford  This is a little better  To own a fault is some reparation    and what every lordly husband will not do  He said  But tell me  my   dear  did Lady Davers offer you any incivility  O sir  replied I  she   is your sister  and I must not tell you all  but she has used me very   severely  Did you tell her  said he  you were married  Yes  sir  I did   at last  but she will have it  tis a sham marriage  and that I am a vile   creature  and she was ready to beat me  when I said so  for she could   not have patience  that I should be deemed her sister  as she said       How unlucky it was  replied he  I was not at home   Why did you not send   to me here  Send  sir  I was kept prisoner by force  They would not let   me stir  or do you think I would have been hindered from obeying you    Nay  I told them  that I had a pre engagement  but she ridiculed me  and   said  Waiting maids talk of pre engagements  And then I shewed her your   kind letter  and she made a thousand remarks upon it  and made me wish   I had not  In short  whatever I could do or say  there was no pleasing   her  and I was a creature and wench  and all that was naught  But you   must not be angry with her on my account       Well  but  said he  I suppose she hardly asked you to dine with her  for   she came before dinner  I presume  if it was soon after you had received   my letter  No  sir  dine with my lady  no  indeed  Why  she would make   me wait at table upon her  with her woman  because she would not expose   herself and me before the men servants  which you know  sir  was very   good of her ladyship       Well  said he  but did you wait upon her  Would you have had me    sir  said I   Only  Pamela  replied he  if you did  and knew not what   belonged to your character  as my wife  I shall be very angry with you    Sir  said I  I did not  but refused it  out of consideration to the   dignity you have raised me to  else  sir  I could have waited on my   knees upon your sister       Now  said he  you confirm my opinion of your prudence and judgment  She   is an insolent woman  and shall dearly repent it  But  sir  she is to be   excused  because she won t believe I am indeed
