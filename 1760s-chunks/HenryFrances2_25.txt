he had paid a very high Compliment to his future one   Adieu   Henry   Page  93  LETTER CCXV   THE Heat of the Day  and the Coolness of my unperforming Nag  obliged me to stop here to Dinner  When the Sun s Strength declines  and my Horse recovers his  I shall make a desperate Push for St  Alban s   Among the Parcel of loose Papers  which I put into my Pocket  for Amusement on the Road  I find the inclosed Letter from Oliver Cromwell to his Wife  which I send you  as Part of a Comment upon Hudibras  which I left you reading  You may observe  from this Letter  the hypocritical and fanatic Stile of the leading Men at that Aera  which will give you Light into the Characters of Knight and  Squire   Though it is but three Hours since we parted  I found I could not eat my Dinner without writing to you  for my Love is stronger than my Hunger  The Eagerness of Appetite sometimes makes me omit a Grace  and Sleep too often inclines me to neglect a Prayer at Night  but at Bed  or Board  I never forget to think of you  or cease to wish you  most earnestly  a Participation of such Entertainment  as I can afford you at either   I shall call at —  in my Road  this Evening  where I expect to find the good Lady Page  94 in such a Condition    as is her Custom always in the Afternoon     There is something remarkably odious in this Vice in Women  as Custom and Education are against it  and that it has not even the Excuse of Nature or Temptation on it s Side    When Women err  let Nature be their Guide   Love has some soft Excuse for female Pride   For my Part  I should think the Embraces of a Harlot chaster than the Fondness of such a Wife     What a shocking Thing must it be to any Woman s Reflection  at a sober Interval  to think  that  by this Vice  she has rendered herself the Subject of Lust  without being the Object of Desire  For such must be the Consequence  when Passions are inflamed  while Reason is extinct  and  as the Wife of Bath says    There is a Rule I never knew to fail   c    And what a dreadful Situation must that unhappy Man be in  who thinks he has no Security over his Wife s Chastity  but the natural Abhorrence which her Vice creates  For  in such a State  one could only think her a fit Paramour for an Incubus  which is a Species of Daemon  that is reported to hold criminal Commerce with dead Bodies  But enough of this vile Subject     Adieu   Henry   Page  95  LETTER CCXVI   My Dearest Rediviva   I RECEIVED your Letter of last Post  wrote by your own dear Hand  which gave me extreme Transport  What your Secretary said of your Health  or rather of your Life  which I was for a thousand Years alarmed about  could not make my Mind easy   till I had the Confirmation from yourself  How I passed the Age between the two last Posts  would be too tedious a Detail to trouble you with now   I was ill for several Days  of the worst Sort of Illness  an Inattention to Reading  and a Lowness of Spirits  It was upon these Hints that I wrote to you for the Precedent of a Will  tho  I pretended it was for another Person  for fear of alarming you  and you cannot imagine what a Shock it gave me  that I had deferred a Matter of such Consequence to you  and to our dear Pledge  so long  I wrote that Letter from my Bed  and lay down between every Paragraph   What a Sympathy was between us at the same Time  for I think we fell ill  and recovered  at the same Instant  How lucky it was too  that neither of us knew the other was ill   till we had both recovered   Page  96I am no farther displeased at your having made Use of our Money  than that you should mention it  In a Fortnight  from this Date  I design to be in Town  neither my Health or Business will permit me sooner   Put up the inclosed along with my Papers  Farewell  my redeemed  my dearest Life   Henry   The Paper  which he inclosed  was his Will  in the Wrapper of which was the following Writing   AS my Marriage  which I hereby publish  which I have privately owned to some Friends already  and which I hope  long before these Seals shall be broke open  I shall find myself at Liberty to acknowledge to all the World  may surprize some of my Relations and Friends  to whom I would  living or dying  give Satisfaction in any Particular relating to myself  I shall leave this Declaration behind me for their Perusal   I was not over reached into this Match by Art  nor hurried into it by Passion
