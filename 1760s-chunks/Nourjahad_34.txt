Cozro  Thou knowest  Page  237  what passed between us on thy first awaking from thy compelled slumbers  and that I heard and saw with what indifference thou receivedst the news of my supposed death  But I will not reproach thee with ingratitude—let the memory of that be buried with the rest of thy errors     I had soon the satisfaction to find that thou wast as it were a new man  The natural goodness of thy disposition  thy reason  thy experience of the deceitfulness of wordly enjoyments  joined to the remorse which thou couldst not help feeling  for a series of vice and folly  at length rouzed thee to a just sense of what thou owedst to the dignity of thy own nature  and to the duties incumbent on  Page  238  thee towards the rest of thy fellow creatures     I now discovered  with joy  that thou hadst intirely divested thyself of that insatiable love of pleasure  to which thou hadst before addicted thyself  and that thou no longer didst regard wealth  but as it enabled thee to do good  There was but one trial more remained  If  said I  his repentance be sincere  and he has that heroism of mind which is inseparable from the truly virtuous  he will not shrink at death  but  on the contrary  will look upon it as the only means by which he can obtain those refined enjoyments suited to the divine part of his nature  and which are as much superior  Page  239  in their essence  as they are in their duration to all the pleasures of sense     I made the trial—The glorious victory  Oh ← Nourjahad →   is thine  By thy contempt of riches  thou hast proved how well thou deservedst them  and thy readiness to die  shews how fit thou art to live —    In the space of fourteen moons  for it is no longer since I first imposed on thy credulity the belief of thy miraculous state  thou hast had the experience of four times so many years  Such assuredly would be the vicissitudes of thy life  hadst thou in reality possessed what thou didst in imagination  Let this dream of existence then be a lesson to thee for the  Page  240  future  never to suppose that riches can ensure happiness  that the gratification of our passions can satisfy the human heart  or that the immortal part of our nature  will suffer us to taste unmixed felicity  in a world which was never meant for our final place of abode  Take thy amiable Mandana to thee for a wife  and receive the fixed confidence and love of Schemzeddin     The history says that ← Nourjahad was from that minute raised to be the first man in power next to the sultan  that his wisdom and virtue proved an ornament and support to the throne of Persia during the course of a long and prosperous life  and that his name was famous throughout the Eastern world     FINIS
