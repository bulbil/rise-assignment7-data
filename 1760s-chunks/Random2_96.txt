beware of teizing the patentee —I treasured up this caution  and exerted my patience three weeks longer  at the end of which  his lordship gave me to understand that Mr  Brayer had read my play  and owned it had undubitable merit  but as he had long been pre engaged to another author  he could not possibly represent it that season  though if I would reserve it for the next  and in the interim make such alterations as he had proposed by observations on the margin  I might depend upon his compliance   Thunderstruck at this disappointment  I could not  for some minutes  utter one syllable  At length  however  I complained bitterly of the manager s insincerity in amusing me so long  when he knew from the beginning  that he could not gratify my desire —But his lordship reprimanded me for my freedom  said Mr  Brayer was a man of honour  and imputed his behaviour with respect to me  to nothing else but forgetfulness —And indeed I have had some reason since that time  to be convinced of his bad memory  for  in spite of appearances  I will not allow myself to interpret his conduct any other way —Lord Rattle observing me very much affected with my disappointment  offered his interest to bring on my play at the other house  which I eagerly accepting  he forthwith wrote a letter of recommendation to Mr  Bellower  actor  and prime minister   290 to Mr  Vandal  proprietor of that theatre  and desired me to deliver it with my tragedy  without loss of time —Accordingly  I hastened to his house  where after having waited a whole hour in a lobby  I was admitted to his presence  and my performance received with great state —He told me he was extremely busy at present  but he would peruse it as soon as possible  and bid me call again in a week  I took my leave  not a little astonished at the port and supercilious behaviour of this stage player  who had not treated me with good manners  and began to think the dignity of a poet greatly impaired since the days of Euripedes and Sophocles  but all this was nothing in comparison of what I have since observed   Well  Mr  Random  I went back at the appointed time  and was told that Mr  Bellower was engaged  and could not see me —I repeated my visit a few days after  and having waited a considerable time  was savoured with an audience  during which  he said  he had not as yet read my play —Nettled at this usage  I could contain myself no longer  but telling him  I imagined he would have paid more deference to Lord Rattle s recommendation  demanded my manuscript with some expressions of resentment —   Ay   said he  in a theatrical tone  with all my heart  —  Then pulling out a drawer of the bureau at which he sat  he took out a bundle  and threw it upon a table that was near him  pronouncing the word   There    with great disdain —I took it up  and perceiving with some surprize  that it was a comedy  told him  it did not belong to me  upon which he offered me another  which I also disclaimed—A third was produced  and rejected for the same reason  At   291 length  he pulled out a whole handful  and spread them before me  saying    There are seven—take which you please—or take them all  —  I singled out my own  and went away  struck dumb with admiration at what I had seen—not so much on account of his insolence  as of the number of new plays  which from this circumstance  I concluded were yearly offered to the stage —You may be sure I did not fail to carry my complaint to my patron  who did not receive it with all the indignation I expected  but taxed me with precipitation  and told me  I must lay my account with bearing the humours of the players  if I intended to write for the stage —   There is now no other remedy  said he  but to keep it till the next season for Mr  Brayer  and alter it at your leisure  in the summer  according to his directions  —  I was now reduced to a terrible alternative  either to quit all hopes of my tragedy  from which I had all along promised myself a large share of fortune and reputation  or to encounter eight long months of adversity in preparing for  and expecting its appearance —This last pennance  painful as it was  seemed most eligible to my restection at that time  and therefore I resolved to undergo it     Why should I tire you with particulars of no consequence  I wrestled with extreme poverty  until the time of my probation was expired  and went to my Lord Rattle in order to remind him of my affair  when I understood  to my great concern  that his lordship was on the point of going abroad  and  which was still more unfortunate for me  Mr  Brayer had gone into the country  so that my generous patron had it not in his power to introduce me personally  as he
