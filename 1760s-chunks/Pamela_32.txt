 good things without being hooted at  and so have bought what will be   more suitable to my degree  and be a good holiday suit too  when I get   home       He then took me in his arms  and presently pushed me from him  Mrs    Jervis  said he  take the little witch from me  I can neither bear    nor forbear her   Strange words these    But stay  you shan t go   Yet   begone   No  come back again       I thought he was mad  for my share  for he knew not what he would have    I was going  however  but he stept after me  and took hold of my arm    and brought me in again  I am sure he made my arm black and blue  for   the marks are upon it still  Sir  sir  said I  pray have mercy  I will    I will come in       He sat down  and looked at me  and  as I thought afterwards  as sillily   as such a poor girl as I  At last he said  Well  Mrs  Jervis  as I was   telling you  you may permit her to stay a little longer  till I see if   my sister Davers will have her  if  mean time  she humble herself  and   ask this as a favour  and is sorry for her pertness  and the liberty   she has taken with my character out of the house  and in the house    Your honour indeed told me so  said Mrs  Jervis  but I never found her   inclinable to think herself in a fault  Pride and perverseness  said he    with a vengeance  Yet this is your doating piece   Well  for once    I ll submit myself to tell you  hussy  said he to me  you may stay a   fortnight longer  till I see my sister Davers  Do you hear what I say to   you  statue  Can you neither speak nor be thankful   Your honour frights   me so  said I  that I can hardly speak  But I will venture to say    that I have only to beg  as a favour  that I may go to my father and   mother   Why fool  said he  won t you like to go to wait on my sister   Davers  Sir  said I  I was once fond of that honour  but you were   pleased to say  I might be in danger from her ladyship s nephew  or he   from me   D    d impertinence  said he  Do you hear  Mrs  Jervis  do you   hear  how she retorts upon me  Was ever such matchless assurance           I then fell a weeping  for Mrs  Jervis said  Fie  Pamela  fie   And I   said  My lot is very hard indeed  I am sure I would hurt nobody  and   I have been  it seems  guilty of indiscretions  which have cost me my   place  and my master s favour  and so have been turned away  and   when the time is come  that I should return to my poor parents  I am not   suffered to go quietly  Good your honour  what have I done  that I must   be used worse than if I had robbed you       Robbed me  said he  why so you have  hussy  you have robbed me  Who  I    sir  said I  have I robbed you  Why then you are a justice of peace  and   may send me to gaol  if you please  and bring me to a trial for my life    If you can prove that I have robbed you  I am sure I ought to die       Now I was quite ignorant of his meaning  though I did not like it  when   it was afterwards explained  neither  And well  thought I  what will   this come to at last  if poor Pamela is esteemed a thief  Then I thought   in an instant  how I should shew my face to my honest poor parents  if   I was but suspected  But  sir  said I  let me ask you but one question    and pray don t let me be called names for it  for I don t mean   disrespectfully  Why  if I have done amiss  am I not left to be   discharged by your housekeeper  as the other maids have been  And if   Jane  or Rachel  or Hannah  were to offend  would your honour stoop   to take notice of them  And why should you so demean yourself
