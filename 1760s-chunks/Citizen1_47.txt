and observing the nakedness of the inhabitants  he was so barbarous as to observe  that he thought the best method the Flemings could take was to sell their pictures  and buy cloaths  Ah  Coglione  We shall go to morrow to Mr  Carwarden s cabinet  and the next day we shall see the curiosities collected by Van Ran  and the day after we shall pay a visit to Mount Calvary  and after that— but I find my paper finished  so with the most sincere wishes to your lordship s happiness  and with hopes after having seen Italy  that centre of pleasure  to   146 return home worthy the care and expence which has been generously laid out in my improvement   I remain  my Lord  Yours   c   LETTER XXXIV  From Hingpo  a slave in Persia  to Aliangi  a travelling philosopher of China  by the way of Moscow   FORTUNE has made me the slave of another  but nature and incli••tion render me entirely subservient to you  a •yrant commands my body  but you are master of my heart  And yet let not thy inflexible nature condemn me when I confess that I find my soul shrink with my circumstances  I feel my mind not less than my body  bend beneath the rigours of servitude  the master whom I serve grows every day more formidable  In spite of reason which should teach me to despise him  his hideous image fills even my dreams with horror   A few days ago a christian slave  who wrought in the gardens  happening to enter an arbour where the tyrant was entertaining the ladies of his Haram with coffee  the unhappy captive was instantly stabbed to the heart for his intrusion  I have been preferred to his place  which tho  less laborious than my former station  is yet more ungrateful  as it brings me nearer him whose presence   147 excites sensations at once of disgust and apprehension   Into what a state of misery are the modern Persians fallen  A nation once famous for setting the world an example of freedom  is now become a land of tyrants  and a den of slaves  The houseless Tartar of Kamkatska  who enjoys his herbs and his fish in unmolested freedom  may be envied  if compared to the thousands who pine here in hopeless servitude  and curse the day that gave them being  Is this just dealing  heaven  to render millions wretched to swell up the happiness of a few  cannot the powerful of this earth be happy without our sighs and tears  must every luxury of the great be woven from the calamities of the poor  It must  it must surely be  that this jarring discordant life is but the prelude to some future harmony  the soul attuned to virtue here  shall go from hence to fill up the universal choir where Tien presides in person  where there shall be no tyrants to frown  no shackles to bind  nor no whips to threaten  where I shall once more meet my father with rapture  and give a loose to filial piety  where I shall hang on his neck  and hear the wisdom of his lips  and thank him for all the happiness to which he has introduced me   The wretch whom fortune has made my master  has lately purchased several slaves of both sexes  among the rest I hear a christian captive talked of with admiration  The eunuch who bought her  and who is accustomed to survey beauty with indifference  speaks of her with emotion  Her pride  however  astonishes her attendant slaves not less than her beauty  it is reported   148 that she refuses the warmest solicitations of her haughty lord  he has even offered to make her one of his four wives upon changing her religion  and conforming to his  It is probable she cannot refuse such extraordinary offers  and her delay is perhaps intended to enhance her favours   I have just now seen her  she inadvertently approached the place without a veil  where I sat writing  She seemed to regard the heavens alone with fixed attention  there her most ardent gaze was directed  Genius of the sun  what unexpected softness  what animated grace  her beauty seemed the transparent covering of virtue  Celestial beings could not wear a look of more perfection while sorrow humanized her form  and mixed my admiration with pity  I rose from the bank on which I sat  and she retired  happy that none observed us  for such an interview might have been fatal   I have regarded  till now  the opulence and the power of my tyrant  without envy  I saw him with a mind incapable of enjoying the gifts of fortune  and consequently regarded him as one loaded  rather than enriched with its favours  But at present  when I think that so much beauty is reserved only for him  that so many charms shall be lavished on a wretch incapable of feeling the greatness of the blessing  I own I feel a reluctance to which I have hitherto been a stranger   But let not my father impute those uneasy sensations to so trifling a cause as love  No  never let it be thought that your son  and the pupil of   149 the wise Fum Hoam could stoop to so degrading
