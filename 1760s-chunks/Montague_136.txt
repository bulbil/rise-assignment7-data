you think it a strong proof of my passion for my sposo  that I repeat his sentiments       But to business  Sir William is charmed with his little nephew  has promised to settle on him what he before mentioned  to allow Miss Williams an hundred pounds a year  which is to go to the child after her death  and to be at the expence of his education himself       I die to hear whether your oriental Colonel is in love with Emily       Pray tell us every thing       Adieu   Your affectionate  A  FITZGERALD     LETTER CCXXII   222   To Captain FITZGERALD   Temple house  Thursday morning  11 o clock   OUR masquerade last night was really charming  I never saw any thing equal to it out of London       Temple has taste  and had spared no expence to make it agreable  the decorations of the grand saloon were magnificent       Emily was the loveliest paisanne that ever was beheld  her dress  without losing sight of the character  was infinitely becoming  her beauty never appeared to such advantage       There was a noble simplicity in her air  which it is impossible to describe       The easy turn of her shape  the lovely roundness of her arm  the natural elegance of her whole form  the waving ringlets of her beautiful dark hair  carelessly fastened with a ribbon  the unaffected grace of her every motion  all together conveyed more strongly than imagination can paint  the pleasing idea of a wood nymph  deigning to visit some favored mortal       Colonel Willmott gazed on her with rapture  and asked me  if the rural deities had left their verdant abodes to visit Temple house       I introduced him to her  and left her to improve the impression   tis well I was married in time  a nabob is a dangerous rival       Lucy looked lovely  but in another style  she was a sultana in all the pride of imperial beauty  her charms awed  but Emily s invited  her look spoke resistless command  Emily s soft persuasion       There were many fine women  but I will own to you  I had  as to beauty  no eyes but for Emily       We are going this morning to see Burleigh  when we return  I shall announce Colonel Willmott to Emily  and introduce them properly to each other  they are to go in the same chaise  she at present only knows him as a friend of mine  and he her as his belle paisanne       Adieu  I am summoned   Your faithful  ED  RIVERS       I should have told you  I acquainted Colonel Willmott with my sister s marriage before I took him to Temple house  and found an opportunity of introducing him to Temple unobserved       Emily is the only one here to whom he is a stranger  I will caution him not to mention to her his past generous design in my favor  Adieu     LETTER CCXXIII   223   To Mrs  FITZGERALD   Temple house  Thursday morning   YOUR Emily was happy beyond words last night  amongst a crowd of beauties  her Rivers s eyes continually followed her  he seemed to see no other object  he would scarce let me wait till supper to unmask       But you will call me a foolish romantic girl  therefore I will only say  I had the delight to see him pleased with my dress  and charmed with the complaisance which was shewed me by others       There was a gentleman who came with Rivers  who was particularly attentive to me  he is not young  but extremely amiable  has a very fine person  with a commanding air  great politeness  and  as far as one can judge by a few hours conversation  an excellent understanding        I never in my life met with a man for whom I felt such a partiality at first sight  except Rivers  who tells me  I have made a conquest of his friend       He is to be my cavalier this morning to Burleigh       It has this moment struck me  that Rivers never introduced his friend and me to each other  but as masks  I never thought of this before  I suppose he forgot it in the hurry of the masquerade       I do not even know this agreable stranger s name  I only found out by his conversation he had served in the army       There is no saying how beautiful Lucy looked last night  her dress was rich  elegantly fancied  and particularly becoming to her graceful form  which I never saw look so graceful before       All who attempted to be fine figures  shrunk into nothing before her        Lucy carries her head  you know  remarkably well  which  with the advantage of her height  the perfect standard of women  her fine proportion  the native dignity of her air  the majestic flow of her robe  and the blaze of her diamonds  gave her a look of infinite superiority  a superiority which some of the company seemed to feel
