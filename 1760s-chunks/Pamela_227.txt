 generous allowance for my imperfections  which I could only assure him   should not be wilful ones  but his kind instructions  and that as often   as he observed any part of my conduct such as he could not entirely   approve  he would let me know it  and I would think his reproofs of   beginning faults the kindest and most affectionate things in the world   because they would keep me from committing greater  and be a means to   continue to me the blessing of his good opinion       He answered me in the kindest manner  and assured me  That nothing   should ever lie upon his mind which he would not reveal  and give me an   opportunity either of convincing him  or being convinced myself       He then asked me  When I should be willing to go to the Bedfordshire   house  I said  whenever he pleased  We will come down hither again   before the winter  said he  if you please  in order to cultivate the   acquaintance you have begun with Lady Jones  and Sir Simon s family    and  if it please God to spare us to one another  in the winter I will   give you  as I promised for two or three months  the diversions of   London  And I think  added he  if my dear pleases  we will set out next   week  about Tuesday  for t other house  I can have no objection  sir    said I  to any thing you propose  but how will you avoid Miss Darnford s   solicitation for an evening to dance  Why  said he  we can make Monday   evening do for that purpose  if they won t excuse us  But  if you   please  said he  I will invite Lady Jones  Mr  Peters and his family    and Sir Simon and his family  to my little chapel  on Sunday morning    and to stay dinner with me  and then I will declare my marriage to them    because my dear life shall not leave this country with the least reason   for a possibility of any body s doubting that it is so  O  how good   was this  But  indeed  his conduct is all of a piece  noble  kind  and   considerate  What a happy creature am I   And then  may be  said he    they will excuse us till we return into this country again  as to the   ball  Is there any thing  added he  that my beloved Pamela has still to   wish  If you have  freely speak       Hitherto  my dearest sir  replied I  you have not only prevented my   wishes  but my hopes  and even my thoughts  And yet I must own  since   your kind command of speaking my mind seems to shew  that you expect   from me I should say something  that I have only one or two things to   wish more  and then I shall be too happy  Say  said he  what they are    Sir  proceeded I  I am  indeed  ashamed to ask any thing  lest it should   not be agreeable to you  and lest it should look as if I was taking   advantage of your kind condescensions to me  and knew not when to be   satisfied       I will only tell you  Pamela  said he  that you are not to imagine    that these things  which I have done  in hopes of obliging you  are the   sudden impulses of a new passion for you  But  if I can answer for my   own mind  they proceed from a regular and uniform desire of obliging   you  which  I hope  will last as long as your merit lasts  and that  I   make no doubt  will be as long as I live  And I can the rather answer   for this  because I really find so much delight in myself in my present   way of thinking and acting  as infinitely overpays me  and which  for   that reason  I am likely to continue  for both our sakes  My beloved   wife  therefore  said he  for methinks I am grown fond of a name I once   despised  may venture to speak her mind  and I will promise  that  so   far as it is agreeable to me  and I cheerfully can  I will comply  and   you will not insist upon it  if that should not be the case       To be sure  sir  said I  I ought not  neither will I  And now you   embolden me to become an humble petitioner  and that  as I ought  upon   my knees  for the reinstating such of your servants  as I
