 She has taken great freedoms with me before Sir Charles    and they have all been at me  without mercy  and I was forced to be very   serious with them  or else they would have come up to have seen you    since I would not call you down   He kissed me  and said  I shall   quarrel with them  if I can t get them away  for I have lost two or   three precious hours with my soul s delight  And so he went down       Mrs  Jewkes asked me to walk down to dinner in the little parlour  I   went down  and she was so complaisant as to offer to wait upon me at   table  and would not be persuaded  without difficulty  to sit down   with me  But I insisted she should  For  said I  it would be very   extraordinary  if one should so soon go into such distance  Mrs    Jewkes   Whatever my new station may require of me  added I  I hope I   shall always conduct myself in such a manner  that pride and insolence   shall bear no part in my character       You are very good  madam  said she  but I will always know my duty to   my master s lady   Why then  replied I  if I must take state upon me so   early  Mrs  Jewkes  let me exact from you what you call your duty  and   sit down with me when I desire you       This prevailed upon her  and I made shift to get down a bit of   apple pye  and a little custard  but that was all       My good master came in again  and said  Well  thank my stars  these   rakes are going now  but I must set out with them  and I choose my   chariot  for if I took horse  I should have difficulty to part with   them  for they are like a snowball  and intend to gather company as they   go  to make a merry tour of it for some days together       We both got up  when he came in  Fie  Pamela  said he  why this ceremony   now   Sit still  Mrs  Jewkes   Nay  sir  said she  I was loath to sit   down  but my lady would have me   She is very right  Mrs  Jewkes  said   my master  and tapped me on the cheek  for we are but yet half married    and so she is not above half your lady yet   Don t look so down  don t   be so silent  my dearest  said he  why  you hardly spoke twenty words   to me all the time we were out together  Something I will allow for your   bashful sweetness  but not too much   Mrs  Jewkes  have you no pleasant   tales to tell my Pamela  to make her smile  till I return   Yes  sir    said she  I could tell twenty pleasant stories  but my lady is too nice   to hear them  and yet  I hope  I should not be shocking neither  Ah    poor woman  thought I  thy chastest stories will make a modest person   blush  if I know thee  and I desire to hear none of them       My master said  Tell her one of the shortest you have  in my hearing    Why  sir  said she  I knew a bashful young lady  as madam may be    married to  Dear Mrs  Jewkes  interrupted I  no more of your story  I   beseech you  I don t like the beginning of it  Go on  Mrs  Jewkes  said   my master  No  pray  sir  don t require it  said I  pray don t  Well    said he  then we ll have it another time  Mrs  Jewkes       Abraham coming in to tell him the gentlemen were going  and that his   chariot was ready  I am glad of that  said he  and went to them  and set   out with them       I took a turn in the garden with Mrs  Jewkes  after they were gone  And   having walked a while  I said  I should be glad of her company down the   elm walk  to meet the chariot  For  O  I know not how to look up at him    when he is with me  nor how to bear his absence  when I have reason to   expect him  What a strange contradiction there is in this unaccountable   passion       What a different aspect every thing
