for anything but their poundage when their plays happen to be received  It is all very well for a few nights  But only fancy a revival at the end of twenty years  and what a figure they will cut then  The audiences of the present day turn up their noses at the stock pieces of the last age  and it is a question whether their taste will fare better with their more critical descendants  If that conjecture be probable  the inventors of clap traps now will be the butt of cat calls hereafter  It is just the same with novel writers  and all other manufacturers of unnecessary literature  they strut and fret for an hour  and then are no more seen or heard of  The glories of successful authorship are the mere vapours of a murky atmosphere  meteors of a marsh  foul coruscations of a dunghill  cathedral tapers to put out the galaxy  blue flames of coarse paper held over a candle   Though these caricatures of rival renown were the mere creations of jealousy in the poet of the Asturias  it was not my business to correct his ill temper  I am delighted  said I  that wit and you have had so serious a quarrel  and that the diarrhoea of your inventive faculties has been cured by an astringent  You may depend on it  I will put you in the way of a good livelihood  without drawing deep upon your intellectual credit  So much she better  cried he  wit smells like carrion in my nostrils  or rather like a pungent and deleterious perfume  fragrant to the sense  but corrosive to the vitals  I heartily wish  my dear Fabricio  resumed I  that you may always keep in that mind  Only wash your hands completely of poetry  and you may depend on it  I will enable you to keep your head above water without picking or stealing  In the mean while  added I  slipping a purse of sixty pistoles into his hand  accept this as a slight instance of my regard   O friend like the friends in days of yore  cried the son of barber Nunez  out of his wits with joy and gratitude  it was heaven itself which sent you into this hospital  whence your goodness is now discharging me  Before we parted  I gave him my address  and invited him to come and see me as soon as his health would permit  He opened his eyes as an oyster does its shell  when I told him that I lodged under the minister s roof  O illustrious Gil Blas  said he  great as Pompey and fortunate as Sylla  whose lot it is to be hand in glove with the dictators of modern times  I rejoice most disinterestedly in your good fortune  because it is so very evident what a noble use you make of it       CH  VIII     Gil Blas gets forward progressively in his master s affections  Scipio s return to Madrid  and account of his journey   THE Count of Olivarez  whom I shall henceforward call my lord duke  because the king was pleased to confer that dignity on him about this time  was infested with a weakness which I did not suffer to pass without taking toll  it was a furious desire of being beloved  The moment he fancied that any one really liked him  his heart was caught in a trap  This was not lost upon my keen sense of character  It was not enough to do precisely as he ordered  I superadded a zeal in the execution which made him mine  I laid myself out to his liking in everything  and provided beforehand for his most eccentric wishes   By conduct like this  which almost always answers  I became by degrees my master s favourite  and he  on the other hand  as if he had got round to my blind side also  wormed himself into my affections  by giving me his own  So forward did I get into his good graces  as to halve his confidence with Signor Carnero  his principal secretary   Carnero had played my game  and that so successfully  as to be intrusted with the greater mysteries  We two therefore were the keepers of the prime minister s conscience  and held the keys of all his secrets  with this difference  that Carnero was consulted on state affairs  myself about his private concerns  dividing the business into two separate departments  and we were each of us equally pleased with our own  We lived together without jealousy  and certainly without attachment  I had every reason to be satisfied with my quarters  where continual intercourse gave me an opportunity of prying into the duke s inmost soul  which was a masked battery to all mankind beside  but plain as a pikestaff to me  when he no longer questioned the sincerity of my attachment to hint   Santillane  said he one day  you were witness to the Duke of Lerma s possession of an authority  more like that of an absolute monarch than a favourite minister  and yet I am still happier than he was at the very summit of his good fortune  He had two formidable enemies in his own son  the Duke of Uzeda  and in the confessor of Philip the Third  but there
