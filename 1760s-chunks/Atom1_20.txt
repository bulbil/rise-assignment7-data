which flowed from him in a pleasing tide of elocution  He    107 had withal the art of soothing  wheedling  insinuating  and misrepresenting with such a degree of plausibility  that his talents were admired even by the few who had sense enough to detect his sophistry  He had no idea of principle  and no feeling of humanity  He had renounced the maxims of his family  after having turned them to the best account by execrating the rites of Fakkubasi or the White Horse  in private among malcontents  while he worshipped him in public with the appearance of enthusiastic devotion  When detected in this double dealing  he fairly owned to the Cuboy  that he cursed the White Horse in private for his private interest  but that he served him in public from inclination   The Cuboy had just sense enough to perceive that he would always be true to his own interest  and therefore he made it his interest to serve the m—y to the full extent of his    108 faculties  Accordingly Mura clami fought a good battle with orator Taycho  in the occasional assemblies of the populace  But as it is much more easy to inflame than to allay  to accuse than to acquit  to asperse than to purify  to unveil truth than to varnish falshood  in a word  to patronize a good cause than to support a bad one  the majesty of the mob snuffed up the excrementitious salts of Taycho s invectives  until their jugulars ached  while they rejected with signs of loathing the flowers of Mura clami s elocution  just as a citizen of Edinburgh stops his nose when he passes by the shop of a perfumer   While the constitution of human nature remains unchanged  satire will be always better received than panegyric  in those popular harangues  The Athenians and Romans were better pleased with the Philippics of Demosthenes and Tully     109 than they would have been with all the praise those two orators could have culled from the stores of their eloquence  A man feels a secret satisfaction in seeing his neighbour treated as a rascal  If he be a knave himself   which ten to one is the case  he rejoices to see a character brought down to the level of his own  and a new member added to his society  if he be one degree removed from actual roguery   which is the case with nine tenths of those who enjoy the reputation of virtue  he indulges himself with the Pharisaical consolation  of thanking God he is not like that publican   But  to return from this digression  Mura clami  though he could not with all his talents maintain any sort of competition with Taycho  in the opinion of the mob  he  nevertheless  took a more effectual method to weaken the force of his opposition  He pointed out to    110 Fika kaka the proper means for amending the errors of his administration  he proposed measures for prosecuting the war with vigour  he projected plans of conquest in Fatsissio  recommended active officers  forwarded expeditions  and infused such a spirit into the councils of Japan  as had not before appeared for some centuries   But his patron was precluded from the benefit of these measures  by the obstinate prejudice and precipitation of the Dairo  who valued his Yessian farm above all the empire of Japan  This precious morsel of inheritance bordered upon the territories of a Tartar chief called Brut an tiffi  a famous freebooter  who had inured his Kurd to bloodshed  and enriched himself with rapine  Of all mankind  he hated most the Dairo  tho  his kinsman  and sought a pretence for seizing the farm  which in three days he could have made his own     111 The Dairo Gothama baba was not ignorant of his sentiments  He trembled for his cabin when he considered its situation between hawk and buzzard  exposed on one side to the talons of Brut an tiffi  and open on the other to the incursions of the Chinese  under whose auspices the said Brut an tiffi had acted formerly as a zealous partizan  He had  indeed  in a former quarrel exerted himself with such activity and rancour  to thwart the politics of the Dairo  and accumulate expences on the subjects of Niphon  that he was universally detested through the whole empire of Japan as a lawless robber  deaf to every suggestion of humanity  respecting no law  restricted by no treaty  scoffing at all religion  goaded by ambition  instigated by cruelty  and attended by rapine   In order to protect the farm from such a dangerous neighbour  Gothama baba  by an effort of sagacity peculiar    112 to himself  granted a large subsidy from the treasury of Japan  to a remote nation of Mantchoux Tartars  on condition that they should march to the assistance of his farm  whenever it should be attacked  With the same sanity of foresight  the Dutch might engage in a defensive league with the Ottoman Porte  to screen them from the attempts of the most Christian king  who is already on their frontiers  Brut an tiffi knew his advantage  and was resolved to enjoy it  He had formed a plan of usurpation  which could not be executed without considerable sums of money  He gave the Dairo to understand  he was perfectly
