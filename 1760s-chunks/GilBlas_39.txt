evident I should pay my way liberally  for he discovered something of nobility through my disguise  and had no doubt but I was a gentle man in very easy circumstances  I saw plainly that the rascal was laughing at me  and  to stop his humour before it became too convulsive  gave him a little insight into the state of my purse  I went so far as to count over my ducats on a table before him  and perceived my coin to have inclined him to a more respectful judgment  I begged the favour of him to send for a tailor  A broker would be better  said he  he will bring all sorts of apparel  and you will be dressed up out of hand  I approved of this advice  and determined to follow it  but  as the day was on the point of closing  I put off my purchase till the morrow  and thought only of getting a good supper  to make amends for the miserable fare I had taken up with since my escape from the forest       CH  XV     Gil Blas dresses himself to more advantage  and receives a second present from the lady  His equipage on setting out from Burgos   THEY served me up a plentiful fricassee of sheep s trotters  almost the whole of which I demolished  My drinking kept pace with my eating  and when I could stuff no longer  I went to bed  I lay comfortably enough  and was in hopes that a sound sleep would have the kindness without delay to commit a friendly invasion on my senses  But I could not close an eye for ruminating on the dress I should choose  What shall I do  thought I  Shall I follow my first plan  Shall I buy a short cassock  and go to Salamanca to set up for a tutor  Why should I adopt the costume of a licentiate  For the purpose of going into orders  Do I feel an inward call  No  If I have any call  it is quite the contrary way  I had rather wear a sword than an apron  and push my fortune in this world  before I think of the next   I made up my mind to take on myself the appearance of a gentleman  Waiting for the day with the greatest impatience  its first dawn no sooner greeted my eyes  than I got up  I made such an uproar in the inn  as to wake the most inveterate sleeper  and called the servants out of bed  who returned my salute with a volley of curses  But they found themselves under a necessity of stirring  and I let them have no rest till they had sent for a broker  The gentleman soon made his appearance  followed by two lads  each lugging in a great bundle of green cloth  He accosted me very civilly  to the following effect  Honoured sir  you are a happy man to have been recommended to me rather than any one else  I do not mean to give my brethren an ill word  God forbid I should offer the slightest injury to their reputation  They have none to spare  But  between ourselves  there is not one of them that has any bowels  they are more extortionate than the Israelites  There is not a broker but myself that has any moral sense  I keep within the bounds of a reasonable profit  I am satisfied with a pound in the penny     no  no     that is wrong     with a penny in the pound  Thanks to heaven  I get forward fair and softly in the world   The broker  after this preface  which I  like a fool  took for chapter and verse  told his journeymen to undo their bundles  They showed me suits of every colour in the rainbow  and exposed to sale a great choice of plain cloths  These I threw aside with contempt  as thinking them too undrest  but they made me try on one which fitted me as well as if I had been measured for it  and just hit my fancy  though it was a little the worse for wear  It was a doublet with slashed sleeves  with breeches and a cloak  the whole of blue velvet with a gold embroidery  I felt a little hankering after this particular article  and attempted to beat down the price  The broker  who saw my inclination  told me I had a very correct taste  By all that is sacred  exclaimed he  it is plain you are no younker  Take this with you  That dress was made for one of the first nobility in the kingdom  and has not been on his back three times  Look at the velvet  feel it  nothing can be richer or of a better colour  and for the embroidery  come now  tell truth  did you ever see better workmanship  What is the price of it  said I  Only sixty ducats  replied he  I have refused the money  or else I am a liar  The alternative could not fail in one proposition or the other  I bid five and forty  two or three and twenty would have been nearer the mark  My worthy
