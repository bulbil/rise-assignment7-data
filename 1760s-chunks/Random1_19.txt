which I succeeded beyond my own expectation —I was on very good terms with my master s wife  whose esteem I acquired and cultivated  by representing Mrs  Potion in the most ridiculous lights my satirical talents could invent  as well as by rendering her some   45 christian offices  when she had been too familiar with the dram bottle  to which she had often times recourse for consolation  under the affliction she suffered from a barbarous husband —In this manner I lived  without hearing the least tidings of my uncle  for the space of two years  during which time I kept little or no company  being neither in a humour to relish  nor in a capacity to maintain much acquaintance  for the Nabal my master allowed me no wages  and the small perquisites of my station scarce supplied me with the common necessaries of life —I was no longer  a pert  unthinking coxcomb  giddy with popular applause  and elevated with the extravagance of hope  my misfortunes had taught me how little the caresses of the world during a man s prosperity  are to be valued by him  and how seriously and expeditiously he ought to set himself about making himself independent of them  My present appearance  therefore  was the least of my care  which was wholly engrossed in laying up a stock of instruction that might secure me against the caprice of fortune for the future  I became such a sloven  and contracted such an air of austerity  that every body pronounced me crest fallen  and Gawky returned to town without running any risk from my resentment  which was by this time pretty much cooled  and restrained by prudential reasons  so effectually  that I never so much as thought of obtaining satisfaction for the injuries he had done me —When I deemed myself sufficiently master of my business  I began to cast about for an opportunity of launching into the world  in hopes of finding some provision  that might make amends for the difficulties I had undergone  but  as this could   46 not be effected without a small sum of money to equip me for the field  I was in the utmost perplexity how to raise it  well knowing  that Crab  for his own sake  would never put me in a condition to leave him  when his interest was so much concerned in my stay —But a small accident  which happened about this time  determined him in my favour  This was no other than the pregnancy of his maid servant  who declared her situation to me  assuring me at the same time  that I was the occasion of it  Although I had no reason to question the truth of this imputation  I was not ignorant of the familiarities which had passed between her master and her  of which availing myself  I represented to her the folly of laying the burthen at my door  when she might dispose of it to much greater advantage with Mr  Crab  She listened to my advice  and next day acquainted him with the pretended success of their mutual endeavour —He was far from being over joyed at this proof of his vigour  which he foresaw might have very troublesome consequences  not that he dreaded any domestic grumblings and reproaches from his wife  whom he kept in perfect subjection  but because he knew it would furnish his rival Potion with a handle for insulting and undermining his reputation  there being no scandal equal to that of uncleanness  in the opinion of those who inhabit that part of the island where he lived —He therefore took a resolution worthy of himself  which was  to persuade the girl  that she was not with child  but only afflicted with a disorder incident to young women  which he could easily remove  with this view  as he pretended  he prescribed for her such medicines  as he thought   47 would infallibly procure abortion  but in this he was disappointed  for the maid being advertised by me of his design  and at the same time well satisfied with her own condition  absolutely refused to follow his directions  and threatned to publish her situation to the world  if he did not immediately take some method of providing for the important occasion  which she expected in a few months —It was not long before I guessed the result of his deliberation  by his addressing himself to me  one day  in this manner    I am surprised  that a young fellow like you  discovers no inclination to push his fortune in the world —By G—d  before I was of your age  I was broiling on the coast of Guinea —Damme  what s to hinder you from profiting by the war  which will certainly be declared in a short time against Spain —You may easily get on board of a king s ship in quality of a surgeon s mate  where you will certainly see a great deal of practice  and stand a good chance of getting prize money  —  I laid hold of this declaration  which I had long wished for  and assured him I would follow his advice with pleasure  if it was in my power  but that it was impossible for me  to embrace an opportunity of that kind  having no friend to advance a little money  to supply me with what necessaries I should want  and defray the
