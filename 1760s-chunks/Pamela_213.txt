  shew me   I cannot forgive myself  For  oh  if I know the least of   this idle foolish heart of mine  it has not a misgiving thought of   your goodness  and I should abhor it  if it were capable of the least   affectation   But  dear good sir  leave me a little to myself  and I   will take myself to a severer task than your goodness will let you do   and I will present my heart before you  a worthier offering to you  than   at present its wayward follies will let it seem to be   But one thing   is  one has no kind friend of one s own sex  to communicate one s   foolish thoughts to  and to be strengthened by their comfortings  But I   am left to myself  and  oh  what a weak silly thing I am       He kindly withdrew  to give me time to recollect myself  and in about   half an hour returned  and then  that he might not begin at once upon   the subject  and say  at the same time  something agreeable to me  said    Your father and mother have had a great deal of talk by this time about   you  Pamela  O  sir  returned I  your goodness has made them quite   happy  But I can t help being concerned about Lady Davers       He said  I am vexed I did not hear the footman out  because it runs in   my head he talked somewhat about her coming hither  She will meet with   but an indifferent reception from me  unless she comes resolved to   behave better than she writes       Pray  sir  said I  be pleased to bear with my good lady  for two   reasons  What are they  said he  Why  first  sir  answered I  because   she is your sister  and  to be sure  may very well think  what all the   world will  that you have much undervalued yourself in making me happy    And next  because  if her ladyship finds you out of temper with her  it   will still aggravate her more against me  and every time that any warm   words you may have between you  come into her mind  she will disdain me   more       Don t concern yourself about it  said he  for we have more proud ladies   than she in our other neighbourhood  who  perhaps  have still less   reason to be punctilious about their descent  and yet will form   themselves upon her example  and say  Why  his own sister will not   forgive him  nor visit him  And so  if I can subdue her spirit  which is   more than her husband ever could  or indeed any body else  it is a great   point gained  And  if she gives me reason  I ll try for it  I assure   you       Well  but  my dear girl  continued he  since the subject is so   important  may I not say one word about to morrow   Sir  said I  I hope   I shall be less a fool  I have talked as harshly to my heart  as Lady   Davers can do  and the naughty thing suggests to me a better  and more   grateful behaviour       He smiled  and  kissing me  said  I took notice  Pamela  of what you   observed  that you have none of your own sex with you  I think it is a   little hard upon you  and I should have liked you should have had Miss   Darnford  but then her sister must have been asked  and I might as well   make a public wedding  which  you know  would have required clothes and   other preparations  Besides  added he  a foolish proposal was once made   me of that second sister  who has two or three thousand pounds more than   the other  left her by a godmother  and she can t help being a little   piqued  though  said he  it was a proposal they could not expect should   succeed  for there is nothing in her person nor mind  and her fortune    as that must have been the only inducement  would not do by any means    and so I discouraged it at once       I am thinking  sir  said I  of another mortifying thing too  that were   you to marry a lady of birth and fortune answerable to your own  all   the eve to the day would be taken up in reading  signing  and sealing of   settlements  and portion  and such like  But now the poor Pamela brings   you nothing at
