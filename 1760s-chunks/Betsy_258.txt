dear   pursued she  after a pause  finding  by Miss   Betsy s countenance  that what she had said on this score had stung her   to the quick   I would not have you deprive yourself of those pleasures   of life which are becoming your sex  your age  and character  there is   no necessity that  because you are a wife  you should become a mope  I   only recommend a proper medium in these things        Her ladyship was going on  when Miss Betsy s servants  whom she had   ordered to bring such part of her baggage as she thought would be   needful while she staid in that place  came with it into the chamber  on   which this kind adviser told her fair friend that she would refer what   she had farther to say on these subjects till another opportunity       Miss Betsy replied  that she would treasure up in her heart all the   admonitions she should at any time be pleased to give her  and that she   hoped her future conduct would demonstrate that no part of what her   ladyship had said was lost upon her       With these words they returned into the dining room  and the close of   day soon after coming on  Sir Ralph and his lady  with the two Mr    Thoughtlesses  took leave of the bride and bridegroom  and came back to   town                CHAPTER V       Seems to demand  for more reasons than one  a greater share of   attention than ordinary  in the perusal of it          The fair wife of Mr  Munden  Miss Betsy now no more  had promised   nothing at the altar that she was not resolved religiously to perform    she began seriously to consider on the duties of her place  she was   ignorant of no part of them  and soon became fully convinced that on a   strict observation of them depended her honour  her reputation  her   peace of mind  and  in fine  all that was dear to a woman of virtue and   understanding       To give the more weight to these reflections  she also called to her   mind the long perseverance of Mr  Munden  his constant assiduities to   please her  his patient submitting to all the little caprices of her   humour  and establishing in herself an assured belief of the ardour and   sincerity of his affection to her  her gratitude  her good nature  and   good sense  much more than compensated for the want of inclination  and   without any of those languishments  those violent emotions  which bear   the name of love  rendered her capable of giving more real and more   valuable proofs of that passion than are sometimes to be found among   those who profess themselves  and are looked upon by the world  as the   most fond wives       In spite of her endeavours  the thoughts of Mr  Trueworth would    however  sometimes come into her mind  but she repelled them with all   her might  and as the merits of that gentleman would  in reality  admit   of no comparison with any thing that Mr  Munden had to boast of  she   laboured to overbalance the perfections of the one  by that tender and   passionate affection with which she flattered herself she now was  and   always would be  regarded by the other       Thus happily disposed to make the bonds she had entered into easy to   herself  and perfectly agreeable to the person with whom she was   engaged  he had  indeed  a treasure in her beyond what he could ever   have imagined  or her friends  from her former behaviour  had any reason   to have expected  and  had he been truly sensible of the value of the   jewel he possessed  he would have certainly been compleatly blessed  but   happiness is not in the power of every one to enjoy  though Heaven and   fortune deny nothing to their wishes  But of this hereafter       At present  all was joy and transport on the side of the bridegroom  all   complaisance and sweetness on that of the bride  Their whole deportment   to each other was such as gave the most promising expectations of a   lasting harmony between them  and gladdened the hearts of as many as saw   it  and interested themselves in the felicity of either of them       They continued but a few days in the retirement which had been made   choice of for the consummation of their nuptials  Mr  Munden was   naturally gay  loved company  and all the modish diversions of the   times  and his wife  who
