Well  Horatio  said she  what do you think of the little   French epigram I put into your hands yesterday   has it not a very   agreeable point       Horatio had such an aversion to all kind of deceit  that even here    where it was so necessary  he could not  without some hesitation  answer   to what she said in these words   Some accident or other  cried he    deprived me of the pleasure you were so good to intend me  for when I   put my hand in my pocket thinking to read it  I perceived I was so   unhappy as to have lost  it   I looked for it in vain   it was   irrecoverably gone  and I am an utter stranger to the contents       And ever shall be so  replied she tartly  only to punish your   carelessness of a lady s favour  know  that it was a piece of wit which   would have been highly agreeable to you   but don t expect I shall take   the pains to write it over again  or even tell you the subject on which   it turned       Horatio cooly said  he could not but confess he had been to blame  and   must therefore allow the justice of her proceeding  As none present   besides himself  his bedfellow  and Mullern  knew the truth of this   affair  what passed between them was taken by the others as literally   spoken  and little suspected to couch the mystery it really did       Mullern  after this  by the assistance of Horatio and the old officer    had frequent opportunities of gratifying his own and the amorous   Mattakesa s desires   The testimonies she gave him how well she was   pleased with his conversation  were for the common good of his   companions   Horatio was easy in finding himself out of all danger of   any solicitations he was determined never to acquiesce in  and those   three who were in the secret passed their time pleasantly enough    whenever they had an opportunity of talking on this adventure  without   any of the others being witnesses of what they said             CHAP  XXI        The prisoners expectations raised  a terrible disappointment  some of   the chief carried to prince Menzikoff s palace  their usage there    Horatio set at liberty  and the occasion        Our captives had soon after a new matter of rejoicing  a Polander in the   service of Muscovy  who had been taken prisoner by the Swedes  and was   discharged and sent home  with a great number of others  by the   unparallell d generosity of Charles XII  was one of the guards who now   did duty in the prison  It was often his turn to bring them their poor   allowance of provision  and having some pity for their condition  as   well as gratitude for a people who had used him and his companions in a   different manner  told them  that they might be of good heart  for  said   he  you will soon be set at liberty   our emperor has enough to do to   keep his ground in Ukraina  Charles is as victorious as ever   the   prince of the Cosaques  one of the bravest men on earth  next to   himself  has entered into an alliance with him   king Stanislaus is   sending him succours from Poland   a powerful reinforcement is coming to   him from Lithuania  and when these armies are joined  as I believe they   already are  nothing can withstand them   you will hear the Swedish   march beat from this prison walls   and perhaps see your present   conquerors change places with you  and  to confirm the truth of what I   say  continued he  I can further assure you that the czar  before I left   the camp  was in the utmost confusion   his council  as well as army    were at a stand  and he had twice made overtures of peace  and   been refused       This was an intelligence which might well be transporting to the king of   Sweden s officers   the thought  of seeing him enter Petersburgh a   conqueror   of once more embracing their old friends and companions  and   of triumphing over those who had so cruelly abused the power the chance   of war had put into their hands  made them all  in their turns  hug and   bless the kind informer   they also asked him several questions   concerning the generals  and each being more particular concerning those   they had the greatest interest in  received from this honest soldier all   the satisfaction they could desire
