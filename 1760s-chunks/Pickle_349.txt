 however  he absolutely rejected  not only on account of his  having already bestowed it upon Hatchway during the term of his natural  life  but also with a view of retaining some memorial of the commodore s  generosity  He proposed  therefore  to finish in this retreat the  translation which he had undertaken  and earn his future subsistence by  labour of the same kind  He desired Cadwallader to take charge of his  movables  and send to him such linen and clothes as he should have  occasion for in his confinement  But  among all his difficulties   nothing embarrassed him so much as his faithful Pipes  whom he could no  longer entertain in his service  He knew Tom had made shift to pick up    6 22 15  3 45 PM   a competency in the course of his ministration  but that reflection   though it in some measure alleviated  could not wholly prevent the  mortification he should suffer in parting with an affectionate adherent   who was by this time become as necessary to him as one of his own  members  and who was so accustomed to live under his command and  protection  that he did not believe the fellow could reconcile himself  to any other way of life   Crabtree  in order to make him easy on that score  offered to adopt him  in the room of his own valet  whom he would dismiss  though he observed   that Pipes had been quite spoiled in our hero s service  But Peregrine  did not choose to lay his friend under that inconvenience  knowing that  his present lacquey understood and complied with all the peculiarities  of his humour  which Pipes would never be able to study or regard  he  therefore determined to send him back to his shipmate Hatchway   with whom he had spent the fore part of his life  These points being  adjusted  the two friends adjourned to the coffee house  with a view of  inquiring into the character of the clergyman to whose beneficence our  adventurer was so much indebted  They learned he was a person who had  incurred the displeasure of the bishop in whose diocese he was settled   and  being unequal in power to his antagonist  had been driven to the  Fleet  in consequence of his obstinate opposition  though he still  found means to enjoy a pretty considerable income  by certain irregular  practices in the way of his function  which income was chiefly consumed  in acts of humanity to his fellow creatures in distress   His eulogium was scarce finished  when he entered the room  according to  appointment with Peregrine  who ordering wine and something for supper  to be carried to his apartment  the triumvirate went thither  and  Cadwallader taking his leave for the night  the two fellow prisoners  passed the evening very sociably  our hero being entertained by his new  companion with a private history of the place  some particulars of which  were extremely curious  He told him  that the person who attended them  at supper  bowing with the most abject servility  and worshipping them  every time he opened his mouth  with the epithets of your lordship and  your honour  had  a few years before  been actually a captain in  the guards  who  after having run his career in the great world  had  threaded every station in their community  from that of a buck of  the first order  who swaggers about the Fleet in a laced coat  with a  footman and w    to the degree of a tapster  in which he was now  happily settled   If you will take the trouble of going into the cook s  kitchen   said he   you will perceive a beau metamorphosed into a  turnspit  and there are some hewers of wood and drawers of water in  this microcosm who have had forests and fishponds of their own  Yet   notwithstanding such a miserable reverse of fortune  they are neither  objects of regard nor compassion  because their misfortunes are the  fruits of the most vicious extravagance  and they are absolutely  insensible of the misery which is their lot  Those of our  fellow sufferers  who have been reduced by undeserved losses  or the  precipitation of inexperienced youth  never fail to meet with the most  brotherly assistance  provided they behave with decorum  and a due  sense of their unhappy circumstances  Nor are we destitute of power to  chastise the licentious  who refuse to comply with the regulations  of the place  and disturb the peace of the community with riot and  disorder  Justice is here impartially administered by a court of equity   consisting of a select number of the most respectable inhabitants  who  punish all offenders with equal judgment and resolution  after they have    6 22 15  3 45 PM   been fairly convicted of the crimes laid to their charge    The clergyman having thus explained the economy of the place  as well as  the cause of his own confinement  began to discover signs of curiosity  touching our hero s situation  and Pickle  thinking he could do no
