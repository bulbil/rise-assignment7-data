the Hollander was a Jew  than he entered into an investigation  of the Hebrew tongue  in which he was a connoisseur  and the doctor at  the same time attacked the mendicant on the ridiculous maxims of his  order  together with the impositions of priestcraft in general  which   he observed  prevailed so much among those who profess the Roman  Catholic religion   Thus coupled  each committee enjoyed their own conversation apart   without any danger of encroachment  and all were so intent upon their  several topics  that they scarce allowed themselves a small interval  in viewing the desolation of Menin  as they passed through that ruined  frontier  About twelve o clock they arrived at Courtray  where the  horses are always changed  and the company halt an hour for refreshment   Here Peregrine handed his charmer into an apartment  where she was  joined by the other lady  and on pretence of seeing some of the churches  in town  put himself under the direction of the Capuchin  from whom he  learned that the lady was wife to a French gentleman  to whom she had  been married about a year  and that she was now on her journey to visit  her mother  who lived in Brussels  and was at that time laboured under a  lingering distemper  which  in all probability  would soon put a period  to her life  He then launched out in praise of her daughter s virtue  and conjugal affection  and  lastly  told him  that he was her  father confessor  and pitched upon to be her conductor through Flanders   by her husband  as well as his wife  placed the utmost confidence in his  prudence and integrity   Pickle easily comprehended the meaning of this insinuation  and took  the hint accordingly  He tickled the priest s vanity with extraordinary  encomiums upon the disinterested principles of his order  which were  detached from all worldly pursuits  and altogether devoted to the  eternal salvation of mankind  He applauded their patience  humility  and  learning  and lavished a world of praise upon their talent in preaching     6 22 15  3 45 PM   which  he said  had more than once operated so powerfully upon him  that  had he not been restrained by certain considerations which he could  not possibly waive  he should have embraced their tenets  and begged  admission into their fraternity  but  as the circumstances of his fate  would not permit him to take such a salutary measure for the present   he entreated the good father to accept a small token of his love and  respect  for the benefit of that convent to which he belonged  So  saying he pulled out a purse of ten guineas  which the Capuchin  observing  turned his head another way  and  lifting up his arm   displayed a pocket almost as high as his collar bone  in which he  deposited the money   This proof of affection for the order produced a sudden and surprising  effect upon the friar  In the transport of his zeal he wrung this  semi convert s hand  showered a thousand benedictions upon his head  and  exhorted him  with the tears flowing from his eyes  to perfect the great  work which the finger of God had begun in his heart  and  as an instance  of his concern for the welfare of his precious soul  the holy brother  promised to recommend him strenuously to the pious admonitions of the  young woman under his care  who was a perfect saint upon earth  and  endowed with a peculiar gift of mollifying the hearts of obdurate  sinners   O father   cried the hypocritical projector  who by this time  perceived that his money was not thrown away   if I could be favoured  but for one half hour with the private instruction of that inspired  devotee  my mind presages  that I should be a strayed sheep brought  back into the fold  and that I should find easy entrance at the gates of  heaven  There is something supernatural in her aspect  I gaze upon her  with the most pious fervour  and my whole soul is agitated with tumults  of hope and despair    Having pronounced this rhapsody with transport half natural and half  affected  the priest assured him  that these were the operations of the  Spirit  which must not be repressed  and comforted him with the hope of  enjoying the blessed interview which he desired  protesting  that  as  far as his influence extended  his wish should be that very evening  indulged  The gracious pupil thanked him for his benevolent concern   which he swore should not be squandered upon an ungrateful object  and  the rest of the company interrupting the conversation  they returned in  a body to the inn  where they dined all together  and the ladies were  persuaded to be our hero s guests   As the subjects on which they had been engaged before dinner were not  exhausted  each brace resumed their former theme when they were replaced  in the diligence  The painter s mistress finished her conquest  by  exerting her
