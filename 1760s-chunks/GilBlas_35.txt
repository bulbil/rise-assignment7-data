At every handful of pistoles  what little eyes did I see them make  The corregidor was absolutely out of his wits  It was the best stroke within the memory of justice  My pretty lad  said his Worship with a softened tone  we only do our duty  but do not you tremble for your bones before the time  you will not be broken on the wheel if you do not deserve it  These blood suckers were emptying my pockets all the time with their cursed palaver  and took from me what their betters of the shades below had the decency to leave     my uncle s forty ducats  They stuck at nothing  Their staunch fingers  with slow but certain scent  routed me out from top to toe  they whisked me round and round  and stripped me even to the shame of modesty  for fear some sneaking portrait of the king should slink between my shirt and skin  When they could sift me no further  the corregidor thought it time to begin his examination  I told a plain tale  My deposition was taken down  and the sequel was  that he carried in his train his bloodhounds  and my little property  leaving me to toss without a rag upon a beggarly wisp of straw   Oh the miseries of human life  groaned I  when I found myself in this merciless and solitary condition  Our adventures here are whimsical  and out of all time and tune  From my first outset from Oviedo  I had got into a pleasant round of difficulties  hardly had I worked myself out of one danger  before I soused into another  Coming into town here  how could I expect the honour of the corregidor s acquaintance  While thus communing with my own thoughts  I got once more into the cursed doublet and the rest of the paraphernalia which had got me into such a scrape  then plucking up a little courage  never mind  Gil Blas  thought I  do not be chicken hearted  What is a prison above  ground  after so brimstone a snuffle as thou hast had of the regions below  But  alas  I hallo before I am out of the wood  I am in more experienced hands than those of Leonarda and Domingo  My key will not open this grate  I might well say so  for a prisoner without money is like a bird with its wings clipt  one must be in full feather to flutter out of distance from these gaol birds   But we left a partridge and a young rabbit on the spit  How they got off I know not  but my supper was a bit of sallow  complexioned bread  with a pitcher of water to render it amenable to mastication  and thus was I destined to bite the bridle in my dungeon  A fortnight was pretty well without seeing a soul but my keeper  who had orders that I should want for nothing in the bread and water way  Whenever he made his appearance I was inclined to be sociable  and to parley a little to get rid of the blue devils  but this majestic minister was above reply  he was mum  he scarcely trusted his eyes but to see that I did not slip by him  On the sixteenth day  the corregidor strutted in to this tune    You are a lucky fellow  I have news for you  The lady is packed off for Burgos  She came under my examination before her departure  and her answers went to your exculpation  You will be at large this very day if your carrier from Pegnaflor to Cacabelos agrees in the same tale  He is now in Astorga  I have sent for him  and expect him here  if he confirms the story of the torture  you are your own master   At these words I was ready to jump out of my skin for joy  The business was settled  I thanked the magistrate for the abridgment of justice with which he had deigned to favour me  and was getting to the fag end of my compliment  when the muleteer arrived  with an attendant before and behind  I knew the fellow s face  but he  having as a matter of course sold my cloak bag with the contents  from a deep rooted affection to the money which the sale had brought  swore lustily that he had no acquaintance with me  and had never seen me in the whole course of his life  Oh  you villain  exclaimed I  go down on your knees and own that you have sold my clothes  Prythee  have some regard to truth  Look in my face  am not I one of those shallow young fellows whom you had the wit to threaten with the rack in the corporate town of Cacabelos  The muleteer turned upon his toe  and protested he had not the honour of my acquaintance  As he persisted in his disavowal  I was recommitted for further examination  Patience once more  It was only reducing feasts and fasts to the level of bread and water  and regaling the only sense I had the means of using with the sight of my tongue tied warden  But when I reflected how little innocence would avail to extricate me from the clutches of the law  the thought was death  I panted for
