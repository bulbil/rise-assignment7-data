 she did not think perhaps that things were quite so bad with me as they really were  but if she heard  which by the way I knew was an invention of her own  that my mother left any thing behind her  she was deceived  there really was nothing  But let us call another subject —When did you hear from Mr Faulkland  It is some time since I have had a letter from his lady   His lady he repeated  and stamping with his foot  cursed be hour which gave her that title   Dear Sir George  you shock me  how can you be so uncharitable  so unchristian   If you know her as well as I do  said he—and shook his head   You are so strong in your indignation against her  I replied  that you almost make me suspect that you do know more of her than I do  her weakness in regard to Mr Faulkland excepted  I could never entertain an ill thought of her  but you have raised a curiosity  which  though I tremble to have it gratified  yet I must beg you to speak out   Do not think me malicious  Sidney  said he  a woman’s reputation is too sacred a thing to be trifled with  if her weakness  as you call it  had been confined to Mr Faulkland  hers should be so with me  but I cannot think with temper on the sacrifice that noble fellow has been forced to make to caprice   Dear brother  explain yourself  you terrify me   My heat on this occasion  he answered  would be unjustifiable  if I had not proof for what I say  Miss Burchell  for I will not call her by my friend’s name  is that monster  a female libertine  a rake in the worst sense of the word   Monstrous  cried I  your prejudice makes you believe every cruel tale you may have heard — Heard  he interrupted with an indignant smile  the d—l’s in it if I have not more than hear say for my knowledge   Lord  brother  you make me shudder  what do you mean   He replied  you will not believe me perhaps when I tell you that I am as much obliged to Miss Burchell’s favour  as Mr Faulkland was   If Sir George had plunged a dagger in my heart  I could not have felt a sharper pang  He saw me struck with amazement and grief     I knew it would shock you  said he  but you extorted the secret from me  for a secret it has  and ever should have remained  but in my own justification you compelled me to disclose it   You know  said he  that from the first I never considered Faulkland’s engagement to her  as a serious one  nor in any shape binding  this judgment I formed without knowing any thing of the woman  but from Faulkland’s own representation of the fact  tho’ to say the truth  he always spoke of her with more tenderness than she deserved  and imputing her frailty to her love of him  was  as most men are apt to do on such occasions  disposed to judge favourably of her  The first time I saw her was at Sidney castle  that time when my mother invited her  and when  you may remember  I went down there in compliment to my mother  I own I thought her extremely agreeable  which was alone sufficient  to make me a little more than barely polite  but my mother’s extraordinary attachment to her  engaged me to go still farther  and to oblige her  I was more than ordinarily attentive to please Miss Burchell  When I assure you upon my honour that I had no farther views  I believe you will not doubt my veracity  but whether Miss Burchell mistook my civilities for fondness  or whether  as I rather believe  her natural disposition was so loose that every man she saw lighted up a flame in her heart  I know not  but certain it was  she made me such advances that I must have been extremely stupid not to have understood her  and absolutely frozen to have repelled her   My good mother’s unsuspecting temper permitted us too many opportunities  and the light ones of your sex do not easily forgive the neglect of those   In short Miss Burchell yielded to the impetuosity of her wishes  and I followed her lead  more through vacancy  and a want of better employment  than out of inclination  I was very glad when she was recalled home  for I was heartily wearied of her  The day before she left Sidney castle  when we were alone  she said to me  I have too great a reliance on your honour  to suppose you capable of injuring my reputation by ever divulging what has passed between us  I am easy therefore on that head  But there is one circumstance on which you must give me the most solemn promise that is in your power to make  without which I shall be the most unhappy creature in the world  I know there is a friendship between you and Mr Faulkland  and I am not ignorant that you men in your unreserved moments of confidence  do not scruple to
