by the directors  in a manner the proprietors could not account for  They therefore petitioned the house  representing the manner in which they had been defrauded of such vasts sums of money  and the distress to which many were reduced to  in consequence of such imposition  The petition was received  and a secret committee appointed to inquire into the grievance  They soon discovered a most iniquitous scene of fraud  which had been carried on by Thompson and Robinson  in concert with some of the directors  for embezzling the capital  and cheating the proprietors  Many persons of rank and quality were concerned in this infamous conspiracy  some of the first characters in the nation did not escape without censure  The house of commons declared their resentment  and expelled one or two of their members  but the sufferers met with scarce any redress  Nor can I mention such a circumstance without reflecting on that spirit of rapacity and avarice which infected every degree of people  An ill example in the governing part of a country ever diffuses itself downward  and  while the ministry do not blush at detection  the people of every rank will not fear guilt  About this time not less than five members of parliament were expelled for the most sordid acts of knavery  Sir Robert Sutton  Sir Archibald Grant  and George Robinson  for their rauds in the management of the Charitable Corporaion scheme  Dennis Bond  Esquire  and Serjeant Burch  for a fraudulent sale of the late Earl of Derwentwater s forfeited estates  Luxury had produced rodigality  the sure parent of every meanness  It was even asserted in the house of Lords  that not   148 one shilling of the forfeited estates was ever applied to the service of the public  but became the reward of avarice and venality   Another occurrence of a more private nature  about this time  excited public compassion  not without a degree of horror  Richard Smith  a bookbinder  and his wife  had long lived together  and struggled with those wants  which  notwithstanding the profusion of the rich at this time  oppressed the poor  Their mutual tenderness for each other  was the only comfort they had in their distresses  which distresses were increased by having a child  which they knew not how to maintain  At length  they took the desperate resolution of dying by their own hands  the child s throat was cut  and the husband and wife were found hanging in their bed chamber  They left a letter behind  containing the reasons which induced them to this act of desperation  they declared  that they could no longer support a life of such complicated wretchedness  and thought it tenderness to take their child with them  from a world where they themselves had found no compassion  Suicide  in many instances  is ascribed to phrenzy  we have here an instance of self murder  concerted with composure  and borrowing the aids of reason for its vindication   I am   c   LETTER XVIII   THE History of England has little  during this interval  to excite curiosity  The debates in parliament grew every day more obstinate  as every subject happened to come round in voting the annual supplies  But as the subjects were mostly the same  so also were the arguments  There was one    149 however  of a different nature from those in the usual course of business  which was laboured for strenously by the ministry  and as warmly opposed by their antagonists  namely  the excise bill  which Sir Robert Walpole introduced into the house  by first declaiming against the frauds practised by the factors in London  who were employed by the American planters in selling their tobacco  To prevent these frauds he proposed  instead of having the customs levied in the usual manner upon tobacco  that what was imported should be lodged in warehouses appointed for that purpose by the officers of the crown  from thence to be sold  after paying the duty of four pence per pound  when the proprietor found a market for it  This proposal raised a violent ferment  not less in the house than without doors  Those who opposed the scheme  asserted  that this scheme would expose the factors to such hardships  that they would not be able to continue the trade  nor would it prevent the frauds complained of  They asserted  that it would produce an additional swarm of exciseofficers and warehouse keepers  which would at once tender the ministry formidable  and the people dependant  Arguments  however  were not what the ministry most dreaded  for the people had been raised into such a ferment  that all the avenues to the house were crowded with complaining multitudes  and Sir Robert Walpole began even to fear for his life  The ministry carried the proposal in the house  but  observing the tumult of the people  they thought fit to drop the design  The miscarriage of the bill was celebrated with public rejoicings in London and Westminster  and the minister was burned in effigy by the populace   This success  in the members of the opposition  encouraged them to go on to a proposal for repealing an act made in the last reign  by which the house of commons was to be septennial  They proposed   150 that parliaments should again be made triennial
