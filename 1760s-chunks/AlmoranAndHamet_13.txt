the death of Solyman  and as the   reverence of HAMET for the memory of his father would not suffer him to   marry till the year should be completed  he determined not to mention   ALMEIDA to his brother  till the time when he could marry her was near    The fierce and haughty deportment of ALMORAN had now left HAMET no room   to doubt of his character  and though he had no apprehension that he   would make any attempts upon ALMEIDA  after she should be his wife  yet   he did not know how much might justly be feared from his passion  if he   should see her and become enamoured of her  while she was yet a virgin   in the house of her father       ALMEIDA had not only unsullied purity of mind  but principles of refined   and exalted virtue  and as the life of HAMET was an example of all that   was either great or good  Abdallah felt no anxiety upon leaving them   together  except what arose from his fears  that his daughter would not   be able to secure the conquest she had made       As it was impossible for HAMET to have such an acquaintance with ALMEIDA   as he desired  till he could enter into conversation with her upon terms   of equality  it was his first care to sooth her into confidence and   familiarity  and by degrees he succeeded  he soon found  in the free   intercourse of mind with mind  which he established instead of the   implicit submission which only ecchoed his own voice  how little of the   pleasure that women were formed to give can be enjoyed  when they are   considered merely as slaves to a tyrant s will  the passive subjects of   transient dalliance and casual enjoyment  The pleasure which he took in   the youthful beauty of ALMEIDA  was now endeared  exalted  and refined    by the tender sensibility of her heart  and by the reflexion of his own   felicity from her eyes  when he admired the gracefulness of her motion    the elegance of her figure  the symmetry of her features  and the bloom   of her complexion  he considered them as the decorations only of a   mind  capable of mixing with his own in the most exquisite delight  of   reciprocating all his ideas  and catching new pleasure from his   pleasure  Desire was no longer appetite  it was imagination  it was   reason  it included remembrance of the past  and anticipation of the   future  and its object was not the sex  but ALMEIDA       As HAMET never witheld any pleasure that it was in his power to impart    he soon acquainted Abdallah  that he waited only for a proper time to   place ALMEIDA upon the throne  but that he had some reasons for keeping   a resolution  which he thought himself obliged to communicate to him    concealed from others       It happened  however  that some of the women who attended upon ALMEIDA    met with some female slaves belonging to the seraglio of ALMORAN  at the   public baths  and related to them all the particulars of ALMEIDA S   preservation by HAMET  that he had first conveyed her to his own   apartments  and had since been frequently with her in that which he had   assigned her in his palace  they were also lavish in the praise of her   beauty  and free in their conjectures what might be the issue of her   intercourse with HAMET       Thus the situation of HAMET and ALMEIDA became the subject of   conversation in the seraglio of ALMORAN  who learnt it himself in a   short time from one of his women       He had hitherto professed great affection for HAMET  and HAMET was   deceived by his professions  for notwithstanding the irregularities of   his life  he did not think him capable of concealed malice  or of   offering injury to another  except when he was urged by impetuous   passions to immediate pleasure  As there was  therefore  an appearance   of mutual affection between them  ALMORAN  though the report of   ALMEIDA S beauty had fired his imagination and fixed him in a resolution   to see her  did not think proper to attempt it without asking HAMET S   consent  and being introduced by his order  as he made no doubt of there   being a connexion between them which would make him resent a contrary   conduct       He took an opportunity  therefore  when they were alone in a summer   pavilion that was built on a lake behind the palace  to reproach him    with an air of mirth  for having concealed a beauty near his apartments    though he pretended to have no seraglio  HAMET instantly discovered his   surprize and emotion by a blush  which the next moment
