 and he always talks it away whenever he finds a scholar in company  but I know the rogue  and will catch him yet      Though I was already sufficiently mortified  my greatest struggle was to come  in facing my wife and daughters  No truant was ever more afraid of returning to school  there to behold the master s sweet visage  than I was of going home  I was determined  however  to anticipate their fury  by first falling into a passion myself   But  alas  upon entering  I found the family no way disposed for battle  My wife and girls were all in tears  Mr  Thornhill having been there that day to inform them  that their journey to town was entirely over  The two ladies having heard reports of us from some malicious person about us  were that day set out for London  He could  Page  143  neither discover the tendency  nor the author of these  but whatever they might be  or whoever might have broached them  he continued to assure our family of his friendship and protection  I found  therefore  that they bore my disappointment with great resignation  as it was eclipsed in the greatness of their own  But what perplexed us most was to think who could be so base as to asperse the character of a family so harmless as ours  too humble to excite envy  and too inoffensive to create disgust   Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XV   All Mr  Burchell s villainy at once detected  The folly of being over wise   THAT evening and a part of the following day was employed in fruitless attempts to discover our enemies  scarce a family in the neighbourhood but incurred our suspicions  and each of us had reasons for our opinion best known to ourselves  As we were in this perplexity  one of our little boys  who had been playing abroad  brought in a letter case  which he found on the green  It was quickly known to belong to Mr  Burchell  with whom it had been seen  and  upon examination  contained some hints upon different subjects  but what particularly engaged our attention was a sealed note  superscribed the copy of  Page  146  a letter to be sent to the two ladies at Thornhill castle  It instantly occurred that he was the base informer  and we deliberated whether the note should not be broke open  I was against it  but Sophia  who said she was sure that of all men he would be the last to be guilty of so much baseness  insisted upon its being read  In this she was seconded by the rest of the family  and  at their joint solicitation  I read as follows   LADIES    THE bearer will sufficiently satisfy you as to the person from whom this comes  one at least the friend of innocence  and ready to prevent its being seduced  I am informed for a truth  that you have some intentions of bringing two young ladies to town  whom I have some knowledge of  under the character of companions  As I would neither have simplicity imposed upon  nor virtue contaminated  I must offer it as my opinion  that the impropriety of such  Page  147  a step will be attended with dangerous consequences  It has never been my way to treat the infamous or the lewd with severity  nor should I now have taken this method of explaining myself  or reproving folly  did it not aim at guilt  Take therefore the admonition of a friend  and seriously reflect on the consequences of introducing infamy and vice into retreats where peace and innocence have hitherto resided      Our doubts were now at an end  There seemed indeed something applicable to both sides in this letter  and its censures might as well be referred to those to whom it was written  as to us  but the malicious meaning was obvious  and we went no farther  My wife had scarce patience to hear me to the end  but railed at the writer with unrestrained resentment  Olivia was equally severe  and Sophia seemed perfectly amazed at his baseness  As for my part  it appeared to me one of the vilest instances of unprovoked ingratitude I had  Page  148  met with  Nor could I account for it in any other manner than by imputing it to his desire of detaining my youngest daughter in the country  to have the more frequent opportunities of an interview  In this manner we all sate ruminating upon schemes of vengeance  when our other little boy came runing in to tell us that Mr  Burchell was approaching at the other end of the field  It is easier to conceive than describe the complicated sensations which are felt from the pain of a recent injury  and the pleasure of approaching revenge  Tho  our intentions were only to upbraid him with his ingratitude  yet it was resolved to do it in a manner that would be perfectly cutting  For this purpose we agreed to meet him with our usual smiles  to chat in the beginning with more than ordinary kindness  to amuse him a little  but then in the midst of the flattering calm to burst upon him like an earthquake  and overwhelm him with the
