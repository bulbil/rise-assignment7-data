we proposed to conclude the evening with a  dance  one barge being insufficient to contain the whole company  we  were divided by lots  in consequence of which  my husband and I were  parted  This separation was equally mortifying to us both  who  though  married  were still lovers  and my chagrin increased when I perceived  that I was doomed to sit by Sir W  Y    a man of professed gallantry   for  although Lord W   had  before his marriage  made his addresses to  every woman he saw  I knew very well he did not desire that any person  should make love to his wife    That I might not  therefore  give umbrage  by talking to this gallant   I conversed with a Scotch nobleman  who  according to common report  had  formerly sighed among my admirers  By these means  in seeking to avoid  one error  I unwittingly plunged myself into a greater  and disobliged  Lord W   so much  that he could not conceal his displeasure  nay  so  deeply was he offended at my conduct  that  in the evening  when the  ball began  he would scarce deign to take me by the hand in the course  of dancing  and darted such unkind looks  as pierced me to the very  soul  What augmented my concern  was my ignorance of the trespass I had  committed  I was tortured with a thousand uneasy reflections  I began to  fear that I had mistaken his temper  and given my heart to a man who was  tired of possession  though I resolved to bear without complaining the  misfortune I had entailed upon myself    I seized the first opportunity of speaking to him  and thereby  discovered the cause of his chagrin  but  as there was no time for  expostulation  the misunderstanding continued on his side  with such  evident marks of uneasiness  that every individual of the company made  up to me  and inquired about the cause of his disorder  so that I was  fain to amuse their concern  by saying  that he had been ill the day  before  and dancing did not agree with his constitution  So much was he  incensed by this unhappy circumstance of my conduct  which was void of  all intention to offend him  that he determined to be revenged on me  for my indiscretion  and at supper  chancing to sit between two very  handsome ladies  one of whom is lately dead  and the other  at present   my neighbour in the country  he affected an air of gaiety  and openly  coquetted with them both     6 22 15  3 45 PM    This was not the only punishment he inflicted on his innocent wife  In  the course of our entertainment  we engaged in some simple diversion   in consequence of which the gentlemen were ordered to salute the ladies   when Lord W    in performing this command  unkindly neglected me in my  turn  I had occasion for all my discretion and pride  to conceal  from the company the agonies I felt at this mark of indifference and  disrespect  However  I obtained the victory over myself  and pretended  to laugh at his husband like behaviour  while the tears stood in my eyes  and my heart swelled even to bursting    We broke up about five  after having spent the most tedious evening I  had ever known  and this offended lover went to bed in a state of sullen  silence and disgust  Whatever desire I had to come to an explanation  I  thought myself so much aggrieved by his unreasonable prejudice  that  I could not prevail upon myself to demand a conference  till after his  first nap  when my pride giving way to my tenderness  I clasped him in  my arms  though he pretended to discourage these advances of my love  I  asked how he could be so unjust as to take umbrage at my civility to  a man whom he knew I had refused for his sake  I chid him for his  barbarous endeavours to awake my jealousy  and used such irresistible  arguments in my own vindication  that he was convinced of my innocence   scaled my acquittal with a kind embrace  and we mutually enjoyed the  soft transports of a fond reconciliation    Never was passion more eager  delicate  or unreserved  than that which  glowed within our breasts  Far from being cloyed with the possession of  each other  our raptures seemed to increase with the term of our union   When we were separated  though but for a few hours  by the necessary  avocations of life  we were unhappy during that brief separation  and  met again like lovers  who knew no joy but in one another s presence   How many delicious evenings did we spend together  in our little  apartment  after we had ordered the candles to be taken away  that we  might enjoy the agreeable reflection of the moon in a fine summer s  evening  Such a mild and solemn scene
