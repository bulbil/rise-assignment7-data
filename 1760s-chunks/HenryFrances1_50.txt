whining Inamorato s   I am just come from —  to catch the Post going out   Adieu   Henry   LETTER XCVI   I SHOULD have wrote to my dear Harry last Post  but was prevented by Illness  I am now  thank God  a great deal better  so will not trouble you with an Account of my Malady   I am much obliged to you for the romantick Gallantry  you hint at in your last  but  in order to make a proper Return to so much Politeness  I must assure you  tho  I long with the utmost Earnestness to see you here  it would rather give me Pain  than Pleasure  to think I was the sole Motive of your Coming  I do not know  but Pride may have a large Share in this Declaration  for I confess  I have not Humility enough in my Disposition  to be pleased with receiving Favours —However  my Vanity is much delighted   171 with the Compliment  and insists on its remaining  as it is a very genteel one   I hope I did not wrong you  with Regard to Paraclete  I should indeed be sorry  it had a more solid Foundation  than Fancy  as we could  in that  build as pretty a Castle  as any two People I know   I live toute Seul  yet am as happy in mine own dear Home  as my Health will permit  I am grown quite a domestick Animal  and have found out  that the Reason we  who pursue  rarely find Happiness  is  because she is too near us  and  hides behind her Ardour to be seen   for she very seldom lives from Home —I expect Kitty will exchange the Pleasure I have found in conversing with myself  for a much higher  that of conversing with her  She is to come to me next Week  and tho   from being too long immersed in Crowds and Hurry  I have acquired a Kind of Passion for Loneliness  I shall be sincerely glad of her Company  but I much fear my Disposition  which  from the long Series of Disappointments and Mortifications I have met with  is grown quietly gloomy  will be but ill suited to her lively Gaiety  However  some say  that Contrasts in Friendship  like Sympathies in Love  cement the Union  I hope it will do so with us —My Aunt came to Town  last Night —I have no Kind of News to send you  and my Spirits are so extremely   172 low  that I fear my Epistle will be contagious  and give you the Hum drums  which have  at present  taken entire Possession of  Your sincere Friend and Servant   LETTER XCVII   Dear HARRY   I HAVE received both your Letters  I did not get that of the 19th  till Sunday Morning  let me beg you not to write by the Stage again  for I hate Delays  I wrote to you last Saturday on the same Subject  I am now to treat of  but  as you desire I should be explicit  I obey   And  first  let me again thank you  for your designed Visit  and again assure you  that  with never ceasing Earnestness  I wish  nay long to see you here  But as I ever did  and ever shall prefer your Ease and Happiness to my own  I must insist on your not contributing to mine  at the Expence of your s   In the most romantick Hours of my Life  when every Instance of Tenderness transported me  I well remember to have received more Pain  than Pleasure  from a parallel Proof of your Regard  and  to deal frankly with you   which indeed I think you merit  it is neither in my Power nor Inclination to make the Returns  which  I fear  you would expect for such a Favour  Let me intreat you then  my dear   173Harry  not to give yourself and me fruitless Trouble  but wait   till Time  or Business  produces some lucky Event  which may render your Coming necessary to yourself  and of Course pleasing to me —Whenever that happens  I will  with the utmost Pleasure  meet you  at whatever Distance  you shall appoint  from Town  with a Female Companion  provided we can settle it so  as not to interfere with my domestick Affairs  and be assured  that every Moment of my Life  which can be spared from those  shall be bestowed on you  This is indeed no Compliment  as I know no other Method of spending it  with Satisfaction to myself   I now solemnly declare that  by declining your intended Kindness  I debar myself of the only Pleasure I am capable of receiving  for all other Enjoyments   have lost the Power to charm my Soul   —Do not then unkindly construe my Regard for your Welfare into Caprice  or cruelly say  that I don t desire to see you —too well you know  I do     You do me but strict Justice in believing  that the most minute Matter  relative to you  must ever be of Consequence to me  and
