she gives for leaving him  No such thing  Sir George  Arnold is a man of too much sense  and knows the world too well  to be so deceived  I have been told by my Lord V——  knows him perfectly  that nobody judges better when he is not blinded by his passions  All her professions must go for nothing when facts are against her  ’Tis plain she went off with another man  and to all appearances premeditately  as her maid and her riches bore her company  ’Tis also plain  by her own confession  that this man stands well with her  As for her recanting her injurious aspersions on poor Mrs Arnold  ’tis the only circumstance in her letter likely to gain belief  as she could have no temptation to that but real compunction  with which people of that kind are sometimes visited  and for the rest of her letter  to any one of common understanding  that lays circumstances together  it will appear  as I intended it should  the contrivance of an artful jilt  who  having almost ruined the wretch she has had in her power  would afterwards make a merit of deserting him  for they must be hardened reprobates indeed  that would not  if they could  at least try to palliate their evil deeds  This is the light I expect Arnold will consider her in  I know he is hurt deeply in his fortune by this vile harpy  I hope the remnant may be sufficient to support your excellent sister  if not in affluence  at least with comfort  should she regain her influence over him  and submit to live with him again  This  I am sure  will be the consequence  if he is not blind to his own happiness   I shall be impatient to know how the letter operates on him  but this you are not likely to be let into  and perhaps his pride may make him endeavour to conceal it from every body  My Lord V——  I am sure  will pick up some intelligence  and send it to me   I think Mrs Gerrarde’s confession  in regard to Mrs Arnold  to which she could have no interested motive   with the corroborating    circumstance of my going off with her at a time when Mrs Arnold was from under her husband’s protection  injured by him in the tenderest point  and aspersed by a barbarous and invidious world  all this  I say  must surely clear from all suspicion that admirable creature  for who  that knows Mrs Arnold  would think that any man  except her husband  would prefer any woman upon earth to her  If this does not remove all doubt of her conduct in Arnold  as well as in the rest of the world  my pains have been to little purpose  and I know no other human means that can be used to disabuse the mad credulity of that man  I pity him from my heart in his present situation  for it will be some time before he will be sensible of the good I have done him  and  I dare swear  the man is at this time so ungrateful  that  if he could  he would cut my throat  I do not want to have him know the extent of his obligation to me  I shall be satisfied to sit down in the contemplation of my meritorious actions  without enjoying the fame of them  This greatness of mind I learnt of Mrs Gerrarde  But to return  The having gained my material point put me into such spirits  that I could have kissed Mrs Gerrarde  a liberty which  I assure you  however I never presumed to take  She  for her part  seemed as well pleased with what she had done as I was  I praised her for the part she had acted  though I very much feared she would repent of it when we came to explanations  which I resolved should be on that very day  I told her  I hoped she would oblige me with her company at dinner  She consented with a bow  I had ordered one to be got ready earlier than usual  and directed that it should be in her apartment  We were told it was on table  I never saw Mrs Gerrarde so agreeable as she was during dinner  she was in high spirits and good humour  I almost thought it a pity to let her down that day  but I considered the longer her expectations were kept up  the greater would be her disappointment  and  out of pure charity  I determined to put her out of doubt   I had been told Mrs Gerrarde was no enemy to a chearful glass  but the designs she had formed upon me put her on her guard  and I observed she drank nothing but wine and water  made very small  This  I was afraid  would not be sufficient to keep up her courage under what I intended to say to her  I pretended to be disposed to drink  and insisted on her helping me out with a flask of burgundy  With affected coyness she suffered me to fill her glass  the second offer I made  her resistance was less  the third she made no objection    to at all  and the fourth she
