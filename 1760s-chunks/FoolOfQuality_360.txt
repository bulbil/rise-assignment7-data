the mean season in endeavours to amuse his darling  and   to dispel the cloud of melancholy that continued to hang over him      For this purpose  he went with him to Versailles  and to the   many other elegant environs of Paris  He also showed him the   Tuileries and other public walks  where our hero became oppressed   by his involuntary attraction of all eyes upon him      One night  happening to go to the play without the company of   his guardian  as he came forth with the crowd a carriage was   opened for him  which he took to be his own  and in he stepped    and away he was taken      In the mean time Mr  Clinton waited supper for him  and began   to grow uneasy when the clock struck twelve  At last his carriage   and servants returned  with tidings that they stayed for him above   an hour at the theatre after the play was over   and had ever since   been in search of him  to no purpose      Though Mr  Clinton was by nature of an intrepid spirit  and was   still more assured by his reliance on Providence  he yet found   himself agitated in a very alarming manner  He therefore retired   to his closet  and there  on his knees  fervently commended his   Harry to the protection of his God      At length the clock struck three  Soon after the bell was heard   from the hall   and Harry entering  with a page in a rich livery    flew like lightning up stairs  and cast himself into the bosom of his   patron      My father  my father  he cried  I have been in sad panics for   you  I knew the love that you bore to your good for nothing   Harry  But indeed I could not help it  I could not get to you   till this instant  I have been a prisoner  sir  and here is my dear   deliverer          400 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      As soon as they were something composed  and all seated  Harry    proceeded to satisfy the impatience of his uncle      As I came out of the theatre  ruminating on a passage in one of   Kacine s tragedies  I found a chariot in the spot where I had left   my own  and  stepping heedlessly into it  I was soon set down    and  hastening through the great hall  flew up stairs to salute you    But think how T was surprised  when I suddenly found myself in   the most sumptuous chamber  perhaps  in the universe  It was   wainscoted with mirrors of the most perfect polish  whose plates   were artfully buttoned and buckled together by diamonds and other   gems of a most dazzling lustre      All astonished  I recoiled  and was going to withdraw  when   I was met by a lady who gracefully accosted me  Have you   commands  sir  says she  for any one in this house  A thousand   pardons  madam  I perceive my error  I really thought I was   set down at my own lodgings  No great offence  sir   but now that   I look at you again  I think you ought to pay the forfeit of your   intrusion  by giving me one hour of your company at least  You   must excuse me  madam  my guardian would be under the most   terrifying alarms for me  A fig for guardians   she cried  You are   now my prisoner   and nothing less than my friend Lewis  with his   army at his back  shall be able to take you out of my hands      So saying  she rung a bell  and immediately a folding door of   panelled looking glass flew open  and showed us to another apart    ment  where a supper  composed of all the elegancies of the   season  was served up as by magic  and lay fuming on the table      She then took me by the hand  and  having graciously seated   me  placed herself opposite  A number of servants then vanished   on the instant  leaving a dumb waiter of silver behind them      Sir  said she  we are not to have any further company  You alone   were expected  you alone are desired   all others are forbidden      In short  I have seen you often at the public walks and theatres    You did more than strike my fancy   you laid hold on my heart    I inquired every thing about you  I know your rank  title  and   fortune  I made use of this night
