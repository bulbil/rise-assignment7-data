series of  disappointments  he cursed them in his heart for their unseasonable  appearance  When they questioned him about Pallet  he told them he had  found him stark staring mad  howling in a corner  and wet to the skin   and conducted him to his room  where he was now abed  The physician   hearing this circumstance  made a merit of his vanity  and  under  pretence of concern for the patient s welfare  desired he might have an  opportunity of examining the symptoms of his disorder  without loss of  time  alleging that many diseases might have been stifled in the birth   which afterwards baffled all the endeavours of the medical art  The  young gentleman accordingly delivered the key  and once more withdrew  into his own chamber  with a view of seizing the first occasion that  should present itself of renewing his application to his Amanda s  door  while the doctor  in his way to Pellet s apartment  hinted to the  governor his suspicion that the patient laboured under that dreadful  symptom called the hydrophobia  which he observed had sometimes appeared  in persons who were not previously bit by a mad dog  This conjecture  he founded upon the howl he uttered when he was soused with water  and  began to recollect certain circumstances of the painter s behaviour for  some days past  which now he could plainly perceive had prognosticated  some such calamity  He then ascribed the distemper to the violent  frights he had lately undergone  affirming that the affair of the  Bastille had made such a violent encroachment upon his understanding   that his manner of thinking and speaking was entirely altered  By a  theory of his own invention  he explained the effects of fear upon a  loose system of nerves  and demonstrated the modus in which the animal  spirits operate upon the ideas and power of imagination   This disquisition  which was communicated at the painter s door  might  have lasted till breakfast  had not Jolter reminded him of his own  maxim  Venienti occurrite morbo  upon which he put the key to immediate  use  and they walked softly towards the bed  where the patient lay  extended at full length in the arms of sleep  The physician took  notice of his breathing hard  and his mouth being open  and from  these diagnostics declared  that the liquidum nervosum was intimately  affected  and the saliva impregnated with the spiculated particles  of the virus  howsoever contracted  This sentence was still farther  confirmed by the state of his pulse  which  being full and slow   indicated an oppressed circulation  from a loss of elasticity in the  propelling arteries  He proposed that he should immediately suffer a  second aspersion of water  which would not only contribute to the cure   but also certify them  beyond all possibility of doubt  with regard to  the state of the disease  for it would evidently appear  from the manner  in which he would bear the application  whether or not his horror of  water amounted to a confirmed hydrophobia  Mr  Jolter  in compliance  with his proposal  began to empty a bottle of water  which he found  in the room in a basin  when he was interrupted by the prescriber   who advised him to use the contents of the chamberpot  which  being  impregnated with salt  would operate more effectually than pure element     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Thus directed  the governor lifted up the vessel  which was replete with  medicine  and with one turn of his hand  discharged the whole healing  inundation upon the ill omened patient  who  waking in the utmost  distraction of horror  yelled most hideously  just at the time when  Peregrine had brought his mistress to a parley  and entertained hopes of  being admitted into her chamber   Terrified at this exclamation  she instantly broke off the treaty   beseeching him to retire from the door  that her honour might receive  no injury from his being found in that place  and he had just enough  of recollection left to see the necessity of obeying the order  in  conformity to which he retreated well nigh deprived of his senses  and  almost persuaded that so many unaccountable disappointments must have  proceeded from some supernatural cause  of which the idiot Pallet was no  more than the involuntary instrument   Meanwhile  the doctor having ascertained the malady of the patient   whose cries  interrupted by frequent sobs and sighs  he interpreted into  the barking of a dog  and having no more salt water at hand  resolved to  renew the bath with such materials as chance would afford  He actually  laid hold of the bottle and basin  but by this time the painter had  recovered the use of his senses so well as to perceive his drift   and  starting up like a frantic bedlamite  ran directly to his sword   swearing  with many horrid imprecations  that he would murder them both  immediately  if he should be hanged before dinner  They did not choose  to wait the issue of his threat  but retired with
