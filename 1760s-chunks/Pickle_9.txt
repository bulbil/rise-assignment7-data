 This the needful from  Yours  etc                                        Gam  Pickle    This laconic epistle  simple and unadorned as it was  met with as  cordial a reception from the person to whom it was addressed  as if it  had been couched in the most elegant terms that delicacy of passion and  cultivated genius could supply  nay  I believe  was the more welcome on  account of its mercantile plainness  because when an advantageous match  is in view  a sensible woman often considers the flowery professions and  rapturous exclamations of love as ensnaring ambiguities  or  at best   impertinent preliminaries  that retard the treaty they are designed to  promote  whereas Mr  Pickle removed all disagreeable uncertainty  by    6 22 15  3 45 PM   descending at once to the most interesting particular   She had no sooner  as a dutiful child  communicated this billet doux to  her father  than he  as a careful parent  visited Mr  Pickle  and   in presence of Mrs  Grizzle  demanded a formal explanation of his  sentiments with regard to his daughter Sally  Mr  Gamaliel  without any  ceremony  assured him he had a respect for the young woman  and  with  his good leave  would take her for better  for worse  Mr  Appleby  after  having expressed his satisfaction that he had fixed his affections  in his family  comforted the lover with the assurance of his being  agreeable to the young lady  and they forthwith proceeded to the  articles of the marriage settlement  which being discussed and  determined  a lawyer was ordered to engross them  the wedding clothes  were bought  and  in short  a day was appointed for the celebration of  their nuptials  to which everybody of any fashion in the neighbourhood  was invited  Among these  commodore Trunnion and Mr  Hatchway were not  forgotten  being the sole companions of the bridegroom  with whom  by  this time  they had contracted a sort of intimacy at their nocturnal  rendezvous   They had received a previous intimation of what was on the anvil  from  the landlord  before Mr  Pickle thought proper to declare himself  in  consequence of which  the topic of the one eyed commander s discourse   at their meeting  for several evenings before  had been the folly and  plague of matrimony  on which he held forth with great vehemence of  abuse  leveled at the fair sex  whom he represented as devils incarnate   sent from hell to torment mankind  and in particular inveighed against  old maids  for whom he seemed to entertain a singular aversion   while his friend Jack confirmed the truth of all his allegations  and  gratified his own malignant vein at the same time by clenching every  sentence with a sly joke upon the married state  built upon some  allusion to a ship or sea faring life  He compared a woman to a great  gun loaded with fire  brimstone  and noise  which  being violently  heated  will bounce and fly  and play the devil  if you don t take  special care of her breechings  He said she was like a hurricane that  never blows from one quarter  but veers about to all points of the  compass  He likened her to a painted galley  curiously rigged  with  a leak in her hold  which her husband would never be able to stop  He  observed that her inclinations were like the Bay of Biscay  for why   because you may heave your deep sea lead long enough without ever  reaching the bottom  that he who comes to anchor on a wife may find  himself moored in d  d foul ground  and after all  can t for his blood  slip his cable  and that  for his own part  though he might make short  trips for pastime  he would never embark in woman on the voyage of life   he was afraid of foundering in the first foul weather   In all probability  these insinuations made some impression on the mind  of Mr  Pickle  who was not very much inclined to run great risks of any  kind  but the injunctions and importunities of his sister  who was bent  upon the match  overbalanced the opinion of his sea friends  who finding  him determined to marry  notwithstanding all the hints of caution they  had thrown out  resolved to accept his invitation  and honoured his  nuptials with their presence accordingly   CHAPTER IV      6 22 15  3 45 PM   The Behaviour of Mrs  Grizzle at the Wedding  with an Account of the  Guests   I hope it will not be thought uncharitable  if I advance  by way of  conjecture  that Mrs  Grizzle  on this grand occasion  summoned her  whole exertion to play off the artillery of her charms on the single  gentlemen who
