I shall never attempt to over rule your Will  but to better inform it  or the more effectually to answer the great End of all my Thoughts and Actions  namely  your Happiness and Establishment  and my own  only through such charming Means  My not going to London before this  is one Instance  I may give  that I prefer both our Interests  before our Pleasure  and  if I have not fixed the Day  at your frequent Request  it is Page  74 because I cannot be certain of it yet  however  I can answer you  that  before ten Days from this  I shall have the unfeigned Delight of seeing my sweet Girl   I cannot help being angry with you for such an ungenerous and impious Wish  as you make in your last Letter  What Advantage could possibly accrue to me  from your Death  who  as I said before  only intend  nay  only wish or desire  and am only capable of Happiness through your Means  How have I undeserved from you  or what Merits have those Persons you so falsely stile my Friends  toward you  that their Satisfaction is so unkindly and unwarrantably preferred before mine  What Comfort could they afford me  for your Loss  or where else could I expect to find it  It is too late in Life for me to begin the World anew  My Habits are grown too strong to be counteracted now  What a Turn must my whole Set of Ideas take  and how many refined Pleasures must I unlearn  or lose the Relish of  before I could be satisfied with the Enjoyment of any other Woman  I have often quarrelled with you  upon such Subjects  and take it very unkindly that you will not recollect yourself a little  before you treat me with so much Ingratitude and Ungenerosity  Indeed I is angry with U  in Spight of all the Letters of the Alphabet  from Alpha to Omega  which is the Page  75 Order your dear Idea presents itself to my Thoughts in  Repent  thou Suicide and Homicide in one   Remember to write to me by Tuesday s Post  directed to —  and on Thursday direct to me at —  which is my Way home  I will not excuse you these two Posts  because I shall want your Company on the Road   Adieu  my Treasure  for  by a Turn upon the Words of Scripture  I may call you so  as my Heart is with you   Henry   LETTER CCV   THE sincere Pleasure I received from my dear Harry s last Letter is  indeed  sufficient to make me wish for Life  nay  a long one  to enable me to repay his generous Tenderness  Believe me  my sweet Love  your Kindness is not thrown away  for all the poor Return  which I can make  is most sincerely your s  in Thought  in Word  in Deed —And  if I really am so blest  as to contribute to your Happiness  well may you call me ungenerous and ungrateful  for wishing to exchange that Bliss  even for the Joys of Immortality  The Transport  which I feel  from thinking I am dear to you  is much too great to be expressed  Page  76 I am  I ever will be your s  Dispose my Life  my Being  as you please  Thou art the Lord of me —Haste then  thou dear Author of my Happiness  haste to complete it by thy much loved  much longed for Presence   I am still une pauvre Solitaire  and look upon myself to be the truest female Recluse  that ever was  as my Confinement  Solitude  and Fasting  are dictated by Choice  not Necessity —Yet I am afraid this voluntary Restraint is not founded in Reason  or Virtue  My Moderation may be compared to that of an Epicure  who  though he may have a good Appetite  eats sparingly of a coarse Dinner  but provide him with Delicacies  and he shews the Glutton  So I go seldom abroad  see no Company at home  never think of public Diversions  and pass my Life in a State of Indifference to the Objects which are within my Reach  but  were it in my Power to enjoy the Feast of Reason  in thy Converse  I should quickly lose the Appearance of Self Denial  and gladly indulge myself in the extreme Enjoyment of the highest Pleasures—those of seeing  hearing  loving  and being loved by thee  Adieu   Frances   Page  77  LETTER CCVI   My sweetest  dear Girl   I AM at a Loss for Epithets fond or expressive enough to address you with  but must refer self to the Intuition of angelic Minds  to shew you how far short the warmest Terms of human Language fall of that sincere Affection and tender Love I bear you   I am surprised at the Weakness of your Concern upon my mentioning my dying  for surely a Man is not the nearer  though he may be the better prepared for it  by his making a Will  nay  even the very Approach of it ought to alarm us no more  than it should a fond Parent  that his Child was growing
