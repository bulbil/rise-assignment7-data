 of the pleasure   of insulting us on our country s fall       In this romantic and distracted manner did they in vain endeavour to   discharge their breasts of the load of anguish each sustained   Their   misfortune was not of a nature to be alleviated by words   it was too   mighty for expression  and the more they spoke  the more they had yet to   say   For three whole days they refused the wretched sustenance brought   to them  neither did the least slumber ever close their eyelids by   night  on the fourth the keeper of the prison came  and told them they   must depart    They endeavoured not to inform themselves how or where   they were to be disposed of  in their present condition all places were   alike to them  so followed him  without speaking  down stairs  at the   bottom of which they found a strong guard of thirty soldiers  who having   chained them in a link  like slaves going to be sold at the market    conducted them to a very stately palace adjoining to that belonging   to the czar       They were but eight in number  out of fifty five who had been taken   prisoners at the time Horatio was  and were thrown altogether in the   dungeon  the others having perished thro  cold and the noysomeness of   the place  before Edella had procured them a more easy situation  but   these eight that survived were all officers  and most of them men of   distinguished birth as well as valour  tho  their long imprisonment    scanty food  and more than all  the grief they at present laboured under   made them look rather like ghosts  than men chose out of thousands to   fight always near the king of Sweden s person in every   hazardous attempt       They were placed in a stately gallery  and there left  while the   officer  who commanded the party that came with them  went into an inner   room  but soon after returned  and another person with him  on which    the first of this unhappy string was loosed from his companions  and a   signal made to him to enter a door  which was opened for him  and   immediately closed again       For about half an hour there was a profound silence  our prisoners kept   it thro  astonishment  and the others  it is to be supposed  had orders   for doing so   At the end of that time the door was again opened  and   the chain which fastened the second Swede to the others  was untied  and   he  in like manner as the former  bid to go in   In some time after  the   same ceremony was observed to a third   then to a fourth  fifth  sixth    and seventh   Horatio chanced to be the last  who  tho  alarmed to a   very great degree at the thoughts of what fate might have been inflicted   on his companions  went fearless in  more curious to know the meaning of   this mysterious proceeding  than anxious for what might befal him       He had no sooner passed the door  than he found himself in a spacious   chamber richly adorned  at the upper end of which sat a man  leaning his   head upon his arm in a thoughtful posture   Horatio immediately knew him   to be prince Menzikoff  whom he had seen during a short truce between   the czar and king Charles of Sweden  when both their armies were in   Lithuania  There were no other persons present than one who had the   aspect of a jew  and as it proved was so  that stood near the prince s   chair  and a soldier who kept the door       Horatio was bid to approach  and when he did so   you are called hither    said the jew in the Swedish language  to answer to such questions as   shall be asked you  concerning a conspiracy carried on between you and   your fellow prisoners with the enemies of Russia  Horatio understood the   language perfectly well  having conversed so long with Swedes  but never   could attain to a perfect pronounciation of it  so replied in French    that he knew the prince could speak French  and he would therefore   answer to any interrogatories his highness should be pleased to make   without the help of an interpreter       Are you not then a Swede  said the prince  Horatio then told him that he   was not  but came from France into the service of the king of Sweden   merely thro  his love of arms       On these words Menzikoff dismissed the jew  and looked earnestly on him    wan
