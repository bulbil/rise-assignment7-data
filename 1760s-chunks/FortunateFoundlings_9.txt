as you have found from me   In fine  Louisa  the care I have   taken of you would not be complete unless I saw you well settled in the   world   I have therefore provided a husband for you  and such a one as I   think you can have no reasonable objection to       Sir  it would ill become me to dispute your will  answered she    modestly  but as I yet am very young  and have never had a thought of   marriage  nor even conversed with any who have experienced that fate  I   should be too much at a loss how to behave in it  without being allowed   some time to consider on its respective duties   I hope therefore  sir    continued she  you will not oblige me to act with too much precipitation   in an affair on which the happiness or misery of my whole future   life depends       Your very thinking it of consequence  said he  is enough to make you   behave so  as to allure your happiness with a man of honour  and indeed   Louisa  I love you too well to propose one to you whose principles and   humour I could not answer for as well as my own       Yet  sir  replied she  I have read that a union of hearts as well as   hands is necessary for the felicity of that state   that there ought to   be a simpathy of soul between them  and a perfect confidence in each   other  before the indissoluble knot is tied   and this  according to my   notion  can only be the result of a long acquaintance and accompanied   with many proofs of affection on both sides       Were all young women to think as you do  said he with a smile  we would   have much fewer marriages  they would indeed be happier  therefore I am   far from condemning your precaution  nor would wish you should give   yourself to one till well assured he was incapable of treating you with   less regard after marriage than before   no  no  Louisa  I will never   press you to become a wife  till you shall yourself acknowledge the man   I offer to you as a husband is not unworthy of that title  thro  a want   of honour  fortune  or affection       As Louisa thought this must be the work of time  the chagrin she felt at   the first mention of marriage was greatly dissipated  and she told him    that when she was once convinced such a person as he described honoured   her so far as to think she merited his affection  she would do all in   her power to return it       The enamoured Dorilaus having now brought her to the point he aimed at    thought it best to throw off the mark at once  and leave her no longer   in suspence   Behold then in me  said he  the person I have mentioned    nor think me vain in ascribing those merits to myself which I would wish   to be the loadstone of your affection   My honour  I believe  you will   not call in question   my humour you have never found capricious  or   difficult to please  and as for my love  you cannot but allow the   conquering that aversion  which myself  as well as all the world    believed unalterable for a marriage state  besides a thousand other   scruples opposed my entering into it with you  is a proof greater than   almost any other man could give you   There requires  therefore  my dear   Louisa  no time to convince you of what I am  or assure you of what I   may be  and I hope the affection you bore me  as a faithful friend  and   the protector of your innocence  will not be diminished on my making   this declaration       The confusion in which this speech involved her is even impossible to be   conceived  much less can any words come up to its description  she   blushed   she trembled   she was ready to die between surprize  grief   and shame   fain she would have spoke  but feared  lest what she should   say would either lose his friendship or encourage his passion   Each   seemed equally dreadful to her   no words presented themselves to her   distracted mind that she could think proper to utter  till he pressing   her several times to reply  and seeming a little to resent her   silence  Oh  sir  cried she  how is it possible for me to make any   answer to so strange a proposition   you were not used to rally my   simplicity  nor can I think you mean what
