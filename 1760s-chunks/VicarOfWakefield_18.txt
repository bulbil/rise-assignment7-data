not removed  Our windows now again  as formerly  were filled with washes for the neck and face  The sun was dreaded as an enemy to the skin without doors  and the fire as a spoiler of the complexion within  My wife observed  that rising too early would hurt her daughter s eyes  that working after dinner would redden their noses  and convinced me that  Page  90  the hands never looked so white as when they did nothing  Instead therefore of finishing George s shirts  we now had them new modelling their old gauzes  or flourishing upon catgut  The poor Miss Flamboroughs  their former gay companions  were cast off as mean acquaintance  and the whole conversation ran upon high life and high lived company  with pictures  taste  Shakespear  and the musical glasses   But we could have borne all this  had not a fortune telling gypsey come to raise us into perfect sublimity  The tawny sybil no sooner appeared  than my girls came running to me for a shilling a piece to cross her hand with silver  To say the truth  I was tired of being always wise  and could not help gratifying their request  because I loved to see them happy  I gave each of them a shilling  though  for the honour of the family  it must be observed  that they never went without money themselves  as my wife always generously let them have a guinea each  to keep in their pockets  but with strict  Page  91  injunctions never to change it  After they had been closetted up with the fortune teller for some time  I knew by their looks  upon their returning  that they had been promised something great —   Well  my girls  how have you sped  Tell me  Livy  has the fortune teller given thee a pennyworth    —   I protest  pappa    says the girl  with a serious face    I believe she deals with some body that s not right  for she positively declared  that I am to be married to a great  Squire in less than a twelvemonth    —   Well now  Sophy  my child    said I    and what sort of a husband are you to have     Sir    replied she    I am to have a Lord soon after my sister has been married to the  Squire    —  How    cried I    is that all you are to have for your two shillings  Only a Lord and a  Squire for two shillings  You fools  I could have promised you a Prince and a Nabob for half the money      Page  92  This curiosity of theirs  however  was attended with very serious effects  we now began to think ourselves designed by the stars for something exalted  and already anticipated our future grandeur   It has been a thousand times observed  and I must observe it once more  that the hours we pass with happy prospects in view  are more pleasing than those crowned with fruition  In the first case we cook the dish to our own appetite  in the latter nature cooks it for us  It is impossible to repeat the train of agreeable reveries we called up for our entertainment  We looked upon our fortunes as once more rising  and as the whole parish asserted that the  Squire was in love with my daughter  she was actually so with him  for they persuaded her into passion  In this agreeable interval  my wife had the most lucky dreams in the world  which she took care to tell us every morning  with great solemnity and exactness  It was one night a coffin and cross  Page  93  bones  the sign of an approaching wedding  at another time she imagined her daughter s pockets filled with farthings  a certain sign of their being one day stuffed with gold  The girls had their omens too  they felt strange kisses on their lips  they saw rings in the candle  purses bounced from the fire  and true love knots lurked at the bottom of every tea cup   Towards the end of the week we received a card from the town ladies  in which  with their compliments  they hoped to see all our family at church the Sunday following  All Saturday morning I could perceive  in consequence of this  my wife and daughters in close conference together  and now and then glancing at me with looks that betrayed a latent plot  To be sincere  I had strong suspicions that some absurd proposal was preparing for appearing with splendor the next day  In the evening they began their operations in a very regular manner  and my wife undertook to conduct the  Page  94  siege  After tea  when I seemed in spirits  she began thus —   I fancy  Charles  my dear  we shall have a great deal of good company at our church to morrow    —   Perhaps we may  my dear    returned I  though   you need be under no uneasiness about that  you shall have a sermon whether there be or not
