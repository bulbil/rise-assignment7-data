fabled that the   son of Philip broke into a passion of tears on finding that no   more worlds remained for him to conquer      Your pardon yet  I pray With respect to your opinion  that     the descendants of the mighty and the exalted inherit the qualities   and excellences of their progenitors  you speak as though this   earth  and all that was thereon  were invariably permanent   where    as the knowing ones will tell you that the one and the other are   subject to annual  and even diurnal  revolutions      Perhaps there is not a beggar or slave upon earth whose some         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  145     time progenitor was not a prince or an emperor   perhaps there is   not a prince or emperor upon earth whose some time progenitor   was not a slave or a beggar  Have you  then  the discernment to   perceive in the beggar the lineaments of the prince  or in the prince   to retrace the lineaments of the beggar  You have not  sage sir    I will tell you a story      The Cardinal Campejus  or some such great cardinal  happened to   have a dispute with the Duke of Modena  Altercation rose high    Do you know  says the prince in passion  that your father was no   better than my father s hog herd  I know it full well  coolly   answered the cardinal   and I am persuaded that  had your high    ness been the son of my father  you would have continued of the   same profession to this day      In such a world as this  all things are in perpetual change    rotation  and revolution  it is nature s process  As the summer   and winter gradually succeed and encroach upon each other   or as   the sun dawns and arises from darkness till he reaches the mid day   fervour of his culminating beam  and thence declines till he sets in   utter gloom   even so mighty nations  as well as families  have their   commencement  ascent  and summit  their declension  decay  and   period  The virtue of all nations and families begins in poverty    thence arises to industry  genius  honour  perhaps to conquest and   empire there s their zenith   but then comes on the load of pon    derous wealth  that gradually weighs them down from this meri    dian  to indulgence  sensuality  guilt  corruption  prostitution  slavery    perdition      Let us now  with the eye of philosophy  consider two men in the   most contrasted state that this world can admit suppose a king   and a beggar  Here the king is more highly fed and more gaily   clothed than the beggar   but if these are advantages deserving   estimation  we behold both this luxury and lustre surpassed by the   bee in the garden  and the lily in the valley  Further  whatever   the native qualities of the king or beggar may be  independent   of the said external or personal distinction  we may  however  be   assured  that an education in the midst of sensuality and decep    tion  of the exhibition of temptations and gratification of lusts  of   parasites and panders  obeisance and prostration  of corporal in    dulgence and mental imposition  can be no very good friend to the   virtues      If we carry the comparison further than this  we find the body of   the king to be as frail  as obnoxious to pains  disease  and in    clemencies  even as naked  poor  and perishable  as that of a   beggar      But if we take the eye of faith to see further than with that of   philosophy  we behold their souls alike immortal  of equal dignity   and extent  we see creatures resembling the Creator himself   breathed from his own spirit formed in his own image and   ordained to his own beatitude and eternity  Here all other dis    tinctions fall away and lose their respect as an instant would do   in comparison of ages  or a molehill in comparison of yon boundless   expanse   and here we find a beggar  whom the king himself is bound   to reverence as being the unquestioned heir of a KING  in coni      L         146 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      parison of whom all other kings are but as beggars  How utterly   vile and contemptible is all dignity and dominion to such an heir    ship as this   an heirship hourly approaching  perhaps just at hand    when the magnificent ruin of man shall be rebuilt
