most positive and peremptory terms  and this  if we consider the temper   of both these young ladies  we may reasonably suppose  might have   occasioned a second quarrel between them  if the servant  whom Mr    Francis always sent to his sister  had not that instant come in  and put   an end to the dispute  by delivering a letter to Miss Betsy  which she   hastily opening  found it contained these lines             To Miss Thoughtless            My dear sister            It is with an inexpressible satisfaction that I find your own        inclinations have anticipated the request I was just about to make        you  I do assure you  the moment I received your letter  I was        going to write  in order to persuade you to do the very thing you        seem to desire  Oxford is  indeed  a very censorious place  I have        always observed it to be so  and have frequently told the ladies         between jest and earnest  that I thought it was a town of the most        scandal  and least sin  of any in the world  I am pretty confident        some of those who pretend to give themselves airs concerning you        and Miss Flora  are as perfectly convinced of your innocence as I        myself am  yet  after all that has happened  I would not have you        think of staying  and the sooner you depart the better  You need be        under no apprehensions on account of my wounds  those I received        from the sword of my antagonist are in a manner healed  and that        with the pistol shot in my shoulder is in as fine a way as can be        expected in so short a time  Those I had the fortune to give him         are in a yet better condition  so that I believe  if it was not for        the over caution of our surgeon  we might both quit our rooms        to morrow  I hear that our grave superiors have had some        consultations on our duel  and that there is a talk of our being        both expelled  but  for my part  I shall certainly save them the        trouble  and quit the university of my own accord  as soon as my        recovery is compleated  My genius is by no means adapted to the        study of divinity  I think the care of my own soul more than        sufficient for me  without taking upon me the charge of a whole        parish  you may  therefore  expect to see me shortly at London  as        it is highly necessary I should consult Mr  Goodman concerning my        future settlement in the world  I should be extremely glad of a        visit from you before you leave Oxford  more especially as I have        something of moment to say to you  which I do not chuse to        communicate by letter  but cannot think it at all proper  for        particular reasons  that you should come to me  some or other of        the gentlemen being perpetually dropping into my chamber  and it is        impossible for you to disguise yourself so as not to be        distinguished by young fellows  whose curiosity would be the more        excited by your endeavours to conceal yourself  As this might        revive the discourse of an affair which I could wish might be        buried in an eternal oblivion  must desire you will defer the        satisfaction you propose to give me till we meet at London  to        which I wish you  and your fair companion  a safe and pleasant        journey  I am  with the greatest tenderness  my dear sister  your        affectionate brother             F  THOUGHTLESS
