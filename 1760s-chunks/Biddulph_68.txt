the chariot to the door  said  as she was going out  she would leave me at home herself  Mr Arnold answered  it would be the best way  and that he should follow soon  The chariot was presently at the door  and I was preparing to get into it  when Mrs Gerrarde cry’d  Bless me  I had forgot  it will not be so civil to leave the gentleman behind  without saying any thing to him  Mr Arnold hastily asked  What Gentleman  Mrs Gerrarde replied  Mr Faulkland  who took it into his head to make me a visit this evening  She went quickly into the parlour  and strait returned with Mr Faulkland  who bowing carelessly to Mr Arnold  and civilly to me  walked away   Mrs Gerrarde stepped into the chariot to me  and ordered it to drive to my house  leaving Mr Arnold standing motionless at her door   A total silence prevailed on my side during our short journey home  except to answer in monosyllables Mrs Gerrarde’s repeated enquiries after my health  She set me down at my own door  and took her leave without alighting  When I found myself alone  I began to    consider the consequences of this evening’s fatal interview  an interview  which  though unthought of by me  I judged was contrived to ensnare me  I laid all the circumstances together  and endeavoured to unravel the clue  ’Tis plain to me Mr Arnold was expected by Mrs Gerrarde this evening  She sent for me on purpose to betray me  the message  which she pretended was delivered wrong  was only an artifice  in order to impose on Mr Arnold  that he might imagine she did not expect me  Indeed  he could not possibly think she should send for me on the very evening he was to be with her  and she had so well guarded her contrivance  that it was not easily to be detected  She had sent her message by word of mouth  though she generally wrote them down on paper  but this way would not have been liable to misconstruction  she had told me she was engaged in the evening  yet detained me longer than I meant to stay  From the first of these circumstances  it must appear to Mr Arnold  that as I had come unwished for  she wanted to get rid of me  the latter obviously served her own purpose  for it is as clear as daylight that she laid her plan so as that Mr Arnold should find Mr Faulkland and me together  All this I have deduced from a long train of reasoning on the circumstances  But the inexplicable part of the mystery is how she contrived to get Mr Faulkland  with whom I did not think she was acquainted  to visit her at so fatally critical a juncture  Sure some evil spirit must have assisted her in this wicked scheme  she knew  no doubt  of the promise Mr Arnold had exacted of me  never to see him  The apparent breach of this promise  she may have art enough to persuade Mr Arnold was concerted on my side  But I hope I shall be able to clear myself of this cruel imputation to my husband  Truth must force its way into his mind  if he is not resolved on my destruction  Perhaps Mr Faulkland may be secretly Mrs Gerrarde’s admirer  and Mr Arnold is the dupe to her perfidy  as I am the sacrifice to her malice and licentiousness —’Tis all a strange riddle  but I cannot remain long in this dismal state of suspence  Mr Arnold  perhaps  may discover her treachery  while she is endeavouring to destroy me in his good opinion   I am waiting here like a poor criminal  in expectation of appearing before my judge  I wish Mr Arnold were come in  yet I dread to see him   I might have spared myself the anxiety  Mr Arnold is just returned  but he has locked himself into another chamber  I will not molest him tonight  to morrow  perhaps  he may be in better temper  and I may    be able to justify myself to him  and dispel this frightful gloom that hangs over us   September 13  Hopes and fears are at an end  and the measure of my afflictions is filled up   I went to bed last night  but slept not  the hours were passed in agonies not to be described  I think all griefs are magnified by silence and darkness  I well knew  prepossessed as Mr Arnold was by my artful enemy  I should find it difficult to excuse myself  or persuade him  that chance  or Mrs Gerrarde’s more wicked contrivance  had been the sole cause of what had given him such offence  I was resolved  however  to vindicate my innocence  and was  in my own thoughts  preparing my defence the greatest part of the night  Towards morning  weariness and grief overpowered me  and I fell asleep  but I enjoyed not this repose long  Some noise that was made in the house suddenly awakened me  I saw it was broad day  and looking at my watch  found it was past seven o’clock  I rang my bell  and Patty entering my room  I enquired if her
