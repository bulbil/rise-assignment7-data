to know were I am  Your house  madam  to Lady L  is to be my asylum —Then seeing me affected  Gentlest of human hearts  said she  what right have I thus to pain you  Well  Sir  drying her eyes  with looks too earnest for her health of mind  tell me  is any body else expected   Your cousins Sebastiano and Juliano  madam  but not the General   Thank Heaven for that —I love my brother Giacomo  But he is so determined a man —His own Lady only can soften his heart   Sir Charles  by his admirable address  made her tolerably easy by dinner time  on the subject of her friends expected arrival  And she once owned  that she should be transported with joy to see her Father  Mother  and Jeronymo  could she assure herself  that she could see them with forgiveness in their countenances   Sir Charles would only be attended at table by Saunders  whom she had seen in Italy  She was much pleased to have it so  but desired Laura might be permitted to attend at the back of her own chair   I addressed myself to Laura three of four times  as she stood  The Lady was pleased  And Laura seemed proud of my notice   Now and then an involuntary tear filled the Lady s eye  as she fat  It was easy to enter into her thoughts  p oor Lady  on her situation  She was grieved  she said  at the trouble she gave me  and frequently sought to suppress a sigh  Once  after a resverie of  few minutes  And am I here  said she  In England  At the house of the Chevalier Grandison  Can it be a  After dinner  Lady L  and she and I  retiring to   150 my drawing room  What a generous Lady  said she  are you  I was afraid to see you  before I saw you  But the moment I beheld you  I embraced a Sister  You will allow of my esteem of your Grandison   Of your Love  dear Lady Clementina  and thank you for it  A good man has an Interest in every good person s affections   Such generosity  snatching my hand with both hers  would confirm a doubtful goodness  But indeed my esteem for him always soared above person  You know I am a zealous Catholic  You know our doctrine of merits  I would have laid down my life to save his soul  But surely God will be merciful to such a man  and no less so to such a woman  as  putting her Arms about me  I have now the honour to embrace   Mercy  madam  said I  is the darling attribute of the Almighty  He is the God of all men   True—But—And was going to say something surther  but stopt on Sir Charles s entrance   Sir Charles  after sitting with us a little while  asked leave of absence for an hour  to look on his friends at Lord G s  We had a charming conversation in the mean time  Our subjects were various  The customs of Italian Ladies  and their surprising illiterateness in general  were parts of it  A woman there  it seems  who knew more than her own tongue  was a miracle till within these few years  that the French customs seem prevailing there  Why  madam  the Ladies of Italy  with genius s as fine as that classic climate ever produced  are immersed in the pleasures of sense  Singing  dancing  and conversation gallantry  take up their whole time  One would imagine  that their husbands and fathers thought them only children of this world  and not heirs of a better hope  by the little care taken in improving their understanding  And were it not for the religion of the country  which we call superstition  half the Italian   151 world of women would be looked upon merely as temporary idols for men to worship for temporary gratifications only  Yet in their conversation assemblies  men see what they are capable of  But their country  it seems  is in the same uncultivated state  as the minds of their women  The garden of the world  as Italy is called  is over run with weeds  And  for want of cultivation  the very richness of its soil becomes its disease  But these reflexions I draw rather by deduction from what Lady Clementia said  than from any direct confession of hers  She is fond of her country in its present state  But sensible English travellers speak of it as I have written   Sir Charles returned within his time  He is kind to be every where  for he is the life of every company  and of every individual   We passed a sweet evening together  and till near eleven o clock  Were Lady Clementina happy  how happy should we all be   Sir Charles waited on the Ladies home  Lord L  was by that time returned from Lord G s  but was the first of the friendly company that withdrew  Lady G  it seems  was all alive in every part of the ontertainment  My uncle Selby and she spared
