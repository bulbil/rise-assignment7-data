situation they were when she went  but without any   appearance of design  to meet her this morning at church as usuaL   As they came out together  my mistress  turning with her fair   friend  said she had some business in Long Acre  and asked her if   she went that way  to which the young lady innocently answered   that she did  and that she should be glad to walk with her      As they walked together  my mistress turned her conversation   on the wicked ways of the town  and particularly the many base   designs that were laid to ensnare unwary innocence  adding  that   all the pleasure which sensuality could give the most luxurious   heart  must fall infinitely short of what she felt at that very moment    in the design she was then going upon  of relieving the distresses   of a worthy family      She had timed her discourse so as to say these words just as she   came to the entrance of the court  in which she knew the widow   lived  when  feigning to slip  she fell all along  crying out  as in the   utmost agony  that she had wrenched her ankle      The lady raising her with the greatest tenderness  expressed   her concern for the unhappy accident  and desired she would submit   to be helped into her lodgings  which  fortunately  were at the next   door  where  though she could be but poorly accommodated  she   might be more at her ease than in a more sumptuous place  and   should have all the care in her power  This was just what my   mistress had schemed for  who  courteously accepting the offer    made a shift to limp in  without any other assistance than her s    It raised my indignation to see the tenderness with which the   beautiful young creature pulled off her shoe and stocking  and   chafed her ankle  thrown away upon so unworthy an object  as   it did my abhorrence to hear the counterfeit shrieks and groans of   my mistress  and the assurance with which she attributed the   swellings caused by debauchery to this immediate accident      This affrighted the young lady so  that she  in a manner  forced   her to send for a surgeon  which with much entreaty she yielded         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 77     to do   but it must be for a friend of her own  a gentleman who   lived a considerable way ofi  at the polite end of the town  for she   could not think of letting any common low lived fellow come near   her      Upon this a porter was directly dispatched for her own surgeon    and in the meantime  as she began to grow easier  she recovered   her spirits  and renewed the conversation that had been broken off   by this accident        I was telling  you  my dear friend    said she    for so I shall ever   call you from tliis moment  your kindness having completed the   conquest which your beauty had before made of my heart   I was   telling you that I was going to visit a family this morning  where   I promised myself the highest joy that a human heart is capable   of feeling  in lightening the distress of the virtuous  by sharing with   them some of that wealth which Heaven has abundantly blessed   me with  and which can justly be applied to no other use than   making this grateful return to that goodness which bestowed it        But my heart was too elate with the thought  and I received this   accident as a caution from Heaven not to flatter myself with any    thing so strongly for the future  But  though I could not have   this pleasure myself  the benefit shall not be delayed to them  I   will make you my almoner  an office that I know will suit the good    ness of your heart  You shall give this packet  which will put an   end to all their distresses         Oh  madam 1 your good opinion is the greatest honour to me      replied the lady    and I hope I shall never forfeit it  especially in   this commission  which I shall undertake with the most sincere   joy   but  pray  dear madam  who are the persons to whom I must   dispense your goodness           That s true  my dear    returned my mistress    I should give   you some account of them  that you may be the better enabled   to judge of the joy I feel in serving them  It is
