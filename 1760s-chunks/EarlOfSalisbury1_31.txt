pair of lovers with secret joy  and hoped  in them  to transmit their  names and little inheritances to succeeding times  They were betrothed   and but waited for the holy benediction to crown their wishes  when war  and tumult began to rage in England  John was then our king  he had  submitted  and was reconciled to the holy father  He had attempted to  recover his dominions in France  but  abandoned by his discontented  Nobles  he returned to his kingdom  full of vexation and revenge  Ah   Lady  little doth the highborn Courtier or the powerful Lord conceive  of that weight of misery which public dissentions heap upon the lowly  subject  The King marched like an enemy thro  the land  spoiling and  ravaging the estates of his wayward Barons  He arrived at Nottingham  where my Lord of Canterbury  at length  prevailed to stop his unfriendly  progress  He continued here for some time  his followers  secure in his  protection  and enriched by his bounty  little regarded the severe  limits which laws prescribe  Gay revellers they  who  full of mirth and  disport  beguiled the time in song and dance with courtly dames  One of  these glittering minions of royal favour perchance cast his wanton eyes  on Edyth  the maid betrothed to my son  Accursed be the hour  in which  he discovered and was enamoured with her beauty  He courted her in  gentle guise  with fair semblance of respect and decent love  he dazzled  her with a view of costly gifts  he promised much  he sighed often  and  sometimes wept  but all fruitless were his endeavours to conquer the  integrity of this honest maiden  Yet  not entirely displeased at his  flattering arts  she listened without terror  or abhorrence  whilst yet his purpose was not directly avowed  and  sometimes  yielding to his courtesy  suffered him to lead her forth  and  to amuse her ear with tales of courtly pleasures and splendor  The  jealous anxiety of Edmund ever watched their steps at wary distance    till at length  when this incautious maid had been conducted to a  secret path  when she suddenly found her helpless innocence at the mercy  of a luxurious courtier  when he boldly prest his suit  and attempted to  force her  trembling and dismayed  to his wicked purpose  her piercing  shrieks soon summoned a faithful deliverer to her side  Edmund  mad  with rage and jealousy  fatally smote the ravisher  and carelessly  leaving him weltering in blood  conveyed away his Edyth  who had fainted  with terror and surprize  and safely deposited his heart s dear treasure  in her father s dwelling             An event like this was not to be concealed  nor did the unhappy youth   now mad with passion  and deaf to the calls of prudence  fear to avow  his bloody deed freely and publicly  Soon was the body discovered  and  soon was Edmund seized  and torn from his frantic mistress  An armed  band hurried him away  with loud and tumultuous denunciations of  vengeance  when happily the King  now returning from the chace  descried  the rout  and dispatched an attendant to demand the cause of such  disorder  Of this he was instantly informed  and curious to learn the  occasion of such a presumptuous violence upon his officer  to view the  man who even boasted of his outrage  he ordered the criminal to be  brought before him  My son was now led forward  and as he prepared to  cast himself at the feet of his Liege  the fiery beast which the King  bestrode  frighted at the tumult  began to start and rear up with  ungovernable wildness  The attendants instantly alighted  but before  they could support their falling master  Edmund had burst like lightning  from the hands of his guards  broke his fall and remounted him  This  zeal and vigour were  beheld with wonder  and secret applause  The King himself was by no  means unaffected by the incident  His looks grew less severe  and in a  tone  not angry  but majestically grave  he demanded to know who he  was  and what had prompted him to this act of blood  My son kneeled  before him  modest but not abject  and with an ingenuous plainness and  freedom  related the unhappy cause that had provoked him to this  outrage  his love to the betrothed maid  the arts and treachery to which  she had been exposed  the horrid attempt of violation  and his own fatal  encounter with the King s officer  In a word  he ackowledged the crime   and with decent boldness declared himself resigned to the punishment   and prepared to yield up his forfeit life  The King listened with  attention  and in the natural and unaffected narrative saw the full  proof of all that had been alledged  With a sudden warmth  he swore by  the foot of God   his usual oath  that his servant had deservedly met  his sate  that
