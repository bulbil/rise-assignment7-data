enemy  but the temperate Mr  Trueworth seemed to take an   equal care to avoid hurting his rival  as to avoid being hurt by him    seeing  however  that he was about to make a furious push at him  he ran   in between  closed with him  and Mr  Staple s foot happening to slip  he   fell at full length upon the earth  his sword at the same time dropped   out of his hand  which Mr  Trueworth took up   The victory is yours     cried he   take also my life  for I disdain to keep it     No   replied   Mr  Trueworth   I equally disdain to take an advantage  which mere   chance has given me  rise  Sir  and let us finish the dispute between   us  as becomes men of honour   With these words he returned to him his   sword   I should be unworthy to be ranked among that number   said Mr    Staple  on receiving it   to employ this weapon against the breast    whose generosity restored it  were any thing but Miss Betsy at stake    but  what is life  what is even honour  without the hope of her  I   therefore accept your noble offer  and death or conquest be my lot     They then renewed the engagement with greater violence than before    after several passes  Mr  Trueworth s dexterity could not hinder him   from receiving a wound on his left side  but he gave the other  at the   same time  so deep a one in his right arm  that it deprived him in an   instant of the power of continuing the fight  on which Mr  Trueworth   dropping the point of his sword  ran to him   I am sorry  Sir   said he     for the accident that has happened  I see you are much hurt  permit me   to assist you as well as I am able  and attend you where proper care may   be taken of you     I do not deserve this goodness   answered Mr    Staple   but it is the will of Heaven that you vanquish every way        Mr  Trueworth then seeing the blood run quite down upon his hand    stripped up the sleeve  and bound the wound from which it issued  as   tight as he could with his handkerchief  after which they went together   to an eminent surgeon near Piccadilly  On examination of his wounds    neither that in his arm  nor in his breast  appeared to be at all   dangerous  the flesh being only pierced  and no artery or tendon   touched  Mr  Trueworth seemed only assiduous in his cares for the hurts   he had given his rival  without mentioning the least word of that which   he had received himself  till an elderly gentleman  who happened to be   with the surgeon when they came in  and had all the time been present    perceiving some blood upon the side of his coat  a little above the hip    cried out   Sir  you neglect yourself  I fear you have not escaped   unhurt     A trifle   said Mr  Trueworth   a mere scratch  I believe  it   is time enough to think of that   Nor would he suffer the surgeon    though he bled very fast  to come near him  till he had done with Mr    Staple  It was  indeed  but a slight wound which Mr  Trueworth had   received  though happening among a knot of veins  occasioned the   effusion of a pretty deal of blood  for the stopping of which the   surgeon applied an immediate remedy  and told him that it required   little for a cure besides keeping it from the air       Mr  Staple  who had been deeply affected with the concern this generous   enemy had expressed for him  was equally rejoiced at hearing the wound   he had given him would be attended with no bad consequences  Every thing   that was needful being done for both  the old gentleman prevailed upon   them to go with him to a tavern a few doors off  having first obtained   the surgeon s leave  who told him a glass or two of wine could be of no   prejudice to either       This good natured gentleman  who was called Mr  Chatfree  used to come   frequently to Mr  Goodman s house  had some knowledge of Mr  Staple    and  though he was wholly unacquainted with Mr  Trueworth  conceived so   great an esteem for him  from his behaviour towards the person he had   fought with  that he thought he could not do a more meritorious action    than
