the representation the graces of action   without which the choicest sentiments  clothed in the most exquisite  expression  would appear unanimated and insipid  but these are as  different from this ridiculous burlesque  as is the demeanour of a Tully  in the rostrum  from the tricks of a Jack pudding on a mountebank s  stage  And  for the truth of what I allege  I appeal to the observation  of any person who has considered the elegance of attitude and propriety  of gesture  as they are universally acknowledged in the real characters  of life  Indeed  I have known a Gascon  whose limbs were eloquent as  his tongue  he never mentioned the word sleep without reclining his  head upon his hand  when he had occasion to talk of a horse  he always  started up and trotted across the room  except when he was so situated  that he could not stir without incommoding the company  and in that case  he contented himself with neighing aloud  If a dog happened to be the  subject of his conversation  he wagged his tail  and grinned in a  most significant manner  and one day he expressed his desire of going  backwards with such natural imitation of his purpose  that everybody in  the room firmly believed he had actually overshot himself  and fortified  their nostrils accordingly  Yet no man ever looked upon this virtuoso to  be the standard of propriety in point of speaking and deportment  For  my own part  I confess the player in question would  by dint of these  qualifications  make a very good figure in the character of Pantaloon s  lacquey  in the entertainment of  Perseus and Andromeda   and perhaps  might acquire some reputation  by turning  the Revenge  into a  pantomime  in which case  I would advise him to come upon the stage   provided with a handful of flour  in order to besmear his face when he  pronounces  pale and aghast   etc   and methinks he ought to illustrate  the adder with a hideous hiss  But let us now come to the other  situation  in which this modern Aesopus is supposed to distinguish  himself so much  I mean that same eclaircissement comprehended in  Know  then   twas  I   His manner  I own  may be altered since I was present  at the representation of that performance  but certain I am  when I  beheld him in that critical conjuncture  his behaviour appeared to me  so uncouth  that I really imagined he was visited by some epileptic  distemper  for he stood tottering and gasping for the space of two  minutes  like a man suddenly struck with the palsy  and  after various  distortions and side shakings  as if he had got fleas in his doublet   heaved up from his lungs the letter I  like a huge anchor from foul  ground    This criticism was acceptable to the majority of the college  who had  no great veneration for the player in question  and his admirer  without  making any reply  asked in a whisper  of the gentleman who sat next to  him  if Pickle had not offered some production to the stage  and met  with a repulse   CHAPTER XCV    The young Gentleman is introduced to a Virtuoso of the first Order  and  commences Yelper     6 22 15  3 45 PM   Hitherto Peregrine had professed himself an author  without reaping the  fruits of that occupation  except the little fame he had acquired by  his late satire  but now he thought it high time to weigh solid pudding  against empty praise  and therefore engaged with some booksellers in  a certain translation  which he obliged himself to perform for the  consideration of two hundred pounds  The articles of agreement being  drawn  he began his task with great eagerness  rose early in the morning  to his work  at which he laboured all day long  went abroad with the  bats in the evening  and appeared in the coffee house  where he amused  himself with the newspapers and conversation till nine o clock  then he  retired to his own apartment  and  after a slight repast  betook himself  to rest  that he might be able to unroost with the cock  This sudden  change from his former way of life agreed so ill with his disposition   that  for the first time  he was troubled with flatulencies and  indigestion  which produced anxiety and dejection of spirits  and the  nature of his situation began in some measure to discompose his brain  a  discovery which he no sooner made  than he had recourse to the advice of  a young physician  who was a member of the college of authors  at this  time one of our hero s most intimate acquaintance   The son of Esculapius  having considered his case  imputed his disorder  to the right cause  namely  want of exercise  dissuaded him from such  close application to study  until he should be gradually familiarized  to a sedentary life  advised him to enjoy his friend and his bottle in
