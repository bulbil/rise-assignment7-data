husband at this part of the story  pursued Lady V——  and told him  that to my knowledge Mr Faulkland had gone to Sidney Castle  to see Sir George Bidulph  before you left your own house  and did not set out from thence on his return ’till about three weeks after your separation  at the account of which he was exceedingly surprized   Dear Lady V——  said he  do you think I now want any farther arguments to convince me what an injurious wretch I have been to the best of women   I have one observation to make to you  Mr Arnold  added I  which is  that your lady’s misfortune was intirely owing to her great delicacy  and the nice regard she had to your peace and honour   I do not understand you  Madam  he replied   Know then  said I  that your wife was well acquainted with your connection with Mrs Gerrarde  from the very night that you found her at the public house  to which the accident that happened to her obliged her to go  She owned to me  at the time you drove her from her home  that she had discovered your amour from a conversation she overheard that night between you and Mrs Gerrarde  This I extorted from her  by letting her know I was no stranger to the intrigue  I then repeated to him the discourse that passed between him and that wicked woman  as far as you had told me  and he very well remembered it  Now  Mr Arnold  said I  to prove the assertion I made in regard to your lady  had she reproached you with your infidelity  as some wives would have done  tho’ it might have occasioned a temporary uneasiness to you both  yet would it have prevented her from falling a sacrifice to that most artful and wicked of her sex  for you could not then have had such an improbable falshood imposed on you  as that Mrs Arnold would have made choice of the mistress of her husband for a confidant  and fix on her house as the rendezvous for a love intrigue  The base woman herself had no reason  from Mrs Arnold’s prudent and gentle behaviour  to think she was suspected by her   Your husband lifted up his eyes to heaven  and striking his breast  Blind  blind wretch  he cried  infatuated  ungrateful monster  are there no amends—no amends in thy power for such goodness   I could not bear such a description of my poor Mr Arnold’s deep contrition  I stopped Lady V——  and  being now informed of all I wanted to know  changed the conversation     December 22  We are preparing to get into the country with all speed  I have writ to Patty to set out with the two children for Sidney Castle as soon as possible  Mr Arnold has put his affairs intirely into the hands of our worthy friend Lord V——  and we think  upon a calculation  that what we have in town  at South Park  and at Arnold Abbey  will go near to answer the present demands that are upon us   Lady V—— is the best creature living  she knows that neither Mr Arnold nor I chuse to see any visitors  and she has let none in these two days  I am vexed at laying her under such a restraint  though her good nature will not suffer her to think it one  We shall go out of town on Monday  to morrow we spend with my mother  as do Lord and Lady V——  who are mightily charmed with her   and then adieu to London  perhaps for ever  If my mother comes down to me  as she intends to do  I shall have no temptation ever to return to it   Sidney Castle  December 29   Here I am  my dear  in the house of my nativity  Your Sidney and her Arnold as happy as a king and a queen  or  to speak more properly  happier than any king or queen in Christendom  My two dear little girls are well  thank God  and look charmingly  Poor babes  they could have no idea of their loss when I left them  yet they now seem pleased at seeing me again  My faithful Patty is almost out of her wits with joy  I have no maid but her  and an honest servant  whom my mother left here to look after her house  Mr Arnold has retained but one of his men  the garden is taken care of by an old man in the neighbourhood  to whom my mother allows something for keeping it in order   With what delight do I recall the days of my childhood  which I passed here so happily  You  my dear Cecilia  mix yourself in all my thoughts  every spot almost brings you fresh into my memory  The little filbert wood  the summer house  the mount  and the chestnut close that you used to love so  but the sight of your old dwelling makes me melancholy  I think I could not bear to go into the house  the deserted avenue to me appears much darker than it used to do  and your poor doves are all flying about wild  and I think seem to mourn the
