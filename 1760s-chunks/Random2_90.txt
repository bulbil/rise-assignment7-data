   How d ye do  doctor    He then turned towards us  and honoured Jackson with a particular salutation  upon which my friend  in a formal manner  introduced him to me  by the name of Mr  Melopoyn —This ceremony being over  he advanced into the middle of the congregation  which crowded around him  and hemming three times  to my utter astonishment  pronounced with great significance of voice and gesture  a very elegant and ingenious discourse upon the difference between genius and taste  illustrating his assertions with apt quotations from the best authors  ancient as well as modern  When he had finished his harangue  which lasted a full hour  he bowed again to the spectators  not one of whom  I was informed  understood so much as a sentence of what he uttered  They manifested  however  their admiration and esteem by voluntary contribution  which  Jackson told me  one week with another  amounted to eighteen pence —This moderate stipend  together with some small presents that he received for making up differences  and deciding causes amongst the prisoners  just enabled him to breathe and walk about in the grotesque figure I have described —I understood also  that he was an excellent poet  and had composed a tragedy  which was allowed  by every body who had seen it  to be a performance of great merit  that his learning was infinite  his morals unexceptionable  and his modesty invincible —Such a character could not fail of attracting my regard  I longed   271 impatiently to be better acquainted with him  and desired Jackson would engage him to spend the evening in my apartment —My request was granted  he favoured us with his company  and in the course of our conversation  perceiving that I was not illiterate  and that I had a strong passion for the Belle Lettres  acquitted himself so well on that subject  that I expressed a servent desire of seeing his productions —In this too be gratified my inclination —he promised to bring his tragedy to my room next day  and  in the mean time  entertained me with some detach d pieces  which gave me a very advantageous idea of his poetical talent —Among other things I was particularly pleased with some elegies  in imitation of Tibullus  one of which I beg leave to submit to the reader  as a specimen of his complexion and capacity   I   WHere now are all my flatt ring dreams of joy   Monimia  give my soul her wonted rest —  Since first thy beauty fix d my roving eye   Heart gnawing cares corrode my pensive breast   II   Let happy lovers fly where pleasures call   With festive songs beguile the fleeting hour   Lead beauty thro  the mazes of the ball   Or press her wanton in love s roseate bow r     272III   For me  no more I ll range th  empurpled mead   Where shepherds pipe  and virgins dance around   Nor wander thro  the woodbine s fragrant shade   To hear the music of the grove resound   IV   I ll seek some lonely church  or dreary hall   Where fancy paints the glimm ring taper blue   Where damps hang mould ring on the ivy d wall   And sheeted ghosts drink up the midnight dew   V   There leagu d with hopeless anguish and despair   A while in silence o er my fate repine   Then  with a long farewel to love and care   To kindred dust my weary limbs consign   VI   Wilt thou  Monimia  shed a gracious tear  On the cold grave where all my sorrows rest   Wilt thou strew flow rs  applaud my love sincere   And bid the turf lie light upon my breast     I was wonderfully affected with this pathetic complaint  which seem d so well calculated for my own disappointment in love  that I could not help attaching the idea of Narcissa to the name   273 of Monimia  and of forming such melancholy presages of my passion  that I could not recover my tranquility  and was fain to have recourse to the bottle  which prepared me for a profound sleep that I would not otherwise have enjoyed —Whether these impressions invited and introduced a train of other melancholy reflections  or my fortitude was all exhausted in the effort I made against despondence  the first day of my imprisonment  I cannot determine  but I awaked in the horrors  and found my imagination haunted with such dismal apparitions  that I was ready to despair —and believe the reader will own  that I had no great cause to congratulate myself  when I considered my situation —I was interrupted in the midst of these gloomy apprehensions by the arrival of Strap  who contributed not a little to the re establishment of my peace  by letting me know that he had hired himself as a journeyman barber  by which means he would not only save me a considerable expence  but even make shift to lay up something for my subsistence after my money should be spent  in case I should not be relieved before     274  CHAP  LXII    I read Melopogn s tragedy  and conceive a vast opinion of
