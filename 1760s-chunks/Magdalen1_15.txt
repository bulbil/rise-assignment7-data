restoration of her father s tranquility   During the short time allowed us to take leave  we agreed that she should go to her cousin Darnel s in London  as Mrs  Darnel is a very grave woman  and has some obligations to our family  which must render her additionally solicitous about Louisa s accommodation —There  if her unhappy lapse should be   88 attended with any consequences  she will be sure of tenderness and secrecy  I have packed up all her cloaths and her little ornaments  and  in one of her trunks  shall send up  unknown to her father  a bank note of five hundred pounds  This will maintain her till I find whether there is a possibility of prevailing on Mr  Mildmay to overlook her fault—If  as I much apprehend  a reconcilation with him will be extremely difficult  I must make her what remittances I can  as he will never think those entitled to any instances of his bounty whom he makes the objects of his resentment   Such  my dear lady Haversham  is the present situation of your unfortunate friend  Your cruel  your inhuman brother  may  perhaps  triumph in the desolation which he has occasioned  and  like the generality of low minded libertines  imagine that  in proportion as she   89 has aggravated the distresses of a family that sincerely loved and esteemed him  he has made a fresh acquisition to the importance of his character —You  I know  will heartily sympathize in our afflictions—You are his sister  but not the abettor of his crimes—and therefore  I am persuaded  every thing in your power will be done  to procure us the most effectual redress   The only redress which we can now have  is an instant renewal of the late treaty  which your brother so cruelly disturbed  About two hours before I first heard of Louisa s illness  it seems he rode away from this upon a pretended visit to the earl of A—  but  as he has never been heard of since  I suppose he is in London by this time  entertaining his dissolute companions with the destruction of poor Louisa Mildmay  O  lady Haversham  don t you wonder   90 that  in such a distraction of mind  I am able to write with the least method or propriety  The power of recollection  however  is a faculty which is no way enviable in the wretched  and those who have unhappily lost their peace of mind  ought  in my opinion  to wish for an immediate loss of understanding   Notwithstanding my indignation at your brother s barbarity  lady Haversham  I am nevertheless ready to overlook every thing which has happened  if he comes down again and re establishes  as far as he yet can  the repose of our family—Louisa I am sure must doat with the most extravagant fondness on him  or she never could have made such a sacrifice—her forgiveness  therefore  especially if I interest myself in the affair  is not very difficult to be obtained  and  perhaps  Mr  Mildmay  when he sees that there is no other course to   91 follow  may be brought to abate a little of his resentment  My reason for being thus anxious for an accommodation of this unhappy affair  is a fear  lest  when my son comes to hear of it  he may take some desperate revenge  which will involve us in new calamities—You know he is brave to a fault  and piques himself excessively on the dignity of his profession  and the reputation of his family  Should he  therefore  think of calling your brother to an account  I may possibly be robbed of both my children  and may have the murder of my daughter s honour inconceivably aggravated by the timeless death of my son   The same consideration  lady Haversham  which renders me anxious for the preservation of a son  must naturally influence your conduct for the safety of a   92 brother  even admitting that a person of your ladyship s well known benevolence should  upon so affecting an occasion  be cold to the dictates of justice  or the feelings of humanity  You will consequently  exert your utmost power with your brother to renew the treaty lately carried on  and try all your interest with Mr  Mildmay in favour of Louisa  Who knows  my dear lady Haversham  but Providence may yet have some hours of peace in store for an unhappy mother  and enable her to look once more with chearfulness upon her family  This letter have dispatched by a special messenger  as I wanted to send you the jewels  which your brother a few days ago presented to Louisa  and which  at parting  the poor girl left with me for that purpose  Your ladyship s good sense will immediately see the propriety of returning them  and  I dare say  do me   93 the justice to think that I consider the encessity which has occasioned that return  as the greatest misfortune that ever yet befel your ladyship s  Sincerely devoted  But unspeakably afflicted  HORATIA MILDMAY     94  LETTER VIII  Sir ROBERT HAROLD to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    YOU are no doubt impatient  my dear Charles  from the nature of my last letter  to hear in what manner
