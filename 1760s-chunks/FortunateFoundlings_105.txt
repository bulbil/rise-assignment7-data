warrior  his   blooming years  and the gracefulness of his person  contributed not a   little also towards rendering every thing he said more agreeable  Her   liking of him grew by degrees into a friendship  no less tender than   that one feels for very near relations  and who have never done any   thing to disoblige us  are more endeared by being under undeserved   calamity  but as the inclination she had for him was perfectly innocent    and no ways prejudicial to the prince who was in possession of her   person  she made no secret of it either to himself or those she   conversed with  and was always talking of the wit  delicacy  and   handsomeness of one of those prisoners  whom it was well known were   pensioners to her bounty  But how dangerous is it to be too open before   persons who  void of all true generosity  or the lead principle of   honour themselves  never fail to put the worst construction on the   actions of others  Edella was very near being undone by her sincerity in   acknowledging the distinction she paid to merit  or the compassion she   felt for misfortunes  in a country where humanity to enemies is looked   upon as a crime  friendship to those of the same party altogether   unknown  and even common civility never practised but for the   gratification of self interest  or some favourite passion       This beautiful Polander however being treated by the Muscovites  on   account of the influence she had over the prince Menzikoff  with as much   complaisance as it was in their power to shew  imagined their   disposition less savage than it was in reality  and when she testified   the pity she had for those unhappy gentlemen  it was with design to   excite it in others  and engage them to join with her in petitioning the   czar  at his return  for their enlargement  there being no cartel or   exchange of prisoners subsisting between him and the king of Sweden       Among the number she hoped to gain to her party was Mattakesa  the   relique of a general who had been in great favour with his prince  This   lady  who could speak French  having learned it of a recusant that took   shelter in Russia  consented to go with her one day to the prison  and   no sooner saw Horatio  than  unfortunately for him  Edella  and herself    she became charmed with him  as she was of the number of those who think   nothing a crime that suits their own inclination  she took not the least   pains to subdue the growing passion  but rather indulged it  in order to   receive the highest degree of pleasure in the gratification  She doubted   not but Edella was her rival  and that it was for his sake alone she had   been so beneficent to his fellow sufferers  to supplant her  therefore    was the first step she had to take  and she resolved to omit nothing for   that purpose             CHAP  XX        The treachery of a Russian lady to her friend  her passion for Horatio    the method he took to avoid making any return  and some other   entertaining occurrences        It is easy to believe that Horatio  tho  relieved from that extremity of   misery he suffered while in the dungeon  was far from being able to   content himself with his present condition   a thousand times he   reproached himself for pursuing the dictates of a glory which now seemed   so tyrannic   Have I  cried he  hazarded the eternal displeasure of the   best of men   refused the invitation of the adorable   Charlotta   slighted the condescentions of her father   been deaf both   to interest and love  to become a prisoner to the worst of   barbarians   Who now will pity me   Or if they yet would be so good  how   shall I acquaint them with my wretched fate   Nay  were there even a   possibility of that  what would the compassion of the whole world avail    since a slave to those  who  contrary to the law of nations  and even   common humanity  refuse  on any terms  to release the wretches fallen   into their savage power       In this manner did he bewail himself night and day  and indeed had but   too just reasons for doing so   he had heard that the last time the czar   had been at Petersburg  he had sent all the prisoners he had then taken   to Siberia  and other province of the greater Tartary  where they were   compelled  without any distinction  to do the work of horses rather than   men  and doubted
