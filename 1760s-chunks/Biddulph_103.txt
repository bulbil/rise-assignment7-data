in any other light than that of confining a wild beast  who  having already done a great deal of mischief  would still do more  if left at liberty  but I think I shall not be driven to this  I believe she will accept of a husband with a good settlement  sooner than resign her liberty   And now who do you think the husband is whom I have under contemplation for her  Why  no less a man than my valet de chambre Monsieur Pivet  He is young and handsome  of good parts  and a man of birth  He tells me he has an uncle that is a marquis  and three or four cousins that are in the high court of parliament  Without a joke  the fellow is of a pretty good family  he was bred a mercer  and in a frolic had run away from his business  when I picked him up at Paris  at the time you and I were there together  He then told me  that he only hired with me for an opportunity of seeing a little of the world  and that he would one time or other sit down and settle to his trade  I have sounded him on the point  and find him very ready to accept of the lady with all her faults   I told you I introduced him to Mrs Gerrarde  to serve as her interpreter in the house  at the time I was ill  I did not then tell her who he was  and both she and her maid take him for no other than an acquaintance of mine  who happens to lodge in the same house with us  The vain rogue has encouraged this opinion  and I suppose passes for a very pretty fellow with them  for you know Pivet is a Beau  and is really not ungenteel  But do not fancy that I intend to impose him on the lady for any other than what he really is  All disguise is now laid aside  and I shall proceed with the utmost plainness and sincerity  as soon as I know the lady’s mind in regard to her choice   Here  my dear Sir George  I must take breath a little  it has been a busy day  I undertook a difficult voyage without the certainty of a    landing place  a few storms I expected to encounter  I hope I have weathered the worst  and have come at length to some prospect of an harbour  I expect my next greeting to you will be from a fairer shore —Upon second thoughts  I will not send this off  till I can put both you and myself out of the reach of suspence      Congratulate me  Sir George  honour me  as the first of politicians  the greatest of negotiators  Let no hero of romance compare himself to me  for first making difficulties  and then extricating myself out of them  let no giant pretend to equal me in the management of captive beauties in inchanted castles  let no necromancer presume to vie with me in skill for metamorphosing tigresses into doves  and changing imperious princesses into plain country nymphs  All this I have brought to pass  without the assistance of enchanted sword or dwarf  in the compass of a few days  but take the circumstances in the order they occurred   I left the lady  as I told you  to utter her complaints to her confidante  Rachael  a simple girl  who had just sense enough to regard her own interest  was not likely to give her mistress much consolation  for she was at least as much my friend as her’s  How they passed the night I know not  for my own part  I slept in perfect tranquillity  I desired Pivet in the morning to go and inquire  as from himself  how the lady rested  Mrs Gerrarde  who was still in bed  no sooner heard his voice in the outer room  as he was speaking to her maid  than she called out to Monsieur Pivet  and desired he would be so good as to step into her chamber  Pivet  not much abashed at being admitted to a lady’s ruèlle  obeyed her summons  and placed himself in an armed chair by her  He said he hoped it was not owing to illness that he saw her in bed  Yes  Sir  said she  I am exceedingly ill  I have not slept the whole night  and am now in a high fever  Has Mr Faulkland told you any thing in relation to me  I had prepared Pivet  and he had his answers ready  Madam  said he  I am not a stranger to your situation  and am exceedingly sorry for it  I wish the little influence I have over Mr Faulkland could be employed for your service  but he is a positive man  very enterprising  and not to be controlled by any body  Do you know my story  Sir  cried Mrs Gerrarde  He bowed  and looked down  Mrs Gerrarde understanding this as an affirmative  and raising herself up a little  cried out  A base  ungenerous man  Does he intend to expose me wherever he goes  By no means  Madam  answered Pivet  there is nothing in your story that would do you
