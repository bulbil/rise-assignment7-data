must at last obtain the wish of her soul  Oh  my Cecilia  I would not have my heart devoured by such a flame as her’s  for the whole world  But have I not acted as I should do  I hope I have  I feel satisfied with my own conduct  and I never yet found that to be the case when I acted wrong  There are some nice points  in which our own hearts are the best  as well as the most impartial judges  If Mr Faulkland persists in rejecting poor Miss Burchell  I can urge him no farther  but I am determined not to see him     June 25  How uneasy has been my suspense these three days  I question if Miss Burchell’s is much greater  No answer from this strange man  perhaps he is flown off again —No  I wrong him  a letter is this minute brought up to me from him—Read it  my beloved  and congratulate me   ‘You were born to conquer  Madam  what is there that you cannot effect  My heart was made for you  and you can mould it as you please  Enjoy your triumph  if it be one  I will receive Miss Burchell as your gift  and since I cannot obtain your love  I will at least compel your esteem  Why should your generosity  your compassion for an unhappy lady  to whom you have no obligation  exceed that of a man who owns himself bound to her in gratitude  I wish I could repay her the debt of love I owe her  but I will try to repair my fault hereafter  and in her gentle bosom perhaps I may recover that peace  to which I have been so long a stranger  She will forgive the waywardness of a heart  which never disguised its anguish to her  and which she knows has been torn by a cruel passion  that  like a cruel disease  was not either to be resisted or subdued  But thanks to you  Madam  I think I begin to feel my cure approaching  Miss Burchell’s tenderness will finish what you have begun  You shall never reproach me more  if I ever had an interest in your heart  I will not forfeit it now  but make that proud heart acknowledge  spite of itself  that Faulkland was not unworthy of it ’  Ha  my Cecilia  what do you say to my Orlando now  My Orlando let me this once call him  Has he not a noble mind  Happy  happy Miss Burchell  you are at length arrived to the summit of your wishes  Long may you enjoy them  and may you make your love as blest as he deserves to be  My mother clasped her hands together in joy  when I read this letter to her  God bless him  God bless him  said she  he is now indeed a righteous man  How rejoiced I am  my dear  that I have been the means of bringing about his so much wished for event  And yet  methinks  if I were in Miss Burchell’s place  though my heart doated on the man to death  I could not receive him on such terms  He accepts her as my gift  it is to raise himself in my esteem  he does her justice  Nay  I think the assuming    man seems to insinuate a sort of superiority over me  by this concession  Why let it be so  I shall be content in my humiliation  if my gift will restore him to his peace  If it does  which I pray heaven it may  ought he not to think himself indebted to me   I think I should not let Miss Burchell see this last letter  he does not consent with a good grace  and it may damp her joy  Though  upon second thoughts  I question whether she has delicacy enough to be much affected by this circumstance     I am saved the trouble of observing any decorum towards Miss Burchell  She has been just here wild with transport  and was several minutes in the room before I could get her to speak coherently  She had received a letter from Mr Faulkland  written by his own angelic hand  she said  She made no difficulty of leaving it with me  and here it is   Mr Faulkland’s letter to Miss Burchell   ‘Is it possible  Madam  that I can still be dear to you  careless and remiss as I have been towards you  since you first honoured me with your affection  If you can forgive this  I am ready to offer you my hand  and hope  by devoting my future days to you  to make you amends for those years  during which  deserving as you are  I have withheld that heart which was your due   ‘I never had any merit towards you but my sincerity  and I will not now give up that virtue to arrogate to myself another to which I have no title  I own to you  Madam  that it is to Mrs Arnold’s superior prudence  and nice honour  I am beholden for being brought to a just sense of your worth  and my own obligations to you  If you will give me leave to attend
