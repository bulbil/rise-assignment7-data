the same condition in which he found her  she was then   going to a nunnery  and it is now his duty to send her to one  for it   cannot be expected her father will make a second offer of that sort        With these reflections  together with others on the manner in which it   would be most proper to address Mr  Thoughtless on this score  was her   mind taken up  till the hour she imagined he might be stirring  the   disturbances which must necessarily have happened in his family the   night before  made her suppose he might lie longer than usual  but she   chose rather to wait a while for his rising  than hazard losing the   opportunity of speaking to him by his being gone abroad       That gentleman had  in fact  passed the most disagreeable night he had   ever known  he had loved Mademoiselle de Roquelair with such an   extravagance of fondness  that he had sometimes been even prompted by it   to marry her  but the too great warmth of her constitution  and the   known inconstancy of her temper  as often deterred him from it  and also   made him restrain her from any of those liberties he would otherwise   have allowed her  he had thought himself no less secure of her person   than she always pretended he was of her heart  and now to find all his   tenderness for her abused  all his precautions frustrated  might well   raise in him passions of the most desperate kind       The inclinations of this woman were  in reality  too vicious to be bound   by any obligations  or withheld from their gratifications  by any of the   methods taken for that purpose  she loved variety  she longed for   change  without consulting whether the object was suitable or not  the   mercer had a person and address agreeable enough  he was of an amorous   complexion  and readily improved the advances she made him  he   frequently came to her under the pretence of bringing patterns of silks    or other things in his way of trade  and all this  as she imagined    without raising any suspicion in the family  No interruption happening   in their repeated interviews  she sometimes kept him with her till near   the hour in which Mr  Thoughtless usually came home  which was seldom   till one or two o clock       But on this unlucky night it so fell out that a very ill run of play    and the loss of all the money he had about him  brought him home much   sooner than was his custom  a servant being at the door  prevented his   knocking  so that the lovers had not the least notice how near he was to   them  He went directly into his dressing room  which was backwards on   the ground floor  and sat musing for some time  casting up the sums he   had lost  cursing fortune within himself  and protesting never to touch   a card or throw a dice again  when  on a sudden  he was alarmed with the   sound of a man s voice laughing very heartily  he stamped with his foot    and a servant immediately coming up   Is there any company above     demanded he  hastily   None  Sir  but the mercer that comes to Madam   with silks   replied the man   A mercer at this time of night   cried   Mr  Thoughtless   How long has he been here     I cannot tell exactly    Sir   said he   but  I believe  three or four hours     A long visit    and on business too   resumed Mr  Thoughtless  and  after a little   pause   Go   continued he   bid Mademoiselle de Roquelair come down to   me        If this unfaithful woman had been but mistress of artifice enough to   have made any one of the family her friend  she would certainly have   been told that Mr  Thoughtless was come home  and her gallant might   easily have slipt out of the house without his knowledge  but  on the   contrary  her imperious behaviour towards them  set them all in general   against her  this fellow in particular  whom she had used worse than the   rest  rejoiced that his master was likely to find out what he wished him   to know  but never durst acquaint him with       On his going up stairs  he found they were shut in the bed chamber  and    running to his master with this account   Locked in the chamber   said   Mr  Thoughtless  starting up   Yes  Sir   answered the servant   and
