will descend to meannesses   and  if he should see my prohibition  he would be satisfied that his servant was too free in her censures  I am sure he is quite unconcerned at my knowing his conduct  but I would not  nevertheless  for my children’s sake  bring this tender  faithful  poor creature into disgrace with him  by convincing him of the liberty she takes  though he may very naturally suspect it   October 30  A lady of our acquaintance  who happened to see me at church  came to pay me a visit to day  It seems  she is intimate with the widow Arnold  who told her  very lately  that she was impatient for the commencement of term  as she then expected the cause depending between her and us would be brought to a final issue  and determined intirely in her child’s favour  This account alarmed my poor mother so much  that she could not be easy till she sent for our lawyer  who was so obliging as to come upon the first summons  She    acquainted him with the cause of her apprehensions  and asked him  whether there was any likelihood of the widow’s succeeding  He laughed at my mother’s fears  and at our antagonist’s flourishes  as he called them  and said  he would not give a bent six pence to ensure Mr Arnold’s estate to him  which the ensuing term  he says  will put out of the reach of doubt  This assurance has quieted our anxiety on that head  The loss of our suit would indeed be a dreadful blow  as we should have nothing then remaining but my small jointure  for the support of Mr Arnold  myself  and our two children  not to mention Mrs Gerrarde  who  I have reason to believe  has been no inconsiderable sharer in Mr Arnold’s fortune   November 4  Six melancholy weeks are gone since I have been here  I may say  both a prisoner  and a fugitive  I count the days as they pass  as if I expected some revolution in my fate  yet  whence is it to come  No prospect as yet opens to me  Mr Arnold’s law affairs will soon call him to town  something may then happen—But does not Mrs Gerrarde come too  He cannot live without her  and I shall reap no benefit from this  but the chance of seeing my children sometimes perhaps  though he may not bring them with him  or  if he does  he may be cruel enough to refuse me the sight of them  Sir George is cold and dilatory  were he on the spot  something might be done  he might expostulate  my mother too could join arguments to intreaties  Mr Arnold perhaps might be recovered from his delusion  it is but a perhaps   November 15  My brother is arrived in town sooner than we expected  and came this evening to pay us a visit  My altered and dejected looks  I believe  shocked him  but George wants tenderness  or at least a capacity of shewing it  After a recapitulation of my story  he asked me  ‘Could I be so mean spirited a creature as ever to think of living with Arnold again  even though he should be inclined to desire it ’ I told him  he considered the matter in a wrong light  and that he ought to reflect on my reputation  and the future welfare of my two poor little girls  who would be material sufferers  from the want of my care and attention  as they grew up  not to mention the disadvantages they would enter life with  by my continuing under an aspersion which might in time become very public  as I made no doubt but that Mrs    Gerrarde would take pains to propagate it wherever she went  My mother added  Mr Arnold too might be saved from perdition  if he could be so far convinced of his wife’s innocence  as to be reconciled to her  and live with her again  And pray  said Sir George  how is this to be done  if that damned woman has put it into his head  that Faulkland and you are fond of one another  Do you imagine that he will believe what you say  what your brother  or your mother  or even Faulkland himself  could say to the contrary  I own to you very fairly  that I so much despise the man  that  unless you will give me leave to talk to him my own way  I will have nothing to say to him at all  Would you have me sue to him for a reconciliation  and try to persuade him out of the belief of an imaginary injury  which probably he was glad to make a handle of to get rid of you  No  Sidney  you may be as tame as you please yourself  but it does not become your brother to be so  When I go to him  I must insist upon not having rules prescribed to me  your delicacy  in regard to Faulkland’s asserting your innocence  I have nothing to say against  but there can be no objection to your brother’s vindicating the honour of his family  I saw Sir George’s resentment was rouzed to the highest pitch
