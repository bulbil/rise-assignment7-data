from taking any measures  either to invalidate   the evidence of the witnesses  or prevail upon them to abscond when the   proof of what they had sworn against her should be expected  The whole   detection of her guilt was designed to come at once upon her like a   thunderclap  and thereby all the little efforts of artifice and   chicanery to which she  doubtless  would otherwise have had recourse  be   rendered of no use  nor give the least impediment to justice       Accordingly  this zealous assertor of his client s cause went to visit   her  as of his own good will  flattered her with the hope that her   husband would soon be prevailed upon to take her home again  and lent   her several small sums of money to supply her necessities  saying  at   the same time  that when matters were made up between them  and all was   over  he very well knew that Mr  Goodman would return it to him with   thanks       This strategem had the effect it was intended for  it not only kept her   from attempting any thing of the nature above mentioned  but also from   running Mr  Goodman into debt  which certainly she might have done  on   some pretence or other  in spite of all the care and means that could   have been taken to destroy her credit       It must be acknowledged  indeed  that acting in this manner was a   prodigious piece of dissimulation  but  at the same time  it must be   acknowledged also  that it was abundantly justified by the cause  and   practised for the most laudable end  to serve an honest  worthy    gentleman  his friend and client  against a woman who had wronged him in   the tenderest point  and who was capable of making use of the vilest   methods to elude the punishment her crimes deserved  and  as a great   author tells us             It is a kind of stupid honesty        Among known knaves  to play upon the square        Lady Mellasin  however  was lulled into so perfect a security by her   dependance on the good nature of her husband  and the tender affection   he had always shewn to her  as well as by the high character she had   always heard of the lawyer s veracity  that she was more easy than could   have been expected in a woman of her situation  even though it had been   as she was made to believe       She received  and returned  with her usual politeness and gaiety  the   visits that were made her by all those who thought proper to continue an   acquaintance with her  she pretended that it was only a little family   contest that had separated her from Mr  Goodman for a short time  and   always mentioned him with so much kindness and respect  as made every   one believe there was nothing between them but what would be easily made   up       This was  indeed  the most prudent method she could take  not only to   preserve her own reputation to the world  but also to give Mr  Goodman a   high idea of her conduct  if what she said should happen to be repeated   to him       She was every day in expectation that  through her own good management    and the intercession of the lawyer  whom she now took to be her staunch   friend  all would be over  and she should be recalled home  when a   citation to appear before the doctors of the civil law was delivered to   her by an officer belonging to that court       It is more easy to conceive than describe her distraction at so   unlooked for a turn  she now found that her intrigue with Marplus was   discovered  and that all she had to dread was like to fall upon her by   that event  her perplexity was also greatly increased by her not being   able to find out by whom  or by what means  she had been betrayed  she   sent immediately in search of Marplus  whom  since his arresting Mr    Goodman  she had never once seen nor heard any thing of  but all the   information she could get of him was  that he had been thrown into   prison by Mr  Goodman  and  after confinement of a few days  had been   released  and was gone nobody knew where  but  as it was supposed  out   of England  that his wife had likewise removed from her lodgings  but   whether with an intention to follow him or not  no certain intelligence   could be given       As this
