Hatchway  should purchase of him the garrison with its appendages  which  at a  moderate price  would sell for more money than would be sufficient to  discharge his debts  that  if the servile subordination of the army  did not suit his inclinations  he might  with his reversion  buy a  comfortable annuity  and retire with him to the country  where he might  live absolutely independent  and entertain himself  as usual  with the  ridiculous characters of mankind   This plan was to Pickle less disagreeable than any other project which  as yet had been suggested  and the lieutenant declared himself ready to  execute his part of it without delay  but the soldier was mortified at  the thoughts of seeing his assistance unnecessary  and eagerly objected  to the retirement  as a scheme that would blast the fairest promises  of fame and fortune  and bury his youth and talents in solitude and  obscurity  This earnest opposition on the part of Gauntlet hindered    6 22 15  3 45 PM   our adventurer from forming any immediate resolution  which was also  retarded by his unwillingness to part with the garrison upon any terms   because he looked upon it as a part of his inheritance  which he could  not dispose of without committing an insult upon the memory of the  deceased commodore   CHAPTER CIII   He is engaged in a very extraordinary Correspondence  which is  interrupted by a very unexpected Event   While this affair was in agitation  the captain told him in the course  of conversation  that Emilia was arrived in town  and had inquired about  Mr  Pickle with such an eagerness of concern  as seemed to proclaim that  she was in some measure informed of his misfortune  he therefore  desired to know if he might be allowed to make her acquainted with  his situation  provided he should be again importuned by her on that  subject  which he had at first industriously waived  This proof  or  rather presumption  of her sympathizing regard  did not fail to operate  powerfully upon the bosom of Peregrine  which was immediately filled  with those tumults which love  ill stifled  frequently excites  He  observed  that his disgrace was such as could not be effectually  concealed  therefore he saw no reason for depriving himself of Emilia s  compassion  since he was for ever excluded from her affection  and  desired Godfrey to present to his sister the lowly respects of a  despairing lover   But  notwithstanding his declaration of despondence on this head  his  imagination involuntarily teemed with more agreeable ideas  The proposal  of Crabtree had taken root in his reflection  and he could not help  forming plans of pastoral felicity in the arms of the lovely Emilia   remote from those pompous scenes which he now detested and despised   He amused his fancy with the prospect of being able to support her in a  state of independency  by means of the slender annuity which it was  in his power to purchase  together with the fruits of those endeavours  which would profitably employ his vacant hours  and foresaw provision  for his growing family in the friendship of the lieutenant  who had  already constituted him his heir  He even parcelled out his hours among  the necessary cares of the world  the pleasures of domestic bliss  and  the enjoyments of a country life  and spent the night in ideal parties  with his charming bride  sometimes walking by the sedgy bank of some  transparent stream  sometimes pruning the luxuriant vine  and sometimes  sitting in social converse with her in a shady grove of his own  planting   These  however  were no more than the shadowy phantoms of imagination   which  he well knew  would never be realized  not that he believed such  happiness unattainable by a person in his circumstances  but because he  would not stoop to propose a scheme which might  in any shape  seem to  interfere with the interest of Emilia  or subject himself to a repulse  from that young lady  who had rejected his addresses in the zenith of  his fortune     6 22 15  3 45 PM   While he diverted himself with these agreeable reveries  an unexpected  event intervened  in which she and her brother were deeply interested   The uncle was tapped for the dropsy  and died in a few days after the  operation  having bequeathed  in his will  five thousand pounds to his  nephew  and twice that sum to his niece  who had always enjoyed the  greatest share of his favour   If our adventurer  before this occurrence  looked upon his love for  Emilia as a passion which it was necessary  at any rate  to conquer or  suppress  he now considered her accession of fortune as a circumstance  which confirmed that necessity  and resolved to discourage every thought  on that subject which should tend to the propagation of hope  One day   in the midst of a conversation calculated for the purpose  Godfrey put  into his hand a letter directed to Mr  Pickle  in the handwriting of  Emilia  which
