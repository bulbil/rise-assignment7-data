succeeded Elizabeth  and none ever enjoyed a reign of more lasting tranquility  Historians  for what reason I know not  are fond of describing this Monarch s transactions with ridicule  but  for my own part  I cannot avoid giving just applause  both to his wisdom and felicity   King James came to the throne with the universal approbation of all orders of the state  for  in his person was united every claim to the crown  that either descent  bequest  or parliamentary sanction could confer  But  on his first arrival  it was readily seen that he by no means approved of the treatment of his mother  Mary Queen of Scots    300 and not only refused to wear mourning himself for the late Queen  by whom she had been beheaded  but also denied admission to any who appeared in mourning upon her account   Upon a review of his conduct  there are few of this Monarch s actions that do not seem to spring from motives of justice and virtue  his only error seems to consist in applying the despotic laws and maxims of the Scottish government to the English constitution  which was not susceptible of them  He began his reign by a laudable attempt to unite both the kingdoms into one  but this the jealousy of the English prevented  they were apprehensive  that the posts and employments  which were in the gift of the court  might be conferred on the Scotch  whom they were  as yet  taught to regard as foreigners  By his repulse in this instance  he found the people he came to govern very different from those he had left  and perceived that the liberty and the spirit of the English could not be restrained by the shadows of divine right and passive obedience   He now  therefore  attempted to correct his first mistake  and to peruse the English laws as he had formerly done those of his own country  and by these he was resolved to govern  He was in this second attempt disappointed in his aim  in a government so fluctuating as that of England  custom was ever deviating from law  and what was enacted in one reign was contradicted  by precedent  in another  the laws and the manners of England were  at this particular juncture  very different from each other  The laws had all along declared in favour of an almost unlimited prerogative  the present manners  on the contrary  were formed by instruments  and upon principles of liberty    301 All the Kings and Queens before him  except such as were weakened by intestine divisions  or the dread of approaching invasion  issued rather commands than received advice from their parliaments  James was early sensible of their conduct in this respect  and strove to establish the prerogative upon the laws  unmindful of the alteration of manners among the people  who had  in the reign of Queen Mary  got an idea of their own power  of which  when the majority are once sensible  they never desist from defending   Numberless  therefore  were the disputes between the King and his parliament  during this whole reign  one attempting to keep the royal splendor unsullied  the others aiming at lessening the dangerous part of his power  the one labouring to preserve the laws and institutions of former reigns  the other stedfast in asserting the inherent privileges of mankind  Thus we see virtue was the cause of the dissension on either side  and the principles of both  though seemingly opposite  were  in fact  founded either in law or in reason  When the parliament would not grant a subsidy  James had examples enough  among his predecessors  to extort a benevolence  Edward IV  Henry VIII  and others  had often done this  and he was intitled  undoubtedly  by precedent  to the same privilege  The house of commons  on the other hand  who began to find themselves the protectors of the people  and not the passive instruments of the crown  justly considered that this extorted benevolence might  at length  make the Sovereign entirely independent of the parliament  and therefore complained against it  as an infringement on their privileges  These attempts of the crown  and those murmurings of the people  continued through this   302 whole reign  and first gave rise to that spirit o party  which has ever since subsisted in England  the one side declaring for the King s prerogative  the other for the people s liberty   Whenever the people  as I have already observed  get sight of liberty  they never quit the view  the commons  as may naturally be expected in the present juncture  gained ground  even though defeated  and the Monarch  notwithstanding his professions and resolutions to keep his prerogative untouched  was every day losing some small part of his authority  Historians are apt to charge this to his imbecillity  but it  in reality  arose from the spirit of the times  the clergy  who had returned from banishment during the last reign  had disseminated republican principles among their hearers  and no art nor authority could check its growth  so that  had the most active  or the most diligent Monarch upon earth  been then seated on the throne  yet could he not have preserved the ancient privileges of
