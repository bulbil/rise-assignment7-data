but only restrained  he ordered the Bible to be translated into the vulgar tongue  but not put into the hands of the laity  It was a capital crime to believe in the   249 Pope s supremacy  and yet equally heinous to be of the reformed religion  as practised in Germany  His opinions upon religion were delivered in a law  which  from its horrid consequences  was termed the Bloody Statute  by which it was ordained  that whoever  by word or writing  denied transubstantiation  that whoever maintained the communion in both kinds was necessary  or that it was lawful for priests to marry  or that vows of chastity could innocently be broken  or that private masses were unprofitable  or that auricular confession was unnecessary  should be burnt or hanged as the court should determine   The kingdom  at that time  was in some measure divided between the followers of Luther and the adherents to the Pope  this statute  with his former decrees  in some measure excluded both  and therefore opened a wide field for persecution   These persecutions  however  were preceded by one of a different nature  arising neither from religious nor political causes  but tyrannical caprice  Anna Bullen  his Queen  was herself of the Lutheran persuasion  and had secretly favoured that party  these attachments soon created her enemies  who only waited some favourable occasion to destory her credit with the King  and that occasion presented itself but too soon  The King s passion was  by this time  quite exhausted  the only desire he ever had for her was that brutal appetite which enjoyment soon destroys  he was fallen in love  once more  if we may call it love  with Jane Seymour  a maid of honour to the Queen   As soon as the Queen s enemies perceived the King s disgust  they soon gave him an opportunity to gratify his inclinations  by accusing her of sundry intrigues with her domestics  which accusation   250 was eagerly caught up by the King  All his passions were in extreme  he immediately flew to parliament  and had her accused of adultery and incest with her own brother  This parliament  who had long shewn themselves the timid ministers of all his passions  condemned the Queen and her brother  without ever knowing on what foundation the sentence was grounded   Her brother  Lord Rochfort  was beheaded  though there was not the least proof of his guilt  one Norris and Brereton were hanged for only having paid her such compliments  as would now merdy pass for gallantry and innocent amusement  Smeton  a musician  was compelled to acknowledge his having received favours from her  and he was then hanged without an opportunity of being confronted by the Queen   Upon such slight suspicions was this unhappy Queen sent to the Tower  in order to await the execution of her sentence  She who had been once the envied object of royal favour  was now going to give a new instance of the capriciousness of fortune  she was ever of a chearful disposition  and her easy levities perhaps disgusted the gloomy tyrant  She had distributed  in the last year of her life  not less than fifteen thousand pounds among the poor  and was at once their protector and darling  Upon being conducted to her prison  she sat down to address the King  by letter  for mercy  in this she insisted upon her innocence in the strongest terms    You have raised me  said she  from privacy to make me a lady  from a lady you made me a Countess  from a Countess a Queen  and from a Queen I shall shortly become a saint    On the morning of her execution she sent for Mr  Kingston  the keeper of the Tower  to whom    251 upon entering her prison  she said   Mr  Kingston  I hear I am not to die till noon  and I am sorry for it  for I thought to be dead before this time  and free from a life of pain   The keeper attempting to comfort her by assuring her the pain would be very little  she replied   I have heard the executioner is very expert  and  clasping her neck with her hands  laughing  and I have but a little neck    Kingston  who gives this account  continues to observe  that he had seen many men and women executed  but never one whose fortitude was equal to her s  She was beheaded soon after  behaving with the utmost decency and resolution     Anna Bullen seemed to be guilty of no other crime than that of having survived the King s affection  many crowned heads had already been put to death in England  but this was the first royal execution upon a scaffold  Henry ordered his parliament to give him a divorce  between her sentence and execution  thus to bastardize Elizabeth  the only child he had by her  as he had already bastardized Mary  his only child by Queen Catharine   The very next day after her execution he married Jane Seymour  who died the year following  after having been delivered of a son   In the mean time the fires of Smithfield began to blaze  those who adhered to
