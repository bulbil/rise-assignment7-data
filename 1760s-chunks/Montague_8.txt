 in which parties we were joined by all the fine women at Montreal  Mrs  Melmoth is a very pleasing  genteel brunette  but Emily Montague you will say I am in love with her if I describe her  and yet I declare to you I am not  knowing she loves another  to whom she is soon to be united  I see her charms with the same kind of pleasure I do yours  a pleasure  which  tho  extremely lively  is by our situation without the least mixture of desire      I have said  she is charming  there are men here who do not think so  but to me she is loveliness itself  My ideas of beauty are perhaps a little out of the common road  I hate a woman of whom every man coldly says  she is handsome  I adore beauty  but it is not meer features or complexion to which I give that name   tis life   tis spirit   tis animation   tis in one word   tis Emily Montague without being regularly beautiful  she charms every sensible heart  all other women  however lovely  appear marble statues near her  fair  pale  a paleness which gives the idea of delicacy without destroying that of health   with dark hair and eyes  the latter large and languishing  she seems made to feel to a trembling excess the passion she cannot fail of inspiring  her elegant form has an air of softness and languor  which seizes the whole soul in a moment  her eyes  the most intelligent I ever saw  hold you enchain d by their bewitching sensibility      There are a thousand unspeakable charms in her conversation  but what I am most pleas d with  is the attentive politeness of her manner  which you seldom see in a person in love  the extreme desire of pleasing one man generally taking off greatly from the attention due to all the rest  This is partly owing to her admirable understanding  and partly to the natural softness of her soul  which gives her the strongest desire of pleasing  As I am a philosopher in these matters  and have made the heart my study  I want extremely to see her with her lover  and to observe the gradual encrease of her charms in his presence  love  which embellishes the most unmeaning countenance  must give to her s a fire irresistible  what eyes  when animated by tenderness      The very soul acquires a new force and beauty by loving  a woman of honor never appears half so amiable  or displays half so many virtues  as when sensible to the merit of a man who deserves her affection  Observe  Lucy  I shall never allow you to be handsome till I hear you are in love      Did I tell you Emily Montague had the finest hand and arm in the world  I should however have excepted yours  her tone of voice too has the same melodious sweetness  a perfection without which the loveliest woman could never make the least impression on my heart  I don t think you are very unlike upon the whole  except that she is paler  You know  Lucy  you have often told me I should certainly have been in love with you if I had not been your brother  this resemblance is a proof you were right  You are really as handsome as any woman can be whose sensibility has never been put in motion       I am to give a ball to morrow  Mrs  Melmoth is to have the honors of it  but as she is with child  she does not dance  This circumstance has produc d a dispute not a little flattering to my vanity  the ladies are making interest to dance with me  what a happy exchange have I made  what man of common sense would stay to be overlook d in England  who can have rival beauties contend for him in Canada  This important point is not yet settled  the etiquette here is rather difficult to adjust  as to me  I have nothing to do in the consultation  my hand is destin d to the longest pedigree  we stand prodigiously on our noblesse at Montreal    Four o clock       After a dispute in which two French ladies were near drawing their husbands into a duel  the point of honor is yielded by both to Miss Montague  each insisting only that I should not dance with the other  for my part  I submit with a good grace  as you will suppose    Saturday morning       I never passed a more agreeable evening  we have our amusements here  I assure you  a set of fine young fellows  and handsome women  all well dress d  and in humor with themselves  and with each other  my lovely Emily like Venus amongst the Graces  only multiplied to about sixteen  Nothing is  in my opinion  so favorable to the display of beauty as a ball  A state of rest is ungraceful  all nature is most beautiful in motion  trees agitated by the wind  a ship under sail  a horse in the course  a fine woman dancing  never any human being had such an aversion to still life as I have       I am going back
