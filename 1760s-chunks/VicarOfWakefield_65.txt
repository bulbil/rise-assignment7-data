 let him know  that if I have done him any injury  I am sorry for it    Mr  Jenkinson took pen and ink  and wrote down my submission nearly as I have exprest it  to which I signed my name  My son was employed to carry the letter to Mr  Thornhill  who was then at his seat in the country  He went  and in about six hours returned with a verbal answer  He had some difficulty  he said  to get a sight of his landlord  as the servants were insolent and suspicious  but he accidentally saw him as he was going out upon business  preparing for his marriage  which was to be in three days  He continued to inform us  that he stept up in the humblest manner  and delivered the letter  which  when Mr  Thornhill had read  he said that all submission was now too late and unnecessary  that he had heard of our application to his  Page  135  uncle  which met with the contempt it deserved  and as for the rest  that all future applications should be directed to his attorney  not to him  He observed  however  that as he had a very good opinion of the discretion of the two young ladies  they might have been the most agreeable intercessors    Well  sir    said I to my fellow prisoner    you now discover the temper of the man that oppresses me  He can at once be facetious and cruel  but let him use me as he will  I shall soon be free  in spite of all his bolts to restrain me  I am now drawing towards an abode that looks brighter as I approach it  this expectation cheers my afflictions  and though I shall leave an helpless family of orphans behind me  yet they will not be utterly forsaken  some friend  perhaps  will be found to assist them for the sake of their poor father  and some  Page  136  may charitably relieve them for the sake of their heavenly father    Just as I spoke  my wife  whom I had not seen that day before  appeared with looks of terror  and making efforts  but unable to speak      Why  my love    cried I    why will you thus encrease my affliction by your own  what though no submissions can turn our severe master  tho  he has doomed me to die in this place of wretchedness  and though we have lost a darling child  yet still you will find comfort in your other children when I shall be no more     We have indeed lost    returned she    a darling child  My Sophia  my dearest  is gone  snatched from us  carried off by ruffians    Page  137     How  madam    cried my fellow prisoner    miss Sophia carried off by villains  sure it cannot be    She could only answer with a fixed look and a flood of tears  But one of the prisoner s wives  who was present  and came in with her  gave us a more distinct account  she informed us that as my wife  my daughter  and herself  were taking a walk together on the great road a little way out of the village  a post   chaise and four drove up to them and instantly stopt  Upon which  a well drest man  but not Mr  Thornhill  stepping out  clasped my daughter round the waist  and forcing her in  bid the postillion drive on  so that they were out of sight in a moment      Now    cried I    the sum of my miseries is made up  nor is it in the power of any thing on earth to give me another pang  What  not one left  not to leave  Page  138  me one  the monster  the child that was next my heart  she had the beauty of an angel  and almost the wisdom of an angel  But support that woman  nor let her fall  Not to leave me one    —   Alas  my husband   said my wife    you seem to want comfort even more than I  Our distresses are great  but I could bear this and more  if I saw you but easy  They may take away my children and all the world  if they leave me but you    My Son  who was present  endeavoured to moderate our grief  he bade us take comfort  for he hoped that we might still have reason to be thankful —     My child    cried I    look round the world  and see if there be any happiness left me now  Is not every ray of comfort shut out  while all our bright prospects only lie beyond the grave    —   My dear father    returned he    I hope there is still something that will give you an interval  Page  139  of satisfaction  for I have a letter
