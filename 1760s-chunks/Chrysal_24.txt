     I shall not describe my surprise at my first plunging into those   realms of darkness   nor shall I satisfy the curiosity I see rising   in you  whether that period was the beginning of my existence     or whether I was  either as a punishment or reward for a past  or a   preparation for a future life  thrown into this    These are mysteries    not yet discovered  though often most learnedly guessed at  All   I shall unfold to you are points already known  or such as I see   ready to be found out by human industry  as it would put an end   to learning to make a revelation of the objects of its inquiries  Such   matters  I say  I shall explain to you  and further relate some occur    rences  the knowledge of which wiU be equally useful and enter    taining  which happened to the several persons with whom I have   had intercourse in the various stages of my present state      And  as you may be at a loss to know how I could arrive at the   knowledge of such facts  many of which happened long before my   converse with those persons  I shall inform you that  besides that   intuitive knowledge common to aU spirits  we of superior orders    who animate this universal monarch  Gold  have also a power of   entering into the hearts of the immediate possessors of our bodies     and there reading aU the secrets of their lives  And this will explain   to you the cause of that love of gold which is so remarkable in all   who possess any quantity of that metal    For the operation of   every material is in proportion to the strength of the spirit actuating   that cause   aa the strength of the spirit is reciprocally in proportion   to  the quantity of his material body       and consequently  when   the mighty spirit of a large mass of gold takes possession of the   human heart  it influences all its actions  and overpowers  or   banishes the weaker impulse of those immaterial  unessential   notions called virtues  And this intuition and power of transmigra    tion I have thus explained to remove every shadow of doubt of   what I shall relate          CHAPTER II     CHETSAL GIVES AN AOOOTTNT OF THE PEBSON WHO DUG UP HIS BODT   MT THE MINE â€” THE PABTIOULAE MANNER OF HIS ACQUIRING THE   KNOWLEDGE OF HIS LIFE  WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE NATURE   OF MEMORY AND CONSCIOUSNESS     The first object that struck me  when I darted on the power of a   sunbeam into those infernal regions where my body was just dug   up  was the person in whose hands it was when I took possession   of it      Dark as the gloom of such a place must be  a melancholy that   doubled all the horrors of it sat upon his brow  He gazed a moment        Essay on Spirit         4 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     on me    in silent grief  and then groaned out these words with a   vehemence that seemed to burst his heart   â€”       Damned  damned  pernicious  damning gold   how dearly do   I purchase this momentary possession of thee   But let me acknow    ledge the justice of my fate  I wished only for gold  and now this   equivocal grant of that wish is the just punishment of the folly and   the wickedness of it        Grief here choked his utterance  He could say no more  but   sobbed aloud  while all the dreary caverns echoed to his anguish      Curiosity prompted me to learn the cause of his distress   I there    fore immediately entered into his heart to read the events of his   life  which I doubted not but I should find deeply imprinted there     but I was surprised to find that room in it which  I could plainly   Bee  had been possessed by the love of gold  so filled with sense   of pain  with grief and remorse  that I could scarce gain   admission      Upon this I mounted into the sensorium of his brain  to learn   from the spirit of consciousness  which you call Self  the cause of   BO uncommon a change  aa it is contrary to the fundamental rules   of our order ever to give up a heart of which we once get   possession      I found the spirit very busy  though I thought somewhat oddly   employed  She was running over a number of niches  or impressions    on the fibres of
