was calm enough to conceal the disorder of his mind  But he complained of the headache  and desired he might be next day visited by the physician  to whom he resolved to explain himself in such a manner  as should make an impression upon him  provided he was not altogether destitute of conscience and humanity             CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR  THE KNOT THAT PUZZLES HUMAN WISDOM  THE HAND OF FORTUNE SOMETIMES WILL UNTIE FAMILIAR AS HER GARTER   When the doctor made his next appearance in Sir Launcelot s apartment  the knight addressed him in these words   Sir  the practice of medicine is one of the most honourable professions exercised among the sons of men  a profession which hath been revered at all periods  and in all nations  and even held sacred in the most polished ages of antiquity  The scope of it is to preserve the being  and confirm the health of our fellow creatures  of consequence  to sustain the blessings of society  and crown life with fruition  The character of a physician  therefore  not only supposes natural sagacity  and acquired erudition  but it also implies every delicacy of sentiment  every tenderness of nature  and every virtue of humanity  That these qualities are centred in you  doctor  I would willingly believe  But it will be sufficient for my purpose  that you are possessed of common integrity  To whose concern I am indebted for your visits  you best know  But if you understand the art of medicine  you must be sensible by this time  that  with respect to me  your prescriptions are altogether unnecessary    Come  sir  you cannot—you don t believe that my intellects are disordered  Yet  granting me to be really under the influence of that deplorable malady  no person has a right to treat me as a lunatic  or to sue out a commission  but my nearest kindred —That you may not plead ignorance of my name and family  you shall understand that I am Sir Launcelot Greaves  of the county of York  Baronet  and that my nearest relation is Sir Reginald Meadows  of Cheshire  the eldest son of my mother s sister—that gentleman  I am sure  had no concern in seducing me by false pretences under the clouds of night into the fields  where I was surprised  overpowered  and kidnapped by armed ruffians  Had he really believed me insane  he would have proceeded according to the dictates of honour  humanity  and the laws of his country  Situated as I am  I have a right  by making application to the Lord Chancellor  to be tried by a jury of honest men  But of that right I cannot avail myself  while I remain at the mercy of a brutal miscreant  in whose house I am enclosed  unless you contribute your assistance  Your assistance  therefore  I demand  as you are a gentleman  a Christian  and a fellow subject  who  though every other motive should be overlooked  ought to interest himself in my case as a common concern  and concur with all your power towards the punishment of those who dare commit such outrages against the liberty of your country    The doctor seemed to be a little disconcerted  but  after some recollection  resumed his air of sufficiency and importance  and assured our adventurer he would do him all the service in his power  but in the meantime advised him to take the potion he had prescribed   The knight s eyes lightening with indignation   I am now convinced   cried he   that you are an accomplice in the villany which has been practised upon me  that you are a sordid wretch  without principle or feeling  a disgrace to the faculty  and a reproach to human nature—yes  sirrah  you are the most perfidious of all assassins—you are the hireling minister of the worst of all villains  who  from motives even baser than malice  envy  and revenge  rob the innocent of all the comforts of life  brand them with the imputation of madness  the most cruel species of slander  and wantonly protract their misery  by leaving them in the most shocking confinement  a prey to reflections infinitely more bitter than death but I will be calm—do me justice at your peril  I demand the protection of the legislature—if I am refused—remember a day of reckoning will come—you and the rest of the miscreants who have combined against me  must  in order to cloak your treachery  have recourse to murder —an expedient which I believe you very capable of embracing —or a man of my rank and character cannot be much longer concealed  Tremble  caitiff  at the thoughts of my release—in the meantime  be gone  lest my just resentment impel me to dash your brains out upon that marble—away ——  The honest doctor was not so firmly persuaded of his patient s lunacy as to reject his advice  which he made what haste he could to follow  when an unexpected accident intervened   That this may be properly introduced  we must return to the knight s brace of trusty friends  Captain Crowe and lawyer Clarke  whom we left in sorrowful deliberation upon the fate of their patron  Clarke s genius being rather more fruitful in
