of the permanent and unchangeable felicity of   Paradise       This difference in the situation of ALMORAN and HAMET  produced great   dissimilarity in their dispositions  habits  and characters  to which    perhaps  nature might also in some degree contribute  ALMORAN was   haughty  vain  and voluptuous  HAMET was gentle  courteous  and   temperate  ALMORAN was volatile  impetuous  and irascible  HAMET was   thoughtful  patient  and forbearing  Upon the heart of HAMET also were   written the instructions of the Prophet  to his mind futurity was   present by habitual anticipation  his pleasure  his pain  his hopes  and   his fears  were perpetually referred to the Invisible and Almighty   Father of Life  by sentiments of gratitude or resignation  complacency   or confidence  so that his devotion was not periodical but constant       But the views of ALMORAN were terminated by nearer objects  his mind was   perpetually busied in the anticipation of pleasures and honours  which   he supposed to be neither uncertain nor remote  these excited his   hopes  with a power sufficient to fix his attention  he did not look   beyond them for other objects  nor enquire how enjoyments more distant   were to be acquired  and as he supposed these to be already secured to   him by his birth  there was nothing he was solicitous to obtain as the   reward of merit  nor any thing that he considered himself to possess as   the bounty of Heaven  If the sublime and disinterested rectitude that   produces and rewards itself  dwells indeed with man  it dwelt not with   ALMORAN  with respect to God  therefore  he was not impressed with a   sense either of duty or dependence  he felt neither reverence nor love    gratitude nor resignation  in abstaining from evil  he was not   intentionally good  he practised the externals of morality without   virtue  and performed the rituals of devotion without piety       Such were ALMORAN and HAMET  when Solyman their father  full of days and   full of honour  slept in peace the sleep of death  With this event they   were immediately acquainted  The emotions of ALMORAN were such as it was   impossible to conceal  the joy that he felt in secret was so great  that   the mere dread of disappointment for a moment suspended his belief of   what he heard  when his fears and his doubts gave way  his cheeks were   suffused with sudden blushes  and his eyes sparkled with exultation and   impatience  he looked eagerly about him  as if in haste to act  yet his   looks were embarrassed  and his gestures irresolute  because he knew   not what to do  he uttered some incoherent sentences  which discovered   at once the joy that he felt  and his sense of its impropriety  and his   whole deportment expressed the utmost tumult and perturbation of mind       Upon HAMET  the death of his father produced a very different effect  as   soon as he heard it  his lips trembled and his countenance grew pale  he   flood motionless a moment  like a pilgrim transfixed by lightning in the   desert  he then smote his breast  and looking upward  his eyes by   degrees overflowed with tears  and they fell  like dew distilling from   the mountain  in a calm and silent shower  As his grief was thus mingled   with devotion  his mind in a short time recovered its tranquillity    though not its chearfulness  and he desired to be conducted to his   brother       He found him surrounded by the lords of his court  his eye still   restless and ardent  and his deportment elate and assuming  HAMET   pressed hastily through the circle  and prostrated himself before him    ALMORAN received the homage with a tumultuous pleasure  but at length   raised him from the ground  and assured him of his protection  though   without any expressions either of kindness or of sorrow   HAMET   says   he   if I have no cause to complain of you as a subject  you shall have   no cause to complain of me as a king   HAMET  whose heart was again   pierced by the cold and distant behaviour of his brother  suppressed the   sigh that struggled in his bosom  and secretly wiped away the tear that   started to his eye  he retired  with his looks fixed upon the ground  to   a remote corner of the apartment  and though his heart yearned to   embrace his brother  his modest diffidence restrained him from intruding   upon the king       In this situation were ALMORAN and HAMET  when OMAR entered the   apartment  OMAR  upon whose head the hand of time became heavy  had from   his youth acquainted himself with
