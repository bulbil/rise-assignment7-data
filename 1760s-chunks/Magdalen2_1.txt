          unnumbered   MEMOIRS OF A MAGDALEN   P  6s  B       unnumbered   MEMOIRS OF A MAGDALEN  OR  THE HISTORY OF LOUISA MILDMAY   Now first published from a SERIES OF ORIGINAL LETTERS   IN TWO VOLUMES   VOL  II   LONDON  Printed for W  GRIFFIN  in Catharine Street  in the Strand  M DCC LXVII      unnumbered   THE HISTORY OF LOUISA MILDMAY   LETTER XIII  Miss HARRIOT BEAUCLERK to Miss LOUISA MILDMAY   O  my sweet friend  my dearest Louisa  are our sorrows never to have an end  and is every day that should mitigate the severity of our fortune  to bring us nothing but an aggravation of distress  Your poor brother—I cannot keep it from you—was a few hours ago brought to us desperately   2 wounded by that barbarous villain Harold  with whom he accidentally met at the Crown in Reading  and there  with more courage than discretion called to an account for his infamous behaviour to the most beautiful and most worthy of her sex  Pistols were the cursed weapons they fought with  and your brother received a shot a little above the groin  the ball was extracted by an eminent surgeon at Reading  and the colonel was brought home in a litter  as the physicians judged it better to remove him even such a number of miles  than to let him remain in any place where he could not have proper accommodations   Your poor mother  when she saw him borne in  fainted away  and was immediately removed to her own apartment  where  after applying the necessary restoratives  we happily recovered her    3 she then told me that this was nothing more than what she expected  and that she was the less affected at the shock as she had rendered it continually familiar to her imagination— Yet  Miss Beauclerk   continued the venerable lady    it is a severe stroke  though an expected one  but God s will be done   A large tear then rolled down her fine face  which she endeavoured to restrain  as she saw how much I was touched with the general misfortune  after this  she sent for the surgeon  and doctor  who attended the colonel  from Reading  and begged they would give her their candid opinion of his situation —  Don t be afraid to tell me gentlemen   says she  endeavouring at a smile   for  though I have all the tenderness of a mother  I hope I also possess the resignation of a Christian   The gentlemen looked at one another in admiration both of her piety and her fortitude  and   4 very freely owned that the colonel was in some danger  but that they were nevertheless in hopes  if they could prevent a fever  to see him tolerably recovered in a little time  The gentlemen then preparing to withdraw  I whispered the doctor to feel her own pulse  which he did in a very respectful manner  and advised her to loose a few ounces of blood  she assented to the motion  and the doctor at going out gave me a look of benignity for my recollection  that indicated a goodness of heart in himself  which has raised him not a little in my estimation  After your mother had been bled  we prevailed upon her to lye down  and I left her just now in a sweet doze  which I flatter myself will do her a world of benefit     As my attention at your brother s first coming in was called off by your mother s distress  I sent for Butler  his Irish   5 servant  who is principally employed about his person  to be informed of particulars—The poor fellow  though deeply affected for his master s accident  told me he should ever love and honour his old master  for bearing up so like a man against the stroke of misfortune— Madam   says he    instead of exclaiming  as the generality of father s would have done on such an occasion  and censuring the rashness of his son  he took hold of my master s hand  kissed it with an air of inconceiveable satisfaction  and praised him for the attention which he had shewn to the honour of his family  the only regret he testified  was at hearing that the person who had injured his honour was not hurt in the engagement  for  had he fallen  says my old master  that would have been a great satisfaction—And so it would you know madam   continued the honest Hibernian    6 —  The honour of a good family is a very nice affair  I am come of as good a family myself as any in Ireland  and know how to feel for such a misfortune as has happened to my master s     Though I could not help smiling at the egotism of poor Butler  I nevertheless desired him to answer my questions  and not teaze me with his reflections  he therefore proceeded to inform me that your father and brother were both more than ever incensed against Harold  and that your brother had solemnly swore to call him to a second account the moment he recovered from the present
