arduous occasions  especially in Love cases  should not presume to advise young persons  because they seldom can divest themselves of passion  partiality or prejudice  that is  indeed  of youth  and forbear to mix their own concerns and byasses with the question referred to them  It should not be put from young friend to young friend  What would you do in such a case  but  What ought to be done   How the dear girl blush d  and how pleased she looked  to be particularly addressed by her guardian   Lady Gertrude spoke of a certain father  who for interested views obliged his daughter to marry at fifteen  when she was not only indifferent to the man  but had formed no right notions of the state   And are they not unhappy  ask d Sir Charles     145 They are  reply d she   I knew such an instance  returned he  The Lady was handsome  and had her full share of vanity  She believed every man who said civil things to her  was in love with her  and had she been single  that he would have made his addresses to her  She supposed  that she might have had this great man  or that  had she not been precipitated  And this brought her to slight the man who had  as she concluded  deprived her of better offers  They were unhappy to the end of their lives  Had the Lady lived single long enough to find out the difference between compliment and sincerity  and that the man who flattered her vanity  meant no more than to take advantage of her folly  she would have thought herself not unhappy with the very man with whom she was so dissatisfied   Lady L  speaking afterwards of a certain nobleman  who is continually railing against matrimony  and who makes a very indifferent husband to an obliging wife  I have known more men than one  said Sir Charles  inveigh against matrimony  when the invective would have proceeded with a much better grace from their wives lips than from theirs But let us enquire  would this complainer have been  or deserved to be happier in any state than he now is   A state of suffering  said Lady L  had probably humbled the spirits of the poor wives into perfect meekness and patience   You observe rightly  replied Sir Charles  And surely a most kind disposition of Providence it is  that adversity  so painful in itself  should conduce so peculiarly to the improvement of the human mind  It teaches modesty  humility  and compassion   You speak feelingly  brother  said Lady L  with a sigh  Do you think  Lucy  nobody sighed but she   I do  said he  I speak with a sense of gratitude  I am naturally of an imperious spirit  But I have reaped advantages  from the early stroke of a mother s   146 death  Being for years  against my wishes  obliged to submit to a kind of exile from my native country  which I considered as a heavy evil  tho  I thought it my duty to acquiesce  I was determined  as much as my capacity would allow  to make my advantage of the compulsion  by qualifying myself to do credit  rather than discredit  to my father  my friends  and my country  And  let me add  that if I have in any tolerable manner succeeded  I owe much to the example and precepts of my dear Dr  Bartlett   The doctor blushed and bowed  and was going to disclaim the merit which his patron had ascribed to him  but Sir Charles confirmed it in still stronger terms  You  my dear Dr  Bartlett  said he  as I have told Miss Byron  was a second conscience to me in my earlier youth  Your precepts  your excellent life  your pure manners  your sweetness of temper  could not but open and enlarge my mind  The soil  I hope I may say  was not barren  but you  my dear paternal friend  was the cultivator  I shall ever acknowlege it—And he bowed to the good man  who was covered with modest confusion  and could not look up   And think you  Lucy  that this acknowlegement lessened the excellent man with any one present  No  It raised him in every eye  And I was the more pleased with it  as it helped me to account for that deep observation  which otherwise one should have been at a loss to account for  in so young a man  And yet I am convinced  that there is hardly a greater difference in intellect between angel and man  than there is between man and man     147  LETTER XIX  Lady G  To Miss BYRON    Thursday  April 13   FOR Heaven s sake  my dearest Harriet  dine with us to day  for two reasons  One relates to myself  the other you shall hear by and by  To myself  first  as is most fit—This silly creature has offended me  and presumed to be sullen upon my resentment  Married but two days  and shew his airs —Were I in fault  my dear  which
