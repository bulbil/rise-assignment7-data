wife of a man under such ties  as she must consider Mr    Faulkland to be  Miss B  brightned up a little upon my mother’s saying this  Did Mr Faulkland ever tell you  madam  how the unhappy affair happened  My mother told her  she knew not particulars  that she had been referred to her for a full explanation  that Mr Faulkland had always endeavoured to excuse himself  and went so far as to say  He was sure the lady herself would acquit him in a great measure  Ah  madam  Miss B  cried  and shook her head  ’Tis as I suspected  said my mother  Mr Faulkland is an ungenerous man  A young lady of your modest appearance  I am sure he must have taken more pains to seduce  than he will acknowlege  Miss B blushed exceedingly—Oh  madam  you have a charitable  generous heart  I was indeed seduced  I knew it  replied my mother  Did he promise to marry you  She coloured deeper than before  I will not accuse him of that  madam  My mother proceeded  You have a relation  madam  I understand she was accessary to your misfortune  Yes  the barbarous woman  answered the lady  she was the contriver of my destruction  and if I could have avoided it  I would never have seen her face again  Tears of grief and indignation again burst from her eyes  Have comfort  madam  said my mother  all may end well yet  I can have no hopes  answered Miss B  Mr Faulkland flies me  you see  nor can I ever expect to recover his heart  since so charming a young lady  as I hear Miss Bidulph is  has possession of it  and though your goodness disappointed him in his late views  he may not yet despair  I found by this  continued my mother  that Miss B knew nothing of your being married  and made haste to tell her  I never saw joy so visible in a countenance  She clasped her hands together  Dear madam  what do you tell me  How you revive my drooping heart  then I am not quite hopeless  there is a possibility in my favour   She then asked my mother if Mr Faulkland had acquainted her with her real name  or that of her relation  My mother  who had once or twice called her by the name of Jefferis  assured her he had not  That was generous in him  said she  he can be generous in some points  But I have no reason to conceal it from so prudent and worthy a lady as you are  my real name is Burchell  that of my cruel relation I will forbear to mention  out of respect to my good uncle  whose wife she is  Mr Faulkland  she added  left a Bill of five hundred pounds with his housekeeper  to provide every thing for me that I should want  with assurances that he would take the tenderest care of—the poor young creature hesitated  and could proceed no farther  but my mother said she understood her meaning  They had a good deal    more discourse  my mother promised to see her often during her confinement  and took her leave   She tells me  she is extremely pretty  and has such an air of innocence and simplicity  as very much engages one in her favour   I have set down this whole conversation  with every other particular  exactly as my mother related it   She  who has a most circumstantial memory  repeated it word for word  and I  from a custom of throwing upon paper every thing that occurs to me  have habituated myself to retain the minutest things   I know not  my dear  whether you will be of my opinion  but I cannot help thinking  that there was something like art in Miss Burchell’s behaviour  far from that candour which Mr Faulkland seemed to expect from her  My mother mentioned the pains that she supposed had been taken to seduce her  her deep blush at this hint  makes me suspect that her answer was not dictated by sincerity  She saw my mother was not acquainted with the particulars  and that she was willing to pass a favourable judgment on her fault  it looks to me as if she laid hold of this prejudice—and yet she owned that Mr Faulkland had never promised to marry her—I know not what to think  but there appears to me  upon the whole  something evasive and disingenuous in her conduct  My mother  who is all openness and integrity  saw it not in this light  But be it as it may  it is no longer of any consequence to me  which was most to blame  the gentleman or the lady  Miss Burchell is certainly the injured Person  perhaps I too may have wronged her in my surmises  if I have  I beg her pardon  the observations I have made on her behaviour are only en passant  and I do from my heart wish Mr Faulkland would make her his wife  You may perceive  from what I have told you  how little this interview was likely to produce in Mr Faulkland’s favour  had it even been brought about sooner
