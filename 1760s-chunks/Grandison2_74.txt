atone for  I need not indeed acquaint you with it  but had rather   183 intitle myself by my ingenuousness to your forgivness  than wish to conceal any thing from you in any article of this high importance  whether you grant it me or not  I own then  that when I last departed from your angry presence  I directly went to Miss Grandison  and on my knees implored her hand  I presumed that an alliance with me was not a disgraceful one  and assured her  that my estate should work itself clear without any expectation from you  as it will  I hope  in a few years  by good management  to which I was sure she would contribute  But she refused me  and resolved to await the good pleasure of her father  yet giving me  I must honestly add  condescending hopes of her favour  could your consent be obtained   Thus is the important affair circumstanced   I never will marry any other woman  while there is the least shadow of hope  that she can be mine  The conversation of the best of young men  your son  for two months  in Italy  and one before that in some of the German courts  has made me ambitious of following such an example in every duty of life  And if I might obtain  by your favour  so dear a wife  and so worthy a brother  as well as so amiable a sister as Miss Charlotte  the happiest man in the world would then be   Sir  Your obliged and faithful servant  L   Yet my father  said Lady L  called it an artful Letter  and observed  that Lord L  was very sure of me  or he had not offer d to make a proposal to me  that deserved not to be excused  You were aiming at prudence  girl  in your refusal  I see that  said my father  You had no reason to doubt but Lord L  would hereafter like you the better for declining marriage in that clandestine manner  because the refusal would   184 give him an opportunity to make things more convenient to himself  One half of a woman s virtue is pride  continued he  I hope not  truly  said Lady L    the other half  policy  If they were sure the man would not think the worse of them for it  they would not wait a second question  Had you had an independent fortune  Caroline  what wou d you have done —But go  you are a weak  and yet a cunning girl  Cunning is the wisdom of women  Womens weakness is man s strength  I am sorry that my daughters are not compounded of less brittle materials  I wonder that any man who knows the sex  marries   Thus spoke the rakish  the keeping father  Lucy  endeavouring to justify his private vices by general reflexions on the sex  And thus are wickedness and libertinism called a knowledge of the world  a knowledge of human nature  Swift  for often painting a dunghil  and for his abominable Yahoe story  was complimented with this knowledge  But I hope  that the character of human nature  the character of creatures made in the image of the deity  is not to be taken from the overflowings of such dirty imaginations   What company  my dear  must those men be supposed to have generally kept  How are we authorised to wish  only that good is often produced out of evil  as is instanced in two such daughters  and such a son  that a man of this cast had never had the honour to call a Lady Grandison by his name  And yet Sir Thomas s vices called forth  if they did not establish  her virtues  What shall we say   Whatever is  is in its causes just   —But purblind man  Sees but a part o th  chain  the nearest link   His eyes not carrying to that equal beam   That poises all above      DRYD     185 I thought  my Lucy  that the conversation I have attempted to give  would not  tho  long  appear tedious to you  being upon a new subject  the behaviour of a free liver of a father to his grown up daughters  when they came to have expectations upon him  which he was not disposed to answer  and the rather  as it might serve to strengthen us  who have had in our family none but good men  tho  we have neighbours of a different character  who have wanted to be acquainted with us  in our resolution to reject the suits of libertine men by a stronger motive even than for our own sakes  And I therefore was glad of the opportunity of procuring it for you  and for our Nancy  now her recover d health will allow her to look abroad more than she had of late been used to do  I am sure my grandmamma  and my aunt Selby  will be pleased with it  because it will be a good supplement to the lessons they have constantly inculcated upon us  against that narrow hearted race of men  who live only for the gratification of their own lawless
