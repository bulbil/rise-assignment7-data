that your union will procure you perfect peace  the best marriages are those where with softness and patience they bear by turns with each other  there are none without some contradiction and disagreement        Do not expect the same degree of friendship that you feel  men are in general less tender than women  and you will be unhappy if you are too delicate in friendship        Beg of God to guard your heart from jealousy  do not hope to bring back a husband by complaints  ill humor  and reproaches  The only means which promise success  are patience and softness  impatience sours and alienates hearts  softness leads them back to their duty        In sacrificing your own will  pretend to no right over that of a husband  men are more attached to theirs than women  because educated with less constraint        They are naturally tyrannical  they will have pleasures and liberty  yet insist that women renounce both  do not examine whether their rights are well founded  let it suffice to you  that they are established  they are masters  we have only to suffer and obey with a good grace        Thus far Madame De Maintenon  who must be allowed to have known the heart of man  since  after having been above twenty years a widow  she enflamed  even to the degree of bringing him to marry her  that of a great monarch  younger than herself  surrounded by beauties  habituated to flattery  in the plenitude of power  and covered with glory  and retained him in her chains to the last moment of his life       Do not  however  my dear  be alarmed at the picture she has drawn of marriage  nor fancy with her  that women are only born to suffer and to obey       That we are generally tyrannical  I am obliged to own  but such of us as know how to be happy  willingly give up the harsh title of master  for the more tender and endearing one of friend  men of sense abhor those customs which treat your sex as if created meerly for the happiness of the other  a supposition injurious to the Deity  though flattering to our tyranny and self love  and wish only to bind you in the soft chains of affection       Equality is the soul of friendship  marriage  to give delight  must join two minds  not devote a slave to the will of an imperious lord  whatever conveys the idea of subjection necessarily destroys that of love  of which I am so convinced  that I have always wished the word OBEY expunged from the marriage ceremony       If you will permit me to add my sentiments to those of a lady so learned in the art of pleasing  I would wish you to study the taste of your husband  and endeavor to acquire a relish for those pleasures which appear most to affect him  let him find amusement at home  but never be peevish at his going abroad  he will return to you with the higher gust for your conversation  have separate apartments  since your fortune makes it not inconvenient  be always elegant  but not too expensive  in your dress  retain your present exquisite delicacy of every kind  receive his friends with good breeding and complacency  contrive such little parties of pleasure as you know are agreable to him  and with the most agreable people you can select  be lively even to playfulness in your general turn of conversation with him  but  at the same time  spare no pains so to improve your understanding  which is an excellent one  as to be no less capable of being the companion of his graver hours  be ignorant of nothing which it becomes your sex to know  but avoid all affectation of knowledge  let your œconomy be exact  but without appearing otherwise than by the effect       Do not imitate those of your sex who by ill temper make a husband pay dear for their fidelity  let virtue in you be drest in smiles  and be assured that chearfulness is the native garb of innocence       In one word  my dear  do not lose the mistress in the wife  but let your behaviour to him as a husband be such as you would have thought most proper to attract him as a lover  have always the idea of pleasing before you  and you cannot fail to please       Having lectured you  my dear Lucy  I must say a word to Temple  a great variety of rules have been given for the conduct of women in marriage  scarce any for that of men  as if it was not essential to domestic happiness  that the man should preserve the heart of her with whom he is to spend his life  or as if bestowing happiness were not worth a man s attention  so he possessed it  if  however  it is possible to feel true happiness without giving it       You  my dear Temple  have too just an idea of pleasure to think in this manner  you would be beloved  it has been the pursuit of your life  though never really attained perhaps before  You at present possess a heart full of sensibility  a heart capable of
