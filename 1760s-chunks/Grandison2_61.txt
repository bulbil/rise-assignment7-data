sake of that  of involving a young Lady in difficulties  which she never knew in her father s house   Why  this  my Lord  is well said  You and I may afford to make handsome compliments to one another  while compliments only are expected  I have a good share of health  I have not quitted the world so entirely  nor think I ought  as to look upon myself as the necessary tool of my children  to promote their happiness at the expence of my own  My Lord  I have still a strong relish for the pleasures of this world  My daughters may be women grown  Your Lordship seems to have found out  that they are  and has persuaded one of them  that she is  and the other will be ready to think she is not three years behind her  This is an inconvenience which you have brought upon me  And as I would be glad to live a little longer for myself  I wish you to withdraw your suit  and leave me to do as well as I can with my daughters  I propose to carry them to town next winter  They shall there look about them  and see whom they could like  and who could like them  that they may not be liable to after repentance  for having taken the first man that offer d   My Lord told Sir Thomas  that he hoped there could not be reason to imagine  that any thing could possibly arise from his address  that should be incompatible with the happiness of a father—And was going on in the same reasonable strain  but Sir Thomas interrupted him—  You must not  my Lord  suppose I can be a stranger to whatever may be urged by a young man on this subject  You say you are in Love  Caroline is a girl that any body may love  But I have not a mind she should marry so soon  I know the inconvenience of early marriages  A man s children treading upon his heels  and shouldering him with their shoulders  In   152 short  my Lord  I have an aversion to be called a grandfather  before I am a grey father  Sir Thomas was not put to it to try to overcome this aversion   Girls will start up  and look up  and parents cannot help it  But what father  in the vigour of his days  would not wish to help it  I am not fond of their partnership in my substance  Why should I divide my fortune with novices  when  making the handsome allowances to them  that I do make  it is not too much for myself  My son should be their example  He is within a year as old as my eldest girl  On his future alliances I build  and hope to add by them to the consequence of all my family  Ah  Lucy    Girls are said to be women sooner than boys are men  Let us see that they are so by their discretion  as well as by stature —Let them stay—  And here Sir Thomas abruptly broke off the conversation for that time  to the great distress of Lord L  who had reason to regret  that he had a man of wit  rather than a man of reason  to contend with   Sir Thomas went directly into his closet  and sent for his two daughters  and  tho  not ill naturedly  rallied t em both so much on their own discoveries  as he wickedly phrased it  and  on admitting Lord L  into the secret  that neither of them could hold up their heads  for two or three days  in his presence  But  out of it  Miss Caroline Grandison found that she was in Love  and the more for Lord L  s generous attachment  and Sir Thomas s not so generous discouragement   My Lord wrote over to young Mr  Grandison  to favour his address  Lady L  permitted me to copy the following answer to his Application   My Lord   I HAVE the honour of your Lordship s letter of the 17th  Never brother loved his sisters better than I do mine  As the natural effects of that Love    153 I receive with pleasure the notification of your great regard for my elder sister  As to myself  I cannot have one objection  But what am I in this case  She is wholly my father s  I also am his  The consideration he gives me in this instance  confounds me  It binds me to him in double duty  It would look like taking advantage of it  were I so much as to offer my humble opinion  unless he were pleased to command it from me  If he does  assure yourself  my Lord  that  my sister s inclination in your Lordship s favour presupposed  my voice shall be warmly given  as you wish  I am  my Lord  with equal affection and esteem   Your Lordship s faithful and obedient Servant   Both sisters rejoiced at the perusal of this affectionate letter  for they were afraid  that the unnatural prohibition of correspondence between them and their brother had estranged his affections from them   The particulars of one more conversation I
