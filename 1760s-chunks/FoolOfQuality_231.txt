 against such outrageous proceedings to the last of their fortunes    They then advanced me  between them  five hundred pounds for the   purpose  I immediately commenced suit against my lord s tenants    But  though I cast them all with costs  I unhappily found that   nearly all my money was sunk in the contest      Meantime  scarce a day passed wherein I was not served with a   subpoena from chancery  to answer such or such a bill  to which my   brother had procured me to be made a party  And he also entered   a suit against me himself  in order to invalidate my father s will    whereby I claimed my little patrimony      When I told this to my friend Mr  Hollow  he broke into a loud   laugh  Your title  cried he  the world cannot invalidate your   title  Mr  Kuth   I will let you have a thousand pounds upon it to    morrow   and this I was under the necessity of accepting soon after      Contention serves  with mutual hands  to shut every door against   reconcilation  The more I had loved my brother  the more I now   detested him  Instead of any submission or overture to appease   him  my lips uttered  in daily invectives  the overflowings ot my   heart   as I also was assured that  on his part  he wished me nothing   less than eternal perdition  Thus we burned  on both sides  with   unquenchable fire  and the kingdom of Satan was fully opened   within us      At length my body was imprisoned  at the suit of my neighbour   Heartless  for 750  and my lands were taken under execution  at   the suit of my neighbour Hollow  for the sum of 2000  But I   soon was informed that all this money was my brother s  who had   advanced it from time to time  to those his clandestine correspond    ents  in order to hasten and deepen my destruction  When I   understood this I raged I was all on fire  and I took a horrid         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  241     pleasure in the notion of having the fangs of a tiger  that I might   tear my brother piecemeal  and my false friends limb from limb    and feast my spirit on their pangs  and mine eyes on their carnage      But when I turned a look on my wife and seven infants  grief   joined with rage to rend me by a double distraction  I cursed the   lot to which I was appointed upon earth  and I should have sought   some desperate means of putting an end to my torments and ex    istence together  but that I dreaded  by my death  to give pleasure   to my brother  ten times more than I dreaded the pain of death   itself      O my friends   had all that ever were sainted come and preached   to me the peace of our Lord Christ at that season  it would have   been no more than beating the air  or striving with so many   sponges to make an impression on a block of marble  It is distress   alone that  by oppression  makes impression that preaches the   internal doctrine of sensible mortification  and humbles a proud   spirit by plucking away all its props      At first  I was a worm under the foot of my God  I turned and   struggled  and writhed  and fought with all my force against the   crusher  But  alas   all was in vain   he was too mighty for me    and opposition served only to add to my anguish      At length I was compelled to acquiesce  rather through the   want of power than the want of will to resist  And 1 lay  as it   were  without motion under his dispensations  at the same time   that my heart reproached him in secret      Having sold all our moveables  and even our wearing apparel   for sustenance  we were reduced to the necessity of sending our   eldest boys to beg fragments of victuals at kitchen windows  to   keep us from utterly famishing  This I held to be such a further   shame and disgrace as stung my soul to the quick  I therefore   began to kick against these pricks also   but finding that the more   I spurned  the stronger I was held and pressed into the dust  I   gave up all resistance  and contented myself with grieving and   weeping under the hand of the Almighty      From hence I gradually sunk into a state of resigned serenity    which  although without sunshine  was yet without disturbance
