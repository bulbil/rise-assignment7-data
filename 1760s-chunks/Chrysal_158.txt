have bad news to tell you  The clerk of the parisn   flent me word yesterday  that understanding I sung my ballad to   a psalm time  he let me know  that I must change my note   directly  or he would order the beadles to whip me out of the   parish  if ever I presumed to sing there again  and to mend   the matter  at the same time ordered me to make use of an old   blackguard tune  which he sent me  the vulgar stupidity of which   blunts the edge of the ridicule  which has never turned against   the tune itself  but solely against the prostitution of it   which can   never be so effectually attacked  as by repeating the maimer   exactly in which it is sung  But where is our friend Brimstone     I expected to hscve met her here        Just as he said this  my master was called out  where he found   a venerable matron  supported by two chairmen  who inquiring in   a feeble voice for number one  he directly showed her in to the   company          CHAPTER in     A VENERABLE MATRON COMPLETES THE COMPAinr â€” THE CtTBTAIir     LIPTBD UP  AND SEVERAL UNEXPECTED DISCOVEBIES MADE     MOMUS PLAYS SUCCESSIVELY UPON DR HUNCHBACK AND MOTHEB   BRIMSTONE â€” AETER VARIOUS DISASTERS  THE EVENENQ IS CON    CLUDED IN CHARACTER     The matron   whom my master was handing in to his friends    displayed one of those figures which lose by the most forcible   description  Her face  though broken by debauchery and disease    preserved the remains of a most pleasing sweetness and beauty    but her body was bloated by intemperance almost out of every   resemblance of the human form  She wore on her head a richly   laced cap  over which half a dozen fine handkerchiefs almost con    cealed a piece of greasy flannel  Her gown  of the richest silk    flowed loosely round her  under a velvet cloak  Uned with ermine     while her legs and feet  swollen out of all shape  and too tender to   bear any ligature  were wrapped up in flannels      My master received this amiable creature from the chairmen    and stooping under as much as he was able to bear of the burthen   of her body  assisted her to limp into the room  The contrast   between her and the shabby skeleton of her supporter was so   strikingly ridiculous  that the moment they appeared Momus    burst into an immoderate fit of laughter  and turning to the   doctor  who was not much less affected  though practice had given   him such a mastery over the muscles of his face  that they never   betrayed the passions of his heart    Behold   said he   the   blessed fruit of thy ministry  and rejoice  See how the spirit   assisteth the flesh to struggle with the infirmities of nature    And   then  waddling up to her  in her own gait    Dear mother    address      1 Mrs Brimstone  aliaa Mrs Cole  alicu Mother Douglas          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 173     ing himself to her   give me your other arm  rest a little part of   your weight  an hun  ed or two  upon me   Come   Let me help   you into that great chair           Oh   oh   oh   my poor bones     exclaimed she    How you pull   me along 1 you will tear me to pieces 1 Oh I oh           Never fear  mother 1 never tear that     answered he    Crazy as   your carcass is  it will stick a little longer together  Your friends   are not ready for you yet         Go  go 1 you re a wicked creature  a profane wretch  Dear   doctor   I thought I should never see you more   I had a sad night   of it   a most said one indeed  But the spirit comforted me  Oh    if it were not for the comforts of the spirit  there would be no   bearing the pains of this life  I was purely when you left met   Your pious conversation had comforted my heart   and the other   bottle we cracked together raised my spirits  so that I forgot all my   pains  But I was not to be so happy long   Satan envied me  and   threw temptation in my way I This wicked imp  and half a dozen   of his roairing
