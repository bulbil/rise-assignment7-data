anger  and the more still was I   affected  when you answered the wicked Mrs  Jewkes so generously in   my favour  at my leaving your house  For this  sir  awakened all my   reverence for you  and you saw I could not forbear  not knowing what I   did  to break boldly in upon you  and acknowledge your goodness on my   knees   Tis true  my dear Pamela  said he  we have sufficiently tortured   one another  and the only comfort that can result from it  will be    reflecting upon the matter coolly and with pleasure  when all these   storms are overblown   as I hope they now are   and we sit together   secured in each other s good opinion  recounting the uncommon gradations   by which we have ascended to the summit of that felicity  which I hope   we shall shortly arrive at       Meantime  said the good gentleman  let me hear what my dear girl would   have said in her justification  could I have trusted myself with her  as   to her fears  and the reason of her wishing herself from me  at a time   that I had begun to shew my fondness for her  in a manner that I thought   would have been agreeable to her and virtue       I pulled out of my pocket the gipsy letter  but I said  before I shewed   it to him  I have this letter  sir  to shew you  as what  I believe  you   will allow must have given me the greatest disturbance  but  first  as   I know not who is the writer  and it seems to be in a disguised hand  I   would beg it as a favour  that  if you guess who it is  which I cannot    it may not turn to their prejudice  because it was written  very   probably  with no other view  than to serve me       He took it  and read it  And it being signed Somebody  he said  Yes    this is indeed from Somebody  and  disguised as the hand is  I know the   writer  Don t you see  by the setness of some of these letters  and a   little secretary cut here and there  especially in that c  and that r    that it is the hand of a person bred in the law way  Why  Pamela  said   he   tis old Longman s hand  an officious rascal as he is   But I have   done with him  O sir  said I  it would be too insolent in me to offer    so much am I myself overwhelmed with your goodness   to defend any body   that you are angry with  Yet  sir  so far as they have incurred your   displeasure for my sake  and for no other want of duty or respect  I   could wish  But I dare not say more       But  said he  as to the letter and the information it contains  Let me   know  Pamela  when you received this  On the Friday  sir  said I  that   you were gone to the wedding at Stamford   How could it be conveyed   to you  said he  unknown to Mrs  Jewkes  when I gave her such a strict   charge to attend you  and you had promised me  that you would not throw   yourself in the way of such intelligence  For  said he  when I went to   Stamford  I knew  from a private intimation given me  that there would   be an attempt made to see you  or give you a letter  by somebody  if not   to get you away  but was not certain from what quarter  whether from my   sister Davers  Mrs  Jervis  Mr  Longman  or John Arnold  or your father    and as I was then but struggling with myself  whether to give way to my   honourable inclinations  or to free you  and let you go to your father    that I might avoid the danger I found myself in of the former   for I   had absolutely resolved never to wound again even your ears with any   proposals of a contrary nature   that was the reason I desired you to   permit Mrs  Jewkes to be so much on her guard till I came back  when I   thought I should have decided this disputed point within myself  between   my pride and my inclinations       This  good sir  said I  accounts well to me for your conduct in that   case  and for what you said to me and Mrs  Jewkes on that occasion  And   I see more and more how much I may depend upon your honour
