waist  and I will tell you truth  and nothing but the truth—You wrote so cool to me  about my coming—And yet I to come  But I could not help it—And I thought you now looked a little severely upon me—But Love  and I  will say  Duty to you  my dearest Miss Byron  AND NOTHING ELSE  made me so earnest to come  Say you forgive me   Forgive you  my dearest Emily —I had only your sake  my dear  in view  If I wrote with less warmth than you expected  forgive me  Consider my situation  my Love  You are  and ever will be  welcome to me  Your griefs  your joys  are mine—Give me which you please   The girl  burst into fresh tears—I  I  I am now as unable  sobbed she  to bear your goodness  as before I was your displeasure—But hide  hide me  Here comes my Guardian —What now  when he sees me thus  will become of me   She heard his voice at the door  leading in the two Lords  and they followed by Mr  Selby  Mrs  Selby  Lucy  and Nancy   Sir Charles went to the two young Ladies  Harriet kept her seat  her arms folded about Emily  Emily s glowing face in her bosom   Sweet emotion  said he  my Emily in tears of joy   —What a charming picture —O my Miss Byron  how does your tenderness to this amiable child oblige me  I sever you not  clasping his generous arms about them both   I have afflicted my dear Emily  Sir  without intending it  I wrote coldly  my precious young friend thinks  and her Love for me makes her sweetly sensible   302 of my supposed ingratitude  But believe me  my dear  I love you with a true sisterly tenderness   I took the dear girl aside  and gently expostulated with her  upon the childishness of her behaviour  and the uneasiness she would give to Miss Byron  as well as to herself  by repetitions of the like weakness of mind   She promised fair  but  Lady L  I wish there were more of the child  and less of the woman  in this affair  Poor thing  she was very thankful for my advice  and expressed how wrong she was  because it might discourage her Guardian and Miss Byron  that now was  from letting her live with them  But for my life  said she  whatever was the matter with me  I could not help my foolishness   Miss Nancy Selby took Emily up with her  and uncle Selby and I had a little lively hit at each other  in the old stile  We drew my brother in  I had not tried his strength a good while  But  as Harriet said in one of the sauciest Letters she ever wrote  I soon found he was the wrong person to meddle with  Yet he is such a charming raillier  that I wonder he can resist his talent  No wonder  Harriet would say  because he has talents so superior to that which  she says  runs away with his poor sister   Emily came down to us very composed  and behaved prettily enough  But had my brother as much mannish vanity as some of the sorry fellows have  who have no pretence for it  he would discern the poor Emily s foible to have some little susceptibility in it  I am glad he does not  for it would grieve him  I have already told him of the sufferings of poor Lady Anne S  on her hearing he is near marriage  and he expressed great concern upon it for that really worthy woman   Mr  Reeves  his wife  and Mr  Deane  were abroad when we arrived  They came in to tea  Our mutual congratulations on the expected happy event  cheared our own hearts  and would have delighted   303 yours  Charming  charming  is the behaviour of my brother to his Bride elect  You can have no notion of it  because at Colnebrook we always saw him acting under a restraint  owing  as since we have found  to Honour  Conscience  and a prior Love   He diverts and turns the course of subjects that he thinks would be affecting to her  yet in such a manner  as it is hardly perceivable to be his intention to do so  For he makes something of the begun ones contribute to the new ones  so that  before uncle Selby is aware of it  he finds himself in one that he had not in his head when he sat out —And then he comes with his    What a pize was I going to say  But this is not what I had in my head    And then  as my brother knows he misses his scent  only because it has not afforded the merry mortal something to laugh at  he furnishes him with some lively and innocent occasion which produces that effect  and then Mr  Selby is satisfied  Mrs  Selby and Lucy see how my brother manages him  yet find it so delicately done  that something arises from it that keeps the honest man in
