his pocketing immediately  on pain of forfeiting  all title to his favour   Pipes was very much chagrined at these injunctions  to which he made  no reply  but  sweeping the money into his bag  stalked off in silence   with a look of grief and mortification  which his countenance had never  exhibited before  Nor was the proud heart of Pickle unmoved upon the  occasion  he could scarce suppress his sorrow in the presence of Pipes   and  soon as he was gone  it vented itself in tears   Having no great pleasure in conversing with his own thoughts  he dressed  himself with all convenient despatch  being attended by one of the  occasional valets of the place  who had formerly been a rich mercer in  the city  and  this operation being performed  he went to breakfast  at the coffee house  where he happened to meet with his friend the  clergyman and several persons of genteel appearance  to whom the doctor  introduced him as a new messmate  By these gentlemen he was conducted to  a place where they spent the forenoon in playing at fives  an exercise  in which our hero took singular delight  and about one o clock a court  was held  for the trial of two delinquents  who had transgressed the  laws of honesty and good order  The first who appeared at the bar was  an attorney  accused of having picked a gentleman s pocket of his  handkerchief  And the fact being proved by incontestable evidence  he  received sentence  In consequence of which  he was immediately carried  to the public pump  and subjected to a severe cascade of cold water   This cause being discussed  they proceeded to the trial of the other  offender  who was a lieutenant of a man of war  indicted for a riot   which he had committed in company with a female  not yet taken  against  the laws of the place  and the peace of his fellow prisoners  The  culprit had been very obstreperous  and absolutely refused to obey the  summons  with many expressions of contempt and defiance against the  authority of the court  upon which the constables were ordered to bring  him to the bar  vi et armis  and he was accordingly brought before the  judge  after having made a most desperate resistance with a hanger  by  which one of the officers was dangerously wounded  This outrage was such  an aggravation of his crime  that the court would not venture to decide  upon it  but remitted him to the sentence of the warden  who  by virtue  of his dictatorial power  ordered the rioter to be loaded with irons   and confined in the strong room  which is a dismal dungeon  situated  upon the side of the ditch  infested with toads and vermin  surcharged  with noisome damps  and impervious to the least ray of light   Justice being done upon these criminals  our adventurer and his company    6 22 15  3 45 PM   adjourned to the ordinary  which was kept at the coffee house  and he  found  upon inquiry  that his messmates consisted of one officer  two  underwriters  three projectors  an alchemist  an attorney  a parson  a  brace of poets  a baronet  and a knight of the Bath  The dinner   though not sumptuous  nor very elegantly served up  was nevertheless  substantial  and pretty well dressed  The wine was tolerable  and all  the guests as cheerful as if they had been utter strangers to calamity   so that our adventurer began to relish the company  and mix in the  conversation  with that sprightliness and ease which were peculiar to  his disposition  The repast being ended  the reckoning paid  and part  of the gentlemen withdrawn to cards  or other avocations  those who  remained  among whom Peregrine made one  agreed to spend the afternoon  in conversation over a bowl of punch  and the liquor being produced   they passed the time very socially in various topics of discourse   including many curious anecdotes relating to their own affairs  No man  scrupled to own the nature of the debt for which he was confined  unless  it happened to be some piddling affair  but  on the contrary  boasted  of the importance of the sum  as a circumstance that implied his  having been a person of consequence in life  and he who made the most  remarkable escapes from bailiffs  was looked upon as a man of superior  genius and address   Among other extraordinary adventures of this kind  none was more  romantic than the last elopement achieved by the officer  who told them  he had been arrested for a debt of two hundred pounds  at a time when he  could not command as many pence  and conveyed to the bailiff s house   in which he continued a whole fortnight  moving his lodgings higher and  higher  from time to time  in proportion to the decay of his credit   until  from the parlour  he had made a regular ascent to the garret   There  while
