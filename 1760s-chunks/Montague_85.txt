acquiring a greater variety as well as sublimity of ideas       Women who have conversed much with men are undoubtedly in general the most pleasing companions  but this only shews of what they are capable when properly educated  since they improve so greatly by that accidental and limited opportunity of acquiring knowledge       Indeed the two sexes are equal gainers  by conversing with each other  there is a mutual desire of pleasing  in a mixed conversation  restrained by politeness  which sets every amiable quality in a stronger light       Bred in ignorance from one age to another  women can learn little of their own sex       I have often thought this the reason why officers daughters are in general more agreable than other women in an equal rank of life       I am almost tempted to bring Bell as an instance  but I know the blindness and partiality of nature  and therefore check what paternal tenderness would dictate       I am shocked at what your Lordship tells me of Miss H—  I know her imprudent  I believe her virtuous  a great flow of spirits has been ever hurrying her into indiscretions  but allow me to say  my Lord  it is particularly hard to fix the character by our conduct  at a time of life when we are not competent judges of our own actions  and when the hurry and vivacity of youth carries us to commit a thousand follies and indiscretions  for which we blush when the empire of reason begins       Inexperience and openness of temper betray us in early life into improper connexions  and the very constancy  and nobleness of nature  which characterize the best hearts  continue the delusion       I know Miss H— perfectly  and am convinced  if her father will treat her as a friend  and with the indulgent tenderness of affection endeavor to wean her from a choice so very unworthy of her  he will infallibly succeed  but if he treats her with harshness  she is lost for ever       He is too stern in his behaviour  too rigid in his morals  it is the interest of virtue to be represented as she is  lovely  smiling  and ever walking hand in hand with pleasure  we were formed to be happy  and to contribute to the happiness of our fellow creatures  there are no real virtues but the social ones        Tis the enemy of human kind who has thrown around us the gloom of superstition  and taught that austerity and voluntary misery are virtue       If moralists would indeed improve human nature  they should endeavor to expand  not to contract the heart  they should build their system on the passions and affections  the only foundations of the nobler virtues       From the partial representations of narrow minded bigots  who paint the Deity from their own gloomy conceptions  the young are too often frighted from the paths of virtue  despairing of ideal perfections  they give up all virtue as unattainable  and start aside from the road which they falsely suppose strewed with thorns       I have studied the heart with some attention  and am convinced every parent  who will take the pains to gain his childrens friendship  will for ever be the guide and arbiter of their conduct  I speak from a happy experience       Notwithstanding all my daughter says in gaiety of heart  she would sooner even relinquish the man she loves  than offend a father in whom she has always found the tenderest and most faithful of friends  I am interrupted  and have only time to say  I have the honor to be   My Lord   c   WM  FERMOR     LETTER CXXXVI   136   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  May 13   MADAME Des Roches has just left us  she returns to day to the Kamaraskas  she came to take leave of us  and shewed a concern at parting from Emily  which really affected me  She is a most amiable woman  Emily and she were in tears at parting  yet I think my sweet friend is not sorry for her return  she loves her  but yet cannot absolutely forget she has been her rival  and is as well satisfied that she leaves Quebec before your brother s arrival       The weather is lovely  the earth is in all its verdure  the trees in foliage  and no snow but on the sides of the mountains  we are looking eagerly out for ships from dear England  I expect by them volumes of letters from my Lucy  We expect your brother in a week  in short  we are all hope and expectation  our hearts beat at every rap of the door  supposing it brings intelligence of a ship  or of the dear man       Fitzgerald takes such amazing pains to please me  that I begin to think it is pity so much attention should be thrown away  and am half inclined  from meer compassion  to follow the example you have so heroically set me       Absolutely  Lucy  it requires amazing resolution to marry   Adieu  yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER CXXXVII   137   To Colonel RIVERS  at Montreal
