instantly sent   for his people  All was hurry  pack  and despatch  and toward   dawning they set out on a road that led to the Cantons  But    changing their course again for several successive mornings  they   arrived at Calais by a long tour of near five weeks  travel      Mr  Clinton set up at his old inn  and after dinner the host     D d         402 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      entered to pay his compliments  Have you any news  landlord    Nothing at present  my lord  all is quiet again  But here has   been a fearful bustle about three weeks ago  The king s army   came down in pursuit of a young Englishman  who ran away   with a lady of quality from Paris  For my share  continued he    looking earnestly at Harry  I fear that you pretty English lads   will hardly leave us a lovely wench in the nation  Harry looked   quite secure  being wholly innocent of any present design on the   sex   but poor little Pierre turned as pale as the table cloth      I remember  continued our talkative host  that just such another   affair happened when I was a boy and servant in this house    Here came a young Englishman  just such another sweet fellow   as this before me   and he brought with him an angel of a creature    the like of whom my eyes never did  nor never shall open upon till   they close in death  After him came one of our great dukes  with   a party of the king s army  and terrible things were expected  But   they made it up in a manner I know not how  and my Lord Anglois   carried off  his prize in triumph  Mr  Clinton stooped his head    and dropped a silent tear  but held no farther converse with our   landlord on the subject      That evening a gale sprung up  and  going on board  they were   safe anchored before morning in the bay of Dover      They then mutually embraced   and Harry  catching his beloved   deliverer to his bosom We are now upon English ground  says   he   welcome to my arms  my dear Pierre  no longer my page or   servant  but my friend and my brother   You cannot conceive what   pain your officiousness has hitherto cost me   but there must be   no more of this  You shall hereafter be served and attended as   I am   nay  I myself will gladly serve you to the utmost of my   power  and the extent of my fortune      Ah  my lord   cried the lovely Pierre  if you deprive me of the   pleasure of serving you  you deprive me of all the pleasure that   the world can afford me  If you knew the delight I find in being   always about you  in watching your thoughts and motions  in   looking into your fine eyes  and there reading your desires before   they rise to expression  you could not find in your heart to deprive   me of such a blessing  Well then  said Harry  raising him fondly   in his arms  our future contest shall be  which of us shall serve   the other with most affection and sedulity      After dinner  the evening being calm and shiny  Harry took   his Pierre with him along the shore that stretches under the   stupendous cliffs of Dover  They had not walked far  when    getting out of the sight of people within the winding of a creek    a man advanced toward them  and  taking out a pistol  called to   Harry  and ordered him to throw down his purse  Our hero did   not regard his money   but  thinking it an indignity to be robbed   by one man  he put his hand to his sword  Hereupon the villain   cocked and levelled his pistol   and the faithful Pierre  observing   that he was going to fire  instantly jumped in between his master   and danger  and received the ball into his own bosom      Harry saw his darling drop  and flying all enraged at the robber    he ran him thrice through the body  and pinned him to the ground          THE FOOL OF QUALITY          403         Then  flying as swiftly back  he threw himself by the side of his   dying Pierre  and  gently raising his languishing head  placed it   fondly on his bosom      You are wounded  my friend dangerously wounded  I fear
