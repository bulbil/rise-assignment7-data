would have look d for  in one so extracted —he was  on the contrary  as mercurial and sublimated a composition —as heteroclite a creature in all his declensions —with as much life and whim  and gaité de coeur about him  as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put together  With all this sail  poor Yorick carried not one ounce of ballast  he was utterly unpractised in the world  and  at the age of twenty six  knew just about as well how to steer his course  Page  56  in it  as a romping  unsuspicious girl of thirteen  So that upon his first setting out  the brisk gale of his spirits  as you will imagine  ran him foul ten times in a day of some body s tackling  and as the grave and more slow paced were oftenest in his way —you may likewise imagine   twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most entangled  For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit at the bottom of such Fracas —For  to speak the truth  Yorick had an invincible dislike and opposition in his nature to gravity —not to gravity as such —for where gravity was wanted  he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days and weeks together —but he was an enemy to the affectation of it  and declared open war against it  only as it appeared a cloak for ignorance  or for  Page  57  folly  and then  whenever it fell in his way  however sheltered and protected  he seldom gave it much quarter   Sometimes  in his wild way of talking  he would say  That gravity was an errant scoundrel  and he would add —of the most dangerous kind too —because a fly one  and that  he verily believed  more honest  well meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in one twelve month  than by pocket picking and shop lifting in seven  In the naked temper which a merry heart discovered  he would say  There was no danger —but to itself —whereas the very essence of gravity was design  and consequently deceit — twas a taught trick to gain credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth  and that  with all its pretensions —it was  Page  58  no better  but often worse  than what a French wit had long ago defined it —viz  A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the defects of the mind —which definition of gravity  Yorick  with great imprudence  would say  deserved to be wrote in letters of gold   But  in plain truth  he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the world  and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint  Yorick had no impression but one  and that was what arose from the nature of the deed spoken of  which impression he would usually translate into plain English without any periphrasis —and too oft without much distinction of either personage  time  or place —so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an  Page  59  ungenerous proceeding —he never gave himself a moment s time to reflect who was the Hero of the piece —what his station —or how far he had power to hurt him hereafter —but if it was a dirty action —without more ado —The man was a dirty fellow —and so on —And as his comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a bon mot  or to be enliven d throughout with some drollery or humour of expression  it gave wings toYorick s indiscretion  In a word  tho  he never sought  yet  at the same time  as he seldom shun d occasions of saying what came uppermost  and without much ceremony —he had but too many temptations in life  of scattering his wit and his humour —his gibes and his jests about him —They were not lost for want of gathering   Page  60  What were the consequences  and what was Yorick s catastrophe thereupon  you will read in the next chapter   CHAP  XII   THE Mortgager and Mortgagée differ the one from the other  not more in length of purse  than the Jester and Jestée do  in that of memory  But in this the comparison between them runs  as the scholiasts call it  upon allfour  which  by the bye  is upon one or two legs more  than some of the best of Homer s can pretend to —namely  That the one raises a sum and the other a laugh at your expence  and think no more about it  Interest  however  still runs on in both cases —the periodical or accidental payments of it  just serving  Page  61  to keep the memory of the affair alive  till  at length  in some evil hour —pop comes the creditor upon each  and by demanding principal upon the spot  together with full interest to the very day  makes them both feel the full extent of their obligations   As the reader  for I hate your ifs  has a thorough knowledge of human nature  I need not say more to satisfy him  that my Hero could not go on at this rate without some
