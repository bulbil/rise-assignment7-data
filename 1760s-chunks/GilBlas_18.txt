of accidents  as his magazine was crammed to the very throat  Having eat and drank his fill  he bethought him of putting a finishing hand to the farce  Master Gil Blas  said he  as he rose from the table  I am too well pleased with my princely entertainment to leave you without a word of advice  of which you seem to stand in much need  From this time forward be on your guard against extravagant praise  Do not trust men till you know them  You may meet with many another man  who  like me  may amuse himself at your expense  and perhaps carry the joke a little further  But do not you be taken in a second time  to believe yourself  on the word of such fellows  the eighth wonder of the world  With this sting in the tail of his farewell speech he very coolly took his leave   I was as much alive to so ridiculous a circumstance  as I have ever been in after life to the most severe mortifications  I did not know how to reconcile myself to the idea of having been so egregiously taken in  or  in fact  to lowering of my pride  So  so  quoth I  this rascal has been putting his tricks upon travellers  has he  Then he only wanted to pump my landlord  or more likely they were both in a story  Ah  my poor Gil Blas  thou hadst better hide thy silly head  To have suffered such knaves as these to turn thee into ridicule  A pretty story they will make of this  It is sure to travel back to Oviedo  and will give our friends a hopeful prospect of thy success in life  The family will be quite delighted to think what a blessed harvest all their pious advice has produced  There was no occasion to preach up morals to thee  for verily thou hast more of the dupe than the sharper in thy composition  Ready to tear my eyes out or bite my fingers off from spite and vexation  I locked myself up in my chamber and went to bed  but not to sleep  of which I had not got a wink when the muleteer came to tell me  that he only waited for me to set out on his journey  I got up as expeditiously as I could  and while I was dressing Corcuelo put in his appearance  with a little bill in his hand     a slight memorandum of the trout     But paying through the nose was not the worst of it  for I had the vexation to perceive  that while I was counting over the cost  this hang dog was chuckling at the recollection of the night before  Having been fleeced most shamefully for a supper  which stuck in my stomach though I had scarcely come in for a morsel of it  I joined the muleteer with my baggage  giving to as many devils as there are saints in the calendar  the parasite  the landlord  and the inn       CH  III     The muleteer s temptation on the road  its consequences  and the situation of Gil Blas between Scylla and Charybdis   I WAS not the only passenger  There were two young gentlemen of Pegnaflor  a little chorister of Mondognedo  who was travelling about the country  and a young tradesman of Astorga  returning home from Verco with his new married wife  We soon got acquainted  and exchanged the usual confidence of travellers  telling one another whence we came and whither we were going  The bride was young enough  but so dark complexioned  with so little of what a man likes to look at in a woman  that I did not think her worth the trouble  But she had youth and a good crummy person on her side  and the muleteer  being rather less nice in his taste  was resolved to try if he could not get into her good graces  This pretty project occupied his ingenuity during the whole day  but he deferred the execution till we should get to Cacabelos  the last place where we were to stop on the road  We alighted at an inn in the out skirts of the town  a quiet convenient place  with a landlord who never troubled himself about other people s concerns  We were ushered into a private room  and got our supper snugly  but just as the cloth was taken away in comes our carrier in a furious passion     Death and the devil  I have been robbed  Here had I a hundred pistoles in my purse  But I will have them back again  I am going for a magistrate  and those gentry will not take a joke upon such serious subjects  You will all be put to the rack  unless you confess  and give back the money  The fellow played his part very naturally  and burst out of the room  leaving us in a terrible fright   We had none of us the least suspicion of the trick  and being all strangers  were afraid of one another  I looked askance at the little chorister  and he  perhaps  had no better opinion of me  Besides  we were all a pack of greenhorns  and were quite unacquainted with
