of Cardinal Spinosa  This unlucky secretary  tired of working for fifteen months without pay  took the liberty of representing his necessities to his Eminence one afternoon  and of asking for a little money towards his subsistence  It is very proper  said the minister  that you should be paid  Here  pursued he  putting into his hands an order on the royal treasury for a thousand ducats  go and receive that sum  but take notice at the same time that it balances accounts between us  The secretary would have pocketed his thousand ducats without remorse  had the thousand ducats been tangible  and the liberty of changing services secure  but just as he stepped down from the cardinal s threshold  he was tapped on the shoulder by an alguazil  and carried away to the tower of Segovia  where he has been a prisoner for a length of lime   This little historical anecdote set my teeth chattering  All was lost and gone  There was no comfort from within nor from without  My own impatience had been my ruin  just as if I had not borne starving  till patience could avail no longer  Alas  said I  wherefore must I have blurted out that ill starred fable  which went so much against the grain of the minister  He might have been just on the point of extricating me from all my miseries  it might have been the moment of that tide in the affairs of men  which sets in for sudden and enormous elevation  What wealth  what honours have slipped through the fingers by my blunder  I ought to have been aware that great folks do not love to be forestalled  but require the common privileges of elementary subsistence to be received as favours at their hands  It would have been more prudent to have kept my lenten entertainment longer without bothering the duke about it  and even to have died with hunger  that he might be blamed for letting me   Supposing any hope to have remained  my master  when I saw him after dinner  put an extinguisher over it at once  He was very serious with me  contrary to his usual custom  and spoke scarcely at all  an omen of dire dismay for the remainder of the evening  The night did not pass more tranquilly  the chagrin of seeing my agreeable illusions vanish  and the fear of swelling the calendar of state prisoners  left no room but for sighs and lamentations   The following was the critical day  The duke sent for me in the morning  I went into his chamber  with the ague fit of a criminal before his judge  Santillane  said he  showing me a paper in his hand  take this order         I shuddered at the word order  and said within myself  Oh heaven  here is the Cardinal Spinosa over again  the carriage is ordered out for Segovia  Such was my alarm at this moment  that I interrupted the minister  and throwing myself at his feet  May it please your lordship  said I  bathed in tears  I most humbly beseech your excellency to forgive me for my boldness  necessity alone impelled me to acquaint you with my wretched circumstances   The duke could not help laughing at my distress  Be comforted  Gil Blas  answered he  and hearken attentively  Though by betraying your necessities a reproach lights upon me for not having prevented them  I do not take it ill  my friend  I rather ought to be angry with myself for not having inquired how you were going on  But to begin making amends for my want of attention  there is an order on the royal treasury for fifteen hundred ducats  payable at sight  This is not all  I promise you the same sum annually  and moreover  when people of rank and substance shall solicit your interest  I have no objection to your addressing me on their behalf   In the excess of joy occasioned by such tidings  I kissed the feet of the minister  who  having commanded me to rise  continued in familiar conversation  I endeavoured to rally my free and easy humour  but the transition from sorrow to rapture was too instantaneous to be natural  I felt as comical as a culprit  with a pardon singing in his ears  just when he was on the point of being launched into eternity  My master attributed all my flurry to the sole dread of having offended him  though the fear of perpetual imprisonment had its share of influence on my nerves  He owned that he had affected to look cool  to see whether I should be hurt at the alteration  that thereby he formed his opinion with respect to the liveliness of my attachment to his person  and that his own regard for me would always be proportionate       CH  VII     A good use made of the fifteen hundred ducats  A first introduction to the trade of office  and an account of the profit accruing therefrom   THE king  as if on purpose to play into the hands of my impatience  returned to Madrid the very next day  I flew like a harpy to the royal treasury  where they paid me down upon the nail the sum drawn for in my order
