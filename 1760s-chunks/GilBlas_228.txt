then in the fashion  and his features were hacked sufficiently to illustrate a treatise of geometry  With these exceptions  his configuration was much like that of another man  As to his mental qualities  he was not altogether without understanding  and what he wanted in quickness he made up by gravity  His principles were rigid in the extreme  and it was his particular boast to be delicate on the point of honour   After two or three interviews  he distinguished me by his confidence  I soon got into all his personal history  he related on what occasions he had left an eye at Naples  an arm in Lombardy  and a leg in the Low Countries  The most admirable circumstance in all his narratives of battles and sieges  was  that not a single feature of the swaggerer peeped out  not a word escaped him to his own honour and glory  though one could readily have forgiven him for making some little display of the half which was still extant of himself  as a set off against the dilapidations which had deducted so largely from the usual contexture of a man  Officers who return from their campaigns without a scratch upon their skin or a love lock out of place  are not always so humble in their pretensions   But he told me that what gave him most uneasiness was  the having wasted a considerable portion of his private fortune on military objects  so that he had not more than a hundred ducats a year left  a poor establishment for such a pair of whiskers  a gentleman s lodging  and an amanuensis to multiply memorials by wholesale  For in point of fact  my worthy friend  added he  shrugging his shoulders  I present one  with a blessing on my endeavours  every day  and the last meets with the same attention as the first  You would say that it was an even bet between the prime minister and me  which of us two shall be fired first  the memorialist or the receiver of the memorials  I have often had the honour  too  of addressing the king on the same subject  but the rector and his curate say grace in the same key  and in the mean time  my castle of Chinchilla is falling to ruin for want of necessary repairs   Faint heart never won fair lady  said I most wisely to the captain  you are perhaps on the eve of finding all your marches and countermarches repaid with usury  I must not flatter myself with that pleasing expectation  answered Don Annibal  It is but three days since I spoke to one of the minister s secretaries  and if I am to trust his representations  I have only to hold up my head and look big  What then did he say to you  replied I  Had those poor dumb mouths your wounds no eloquence  to wring a hireling pittance for their profuse expense of blood  You shall judge for yourself  resumed Chinchilla  This secretary told me in good plain terms  My honest friend  you need not boast so much of your zeal and your fidelity  you have only done your duty in exposing yourself to danger for your country  Naked glory is the true and honourable recompense of gallant actions  and as such is the prize at which a Spaniard aims  You therefore argue on false principles  if you consider the bounty you solicit as a debt  In case it should be granted  you will owe that favour exclusively to the royal goodness  which in its extreme condescension requites those of its subjects who have served the state valiantly  Thus you see  pursued the captain  that if I had a hundred lives they are all pledged  and that I am likely to go back as hungry as I came   A brave man in distress is the most touching object in this world  I exhorted him to stick close  and offered to write his memorials out fair for nothing  I even went so far as to open my purse to him  and to beg it as a favour that he would draw upon me for whatever he wanted  But he was not one of those folks who never wait to be asked twice on such occasions  So much the reverse  that with a commendable delicacy on the subject  he thanked me for my kindness  but refused it peremptorily  He afterwards told me that  for fear of spunging upon any one  he had accustomed himself  by little and little  to live with such sobriety  that the smallest quantity of food was sufficient for his subsistence  which was but too true  His daily fare was confined to vegetables  by dint whereof his component parts were confined to skin and bone  That he might have no witnesses how ill he dined  he usually shut himself up in his chamber at that meal  I prevailed so far with him  however  by repeated entreaties  as to obtain that we should dine and sup together  then  undermining his pride by little indirect artifices of compassion  I ordered more provision and wine than I could consume to my own share  I pressed him to eat and drink  At first he made difficulties about it  but in the end there was no resisting my hospitality  After a time  his modesty becoming fainter as his diet was
