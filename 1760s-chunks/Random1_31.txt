At bedtime   80 we were shewn to our apartments  The old usurer  Strap and I  were conducted to one room  the captain  his wife  and miss Jenny to another —About midnight  my companion s bowels being disordered  he got up  in order to go backward  in his return  mistaking one door for another  he entered Weazel s chamber  and without any hesitation went to bed to his wife  who was fast asleep  the captain being at another end of the room  groping for some empty vessel  his own chamber pot being leaky  As he did not perceive Strap coming in  he went toward his own bed  after having sound a convenience  but no sooner did he feel a rough head with a cotton night cap on it  than it came into his mind  that he was got to miss Jenny s bed instead of his own  and that the head he felt  was that of some gallant  with whom she had made an assignation —Full of this conjecture  and scandalized at the prostitution of his apartment  he snatched up the vessel he had just before filled  and emptied it at once on the astonished barber and his own wife  who waking at that instant  broke forth into lamentable cries  which not only alarmed the husband beyond measure  but frightened poor Strap almost out of his senses  for he verily believed himself bewitched  especially when the incensed captain seized him by the throat  with a volley of oaths  asking him how he durst have the presumption to attempt the chastity of his wife —Poor Strap was so amazed and confounded  that he could say nothing  but —   I take God to witness she s a virgin for me  —  Mrs  Weazel enraged to find herself in such a pickle  through the precipitation of her husband  got up in her shift  and with the heel   81 of her shoe  which she found at the bed side  belaboured the captain s bald pate  till he cried   Murder  —   I ll teach you to empty your stink pots on me   cried she  you pitiful  hop o  my thumb coxcomb —What  I warrant you re jealous  you man of lath —Was it for this I condescended to take you to my bed  you poor  withered  sapless twig  —  The noise occasioned by this adventure  had brought the master of the waggon and me to the door  where we overheard all that passed  with great satisfaction  In the mean time we were alarmed with the cry of   Rape  Murder  Rape    which miss Jenny pronounced with great vociferation —   O  you vile  abominable old villain   said she  would you rob me of my virtue —But I ll be revenged of you  you old goat  I will —help  for heaven s sake  help —I shall be ravished  ruined  help  —  Some servants of the inn hearing this cry  came running up stairs with lights  and such weapons as chance afforded  when we beheld a very diverting scene —In one corner stood the poor captain shivering in his shirt  which was all torn to rags  with a woful visage  scratched all over by his wise  who had by this time wrapt the covering about her  and sat crying on the side of her bed—In the other end  lay the old usurer sprawling on miss Jenny s bed  with nothing on him but his flannel jacket over his shirt  and his tawny meagre limbs exposed to the air  while she held him fast by the two ears  and loaded him with execrations —When we asked what was the matter  she affected to weep  and told us  she was afraid that wicked rogue had ruined her in her sleep  and   82 bid us take notice of what we saw  for she intended to make use of our evidence against him —The poor wretch looked like one more dead than alive  and begged for Christ s sake to be released  which was no sooner done  than he protested she was no woman  but a devil incarnate—that she had first seduced his flesh to rebel  and then betrayed him —   Yes  cockatrice  continued he  with a faultering voice  thou knowest thou did st spread this snare for me—but thou shalt not succeed—for I will hang myself before thou shalt get a farthing of me  —  So saying  he crawled to his own bed  groaning all the way —We then advanced to the captain  who told us    Gentlemen  here has been a damn d mistake  but I ll be revenged on him who was the occasion of it —That Scotchman who carries the knapsack shall not breathe this vital air another day  if my name be Weazel —My dear  I ask you ten thousand pardons  you are sensible I could mean no harm to you  —   I know not what you meant  replied she  sobbing  but I know I have got enough to send me to my grave  —  At length they were reconciled —The wife was complimented with a share of miss Jenny s bed  her own being overflowed  and the master of the waggon
