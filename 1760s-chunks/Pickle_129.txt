reduced to the neuter gender  so  that there was no alternative at his own option  by which he had it in  his power to regain immediate freedom     What   cried the painter  in  despair   become a singer  Gadzooks  and the devil and all that  I ll  rather be still where I am  and let myself be devoured by vermin   Then  thrusting out his throat   Here is my windpipe   said he   be so good   my dear friend  as to give it a slice or two  if you don t  I shall  one of these days be found dangling in my garters  What an unfortunate    6 22 15  3 45 PM   rascal I am  What a blockhead  and a beast  and a fool  was I to trust  myself among such a barbarous ruffian race  Lord forgive you  Mr   Pickle  for having been the immediate cause of my disaster  If you had  stood by me from the beginning  according to your promise  I should not  have been teased by that coxcomb who has brought me to this pass  And  why did I put on this d  d unlucky dress  Lord curse that chattering  Jezebel of a landlady  who advised such a preposterous disguise   a  disguise which has not only brought me to this pass  but also rendered  me abominable to myself  and frightful to others  for when I this  morning signified to the turnkey that I wanted to be shaved  he looked  at my beard with astonishment  and  crossing himself  muttered his Pater  Noster  believing me  I suppose  to be a witch  or something worse  And  Heaven confound that loathsome banquet of the ancients  which provoked  me to drink too freely  that I might wash away the taste of that  accursed sillikicaby    Our young gentleman  having heard this lamentation to an end  excused  himself for his conduct by representing that he could not possibly  foresee the disagreeable consequences that attended it  and in the  mean time strenuously counselled him to submit to the terms of his  enlargement  He observed that he was now arrived at that time of life  when the lusts of the flesh should be entirely mortified within him  and  his greatest concern ought to be the of his soul  to which nothing could  more effectually contribute than the amputation which was proposed  that  his body  as well as his mind  would profit by the change  because he  would have no dangerous appetite to gratify  and no carnal thoughts to  divert him from the duties of his profession  and his voice  which was  naturally sweet  would improve to such a degree  that he would captivate  the ears of all the people of fashion and taste  and in a little time be  celebrated under the appellation of the English Senesino   These arguments did not fail to make impression upon the painter  who  nevertheless started two objections to his compliance  namely  the  disgrace of the punishment  and the dread of his wife  Pickle undertook  to obviate these difficulties  by assuring him that the sentence would  be executed so privately as never to transpire  and that his wife could  not be so unconscionable  after so many years of cohabitation  as to  take exceptions to an expedient by which she would not only enjoy the  conversation of her husband  but even the fruits of those talents which  the knife would so remarkably refine   Pallet shook his hand at this last remonstrance  as if he thought it  would not be altogether convincing to his spouse  but yielded to the  proposal  provided her consent could be obtained  Just as he signified  this condescension  the jailer entered  and addressing himself to the  supposed lady  expressed his satisfaction in having the honour to tell  her that she was no longer a prisoner  As the painter did not understand  one word of what he said  Peregrine undertook the office of interpreter   and made his friend believe the jailer s speech was no other than an  intimation that the ministry had sent a surgeon to execute what was  proposed  and that the instruments and dressings were prepared in the  next room  Alarmed and terrified at this sudden appointment  he flew  to the other end of the room  and  snatching up an earthen chamber pot   which was the only offensive weapon in the place  put himself in a  posture of defence  and with many oaths threatened to try the temper  of the barber s skull  if he should presume to set his nose within the  apartment     6 22 15  3 45 PM   The jailer  who little expected such a reception  concluded that  the poor gentlewoman had actually lost her wits  and retreated with  precipitation  leaving the door open as he went out  upon which Pickle   gathering up the particulars of his dress with great despatch  crammed  them into Pallet s arms  and taking notice that now the coast was clear
