was one of the greatest geniuses of his time  yet all his merit could not procure him a bare subsistence  Being by degrees driven into an hatred of all mankind from the little pity he found amongst them  he even ventured at last ungratefully to impute his calamities to providence  In his last agonies  when the priest entreated him to rely on the justice of heaven  and ask mercy from him that made him  If God  replies he  has shewn me no justice here  what reason have I to expect any from him hereafter  But being answered  that a suspension of justice was no argument that should induce us to doubt of its reality  let me entreat you  continued his confessor  by all that is dear  to be reconciled to God  your father  your maker  and friend  No  replied the exasperated wretch  you know the manner in which he left me to live   and pointing to the straw on which he was stretched  and you see the manner in which he leaves me to die   But the sufferings of the poet in other countries is nothing when compared to his distresses here  the names of Spencer and Otway  Butler and Dryden    84 are every day mentioned as a national reproach  some of them lived in a state of precarious indigence  and others literally died of hunger   At present the few poets of England no longer depend on the Great for subsistence  they have now no other patrons but the public  and the public  collectively considered  is a good and a generous master  It is indeed  too frequently mistaken as to the merits of every candidate for favour  but to make amends  it is never mistaken long  A performance indeed may be forced for a time into reputation  but destitute of real merit it soon sinks  time  the touchstone of what is truly valuable  will soon discover the fraud  and an author should never arrogate to himself any share of success  till his works have been read at least ten years with satisfaction   A man of letters at present  whose works are valuable  is perfectly sensible of their value  Every polite member of the community by buying what he writes  contributes to reward him  The ridicule therefore of living in a garret  might have been wit in the last age  but continues such no longer  because no longer true  A writer of real merit now may easily be rich if his heart be set only on fortune  and for those who have no merit  it is but fit that such should remain in merited obscurity  He may now refuse an invitation to dinner  without fearing to incur his patron s displeasure  or to starve by remaining at home  He may now venture to appear in company with just such cloaths as other men generally wear  and talk even to princes  with all the conscious superiority of wisdom  Though he cannot boast of fortune here  yet he can bravely assert the dignity of independence  Adieu     85  LETTER LXXXII  From the same   I HAVE interested myself so long in all the concerns of this people  that I am almost become an Englishman  I now begin to read with pleasure of their taking towns or gaining battles  and secretly wish disappointment to all the enemies of Britain  Yet still my regard to mankind fills me with concern for their contentions  I could wish to see the disturbances of Europe once more amicably adjusted  I am an enemy to nothing in this good world but war  I hate fighting between rival states  I hate it between man and man  I hare fighting even between women   I already informed you  that while Europe was at variance  we were also threatened from the stage with an irreconcileable opposition  and that our singing women were resolved to sing at each other to the end of the season  O my friend  those fears were just  They are nor only determined to sing at each other to the end of the season  but what is worse  to sing the same song  and what is still more insupportable  to make us pay for hearing   If they be for war  for my part I should advise them to have a public congress  and there fairly squall at each other  What signifies sounding the trumpet of defiance at a distance  and calling in the town to fight their battles  I would have them come boldly into one of the most open and frequented streets  face to face  and there try their still in quavering     86However this may be  resolved I am that they shall not touch one single piece of silver more of mine  Though I have ears for music  thanks to heaven  they are not altogether asses ears  What  Polly and the Pick pocket to night  Polly and the Pick pocket to morrow night  and Polly and the Pick pocket again  I want patience  I ll hear no more  My soul is out of tune  all jarring discord  and confusion  Rest  rest  ye three dear clinking shillings in my pocket s bottom  the music you make is more harmonious to my spirit  than cat gut  rosin  or all the nightingales
