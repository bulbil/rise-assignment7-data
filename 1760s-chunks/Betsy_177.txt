man   whom she was resolved to shew him had the same pretensions as himself    but though she happened to be disappointed in her expectation in this    she did not want other sufficient matter for her diversion       Sir Frederick  to shew the impatience of his passion  came very soon   after dinner  she received him with as grave an air as she could   possibly put on  but it was not in her power  nor indeed would have been   in any one else s  to continue it for any long time  his conversation   was much of a piece with his letters  and his actions even more   extravagant       Never was such an Orlando Furioso in love  on his first approach  he   had indeed the boldness to take one of her hands  and put it to   his mouth  but  afterwards  whatever he said to her was on his knees    He threw himself prostrate on the carpet before her  grasped her   feet  and tenderly kissed each shoe  with the same vehemence as he   could have done her lips  and as much devotion as the pilgrims at   Rome do the pantofle of his holiness    Darts   Flames   Immortal   joys   Death   Despair   Heaven   Hell   Ever during woe    and all the   epithets in the whole vocabulary of Cupid s legend  begun and ended   every sentence of his discourse  This way of entertaining her was so   extraordinary  and so new to her  that she could not forbear sometimes   returning it with a smile  which  in spite of her endeavours to preserve   a serious deportment  diffused a gaiety through all her air       Those who had told Sir Frederick  that the way to please this lady  was   to soothe her vanity  either knew not  or had forgot to inform him  she   had also an equal share of good sense  so that  mistaking the change he   had observed in her looks for an indication of her being charmed with   his manner of behaviour  he acted and re acted over all his fopperies    and felt as much secret pride in repeating them  as a celebrated singer   on the stage does in obeying the voice of an encore       It is probable  however  that he would have continued in them long   enough to have tired Miss Betsy so much as to have made her give him   some demonstrative remark that the pleasantry he had seen her in    proceeded rather from derision than satisfaction  if  divine service   being ended  some ladies  as they came from church  had not called to   visit her  The sound of company coming up stairs  obliged him to break   off in the middle of a rhapsody  which he  doubtless  thought very fine    and he took his leave somewhat hastily  telling her  the passion with   which he was inflamed  was too fierce to be restrained within those   bounds which she might expect before witnesses  and that he would wait   on her the next day  when he hoped she would be at more liberty to   receive his vows       Eased of the constraint which decency  and the respect which she thought   due to his quality  had laid her under while he was there  her natural   sprightliness burst with double force  Mr  Munden  who came in soon   after  felt the effects of it  he  indeed  enjoyed a benefit he little   dreamt of  The absurd conversation of a rival he as yet knew nothing of    served to make all he said sound more agreeable than ever in the ears of   his mistress  in this excess of good humour  she not only made a   handsome apology for the treatment he had received at Mrs  Modely s   a   thing she had never before vouchsafed to do to any of her lovers  but   also gave him an invitation to squire her to a country dancing  in which   she had engaged to make one the ensuing night                CHAPTER IV       If it were not for some particulars  might be as well passed over as   read          Miss Betsy  one would think  had now sufficient matter to employ her   meditations on the score of those two lovers who at present laid close   siege to her  neither of whom she was willing to part with entirely  and   to retain either she found required some management  Mr  Munden was   beginning to grow impatient at the little progress his long courtship   had made on her affections  and Sir Frederick Fineer  on the other hand    was
