by commissioners appointed by the Queen  the Chancellor at the head of them  Rogers suffered in Smithfield  when he was brought to the stake  he had it in his power to save himself  by recanting his opinions  but neither hopes nor fears could prevail upon him to desert his religion  When the faggots were placed around him  he seemed no way daunted at the preparation  but cried out    I resign my life with joy  in testimony of the doctrine of Jesus   Hooper had his pardon offered him upon the same terms  but he refused it with equal indignation  This old martyr  who was executed at Gloucester  was three quarters of an hour in torment  the fire  either from malice or neglect  had not been sufficiently kindled  so that his legs and thighs were first burnt  and one of his hands dropped off before he expired     Saunders and Taylor  two other clergymen  whose zeal had been distinguished in carrying on   270 the reformation  were the next that suffered Taylor was put into a pitch barrel  and before the fire was kindled  a faggot from an unknown hand was thrown at his head  which streamed with blood  still  however  he continued undaunted  singing the xxxist Psalm in English  which one of the spectators observing  hit him a blow on the side of the head  and commanded him to pray in Latin  he therefore continued a few minutes silent  only with his eyes stedfastly fixed upon heaven  when one of the guards  either through impatience or compassion  struck him down with his halbert  and thus delivered him from a world of pain to a life of immortal happiness   The death of these only served to encrease the savage appetite of the Monks and Popish Bishops for fresh slaughter  Bonner  bloated at once with rage and luxury  let loose his vengeance without restraint  while the Queen  by letters  exhorted him to pursue the pious work without pity or interruption  and now Ridley  Bishop of London  and the venerable Latimer  Bishop of Worcester  were to receive the Martyr s crown  Ridley was one of the ablest champions of the reformation  his piety  learning  and solidity of judgment  were admired by his friends and dreaded by his enemies  The night before his execution he invited the mayor of Oxford  and his wife  to see him die  and  when he saw them melted into tears  he himself appeared quite unmoved  heaven being his secret supporter and comforter in this hour of agony  When he came to the stake where he was to be burnt  he found his old friend Latimer there before him  and began to comfort him in his sufferings  while Latimer was as ready to return the kind office  A furious bigot ascended to preach to   271 them  before the execution of their sentence  Ridley gave a serious attention to the sermon  and offered to answer it  but this he was not allowed to do  At length the fire was set to the pile  Latimer was soon out of pain  but Ridley continued much longer  his legs being consumed before the fire reached his vitals   Cranmer  whom you have seen already so zealous in the reformation  was the next personage of note that was burnt  he had this peculiar aggravation of his calamity  that he was prevailed upon to abjure his principles and sign his recantation  by the hopes of pardon  Being  notwithstanding this  brought to the stake  his confusion and shame were there inexpressible  there he retracted all that their false promises had made him abjure  and  resolving that the hand which had signed should first suffer  he held it out  with an intrepid countenance  in the flames  till it dropped off  frequently crying out  in the midst of his agony  that unworthy hand   Bonner now seemed not satisfied with single deaths  but sent men in whole companies to the flames  women themselves were not spared  but the cruelty went yet farther  a woman  condemned for heresy  was delivered of a child in the midst of the flames  some of the spectators humanely snatched it out  the magistrate  who was a Papist  ordered it to be flung in again  and it was then consumed with the mother  The perpetrators of such actions were no longer human  they must have forfeited all pretensions to the name  for hell itself could be guilty of nothing more atrocious   But they were not content with punishing the living alone  their vengeance extended even to the   272 dead  Bucer and Fagius  two German divines  who had been dead some years before  were cited  very formally  to appear and give an account of their faith  in default of their appearance  their bodies were taken from their graves  and being hung upon a gallows were consumed to ashes  The wife of Peter Martyr  who himself had the prudence to escape  was dug up like the former  and buried in a dung hill  In short  the persecutions of the priests and friars went such lengths  that the very magistrates who had at first been instruments of their cruelty  at last refused to assist at the punishing heretics
