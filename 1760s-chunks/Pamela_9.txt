me  than go to my sister Davers  He   looked so  as filled me with affrightment  I don t know how  wildly  I   thought       I said  when I could speak  Your honour will forgive me  but as you have   no lady for me to wait upon  and my good lady has been now dead this   twelvemonth  I had rather  if it would not displease you  wait upon Lady   Davers  because        I was proceeding  and he said  a little hastily  Because you are a   little fool  and know not what s good for yourself  I tell you I will   make a gentlewoman of you  if you be obliging  and don t stand in your   own light  and so saying  he put his arm about me  and kissed me       Now  you will say  all his wickedness appeared plainly  I struggled and   trembled  and was so benumbed with terror  that I sunk down  not in a   fit  and yet not myself  and I found myself in his arms  quite void   of strength  and he kissed me two or three times  with frightful   eagerness   At last I burst from him  and was getting out of the   summer house  but he held me back  and shut the door       I would have given my life for a farthing  And he said  I ll do you no   harm  Pamela  don t be afraid of me  I said  I won t stay  You won t    hussy  said he  Do you know whom you speak to  I lost all fear  and all   respect  and said  Yes  I do  sir  too well   Well may I forget that I   am your servant  when you forget what belongs to a master       I sobbed and cried most sadly  What a foolish hussy you are  said he    Have I done you any harm  Yes  sir  said I  the greatest harm in the   world  You have taught me to forget myself and what belongs to me    and have lessened the distance that fortune has made between us  by   demeaning yourself  to be so free to a poor servant  Yet  sir  I will be   bold to say  I am honest  though poor  and if you was a prince  I would   not be otherwise       He was angry  and said  Who would have you otherwise  you foolish slut    Cease your blubbering  I own I have demeaned myself  but it was only to   try you  If you can keep this matter secret  you ll give me the better   opinion of your prudence  and here s something  said he  putting some   gold in my hand  to make you amends for the fright I put you in  Go    take a walk in the garden  and don t go in till your blubbering is over    and I charge you say nothing of what is past  and all shall be well  and   I ll forgive you       I won t take the money  indeed  sir  said I  poor as I am I won t take   it  For  to say truth  I thought it looked like taking earnest  and so   I put it upon the bench  and as he seemed vexed and confused at what he   had done  I took the opportunity to open the door  and went out of the   summer house       He called to me  and said  Be secret  I charge you  Pamela  and don t go   in yet  as I told you       O how poor and mean must those actions be  and how little must they make   the best of gentlemen look  when they offer such things as are unworthy   of themselves  and put it into the power of their inferiors to be   greater than they       I took a turn or two in the garden  but in sight of the house  for fear   of the worst  and breathed upon my hand to dry my eyes  because I would   not be too disobedient  My next shall tell you more       Pray for me  my dear father and mother  and don t be angry I have not   yet run away from this house  so late my comfort and delight  but now my   terror and anguish  I am forced to break off hastily
