master  said the broker coolly  I never ask too much  I have but one price  But here  added he  holding up the suits I had thrown aside  take these  I can afford to sell them a better bargain  All this only inflamed my eagerness to buy what I was cheapening  and as I had no idea that he would have made any abatement  I paid him down sixty ducats  When he saw how easily a fool and his money were parted  I verily believe that in spite of the moral sense  he heartily repented not having taken a hint from the extortionate Israelite  But reconciling himself as well as he could to the small profit  to which he professed to confine himself  of a pound upon a penny  he retreated with his journeymen  I was not suffered to forget that they must have something for their trouble   I had now a cloak  a doublet  and a very decent pair of breeches  The rest of my wardrobe was to be thought of  and this took up the whole morning  I bought some linen  a hat  silk stockings  shoes  and a sword  and concluded by putting on my purchases  What pleasure was it to see myself so well accoutred  My eyes were never cloyed  as it were  with the richness of my attire  Never did peacock look at his own plumage with less philosophy  On that very day  I paid a second visit to Donna Mencia  who received me with her usual affability  She thanked me over again for the service I had rendered her  On that subject  rapid was the interchange of compliments  Then  wishing every kind of success  she bade me farewell  and withdrew  without giving me anything but a ring worth thirty pistoles  which she begged me to keep as a remembrance   I looked very foolish with my ring  I had reckoned on a much more considerable present  Thus  little satisfied with the lady s bounty  I measured back my steps in a very musing attitude  but as I entered the inn door  a man over took me  and throwing off his wrapping cloak  discovered a large bag under his arm  At the vision of the bag  apparently full of current coin  I stood gaping as did most of the company present  The voice of angel or archangel could not have been sweeter  than when this messenger of earthly dross  laying the bag upon the table  said  Signor Gil Blas  the lady marchioness desires her compliments  I bowed the bearer out  with an accumulation of fine speeches  and  as soon as his back was turned  pounced upon the bag  like a hawk upon its quarry  and bore it between my talons to my chamber  I untied it without loss of time  and the contents were     a thousand ducats  The landlord who had overheard the bearer  came in just as I had done counting them  to know what was in the bag  The sight of my riches displayed upon a table  struck him in a very forcible manner  What the devil  here is a sum of money  So  so  you are the man  pursued he with a waggish sort of leer  you know how to    tickle the    fancies of the ladies  Four and twenty hours only have you been in Burgos  and marchionesses  I warrant you  have surrendered at the first summons   This discourse was not so much amiss  I was half inclined to leave Majuelo in his error  for it flattered my vanity  I do not wonder young fellows are fond of passing for men of gallantry  But as yet the purity of my morals was proof against the suggestions of my pride  I undeceived my landlord  by telling him Donna Mencia s story  to which he listened very attentively  Afterwards I let him into the state of my affairs  and  as he seemed to take an interest in them  besought him to assist me with his advice  He ruminated for some time  then said with a serious air  Master Gil Blas  I have taken a liking to you  and since you are candid enough to open your heart to me  I will tell you sincerely what I think would suit you best  You were evidently born for a court life  I recommend you to go thither  and to get about the person of some considerable nobleman  But make a point either of getting at his secrets  or administering to his pleasures  unless you do that  it will be all lost time in his family  I know the great  they reckon nothing upon the zeal and attachment of a real friend  but only care for pimping sycophants  You have  besides  another string to your bow  You are young  with an attractive person  parts out of the question  for they are not at all times necessary  it is hard if you cannot turn the head of some rich widow  or handsome wife with a broomstick for her husband  Love may ruin men of fortune  but it makes amends by feathering the nests of those who have none  My vote  therefore  is for Madrid  but
