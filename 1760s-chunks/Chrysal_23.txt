interrupting the mysterious process      As my soul hung in this ecstasy  the flame which wrapped the   sacred birth in the bed of purification arose with the glory too strong   for mortal sense and filled the room  My senses sank under the   pressure  and I was dissolved into a trance  when a voice  celestially   harmonious  encouraged me to raise my eyes  and I beheld the body   of the effulgence condense into an incorporeal substance in the   form of a spirit  while a placid shade softened the fierceness of the   radiance  and made it tolerable to human sense      An holy horror curdled aU my blood   but the melody of the   same voice  which had before emboldened me to look up  reassured   my fainting heart with these words   â€”       Son of pains and votary of science   thy unwearied perseverance         2 ADVENTUBES OF A GUINEA     has prevailed  and I am sent to crown thee with a virgin rose   I   am ChrysaU   the spirit of that incorruptible mass now glowing   in that vase before thee  who  in reward of thy noble constancy   in ofiering this thy last mite on the shrine of knowledge  am come   to reveal to thee the mysteries of Nature  and satisfy that raging   thirst for wisdom which has so long excruciated thy soul  and thus   emaciated thy body  And that thou mayest the better comprehend   the greatness of this honour vouchsafed unto thee  I shall trace   the operations of Nature through her most secret recesses  and   illustrate the truth of what I say by a detail of the various incidents   of my being in my present state  to prepare thee for the recep    tion and proper use of the grand secret  which I shall afterwards   communicate        I can see your thoughts   and will answer every doubt which   may arise in your mind at the wonders of my relation without the   interruption of your inquiries  as awful silence is the essence of   my converse  the least breach of which puts an end to it for ever     Listen  then  in mute attention  nor let a breath disturb the mystic   tale         The works of Nature are infinitely various  and her methods of   operation inscrutable to the curiosity of that vain intruder  Reason    which has of late presumed to pry into her ways  and to doubt  if   not deny  the reality of all effects which her short sighted eye cannot   trace to their causes   a presumption that has justly shortened the   hne of human knowledge  and condensed the mist of ignorance which   overspreads the world  Some noble efforts  though  I see the nature   of man preparing to make  to recover that eminence of conjecture   and credulity which alone can merit such a communication of   extraordinary knowledge as is now indulged to you  Some of the   most hidden truths which I shaU here unfold has unassisted genius   discovered already   and more shall curious penetration make   learned guesses at  even in this sceptic age 2      Know  then  that in the economy of Nature  to ease the trouble   and keep up the state of its great author    a subordination of minis    terial spirits execute the system of his government in aU its degrees     one of whom  for the greater order and expedition  is made to actuate   every divided particle of matter in this immense universe      In   this distribution  that portion of gold was assigned to my charge    upon its first feehng the influence of the   ethereal fire of the sun    the general minister of the divine commands      This happened   in Peru  where that body  of which I then became the spirit  was       This name is evidently derived from Xpuiris  gold  and may probably   signify golden  from her animating a piece of gold   for  by the universal   authority of the occult philosophy  spirits are always denominated from   their office       See all the modern hypothetical philosophy        Essay on Spirit        Siris  Would not these  and many other passages of the same nature   which support the systems of those celebrated works almost tempt us to   think that the writers of them must have had a communication with   this or some such spirit  to come at knowledge so supernatural           ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 5      torn from its peaceful bed  two hundred fathoms deep in the bowelsi   of the earth
