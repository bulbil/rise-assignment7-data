to me than all the ingots of the Indies  But it is not precisely so with our nymph of Albarazin  she has a little Jewish blood to plead  when the Christian precept of loving your neighbour as herself is preached up to her  She would pick her own natural father s pocket  so judge you whether she would be above making a bargain with a travelling uncle   She has only to name her own terms  answered Don Annibal  Whatever my pension may be  she shall have the third of it annually if she pleases  I will pledge my word for it  and that proportion ought to satisfy her craving  if his Catholic Majesty had settled his whole exchequer on me  I would as soon take your word as your bond  for my own part  replied the nimble footed messenger of Don Rodrigo  I know that it will stand the assay  but you have to deal with a little creature who knows herself  and naturally supposes that she knows all the rest of the world by the same token  Besides  she would like better to take it in the lump  two thirds to be paid down now in ready money  Why  how the devil does she mean that I should get the wherewithal  bawled the captain in a quandary  Does she take me for an auditor of public accounts  or treasurer to a charity  You cannot have made her acquainted with my circumstances  Yes  but I have  replied Pedrillo  she knows very well that you are poorer than Job  after what she has heard from me she could think no otherwise  But do not make yourself uneasy  my brain is never at a loss for an expedient  I know an old scoundrel of an usurer  who will take ten per cent  if he can get no more  You must assign your first year s pension to him  in acknowledgment for a like valuable consideration from him  which you will in point of fact receive  only deducting the above mentioned interest  As to security  the lender will take your castle at Chinchilla  for want of better  there will be no dispute about that   The captain declared his readiness to accept the terms  in case of his being so fortunate as to possess any beneficial interest in the good things to be given away the next morning  It happened accordingly  He got a government with a pension of three hundred pistoles  As soon as the news came  he signed and sealed as required  settled his little concerns in town  and went off again for New Castile with a balance of some few pistoles in his favour       CH  XIII     Gil Blas comes across his dear friend Fabricio at court  Great ecstacy on both sides  They adjourn together  and compare notes  but their conversation is too curious to be anticipated   I HAD contracted a habit of going to the royal palace every morning  where I lounged away two or three good hours in seeing the good people pass to and fro  but their aspect was less imposing there than in other places  as the lesser stars turn pale in the presence of the sun  One day as I was walking back and fore  and strutting about the apartments  making about as wise a figure there as my neighbours  I spied out Fabricio  whom I had left at Valladolid in the service of a hospital director  It surprised me not a little that he was chatting familiarly with the Duke of Medina Sidonia and the Marquis of Santa Cruz  Those two noblemen  if my senses did not deceive me  were listening with admiration to his prattle  To crown the whole  he was as handsomely dressed as a grandee   Surely I must be mistaken  thought I  Can this possibly be the son of Nunez the barber  More likely it is some young courtier who bears a strong resemblance to him  But my suspense was of no long duration  The party broke up  and I accosted Fabricio  He knew me at once  took me by the hand  and after pressing through the crowd to get out of the precincts  said with a hearty greeting  My dear Gil Blas  I am delighted to see you again  What are you doing at Madrid  Are you still at service  Some place about the court perhaps  How do matters stand with you  Let me into the history of all that has happened to you since your precipitate flight from Valladolid  You ask a great many questions in a breath  replied I  and we are not in a fit place for story telling  You are in the right  answered he  we shall be better at home Come  I will shew you the way  it is not far hence I am quite my own master  with all my comforts about me  perfectly easy as to the main chance  with a light heart and a happy temper  because I am determined to see everything on the bright side   I accepted the proposal  and Fabricio escorted me  We stopped at a house of magnificent appearance  where he told me that he lived  There was a court to cross  on one side it had a grand staircase leading to a suite of state
