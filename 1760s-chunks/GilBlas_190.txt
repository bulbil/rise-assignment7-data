must be allowed that they could not at first distinguish whether they were to consider us as their deliverers  or as a fresh gang who had taken them out of one furnace to cast them hissing into another  But we recovered their spirits by the assurance  that we should lodge them safely in a public house which Ambrose mentioned as not being more than half a mile off  whence they might take all necessary measures to pursue their journey in whatever direction they thought proper  After these words of comfort  which seemed to sink deep  we placed them in their carriage  and conducted them out of the wood  holding their mules by the bridle  Our clerical friends instituted a ghostly visitation to the pockets of the vanquished banditti  Our next step was to recover Don Alphonso s horse  We also took to ourselves the steeds of the robbers  waiting as they were to be released from the trees to which they were tied near the field of battle  With this extensive cavalcade we followed brother Anthony  mounted on one of the mules  and conducting the carriage to the inn  whither we did not arrive in less than two hours  though he had pledged his credit that the distance from the wood was very short   We knocked roughly at the door  Every living creature was napping  except the fleas  The landlord and landlady got on their clothes in a hurry  and were not at all annoyed at finding their rest disturbed by the arrival of an equipage  which promised to do more for the good of the house than it eventually did  The whole inn was lighted up in an instant  Don Alphonso and the stage bred son of Lucinda lent their assistance to the gentleman and lady in alighting from the carriage  and acted as their ushers in leading the way to the room prepared for them by the landlord  Compliments flew backwards and forwards like shuttlecocks  but we were not a little astonished at discovering the Count de Polan himself and his daughter Seraphina  in the persons we had just rescued  It would be difficult to represent by words the surprise of that lady  as well as of Don Alphonso  when they recognized each other s features  The count took no notice of it  his attention being engrossed by other matters  He set about relating to us in what manner the robbers had attacked him  and how they secured his daughter and himself  after having killed his postilion  a page  and a valet de chambre  He ended with declaring how deeply he felt his obligation  and that if we would call upon him at Toledo  where he should be in a month  we should judge for ourselves whether he felt as a grateful heart ought to feel   His lordship s daughter was not backward in her acknowledgments for her timely rescue  and as we were of opinion  that is  Raphael and myself  that we should do a good turn to Don Alphonso by giving him an opportunity of a minute s private parley with the young widow  we contrived to keep the Count de Polan in play  Lovely Seraphina  said Don Alphonso to the lady in a low voice  I no longer lament over the lot which obliges me to live like a man banished from civil society  since I have been so fortunate as to assist in the important service just rendered you  What then  answered she  with a sigh  is it you who have saved my life and honour  Is it to you that we are so indebted  myself equally with my father  Ah  Don Alphonso  why were you the instrument of my brother s death  She said no more upon the subject  but he conceived clearly by these words  and by the tone in which they were pronounced  that if he was over head and ears in love with Seraphina  she was equally out of her depth in the same passion       BOOK THE SIXTH       CH  I     The fate of Gil Blas and his Companions after they took leave of the Count de Polan  One of Ambrose s notable contrivances set off by the manner of its execution   THE Count de Polan  after having exhausted half the night in thanking us  and protesting that we might reckon upon his substantial acknowledgments  sent for the landlord to consult him on the best method of getting safely to Turis  whither it was his intention to go  We had nothing to do with this nobleman s further progress  and therefore left him to take his own measures  Our departure from the inn was now resolved on  and we followed Lamela like sheep after the bell wether   After two hours  travelling  the day overtook us near Campillo  We made as expeditiously as possible for the mountains between that hamlet and Requena  There we wore out the day in taking our rest and reckoning up our stock  which the spoil of the robbers had considerably replenished  to the amount of more than three hundred pistoles  the lawful ravage of their pockets  We began our march again with the setting in of the night  and on the following morning reached the frontier of Valencia in safety  We got quietly into the first wood that offered as a shelter  The inmost recesses of
