      When he returned  he said  He had had a pleasant ride  and was led out   to a greater distance than he intended  At supper he told me  that he   had a great mind Mr  Williams should marry us  because  he said  it   would shew a thorough reconciliation on his part  But  said he  most   generously  I am apprehensive  from what passed between you  that the   poor man will take it hardly  and as a sort of insult  which I am not   capable of  What says my girl   Do you think he would  I hope not  sir    said I  As to what he may think  I can t answer  but as to any reason   for his thoughts  I can  For indeed  sir  said I  you have been already   so generous  that he cannot  I think  mistake your goodness       He then spoke with some resentment of Lady Davers s behaviour  and I   asked  if any thing new had occurred  Yes  said he  I have had a   letter delivered me from her impertinent husband  professedly at her   instigation  that amounted to little less than a piece of insolent   bravery  on supposing I was about to marry you  I was so provoked    added he  that after I had read it  I tore it in a hundred pieces  and   scattered them in the air  and bid the man who brought it let his master   know what I had done with his letter  and so would not permit him to   speak to me  as he would fain have done   I think the fellow talked   somewhat of his lady coming hither  but she shall not set her foot   within my doors  and I suppose this treatment will hinder her       I was much concerned at this  And he said  Had I a hundred sisters    Pamela  their opposition should have no weight with me  and I did not   intend you should know it  but you can t but expect a little difficulty   from the pride of my sister  who have suffered so much from that of   her brother  and we are too nearly allied in mind  as well as blood  I   find   But this is not her business  And if she would have made it so    she should have done it with more decency  Little occasion had she to   boast of her birth  that knows not what belongs to good manners       I said  I am very sorry  sir  to be the unhappy occasion of a   misunderstanding between so good a brother and so worthy a sister  Don t   say so  Pamela  because this is an unavoidable consequence of the   happy prospect before us  Only bear it well yourself  because she is my   sister  and leave it to me to make her sensible of her own rashness       If  sir  said I  the most lowly behaviour  and humble deportment  and in   every thing shewing a dutiful regard to good Lady Davers  will have any   weight with her ladyship  assure yourself of all in my power to mollify   her  No  Pamela  returned he  don t imagine  when you are my wife  I   will suffer you to do any thing unworthy of that character  I know the   duty of a husband  and will protect your gentleness to the utmost  as   much as if you were a princess by descent       You are inexpressibly good  sir  said I  but I am far from taking a   gentle disposition to shew a meanness of spirit  And this is a trial I   ought to expect  and well I may bear it  that have so many benefits to   set against it  which all spring from the same cause       Well  said he  all the matter shall be this  We will talk of our   marriage as a thing to be done next week  I find I have spies upon   me wherever I go  and whatever I do  But now  I am on so laudable   a pursuit  that I value them not  nor those who employ them  I have   already ordered my servants to have no conference with any body for   ten or twelve days to come  And Mrs  Jewkes tells me every one names   Thursday come se nnight for our nuptials  So I will get Mr  Peters  who   wants to see my little chapel  to assist Mr  Williams  under the notion   of breakfasting with me next Thursday morning  since you won t have it   sooner  and there will nobody else be wanting  and I will beg of Mr
