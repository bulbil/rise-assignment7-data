embrace them  rather than forfeit my good name    let who will be the tempter  And of this pray rest satisfied  and think   better of Your dutiful DAUGHTER till death       My master continues to be very affable to me  As yet I see no cause to   fear any thing  Mrs  Jervis  the housekeeper  too  is very civil to   me  and I have the love of every body  Sure they can t all have designs   against me  because they are civil  I hope I shall always behave so as   to be respected by every one  and that nobody would do me more hurt than   I am sure I would do them  Our John so often goes your way  that I will   always get him to call  that you may hear from me  either by writing     for it brings my hand in   or by word of mouth                LETTER IV         DEAR MOTHER       For the last was to my father  in answer to his letter  and so I will   now write to you  though I have nothing to say  but what will make me   look more like a vain hussy  than any thing else  However  I hope I   shan t be so proud as to forget myself  Yet there is a secret pleasure   one has to hear one s self praised  You must know  then  that my Lady   Davers  who  I need not tell you  is my master s sister  has been a   month at our house  and has taken great notice of me  and given me good   advice to keep myself to myself  She told me I was a pretty wench  and   that every body gave me a very good character  and loved me  and bid me   take care to keep the fellows at a distance  and said  that I might do    and be more valued for it  even by themselves       But what pleased me much was  what I am going to tell you  for at table    as Mrs  Jervis says  my master and her ladyship talking of me  she told   him she thought me the prettiest wench she ever saw in her life  and   that I was too pretty to live in a bachelor s house  since no lady he   might marry would care to continue me with her  He said  I was vastly   improved  and had a good share of prudence  and sense above my   years  and that it would be pity  that what was my merit should be my   misfortune   No  says my good lady  Pamela shall come and live with me    I think  He said  with all his heart  he should be glad to have me so   well provided for  Well  said she  I ll consult my lord about it  She   asked how old I was  and Mrs  Jervis said  I was fifteen last February    O  says she  if the wench  for so she calls all us maiden servants    takes care of herself  she ll improve yet more and more  as well in her   person as mind       Now  my dear father and mother  though this may look too vain to be   repeated by me  yet are you not rejoiced  as well as I  to see my master   so willing to part with me   This shews that he has nothing bad in his   heart  But John is just going away  and so I have only to say  that I   am  and will always be                                Your honest as well as dutiful DAUGHTER       Pray make use of the money  You may now do it safely                LETTER V         MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       John being to go your way  I am willing to write  because he is so   willing to carry any thing for me  He says it does him good at his heart   to see you both  and to hear you talk  He says you are both so sensible    and so honest  that he always learns something from you to the purpose    It is a thousand pities  he says  that such worthy hearts should not   have better luck in the world  and wonders  that you  my father  who are   so well able to teach  and write so good a hand  succeeded no better in
