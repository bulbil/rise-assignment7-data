I gave him all the particulars  not excepting Laura s story  and Lucretia s parentage  His lordship was delighted at the latter circumstance  and enjoined me  with a cordial compliment on my skill in such delicate negotiations  to finish as auspiciously as I had begun my undertaking   I went to look for Carnero  and told him that it was his excellency s pleasure he should make out an order for the admission of Estella and Lucretia  actresses from the Toledo theatre  into his majesty s company  Say you so  Signor de Santillane  answered Carnero with a sarcastic leer  you shall not be kept long in suspense  since you take so marked an interest in the fortunes of these two ladies  He expedited the order in my presence  and within a week the mother and daughter sent me notice of their arrival  I immediately hastened to their lodging near the theatre  and after an interchange of thanks on their part  and assurances of continued support on mine  left them with my best wishes for a bnlliant career of success   Their names were announced in the bills as two new actresses  engaged by the special mandate of the court  They made their first appearance in a play  which they had been accustomed to perform in at Toledo with loud and unanimous applause   Novelty is the very life and soul of theatrical entertainments  The house was uncommonly crowded  and I of course was among the audience  I was rather frightened before the curtain drew up  Prejudiced as I was in favour of the candidates  my alarm was in proportion to my interest  But when once they were fairly on the boards  the din of welcome quieted all my apprehensions  Estella was considered as a first rate actress in comic parts  and Lucretia as a female Roscius in heroines and love sick damsels  But the love which she feigned herself  she really kindled in the hearts of the spectators  Some admired the beauty of her eyes  others were touched with the plaintive sweetness of her voice  and all  bowing to the triumph of youth  vivacity  and elegance  went away in raptures with her person   My lord duke  who took an uncommon interest in this theatrical event  was at the play that evening  I saw him leave his box at the end of the piece  with evident approbation of our new performers  Curious to know whether they equalled his expectations  I followed him home  and into his closet  saying  Well  my lord  is your excellency well pleased with little Marialva  My excellency  answered he with a sly smile  must be very difficult to be pleased  not to confirm the public voice  yes  indeed  my good friend  I am enraptured with your Lucretia  and firmly believe that the king will not see her without emotion       CH  III     Lucretia s popularity  her appearance before the king  his passion  and its consequences   GREAT was the noise about the court on this double acquisition to the theatre  it became the topic of conversation next day at the king s levee  The young Lucretia was most in the mouths of the nobility  who described her so feelingly  that his majesty could not but imbibe the impression  though he was too politic to express his interest either in words or by looks   To make amends for that restraint  he questioned the minister as soon as he was alone with him  who stated the success of a young actress from Toledo on the evening before  Her name  added he  is Lucretia  and it is really a pity that ladies of her profession should ever have been christened by any less chaste appellative  She is an acquaintance of Santillane  who spoke so highly of her  that I thought it right to engage her for your majesty s company  The king smiled at the mention of my name  recollecting  perhaps  through what channel he became acquainted with Catalina  and foreboding a like assistance on the present occasion  Count  said he to the minister  I mean to see this Lucretia act to morrow  and will thank you to let her know it   I was of course sent with this intelligence to the two actresses  Great news  said I to Laura  whom I saw first  you will have the sovereign of the Spanish monarchy among your audience to morrow  as the minister has desired me to inform you  I cannot doubt but you will both of you do your best to prove yourselves worthy of a royal command  but I would advise you to choose a piece with music and dancing  that all Lucretia s accomplishments may be displayed at one view  We will take your counsel  answered Laura  and it shall not be our faults if his majesty is disappointed  That can scarcely happen  said I  seeing Lucretia come into the room in an undress  which shewed her person to more advantage than all the wardrobe of the theatre  he will be the more delighted with your lovely niece  because dancing and music are his principal pleasures  he may even be tempted to throw her the handkerchief  I do not at all wish  replied Laura  that he should be that way inclined
