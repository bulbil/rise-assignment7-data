wants the satisfaction even of self applause  for either he does not feel his present calamities  and that is natural insensibility  or he disguises his feelings  and that is dissimulation   Spleen now begins to take up the man  not distinguishing in his resentments  he regards all mankind with detestation  and commencing man hater  seeks solitude to be at liberty to rail   It has been said  that he who retires to solitude  is either a beast or an angel  the censure is too severe  and the praise unmerited  the discontented being  who retires from society  is generally some good natured man  who has begun life without experience  and knew not how to gain it in his intercourse with mankind  Adieu   LETTER LXV  From Lien Chi Altangi  to Fum Hoam  first president of the Ceremonial Academy at Pekin  in China   I Formerly acquainted thee  most grave Fum  with the excellence of the English in the art of healing  The Chinese boast their skill in pulses  the Siamese their botanical knowledge  but the English advertising physicians alone  of being the great restorers of health  the dispensers of youth  and   11 the insurers of longevity  I can never enough admire the sagacity of this country for the encouragement given to the professors of this art  with what indulgence does she foster up those of her own growth  and kindly cherish those that come from abroad  Like a skilful gardener she invites them from every foreign climate to herself  Here every great exotic strikes root as soon as imported  and feels the genial beam of favour  while the mighty metropolis  like one vast munificent dunghill  receives them indiscriminately to her breast  and supplies each with more than native nourishment   In other countries the physician pretends to cure disorders in the lump  the same doctor who combats the gout in the toe  shall pretend to prescribe for a pain in the head  and he who at one time cures a consumption  shall at another give drugs for a dropsy  How absurd and ridiculous  this is being a mere jack of all trades  Is the animal machine less complicated than a brass pin  Not less than ten different hands are required to make a pin  and shall the body be set right by one single operator   The English are sensible of the force of this reasoning  they have therefore one doctor for the eyes  another for the toes  they have their sciatica doctors  and inoculating doctors  they have one doctor who is modestly content with securing them from bugbites  and five hundred who prescribe for the bite of mad dogs   The learned are not here retired with vicious modesty from public view  for every dead wall is covered with their names  their abilities  their amazing   12 cures  and places of abode  Few patients can escape falling into their hands  unless blasted by lightening  or struck dead with some sudden disorder  it may sometimes happen  that a stranger who does not understand English  or a countryman who cannot read  dies without ever hearing of the vivifying drops  or restorative electuary  but for my part  before I was a week in town  I had learned to bid the whole catalogue of disorders defiance  and was perfectly acquainted with the names and the medicines of every great man  or great woman of them all   But as nothing pleases curiosity more than anecdotes of the great  however minute or trifling  I must present you  inadequate as my abilities are to the subject  with some account of those personages who lead in this honourable profession   The first upon the list of glory is doctor Richard Rock F  U  N  This great man is short of stature  is fat  and waddles as he walks  He always wears a white three tailed wig nicely combed  and frizzed upon each cheek  Sometimes he carries a cane  but a hat never  it is indeed very remarkable  that this extraordinary personage should never wear an hat  but so it is he never wears an hat  He is usually drawn at the top of his own bills  sitting in his arm chair  holding a little bottle between his finger and thumb  and surrounded with rotten teeth  nippers  pills  pacquets  and gally pots  No man can promise fairer nor better than he  for  as he observes  Be your disorder never so far gone  be under no uneasiness  make yourself quite easy  I can cure you     13The next in fame  though by some reckoned of equal pretensions  is doctor Timothy Franks  F  O  G  H  living in a place called the Old Bailey  As Rock is remarkably squab  his great rival Franks is as remarkably tall  He was born in the year of the christian aera 1692  and is  while I now write  exactly sixty eight years  three months  and four days old  Age  however  has no ways impaired his usual health and vivacity  I am told  he generally walks with his breast open  This gentleman  who is of a mixed reputation  is particularly remarkable for a becoming assurance  which carries him gently through life  for  except doctor
