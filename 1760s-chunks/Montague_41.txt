away till summer  when the happy pair embark in the first ship for England        Emily is really what one would call a prudent pretty sort of woman  I did not think it had been in her  she is certainly right  there is danger in delay  she has a thousand proverbs on her side  I thought what all her fine sentiments would come to  she should at least have waited for mamma s consent  this hurry is not quite consistent with that extreme delicacy on which she piques herself  it looks exceedingly as if she was afraid of losing him       I don t love her half so well as I did three days ago  I hate discreet young ladies that marry and settle  give me an agreable fellow and a knapsack       My poor Rivers  what will become of him when we are gone  he has neglected every body for us       As she loves the pleasures of conversation  she will be amazingly happy in her choice    With such a companion to spend the long day     He is to be sure a most entertaining creature         Adieu  I have no patience   Yours   A  FERMOR       After all  I am a little droll  I am angry with Emily for concluding an advantageous match with a man she does not absolutely dislike  which all good mammas say is sufficient  and this only because it breaks in on a little circle of friends  in whose society I have been happy  O  self  self  I would have her hazard losing a fine fortune and a coach and six  that I may continue my coterie two or three months longer       Adieu  I will write again as soon as we are married  My next will  I suppose  be from Montreal  I die to see your brother and my little Fitzgerald  this man gives me the vapours  Heavens  Lucy  what a difference there is in men   END OF VOL  I       THE  HISTORY  OF  EMILY MONTAGUE   VOL  II     THE  HISTORY  OF  EMILY MONTAGUE     By the AUTHOR of  LADY JULIA MANDEVILLE     VOL  II     L O N D O N   Printed for J  DODSLEY  in Pall Mall   MDCCLXIX      I   THE  HISTORY  OF  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER LV   55   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Jan  16   SO  my dear  we went on too fast  it seems  Sir George was so obliging as to settle all without waiting for Emily s consent  not having supposed her refusal to be in the chapter of possibilities  after having communicated their plan of operations to me as an affair settled  papa was dispatched  as Sir George s ambassador  to inform Emily of his gracious intentions in her favor       She received him with proper dignity  and like a girl of true spirit told him  that as the delay was originally from Sir George  she should insist on observing the conditions very exactly  and was determined to wait till spring  whatever might be the contents of Mrs  Clayton s expected letter  reserving to herself also the privilege of refusing him even then  if upon mature deliberation she should think proper so to do       She has further insisted  that till that time he shall leave Silleri  take up his abode at Quebec  unless  which she thinks most adviseable  he should return to Montreal for the winter  and never attempt seeing her without witnesses  as their present situation is particularly delicate  and that whilst it continues they can have nothing to say to each other which their common friends may not with propriety hear  all she can be prevailed on to consent to in his favor  is to allow him en attendant to visit here like any other gentleman       I wish she would send him back to Montreal  for I see plainly he will spoil all our little parties       Emily is a fine girl  Lucy  and I am friends with her again  so  my dear  I shall revive my coterie  and be happy two or three months longer  I have sent to ask my two sweet fellows at Quebec to dine here  I really long to see them  I shall let them into the present state of affairs here  for they both despise Sir George as much as I do  the creature looks amazingly foolish  and I enjoy his humiliation not a little  such an animal to set up for being beloved indeed  O to be sure       Emily has sent for me to her apartment  Adieu for a moment   Eleven o clock       She has shewn me Mrs  Melmoth s letter on the subject of concluding the marriage immediately  it is in the true spirit of family impertinence  She writes with the kind discreet insolence of a relation  and Emily has answered her with the genuine spirit of an independent Englishwoman  who is so happy as to be her own
