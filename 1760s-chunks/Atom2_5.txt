child with all the marks of paternal affection  and doubtful of the issue   25 of the approaching battle  shed a flood of tears at parting from him  after having recommended him to the particular care of his nurse  to whom he gave money and jewels to a considerable value  After the catastrophe of Richard this house was plundered  and the nurse with difficulty escaped to another part of the country  but as the enemies of Richard now prevailed  she never durst reveal the secret of the boy s birth  and he was bred up as her own son to the trade of brick laying  in which character he lived and died in an advanced age at London —Moreover  it is but justice in me  who constituted part of one of Richard s yeomen of the guard  to assure thee that this prince was not so wicked and cruel as he has been represented  The only share he had in the death of his brother Clarence  was his forbearing to interpose in the behalf of that prince   26 with their elder brother king Edward IV  who  in fact  was the greatest brute of the whole family  neither did he poison his own wife  nor employ assassins to murder his two nephews in the Tower  Both the boys were given by Tyrrel in charge to a German Jew  with directions to breed them up as his own children  in a remote country  and the eldest died of a fever at Embden  and the other afterwards appeared as claimant of the English crown —all the world knows how he finished his career under the name of Perkin Warbeck —So much for the abuse of surnames  in the investigation of which I might have used thy own by way of illustration  for  if thou and all thy generation were put to the rack  they would not be able to give any tolerable reason why thou shouldest be called Peacock rather than Crablouse —But it is now high   27 time to return to the thread of our narration  Taycho  having considered the list of officers  without finding one name which implied any active virtue  resolved that the choice should depend upon accident  He hustled them all together in his cap  and putting in his hand at random  drew forth that of Hob nob  a person who had grown old in obscurity  without ever having found an opportunity of being concerned in actual service  His very name was utterly unknown to Fika kaka  and this circumstance the orator considered as a lucky omen  for the Cuboy had such a remarkable knack at finding out the least qualified subjects  and overlooking merit  his new collegue concluded  not without some shadow of reason  that Hob nob s being unknown to the prime minister  was a sort of negative presumption in favour of his character  This officer was accordingly   28 placed at the head of an armament  and sent against the island of Thin quo  in the conquest of which he was to be supported by a squadron of Fune already in those latitudes  under the command of the chief He Rhumn     The voyage was performed without loss  the troops were landed without opposition  They had already advanced towards a rising ground which commanded the principal town of the island  and He Rhumn had offered to land and draw the artillery by the mariners of his squadron  when Hob nob had a dream which disconcerted all his measures  He dreamed that he entertained all the islanders in the temple of the White Horse  and that his own grand mother did the honours of the table —Indeed he could not have performed a greater act of charity  for they were literally in danger of perishing by famine    29 Having consulted his interpreter on this extraordinary dream  he was given to understand that the omen was unlucky  that if he persisted in his hostilities  he himself would be taken prisoner  and offered up as a sacrifice to the idol of the place  While he ruminated on this unfavourable response  the principal inhabitants of the island assembled  in order to deliberate upon their own deplorable situation  They had neither troops  arms  fortifications  nor provision  and despaired of supplies  as the fleet of Japan surrounded the island  In this emergency  they determined to submit without opposition  and appointed a deputation to go and make a tender of the island to general Hob nob  This deputation  preceded by white flags of truce  the Japonese commander no sooner descried  than he thought upon the interpretation of his dream  He mistook   30 the deputies with their white flags for the Bonzas of the idol to which he was to be sacrificed  and  being sorely troubled in mind  ordered the troops to be immediately reimbarked  notwithstanding the exhortations of He Rhumn  and the remonstrances of Rha rin tumm  the second in command  who used a number of arguments to dissuade him from his purpose  The deputies seeing the enemy in motion  made a halt  and  after they were fairly on board  returned to the town  singing hymns in praise of the idol Fo  who  they imagined  had confounded the understanding of the Japonese general   The attempt upon Thin quo having thus miscarried  Hob nob declared he would return to Japan  but was with great difficulty persuaded by the
