apartments  and on the other a small flight  dark and narrow  whither we betook ourselves to a residence elevated in a different sense from what he had boasted  It consisted of a single room  which my contriving friend had divided into four by deal partitions  The first served as an ante chamber to the second  where he lay  of the third he made his closet  of the last his kitchen  The chamber and antechamber were papered with maps  and many a sheet of philosophical discussion  nor was the furniture by any means unsuitable to the hangings  There was a large brocade bed much the worse for wear  tawdry old chairs with coarse yellow coverings  fringed with Grenada silk of the same colour  a table with gilt feet  and a cloth over it that once aspired to be red  bordered with tinsel and embroidery tarnished by that old corroder  time  with an ebony cabinet  ornamented with figures in a clumsy taste of sculpture  Instead of a convenient desk  he had a small table in his closet  and his library was made up with some few books  and a great many bundles of paper arranged on shelves one above the other the whole length of the wall  His kitchen  too modest to put the rest of the establishment out of countenance  exhibited a frugal assortment of earthenware and other necessary implements of cookery   Fabricio  when he had allowed me leisure to philosophize on his domestic arrangements  begged to know my opinion of his apartments and his housekeeping  and whether I was not enchanted with them  Yes  beyond all manner of doubt  answered I with a roguish smile  You must have applied your wits to a good purpose at Madrid  to have got so well accoutred  Of course you have some post  Heaven preserve me from anything of the sort  replied he  My line of life is far above all political situations  A man of rank  to whom this house belongs  has given me a room in it  whence I have contrived to piece out a suite of four  fitted up in such taste as you may see  I devote my time to no employments but what are just to my fancy  and never feel what it is to want  Explain yourself more intelligibly  said I  interrupting him  You set me all agog to be let into your little arrangements  Well  then  said he  I will rid you of that devil curiosity at once  I have commenced author  have plunged head long into the ocean of literature  verse and prose run equally glib  in short I am a jack of all trades to the muses   What  you bound in solemn league and covenant to Apollo  exclaimed I with most intolerable laughter  Nothing under a prophet could ever have anticipated this  I should have been less surprised at any other transformation  What possible delights have you had the ingenuity to detect in the rugged landscape of Parnassus  It should seem as if the labourers there have a very poor taking in civil life  and feed on a coarse diet without sauce  Out upon you  cried he  in dudgeon at the hint  You are talking of those paltry authors  whose works and even their persons are under the thumb of booksellers and players  Is it any wonder that writers under such circumstances should be held cheap  But the good ones  my friend  are on a better footing in the world  and I think it may he affirmed  vanity apart  that my name is to be found in their list  Questionless  said I  talents like yours are convertible to every purpose  compositions from such a pen are not likely to be insipid  But I am on the rack to know how this rage for fencing with inky weapons could have seized thee   Your wonder and alarm has mind in it  replied Nunez  I was so well pleased with my situation in the service of Signor Manuel Ordonnez  that I had no hankering after any other  But my genius  like that of Plautus  being too high  minded to contract itself within the sphere of menial occupations  I wrote a play and got it acted by a company then performing at Valladolid  Though it was not worth the paper it was scrawled upon  it had more success than many better pieces  Hence concluded I that the public was a silly bird  and would hatch any eggs that were put under it  That modest discovery  with the consequent madness of incessant composition  alienated my affections from the hospital  The love of poetry being stronger than the desire of accumulation  I determined on repairing to Madrid  as the centre of everything distinguished  to form my taste in that school  The first thing was to give the governor warning  who parted with me to his own great sorrow  from a sort of affection the result of similar propensities  Fabricio  said he  what possible ground can you have for discontent  None at all  sir  I replied  you are the best of all possible masters  and I am deeply impressed with your kind treatment  but you know one must follow whithersoever the stars ordain  I feel the sacred fire within me  on whose aspiring element my name is to be wafted
