native bravery  the flower of their youth were  at intervals  drained away  and those that remained were bred up in servitude and subjection  All those who had a passion for liberty  were long since destroyed  and none were suffered to live  but such as had betrayed their country in the beginning  or had been too cowardly to resist any unjust invasion  It is no wonder  therefore  that  as the Roman forces decreased in Britain  the Picts became more bold in their incursions  These  probably were the descendants of such Britons as once bravely exchanged their country for freedom  and crossing the narrow sea  which the Romans   28 could not guard  in little boats of wicker covered with leather  they filled the country  wherever they came  with spoil  slaughter  and desolation  when repulsed  by superior numbers  they usually retired  loaded with spoils  and watched for the next opportunity of invasion  when the Romans were drawn away into the remoter parts of the island   These enterprizes were often repeated  and as often repressed  till  in the reign of Valentinian the younger  the empire of Rome began to tremble for its capital  Myriads of barbarous nations  under the names of Goths and Vandals  invaded the dominion of this mistress of the world  with terror  perseverance  and rapidity  All the Roman legions were now  therefore  drawn from Britain  and all the Britons  who were fit for military service  were brought away to relieve the Emperor  who was pursued by the Goths into Piedmont  and there besieged in Aquilea  a town he attempted to defend   The Romans  now taking their last leave of this province  left the Britons to their own government  and the choice of their own Kings  For the exercise of their arms  and for repairing their ramparts  they gave them the best instructions that such terrible times would permit  Nothing can be more affecting than the picture of Britain at that period  though the Roman soldiery were drawn away  their families and descendants were still spread over the whole country  and left without a single person  of conduct or courage  to defend them  The Britons  who were left  began to enter into fresh dissentions for superiority  the enemy continued to pour in greater numbers than ever  from their native forests and   29 mountains  famine  with all its horrid attendants  of disease  robbery  and sedition  increased the misery of the times  their vices  as Gildas  a cotemporary writer  observes  kept pace with their calamities  the whole forming one detestable groupe of cowardice  cruelty  and distress   In this terrible situation it was  that they implored the assistance of the Romans for relief  their letter upon this occasion still remains upon record    To Aetius  thrice Consul  The groans of the Britons  Driven by our barbarous enemy to the sea  and from thence back upon the barbarians  we have only left us the choice of a grave  either to be killed by the one  or to be drowned by the other   The Romans  however  were unable to help themselves  much less capable of giving succour to so remote  and  at present  such unserviceable allies     Yet  amidst such calamities  this people seemed to have still a peculiar happiness in store  for they had  in general  embraced Christianity  At what time the Gospel was first preached in this island is not known  nor is it material to know  it is certain  that England converted its Pagan conquerors to the lights of revelation  and  though this people received laws from others  they adorned them with the religion of truth   Arts  arms  and elegance  must take their rise  by slow degrees  in every country  and can never be  at once  introduced into it with success  All the pains  bestowed in British education  only served to render this people more miserable  dressed them up as victims for every invader  and plunged them in all the misery of knowing happiness without being able to enjoy refinement  The people of a country  just reclaimed from barbarity  in some measure resemble the soil  The cultivation   30 of a few years may be sufficient to clear away the obstacles to agriculture  but it requires several ages  before the land acquires a proper degree of fertility  Thus  all the blood and treasure  which the Romans lost in the conquest of Britain  in the 〈◊〉 only served to depopulate the country  and prepare it for a repletion from new invaders  The Roman poli…s succeeded in quelling British courage  but the inhabitants  deprived of that  seemed destitute of every virtue   I am   c   LETTER VI   Dear Charles   I Remember but few instances in history  where the conquerors did not excel the people conquered  in every virtue  Savage barbarity  of effeminate luxury  have almost ever been imputed to those countries which were obliged to admit a foreign invader  There is a period  between natural rudeness and excessive refinement  which seems peculiarly adapted for conquest and war  and fits mankind for every virtuous and great atchievement
