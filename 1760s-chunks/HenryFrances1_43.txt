dearest Fanny  and here throw my Palinode at your Feet  That I was loved  let my Vanity now confess  which my Humility made me doubt before  It was a Madness to doubt at first  according to a certain Definition of it  a Reasoning right upon wrong Principles  I thought it gross to Sense  that I should be capable of inspiring that soft tender Passion  I thought it possible indeed  I might gain a Friend  but never hoped to be able to win a Mistress  so used to flatter myself  as Addison does Pope  upon his Eclogues  that    144 if they are not Pastorals  they are something better  Another Reason I had to suspect I was not loved  was  that I feared  I was no longer so  and true Love  like true Hanging  or Drowning  according to my Notion  is not to be remedied on this Side the Grave  I have observed to you before  that true Love  like the Small Pox  never attacks us but once  and Reason good  because it lasts for Life  It is a Kind of free Paradise Stock  which can admit of no Inoculation  so luxuriant  that it is impatient of Pruning  nor suffers itself to be twined into Espaliers  A Scion of it was stolen by Adam  when he was banished the Garden of Eden  who  to repair his Crime  as much as in him lay  bequeathed this divine Plant to such of his Posterity  who should prefer Nakedness to Knowledge  and piously attend to the Voice of Nature  in open Defiance of every Preacher  from the Serpent  down to —  Consider of what has been said   c   Henry   LETTER LXXXIV  FRANCES to HENRY   I AM much obliged for the Impatience you express of writing to me  and sincerely   145 wish I could return the Compliment with Sincerity  But at last that quick Spirit  you have so often complained of  is quite extinct  There are so few Things in Life  that can give me Pleasure  that I cannot help regretting the Change in my Sentiments with Regard to Writing  as  by losing my Relish for it  I have lost one of my principal Amusements   If a little Recollection recalled the Evidences of Truth to your Mind  I am pleased the Conversation arose  which  at the Time it happened  so much displeased me  I know not how to suppose  without having the meanest Opinion of you  that you could ever entertain a Doubt  If I thought it were possible you could  I should only say  may your Crime be your Punishment  for  he  who suspects  deserves to find it true   As all Matters of this Kind are now  and ever shall be  as tho  they had never been  you may be well assured  I shall never give you  or myself  the Trouble of endeavouring to convince you of the Reality of a Passion  which no longer exists  but  as there is no Imputation  I could not more easily pardon  than that you have charged me with   as Hypocrisy is  of all Vices  most foreign to my open Heart  give me Leave to ask you  What End could be proposed from feigning  What were the Advantages which could  or did arise from the Reality  What   146 other Cause in Nature can be assigned for a Person  not quite an Ideot  naturally prone to strong Resentments  enduring the most provoking Insolence  and  I hope  unparalelled Ill nature  without even shewing she was sensible of being sacrificed to every Gust of Vanity  or Ill humour in your Temper  or that of any other Person  who thought proper to make their Court to you  by slighting her  —Too plainly she  for Years  evinced the Truth of Rochfaucault s Opinion —   We forgive  as long as we love   —Deal plainly with me  Answer to these Truths  if you can refute them  or derive them from any other Cause  I will confess  that Fanny indeed  has much imposed upon herself   and allow what you have sometimes said  that the natural Coquetry of her Disposition  with a little Flight of Romance  by being indulged too far  had wrought upon her Mind the Semblance of a Passion  which existed not in the Heart   How cruel is Reflection after Passion  How different are the Points of Sight on the same Objects  Why is not Reason strong enough to keep her Throne  or so intirely vanished  as never to re assume it   I am weary of this continued Warfare —    As your Sentiments of Love and mine were always different  I am pleased to find  we  at last  agree in one Point  — that    like the   147 Small Pox  it never attacks us twice   like that too  where it is violent  the Marks last for Life  but the best  and truest Affinity between them  is  that  like that  it may be cured  I own it requires violent Corrosives  but I am a living Instance  that  tho  the
