 with submission  that you would oblige   some of them with an exchange into your regiment  and let Captain   Standard go in his place  And this wiU oblige him too   for I have   often heard him wish to go there in hopes of rising when they come   into action          A good thought  and so I will  Let the fellow go to America   and get scalped   his hot head wants to be cooled   such poor   wretches as he are just fit to be transported there  Tell him to   prepare directly   I long to be rid of him  But when shall I see   the dear little creature   1       In twenty four hours after he is gone  I U undertake to have her   eating sugar plums  and sobbing in your bosom  It cannot pos    sibly be sooner  for you know the captain s spirit  and that he would   cut the throat of a prince who should dishonour his family  as he   calls it          Ay  damn his spirit  that is true   that is what has kept me   civil to the fellow so long  I know he has aU the romantic madness   about honour and such stuff that made his fool of a father live   and die a beggar         j this time his excellency waa dressed to go to council  for which   another dram settled his head      I see your surprise at the brutal behaviour of the master  and   the infamous designs of the man  The former is beyond aggrava    tion   but the latter were only an honest artifice in favour of his    friend  who had no such niece in the world          68 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA         CHAPTER XXII     THE HISTORY OF MB WILLIAM â€” SOME ODD CIBCUMSTANCB3 IN HIS   CONDUCT ACCOTTNTBD FOE â€” BY A PEOGRESSION EQUALLY POLITE   AND FRUGAL â€” CHRYSAL COMES FROM HIS POSSESSION INTO THAT     OF A CELEBRATED FEMALE     William was a son of the regiment  born of one of the general   wives that followed it  He was about the same age with Standard    who had taken such a liking to him when they were boys that he   shared his allowance with him  gave him his old clothes  and taught   him what he had learned at school  A natural acuteness of genius   improved these advantages so well that William could read and   write enough for a gentleman  dance  fence  and scrape on the   violin  before his friend s power of serving him was put an end to    by the death of his father  and his spirit and appetites were too   great to accept of his offer of the best support an ensign could spare   him  to maintain him as a cadet  till his merit should get him a   commission  But  though he would not accept  he did not forget   the offer  nor make his obUgations a cause of hatred  now that it   was in his power to make some return   a way of thinking that   proved the meanness of his birth   for  quitting the barren paths   of military honour  he had turned his genius to the more thnving   profession of a footman  through the various ascents of which he   had risen to his present rank of his excellency s gentleman  in which   he had the unfashionable gratitude to return the favours of his former   benefactor in the above manner  which his experience and know    ledge of his master s temper convinced him to be the only one he   could hope to succeed in  As to his promise about the child  he was   in no pain about that  there being no person who could contradict   whatever excuse he should please to give      There is one circumstance which I see puzzles you in the character   of this man  and that is his taking me from his friend  when he must   be sensible how badly he could spare such a sum  But you must   consider the power of Nature when strengthened by habit      From his mother  WiUiam had inherited venality  which the   bribery of vails  in his present profession  had confirmed beyond   all possibility of correction   so that it was no more in his power   to refuse a guinea when offered to him  than to change his stature   or complexion  An attention to this observation would take off   the wonder  and ease the world from the trouble of the exclamations   that are daily made against the rapacity of persons in office   for   as such are generally taken
