myself at present  I have got into a very foolish sort of a scrape here  My wrist is quite well  and I should have thrown myself at Miss Bidulph’s feet before    now  but to tell you a secret  my virtue not being proof against temptation  I have been intercepted   ’Tis but a slight lapse  however  a flying affair  neither my honour  nor my heart in the question  A little vagrant Cupid has contented himself with picking my pocket  just lightly fluttering through my breast  and away   ‘Are you fallen so low as that  Faulkland  say you  to buy the favour of the fair  No  George  no  not quite so contemptible as that neither  and yet  faith  I did buy it too  for it cost me three hundred pounds  but the lady to whom I am obliged knows nothing of this part of her own history  at least  I hope so  for my credit sake  The case in short is this  an old gouty officer  and his wife  a very notable dame  a fine woman too  happened to lodge in the same house with me  The man came hither to get rid of his aches  the lady of her money  and her virtue  if she has any  for she is eternally at the card tables   ‘Under the conduct of this hopeful guide  came a niece of the husband’s  an extremely fine girl  innocent too  I believe  and the best dancer I ever saw  I don’t know how it happened  but she took a fancy to me  which  upon my word  and I am sure you have no doubts of me  I was far from wishing to improve  You know I always despise the mean triumph of gaining a heart  for which I could not give another in return  I saw with pain her growing inclination for me  but as we lived in the same house  and met every day in the rooms  it was impossible for me to avoid her as much as I wished to do  The aunt I found  had her eyes upon me  and took some pains to promote a liking on my side  I saw her design  and was so much upon my guard  that she  who I soon found was an adept in love matters  almost despaired of gaining her ends  The young lady’s inclination however seemed to increase  a pair of fine blue eyes told me so every day  and I was upon the point of flying to avoid the soft contagion  when an accident happened that totally overthrew all my good resolutions   ‘I had not seen the young lady for two or three days  I enquired for her  and her aunt answered  with a mysterious smile  She is ill  poor thing  why don’t you look in upon her  and ask her how she does  I replied  if the lady will permit me  I will do myself that honour  and intended literally to have kept my word  by just asking her at her chamber door how she did     ‘You are very cruel  said the aunt  would you persuade me that you don’t know the girl is in love with you  Oh  your Servant  Madam  if you think me vain  I thank you for the reprimand  Come  come  said she  this is all affectation  we’ll drink tea with her this evening  Upon my word  said I  if I am to believe what you say  I think you ought not to desire me  I am not blind to the young lady’s merit  but am so unfortunate as not to have it in my power to make such returns as she deserves  I found the occasion required my being serious   ‘If you have not love  said she  you may at least have a little complaisance  Was there ever such a barbarian  not to go and see a woman that is dying for him  I promised to bring you  and she expects you  What is the pretty creature afraid of  patting my cheek   I’ll stay by it all the while  There was no withstanding this  I promised to wait on her   ‘She knocked at my door about six o’clock  and looking in  asked if the coy Narcissus was ready  I went with her  and she led me directly to her niece’s chamber  The young lady looked pale and languishing  but very pretty  I was really grieved to see her  and enquired with an unaffected concern after her health  The tea things were set  and I tried to force something like conversation  but I believe I was rather formal   ‘When we had done tea  the aunt looked at her watch  started off her chair  said she had outstaid her appointment with the party she was to meet at cards  and turning to me  I hope  Sir  you will have the Charity to stay with my niece  and then hurried out of the room  I begged leave to hand her to her chair  intending to take that opportunity of slipping away  and resolved to quit the house the next morning  But the determined gipsey was prepared
