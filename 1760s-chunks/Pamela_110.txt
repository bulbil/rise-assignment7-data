dismal lamentations  and Mrs  Jewkes sent Nan to   the men  to bid them get the drag net ready  and leave the horses  and   come to try to find the poor innocent  as she  it seems  then called   me  beating her breast  and lamenting my hard hap  but most what would   become of them  and what account they should give to my master       While every one was thus differently employed  some weeping and wailing    some running here and there  Nan came into the wood house  and there   lay poor I  so weak  so low  and dejected  and withal so stiff with my   bruises  that I could not stir  nor help myself to get upon my feet    And I said  with a low voice   for I could hardly speak   Mrs  Ann  Mrs    Ann   The creature was sadly frightened  but was taking up a billet to   knock me on the head  believing I was some thief  as she said  but   I cried out  O Mrs  Ann  Mrs  Ann  help me  for pity s sake  to   Mrs  Jewkes  for I cannot get up   Bless me  said she  what  you    madam   Why  our hearts are almost broken  and we were going to drag the   pond for you  believing you had drowned yourself  Now  said she  you ll   make us all alive again       And  without helping me  she ran away to the pond  and brought all the   crew to the wood house   The wicked woman  as she entered  said  Where   is she   Plague of her spells  and her witchcrafts  She shall dearly   repent of this trick  if my name be Jewkes  and  coming to me  took hold   of my arm so roughly  and gave me such a pull  as made me squeal out     my shoulder being bruised on that side   and drew me on my face  O   cruel creature  said I  if you knew what I have suffered  it would move   you to pity me       Even Colbrand seemed to be concerned  and said  Fie  madam  fie  you   see she is almost dead  You must not be so rough with her  The coachman   Robin seemed to be sorry for me too  and said  with sobs  What a   scene is here  Don t you see she is all bloody in her head  and cannot   stir   Curse of her contrivance  said the horrid creature  she   has frightened me out of my wits  I m sure  How the d   l came you   here   Oh  said I  ask me now no questions  but let the maids carry   me up to my prison  and there let me die decently  and in peace  For    indeed  I thought I could not live two hours       The still more inhuman tigress said  I suppose you want Mr  Williams to   pray by you  don t you  Well  I ll send for my master this minute  let   him come and watch you himself  for me  for there s no such thing as   holding you  I m sure       So the maids took me up between them  and carried me to my chamber  and   when the wretch saw how bad I was  she began a little to relent  while   every one wondered  at which I had neither strength nor inclination to   tell them  how all this came to pass  which they imputed to sorcery and   witchcraft       I was so weak  when I had got up stairs  that I fainted away  with   dejection  pain  and fatigue  and they undressed me  and got me to bed    and Mrs  Jewkes ordered Nan to bathe my shoulder  and arm  and ancle    with some old rum warmed  and they cut the hair a little from the back   part of my head  and washed that  for it was clotted with blood  from   a pretty long  but not a deep gash  and put a family plaister upon it    for  if this woman has any good quality  it is  it seems  in a readiness   and skill to manage in cases  where sudden misfortunes happen in a   family       After this  I fell into a pretty sound and refreshing sleep  and lay   till twelve o clock  tolerably easy  considering I was very feverish    and aguishly inclined  and she took a deal of care to fit me to undergo   more trials
