woman  on her discretion I should have great dependence   —And on Father Marescotti s you also may  Chevalier  said the Bishop  I should hope  that when my sister and you are in England together  you would not scruple to consult him on the misbehaviour of any of my sister s Catholic servants   Indeed  my Lord  I would  I will myself be judge in my own house of the conduct and behaviour of all my servants  From the independence of such people upon me  disputes or uneasinesses might arise  that otherwise would never happen between their Lady and me  The power of dismission  on any flagrant misbehaviour  Page  95 must be in me  My temper is not capricious  My charity is not confined  My consideration for people in a foreign country  and wholly in my power  will  I hope  be even generous  I perhaps may bear with them the more for having them in my power  But my wife s servants  were she a sovereign  must be mine   Unhappy  said Father Marescotti  that you can not be of one faith  But  Sir  you will allow  I hope  if the case will bear it  of expostulation from me   Yes  Father  And should generally  I believe  be determined by your advice and mediation  But I would not condition to make the greatest saint  and the wisest man on earth  a judge in my own family over me   There is reason in this  rejoined the Bishop  You  perhaps  would not scruple  Sir  to consult the Marchioness  before you dimissed such a considerable servant as a woman  if my sister did not agree to it   The Marquis and Marchioness will be judges of my conduct  when I am in Italy  I should despise myself  were it not to be the same in England as at Bologna  I have in my travels been attended by Catholic Servants  They never had reason to complain of want of kindness  even to indulgence  from me  We Protestants confine not salvation within the pale of our own church  Catholics do  and have therefore an argument for their zeal in endeavouring to make proselvtes  that we have not  Hence  generally speaking  may a Catholic servant live more happily with a Protestant master  than a Protestant servant with a Catholic master  Let my servants live but up to their own professions  and they shall be indulged with all reasonable opportunities of pursuing the dictates of their own consciences  A truly religious servant  of whatever persuasion  cannot be a bad one   Well  as to this article  we must leave it  acquiesced the Bishop  to occasions as they may arise  Nine Page  96 months in the year  I think you propose to reside in Italy—  That  my Lord  was on a supposition that Lady Clementina would not oblige me with her company to my native country any part of the year  in that case  I proposed to pass but three months in every year in my native country  Otherwise  I hoped that year and year  in turn  would be allowed me   We can have no wish to separate man and wife  said the Marquis  Clementina will  no doubt  accompany her husband  We will stipulate only for year and year  But let ours be the first year  And we cannot doubt but the dear child will meet with all reasonable indulgence  for the sake of her tender health   Not one request that you  my Lord  and you  madam  shall think reasonable  shall be denied to the dear Lady   Let me propose one thing  Chevalier  said the Marchioness  that in the first year  which is to be ours  you endeavour to prevail upon your sisters  amiable women  as we have heard they are  to come over  and be of our acquaintance  Your Ward also  who may be looked upon as a little Italian  You love your sisters  and I should be glad  so would Clementina  I make no doubt  to be familiarized to the Ladies of your family before she goes to England   My sisters  madam  are the most obliging of women  as their Lords are of men  I have no doubt of prevailing upon them  to attend you and Lady Clementina here  And as it will give them time to prepare for the visit  I believe  if it be made in the latter part of the first year  it will be most acceptable to them  and to you  since then they will not only have commenced a friendship with Lady Clementina  and obtained the honour of your good opinion  but will attend the dear Lady in her voyage to England   Page  97 They all approved of this  I added  that I hoped  when the second year arrived  I should have the honour of finding in the party some of this noble family  looking round me  which could not fail of giveing delight  as well as affiance  to the tender heart of their beloved Clementina   My Lord and I  said the Marchioness  will probably  if well  be of the party  We
