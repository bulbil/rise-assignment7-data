to her mother  concealed himself from all  intercourse  except with his valet de chambre and Pipes  who had orders  to scour the country  and reconnoitre every horse  coach  or carriage   that should appear on that highway  with a view of intercepting his  Emilia in her passage   He had waited in this ambuscade a whole week  when his valet gave him  notice  that he and his fellow scout had discovered a chaise and six   driving at full speed towards them  upon which they had flapped their    6 22 15  3 45 PM   hats over their eyes  so as they might not be known  in case they should  be seen  and concealed themselves behind a hedge  from whence they could  perceive in the carriage  as it passed  a young man plainly dressed   with a lady in a mask  of the exact size  shape  and air of Emilia   and that Pipes followed them at a distance  while he rode back to  communicate this piece of intelligence   Peregrine would scarce allow him time to conclude his information  He  ran down to the stable  where his horse was kept ready saddled for the  purpose  and  never doubting that the lady in question was his mistress   attended by one of her uncle s clerks  mounted immediately  and rode  full gallop after the chaise  which  when he had proceeded about two  miles  he understood from Pipes  had put up at a neighbouring inn   Though his inclination prompted him to enter her apartment without  further delay  he suffered himself to be dissuaded from taking such a  precipitate step  by his privy counsellor  who observed  that it would  be impracticable to execute his purpose of conveying her against her  will from a public inn  that stood in the midst of a populous village   which would infallibly rise in her defence  He advised him therefore to  be in wait for the chaise  in some remote and private part of the road   where they might accomplish their aim without difficulty or danger   In consequence of this admonition our adventurer ordered Pipes to  reconnoitre the inn  that she might not escape another way  while he  and the valet  in order to avoid being seen  took a circuit by an  unfrequented path  and placed themselves in ambush  on a spot which they  chose for the scene of their achievement  Here they tarried a full hour   without seeing the carriage  or hearing from their sentinel  So that  the youth  unable to exert his patience one moment longer  left the  foreigner in his station  and rode back to his faithful lacquey  who  assured him  that the travellers had not yet hove up their anchor  or  proceeded on their voyage   Notwithstanding this information  Pickle began to entertain such  alarming suspicions  that he could not refrain from advancing to  the gate  and inquire for the company which had lately arrived in a  chaise and six  The innkeeper  who was not at all pleased with the  behaviour of those passengers  did not think proper to observe the  instructions he had received  on the contrary  he plainly told him  that  the chaise did not halt  but only entered at one door  and went out at  the other  with a view to deceive those who pursued it  as he guessed  from the words of the gentleman  who had earnestly desired that his  route might be concealed from any person who should inquire about their  motions   As for my own peart  measter   continued this charitable  publican   I believes as how they are no better than they should  be  else they wouldn t be in such a deadly fear of being overtaken   Methinks  said I  when I saw them in such a woundy pother to be gone   oddsheartlikins  this must be some London  prentice running away with  his measter s daughter  as sure as I m a living soul  But  be he who he  will  sartain it is  a has nothing of the gentleman about en  for  thof  a asked such a favour  a never once put hand in pocket  or said   Dog   will you drink   Howsomever  that don t argufy in reverence of his being  in a hurry  and a man may be sometimes a little too judgmatical in his  conjectures   In all probability  this loquacious landlord would have  served the travellers effectually  had Peregrine heard him to an end   but this impetuous youth  far from listening to the sequel of his  observations  interrupted him in the beginning of his career  by asking  eagerly which road they followed  and  having received the innkeeper s    6 22 15  3 45 PM   directions  clapped spurs to his horse  commanding Pipes to make the  valet acquainted with the course  that they might attend him with all  imaginable despatch   By the publican s account of their conduct  his former opinion was fully  confirmed
