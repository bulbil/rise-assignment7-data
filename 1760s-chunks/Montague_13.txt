command them as a master  yet  as his commands are always reasonable  and for the general good  no prince in the world is so well obeyed  They have a supreme council of ancients  into which every man enters of course at an age fixed  and another of assistants to the chief on common occasions  the members of which are like him elected by the matrons  I am pleased with this last regulation  as women are  beyond all doubt  the best judges of the merit of men  and I should be extremely pleased to see it adopted in England  canvassing for elections would then be the most agreeable thing in the world  and I am sure the ladies would give their votes on much more generous principles than we do  in the true sense of the word  we are the savages  who so impolitely deprive you of the common rights of citizenship  and leave you no power but that of which we cannot deprive you  the resistless power of your charms  By the way  I don t think you are obliged in conscience to obey laws you have had no share in making  your plea would certainly be at least as good as that of the Americans  about which we every day hear so much       The Hurons have no positive laws  yet being a people not numerous  with a strong sense of honor  and in that state of equality which gives no food to the most tormenting passions of the human heart  and the council of ancients having a power to punish atrocious crimes  which power however they very seldom find occasion to use  they live together in a tranquillity and order which appears to us surprizing       In more numerous Indian nations  I am told  every village has its chief and its councils  and is perfectly independent on the rest  but on great occasions summon a general council  to which every village sends deputies       Their language is at once sublime and melodious  but  having much fewer ideas  it is impossible it can be so copious as those of Europe  the pronunciation of the men is guttural  but that of the women extremely soft and pleasing  without understanding one word of the language  the sound of it is very agreeable to me  their style even in speaking French is bold and metaphorical  and I am told is on important occasions extremely sublime  Even in common conversation they speak in figures  of which I have this moment an instance  A savage woman was wounded lately in defending an English family from the drunken rage of one of her nation  I asked her after her wound   It is well   said she   my sisters at Quebec  meaning the English ladies  have been kind to me  and piastres  you know  are very healing        They have no idea of letters  no alphabet  nor is their language reducible to rules   tis by painting they preserve the memory of the only events which interest them  or that they think worth recording  the conquests gained over their enemies in war       When I speak of their paintings  I should not omit that  though extremely rude  they have a strong resemblance to the Chinese  a circumstance which struck me the more  as it is not the stile of nature  Their dances also  the most lively pantomimes I ever saw  and especially the dance of peace  exhibit variety of attitudes resembling the figures on Chinese fans  nor have their features and complexion less likeness to the pictures we see of the Tartars  as their wandering manner of life  before they became christians  was the same       If I thought it necessary to suppose they were not natives of the country  and that America was peopled later than the other quarters of the world  I should imagine them the descendants of Tartars  as nothing can be more easy than their passage from Asia  from which America is probably not divided  or  if it is  by a very narrow channel  But I leave this to those who are better informed  being a subject on which I honestly confess my ignorance       I have already observed  that they retain most of their antient superstitions  I should particularize their belief in dreams  of which folly even repeated disappointments cannot cure them  they have also an unlimited faith in their powawers  or conjurers  of whom there is one in every Indian village  who is at once physician  orator  and divine  and who is consulted as an oracle on every occasion  As I happened to smile at the recital a savage was making of a prophetic dream  from which he assured us of the death of an English officer whom I knew to be alive   You Europeans   said he   are the most unreasonable people in the world  you laugh at our belief in dreams  and yet expect us to believe things a thousand times more incredible        Their general character is difficult to describe  made up of contrary and even contradictory qualities  they are indolent  tranquil  quiet  humane in peace  active  restless  cruel  ferocious in war  courteous  attentive  hospitable  and even polite  when kindly treated
