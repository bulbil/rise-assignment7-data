which I locked with great expedition  and opening another that  communicated with the staircase  ran out of the house  through a crowd  of more than a hundred people  whom this fray had gathered together    Being universally beloved in the neighbourhood  and respected by my  lord s servants  I passed among them untouched  and took refuge in  a neighbouring cottage  while his lordship bawled and roared for  assistance  being afraid to come out as he had gone in  Without waiting  for his deliberations  I changed clothes with the poor woman who had  given me shelter  and in her blue apron and straw hat sallied out into  the fields  intending to seek protection in the house of a gentleman not  far off  though I was utterly ignorant of the road that led me to it   However  it was my good fortune to meet with a farmer  who undertook to  conduct me to the place  otherwise I should have missed my way  and  in all probability lain in the fields  for by this time it was eight  o clock at night    Under the direction of this guide  I traversed hedges and ditches  for  I would not venture to travel in the highway  lest I should fall into  the hands of my pursuer  and after I had actually tumbled into the mire   and walked six or seven long miles by the help of a good spirit  which  never failed me on such occasions  I arrived at the place  and rung the  bell at the garden gate for admittance  Seeing my figure  which was very  uncouth  together with my draggled condition  they denied me entrance   but  when they understood who I was  immediately opened the door  and I  was hospitably entertained  after having been the subject of mirth  on  account of my dress and adventure    Next day I returned and took possession of my house again  where I  resumed my former amusements  which I enjoyed in quiet for the space  of a whole month  waiting with resignation for the issue of my lawsuit   when  one afternoon  I was apprised of his lordship s approach by one  of my spies  whom I always employed to reconnoitre the road  and so  fortunate was I in the choice of these scouts  that I never was betrayed  by one of them  though they were often bribed for that purpose  I  no sooner received this intelligence  than I ordered my horse to be  saddled  and  mounting  rode out of sight immediately  directing my  course a different way from the London road  I had not long proceeded  in this track  when my career was all of a sudden stopped by a five bar  gate  which  after some hesitation  I resolved to leap  my horse being  an old hunter   if I should find myself pursued  However  with much    6 22 15  3 45 PM   difficulty I made a shift to open it  and arrived in safety at the house  of my very good friend Mr  G    who  being a justice of the peace  had  promised me his protection  if it should be wanted    Thus secured for the present  I sent out spies to bring information of  his lordship s proceedings  and understood that he had taken possession  of my house  turned my servants adrift  and made himself master of all  my movables  clothes  and papers  As for the papers  they were of no  consequence  but of clothes I had a good stock  and  when I had reason  to believe that he did not intend to relinquish his conquest  I thought  it was high time for me to remove to a greater distance from his  quarters  Accordingly  two days after my escape  I set out at eleven  o clock at night  in a chariot and four  which I borrowed of my friend   attended by a footman  who was a stout fellow  and well armed  I  myself being provided with a brace of good pistols  which I was fully  determined to use against any person who should presume to lay violent  hands upon me  except my lord  for whom a less mortal weapon would have  sufficed  such as a bodkin or a tinder box  Nothing could be farther  from my intention than the desire of hurting any living creature  much  less my husband  my design was only to defend myself from cruelty and  oppression  which I knew  by fatal experience  would infallibly be my  lot  should he get me into his power  And I thought I had as good a  right to preserve my happiness  as that which every individual has  to preserve his life  especially against a set of ruffians  who were  engaged to rob me of it for a little dirty lucre    In the midst of our journey  the footman came up  and told me I was  dogged  upon which I looked out  and  seeing a man riding by the chariot
