thoughts  I was the cruel cause that her heart was breaking  and my pity at least was the duenna s  though love is too wayward to be controlled by advice  But I was miserably mistaken in her nature  Her tenderness had all curdled into acrimonious hatred  and at that very moment was she plotting to be my bane   One morning while I was with Don Alphonso  that amiable young master of mine was absent  moody  and out of spirits  I inquired respectfully what was the matter  I am vexed to the soul  said he  to find Seraphina weak  unjust  ungrateful  You are not a little surprised at this  added he  remarking the expression of astonishment with which I heard him  yet nothing is more strictly and lamentably true  I know not what reason you have given Dame Lorenza to be at variance with you  but true it is  you are become so unbearably hateful to her  that if you do not get out of this castle as soon as possible  her death  she says  must be the sure consequence  You cannot but suppose that Seraphina  who knows your value  used all her influence at first against a prejudice to which she could not administer without injustice and ingratitude  But though the best of women  she is still a woman  Sephora brought her up  and she loves her like a mother  Should her old nurse die shortly  she would fancy she had her death to answer for  had she refused herself to any of her whims  For my own part  with all my affection towards Seraphina  and it is none of the weakest  I will never be guilty of so mean a compliance as to side with her on this question  Perish our duennas  perish the whole system of our Spanish vigilance  but never let me consent to the banishment of a young man whom I look upon rather as a brother than a servant   When Don Alphonso had thus expressed his sentiments  I said to him  My good sir  I am born to be the mere whipping top of fortune  It had been my hope that she would leave off persecuting me when under your roof  where everything held out to me happy days and an unruffled life  Now  the part for honour to take is to tear myself away  whatever hankering I may feel after my continuance  No  no  exclaimed the generous son of Don Caesar  Leave me to bring Seraphina to a proper view of things  It shall never be said that you are sacrificed to the caprices of a duenna  who  on every occasion  has but too much influence over the family  All you will get by it  sir  replied I  will only be to put Seraphina in an ill humour by opposing her wishes  I had much rather withdraw than run the risk  by a longer abode here  of sowing division between a married pair  who are a model of conjugal felicity  Such a consequence of my unhappy quarrel would make me miserable for the remainder of my days   Don Alphonso absolutely forbade me to take any hasty step  and I found him so determined in the intention of standing by me  that Lorenza must infallibly have been thrown into the background  if I had chosen to have stood an election against her  There were moments when  exasperated against the duenna  I was tempted to keep no measures with her  but when I came to consider that to unravel this surgical mystery would be to plunge a dagger into the heart of a poor creature  whose curse had been my fastidious prejudice against an ulcerated back  and whom a physical and mental misfortune were conjointly handing down to the grave  I lost all feeling but that of compassion towards her  It was evident  since I was so portentous a phenomenon  that it was my imperious duty to re establish the tranquillity of the castle by my absence  and that duty I performed the next morning before daybreak  without taking any leave of my two masters  for fear they should oppose my departure from a misplaced partiality towards me  My only notice was to leave behind in my chamber a memorial  containing an exact account of my receipts and disbursements during the time of my stewardship       CH  II     What happened to Gil Blas after his retreat from the castle of Leyva  shewing that those who are crossed in love are not always the most miserable of mankind   I WAS mounted on a good horse  my own property  and was the bearer of two hundred pistoles  the greater part of which arose from the plunder of the vanquished banditti  and the forfeiture of Samuel Simon by the Inquisition  for Don Alphonso  without requiring me to account for any part of the said forfeiture  had made restitution of the entire sum out of his own funds  Thus  considering my effects  however obtained  as converted into lawful property by a sort of vicarious sponsorship  I took them into my good graces without any remorse of conscience  An estate like this rendered it absurd to throw away any thought about the future  and a certain likelihood of doing well  which always hangs about a young man at my age
