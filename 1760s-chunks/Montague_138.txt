bore down her duty to a father whom she had never seen  and whom she had supposed dead  till the arrival of Mrs  Melmoth s letters  having been two years without hearing any thing of him       She married me  determined to give up her right to half his fortune in favor of the person for whom he designed her  and hoped  by that means  to discharge her father s obligations  which she could not pay at the expence of sacrificing her heart       But she writes to Mrs  Fitzgerald  and will tell you all       Come and share the happiness of your friends       Adieu   Your faithful  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CCXXVI   226   To Mrs  Fitzgerald    Temple house  Friday   MY Rivers has told you my sweet friend  in what words shall I convey to you an adequate idea of your Emily s transport  at a discovery which has reconciled all her duties       Those anxieties  that sense of having failed in filial obedience  which cast a damp on the joy of being wife to the most beloved of mankind  are at an end       This husband whom I so dreaded  whom I determined never to accept  was my Rivers       My father forgives me  he pardons the crime of love  he blesses that kind providence which conducted us to happiness       How many has this event made happy       The most amiable of mothers shares my joy  she bends in grateful thanks to that indulgent power who has rewarded her son for all his goodness to her        Rivers hears her  and turns away to hide his tears  her tenderness melts him to the softness of a woman       What gratitude do we not owe to heaven  may the sense of it be for ever engraven on our hearts       My Lucy too  all  all are happy       But I will tell you  Rivers has already acquainted you with part of my story       My uncle placed me  with a servant  in whom he could confide  in a convent in France  till I was seven years old  he then sent for me to England  and left me at school eight years longer  after which  he took me with him to his regiment in Kent  where  you know  our friendship began  and continued till he changed into another  then in America  whither I attended him       My father s affairs were  at that time  in a situation which determined my uncle to take the first opportunity of marrying me to advantage        I regarded him as a father  he had always been more than a parent to me  I had the most implicit deference to his will       He engaged me to Sir George Clayton  and  when dying  told me the story of my birth  to which I had till then been a stranger  exacting from me  however  an oath of secresy till I saw my father       He died  leaving me  with a trifle left in trust to him for my use from my grandfather  about two thousand pounds  which was all I  at that time  ever expected to possess       My father was then thought ruined  there was even a report of his death  and I imagined myself absolute mistress of my own actions       I was near two years without hearing any thing of him  nor did I know I had still a father  till the letters you brought me from Mrs  Melmoth       A variety of accidents  and our being both abroad  and in such distant parts of the world  prevented his letters arriving       In this situation  the kind hand of heaven conducted my Rivers to Montreal       I saw him  and  from that moment  my whole soul was his        Formed for each other  our love was sudden and resistless as the bolt of heaven  the first glance of those dear speaking eyes gave me a new being  and awaked in me ideas never known before       The strongest sympathy attached me to him in spite of myself  I thought it friendship  but felt that friendship more lively than what I called my love for Sir George  all conversation but his became insupportable to me  every moment that he passed from me  I counted as lost in my existence       I loved him  that tenderness hourly increased  I hated Sir George  I fancied him changed  I studied to find errors in a man who had  a few weeks before  appeared to me amiable  and whom I had consented to marry  I broke with him  and felt a weight removed from my soul       I trembled when Rivers appeared  I died to tell him my whole soul was his  I watched his looks  to find there the same sentiments with which he had inspired me  that transporting moment at length arrived  I had the delight to find our tenderness was mutual  and to devote my life to making happy the lord of my desires
