house with Violante  We were warned who it was  and I escaped by a back door exactly as he went in at the front As soon as I had got safe off  the women  whom the unexpected visit of this troublesome husband had disconcerted a little  recovered their presence of mind  and with it so large a stock of assurance  as to stand the brunt of his attack  and put him to a nonplus in ascertaining whether they had hid me or smuggled me out  I cannot exactly tell you what he said to Donna Inca and his wife  nor do I believe that history will ever furnish any authentic particulars of the squabble   In the mean time  without suspecting yet how completely I was gulled by Don Balthazar  I sallied forth with curses in my mouth  and returned to the great square  where I had appointed Lamela to meet me  But no Lamela was there  He also had his little snug parties  and the scoundrel fared better than his comrade  As I was waiting for him  I caught a glimpse of my treacherous associate  with a knowing smile upon his countenance  He made up to me  and inquired  with a hearty laugh  what news of my assignation with my nymph  under the convenient roof of Donna Inca  I cannot conceive  said I  what evil spirit  jealous of my joys  takes delight to nip them in their blossom  but after we had embraced  kissed  protested  and  as it were  spoke the prologue of our comedy  comes the peaking cornuto of a husband  the furies fly away with him   and knocks at the door in the instant of our encounter  There was nothing to be done but to secure my retreat as fast as possible  So I got out at a back door  sending to all the inhabitants of hell and its suburbs the jealous knave  who was so uncivil as to search another lady s house for his own horns  I am sorry you sped so ill favouredly  exclaimed Don Balthazar  who was chuckling with in ward satisfaction at my disappointment  What a mechanical rogue of a husband  I would advise you to shew no mercy to the wittol  Oh  you need not teach me how to predominate over such a peasant  replied I  Take my word for it  a new quarter shall be added to his coat of arms this very night  His wife  when I went away  told me not to be faint hearted for such a trifle  but to place myself without fail under her windows at an earlier hour than usual  for she was resolved to let me into the house  and as a precaution against all accidents  she begged me to bring two or three friends in my train  for fear of a surprise  What a discreet and inventive lady  said he  I should have no objection to being of your party  Ah  my dear friend  exclaimed I  out of wits with joy  and throwing my arms about Don Balthazar s neck  how infinitely you will oblige me  I will do more  resumed he  I know a young man  armed like another Caesar  for either field of love or war  he shall be of our number  and you may then rely boldly on the sufficiency of your escort   I knew not in what words to thank this seeming friend  so that my gratitude might be equivalent to his zeal  To make short of the matter  I accepted his proffered aid  Our meeting was fixed under Violante s balcony early in the evening  and we parted  He went in quest of his brother in law  who was the hero in question  As for me  I walked about all day with Lamela  who had no more misgivings than myself  though somewhat astonished at the warmth with which Don Balthazar engaged in my interests  We slipt our own necks completely into the noose  I own this was mere infatuation on our parts  whose natural instinct ought to have warned us of a halter  When I thought it proper time to present myself under Violante s windows  Ambrose and I took care to be armed with small swords  There we found the husband of my fair dame and another man  waiting for us with a very determined air  Don Balthazar accosted me  and introducing his brother in law  said  Sir  this is the brave officer whose prowess I have extolled so highly to you  Make the best of your way into your mistress s house  and let no fear of the consequences be any bar to the enjoyment of the most rapturous human bliss   After a mutual interchange of compliments  I knocked at Violante s door  It was opened by a kind of duenna  In I went  and without looking back after what was passing behind me  made the best of my way to the lady s room  While I was paying her my preliminary civilities  the two cut throats  who had followed me into the house  and had banged the door after them so violently that Ambrose was left in the street  made their appearance  You may well suppose that then was the appeal to arms  They both fell upon me at the same time  but
