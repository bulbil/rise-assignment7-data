honours done me  on my arrival  otherwise would have been immoderate   A debate then followed  upon some articles in which the Church of Rome and the Protestant Churches differ  Mr  Grandison would fain have avoided it  but the Bishop  supposing he should have some advantages in the argument  which he met not with  would not permit him  He was very warm with Mr  Grandison more than once  which did not help his cause   The particulars of this debate I will not at this time give you  They would carry me into great length  and I have much to transcribe  that I believe  from what Sir Charles has let me see of your manner of writing to your friends  you would prefer  To that I will proceed  after a passage or two  which will shew you how that debate  about the difference in Religion  went off   You will call to mind  Chevalier  said the Bishop    266 that your church allows of a possibility of salvation out of its pale—Ours does not   My Lord  our church allows not of its members indulging themselves in capital errors  against conviction  But I hope that no more need to be said on this subject   I think  replied the Bishop  we will quit it  I did not expect that you were so firmly rooted in error  as I find you  But to the point on which we began  I should think it an extraordinary misfortune  were we to find ourselves reduced to the necessity of reasoning a private man into the acceptance of our sister Clementina  Let me tell you  Sir  that were she to know that you but hesitate —He spoke with earnestness  and reddened   Pardon an interruption  my Lord  You are disposed to be warm  I will not so much as offer to defend myself from any imputations that may  in displeasure  be cast upon me  as if I were capable of slighting the honour intended me of a Lady who is worthy of a Prince  I am persuaded that your Lordship cannot think such a desence necessary  I am indeed a private man  but not inconsiderable  if the being able to enumerate a long race of ancestors  whom hitherto I have not disgraced  will give me consideration  But what  my Lord  is ancestry  I live to my own heart  My principles were known before I had the condescending invitation  Your Lordship would not persuade me to change them  when I cannot think them wrong  and since  as you have heard  I have something to offer  when called upon  in support of them   You will consider this matter  my dear Chevalier  It is you  I think  that are disposed to be warm  but you are a valuable man  We  as well as our sister  wish to have you among us  Our church would wish it  Such a proselyte will justify us to every other consideration  and to all our friends  Consider of it  Grandison  but let it not be known to the principals   267 of our family  that you think consideration necessary  The dear Clementina  particularly  must not know it  Your person  Chevalier  is not so dear to the excellent creature  as your soul  Hence it is  that we are all willing to encourage in her a flame so pure  and so bright   My distress  my Lord  is beyond the power of words to describe  I revere  I honour  and will to my last  hour  the Marquis and Marchioness of Porretta  and on better motives than for their grandeur or nobility  Their sons—You know not  my Lord  the pride I have always had to be distinguished even by a nominal relation to them  And give me your Clementina  without the hard conditions you prescribe  and I shall be happy beyond my highest wish  I desire not dowry with her  I have a father on whose generosity and affection I can rely  But I must repeat  my Lord  that my principles are so well known  that I hoped a compromise would be accepted—I would not for the world compel your sister  The same liberty that I crave  I would allow   And will you not take time  Sir  to consider  Are you absolutely determined   If your Lordship know the pain it gives me to say that I am  you would pity me   Well  Sir  I am sorry for it  Let us go in to Signor Jeronymo  He has been your advocate ever since he knew you  Jeronymo has gratitude  but you  Chevalier  have no affections   I thank God  said I  that your Lordship does not do me justice   He led me into his brother s apartment   There  what did I not suffer  from the Friendship  from the Love of that brother▪ and from the urgency of the Bishop  But what was the result   The Bishop asked me  If he were to conduct me to his father  to his mother  to his sister  Or to allow me to depart without seeing them —This was the alternative  My compliance or non compliance was
