and went into the kitchen  where I ordered the landlord to get us a good supper  which he promised to perform so much to my satisfaction  as to make me remember all the days of my life what usage travellers meet with at his house As  added he  now only ask your carrier what sort of a man I am  By all the powers of seasoning  I would defy the best cook in Madrid or Toledo to make an olio at all to be compared to mine  I shall treat you this evening with some stewed rabbit after a receipt of my own  you will then see whether it is any boast to say that I know how to send up a supper  Thereupon  shewing me a stew pan with a young rabbit  as he said  cut up into pieces  There  continued he  is what I mean to favour you with  When I shall have thrown in a little pepper  some salt  wine  a handful of sweet herbs  and a few other ingredients which I keep for my own sauces  you may depend on sitting down to such a dish as would not disgrace the table of a chancellor or an archbishop   The landlord  having thus done justice to his own merits  began to work upon the materials he had prepared  While he was labouring in his vocation  I went into a room  where lying down on a sort of couch  I fell fast asleep through fatigue  having taken no rest the night before  in the space of about two hours  the muleteer came and awakened me  with the information that supper was ready  and a pressing request to take my place at table  The cloth was laid for two  and we sat down to the hashed rabbit  I played my knife and fork most manfully  finding the flavour delicious  whether from the force of hunger in communicating a candid mode of interpretation to my palate  or from the natural effect of the ingredients compounded by the cook  A joint of roast mutton was next served up  It was remarkable that the carrier only paid his respects to this last article  and I asked him why he had not taken his share of the other  He answered with a suppressed smile  that he was not fond of made dishes  This reason  or rather the turn of countenance with which it was alleged  seemed to imply more than was expressed  You have not told me  said I  the real meaning of your not eating the fricassee  do have the goodness to explain it at once  Since you are so curious to be made acquainted with it  replied he  I must own that I have an insuperable aversion to cramming my stomach with meats in masquerade  since one evening at an inn on the road between Toledo and Cuen√ßa  they served me up  instead of a wild rabbit  a hash of tame cat  enough  of all conscience  ever after to set my intestines in battle array against all minces  stews  and force meats   No sooner had the muleteer let me into this secret  than in spite of the hunger which raged within me  my appetite left me completely in the lurch  I conceived  in all the horrors of extreme loathing  that I had been eating a cat dressed up as the double of a rabbit  and the fricassee had no longer any power over my senses  except by producing a strong inclination to retch  My companion did not lessen my tendency that way  by telling me that the inn keepers in Spain  as well as the pastry  cooks  were very much in the habit of making that substitution  The drift of the conversation was  as you may perceive  very much in the nature of a lenitive to my stomach  so much so  that I had no mind to meddle any more with the dish of undefinables  nor even to make an attack upon the roast meat  for fear the mutton should have performed its duty by deputy as well as the rabbit  I jumped up from table  cursing the cookery  the cook  and the whole establishment  then  throwing myself down upon the sofa  I passed the night with less nausea than might reasonably have been expected  The day following with the dawn  after having paid the reckoning with as princely an air as if we had been treated like princes  away went I from Ilescas  bearing my faculties so strongly impregnated with fricassee  that I took every animal which crossed the road  of whatever species or dimensions  for a cat   We got to Madrid betimes  where I had no sooner settled with my carrier than I hired a ready furnished lodging near the Sun gate  My eyes  though accustomed to the great world  were nevertheless dazzled by the concourse of nobility which was ordinarily seen in the quarter of the court  I admired the prodigious number of carriages  and the countless list of gentlemen  pages  gentlemen s gentlemen  and plain  downright footmen in the train of the grandees  My admiration exceeded all bounds  on going to the king s levee  and beholding the monarch in the midst of his court  The effect of the scene was enchanting  and I said to myself  It is
