remaining blessing  And think you that a man  whom you have once enchanted  can recover his self possession  Know yourself better  and cease to enforce impracticable behests  Well then  if so  rejoined she with hurried importunity  do you cease to flatter yourself with interesting my gratitude or my pity  In one short word  the wife of Don Blas shall never be the mistress of Don Gaston  Let us at once end a conversation at which delicacy revolts m spite of virtue  and peremptorily forbids its longer continuance   I now threw myself at the lady s feet in despair  All the powers of language and of tears were called forth to soften her  But even this served only to excite some inbred sentiments of compassion  stifled as soon as born  and sacrificed at the shrine of duty  After having fruitlessly exhausted all my stores of tender persuasion  rage took possession of my breast  I drew my sword  and would have fallen on its point before the inexorable Helena  but she saw my design and prevented it  Stay your rash hand  Cogollos  said she  Is it thus that you consult my reputation  In dying thus and here  you will brand me with dishonour  and my husband with the imputation of murder   In the agony of my despair  far from yielding to these suggestions  I only struggled against the preventive efforts of the two women  and should have struggled too successfully  if Don Blas had not appeared to second them  He had been apprized of our assignation  and instead of going into the country  had concealed himself behind the hangings  to overhear our conference  Don Gaston  cried he  as he arrested my uplifted arm  recall your scattered senses  and no longer give a loose to these mad transports   Here I could hold no longer  Is it for you  said I  to turn me from my resolution  You ought rather yourself to plunge a dagger in my bosom  My love  with all its train of miseries  is an insult to you  Have you not surprised me in your wife s apartment at this unseasonable hour  what greater provocation can you want for your revenge  Stab me  and rid yourself of a man  who can only give up the adoration of Donna Helena with his life  It is in vain  answered Don Blas  that you endeavour to interest my honour in your destruction  You are sufficiently punished for your rashness  and my wife s imprudence  in giving you this opportunity of indulging it  is sanctified by the purity of her sentiments  Take my advice  Cogollos  shrink not effeminately from your wayward destiny  but bear up against it with the patient courage of a hero   The prudent Galician  by such language  gradually composed the ferment of my mind  and waked me once more to virtue  I withdrew in the determination of removing far from the scene of my folly  and went for Madrid  two days afterwards  There  pursuing the career of fortune and preferment  I appeared at court  and laid myself out for connections  But it was my ill luck to attach myself particularly to the Marquis of Villareal  a Portuguese grandee  who  lying under a suspicion of intending to emancipate his country from the Spanish yoke  is now in the castle of Alicant  As the Duke of Lerma knew me to be closely connected with this nobleman  he gave orders for my arrest and detention here  That minister thought me capable of engaging in such a project    he could not have offered a more outrageous affront to a man of noble birth and a Castilian   Don Gaston thus ended his story  By way of consolation I said to him  Illustrious sir  your honour can receive no taint from this temporary detainer  and your interest will probably be promoted by it in the end  When the Duke of Lerma shall be convinced of your innocence  he will not fail to give you a considerable post  and thus retrieve the character of a gentleman unjustly accused of treason       CH  VII     Scipio finds Gil Blas out in the tower of Segovia  and brings him a budget of news   OUR conversation was interrupted by Tordesillas  who came into the room  and addressed me thus  Signor Gil Blas  I have just been speaking with a young man at the prison gate  He inquired if you were not here  and looked much mortified at my refusal to satisfy his curiosity  Noble governor  said he  with tears in his eyes  do not reject my most humble petition  I am Signor de Santillane s principal domestic  and you will do an act of charity by allowing me to see him  You pass for a kind hearted gentleman in Segovia  I hope you will not deny me the favour of conversing for a few minutes with my dear master  who is unfortunate rather than criminal  In short  continued Don Andrew  the lad was so importunate  that I promised to comply with his wishes this evening   I assured Tordesillas that he could not have pleased me better than by bringing this young man to me  who could probably communicate tidings of the last importance  I
