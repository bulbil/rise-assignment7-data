after Ethelwolfe was sent to Northumberland  upon pretence of urgent affairs  but he never performed the journey  he was found murdered in a wood  by the King s command  who took Elfrida to court  where their nuptials were celebrated with the usual solemnity   I have been the more explicit in this story  as  in the first place  it serves to shew  that ladies were admitted to court in this early period  it also demonstrates  that men and women were never kept separate in England  as in Spain and other countries  it still evinces  that  however polite they might be at the time I am speaking of  there was still a savage air  that mixed in every action  and sufficiently distinguished those ages of barbarism from the civilized ages of Greece and Rome  But  to stamp the age with still greater rudeness  Edgar  who was thus guilty of murder  sacrilege  and adultery  was placed among the number of saints  by the Monks who have written his history   The defects of Edgar s government fell upon his successors  the power of the Monks increased    49 and that of the state was diminished in proportion  Every provision for the safety of the kingdom began to decline  and the remissness of the English made way for new incursions of the Danes  who exacted exorbitant tributes from the Kings  and plundered the subjects at discretion  Edward the Martyr  who had not the least title to so glorious an appellation  was crowned King by the single authority of Dunstan  and  consequently  increased Monkish power  he was murdered by order of Elfrida  who seems to have the highest contrast  in her own person  of the greatest external charms  and the most odious internal deformity   Ethelred II  finding himself unable to oppose the Danes  compounded with them for his own safety  But  soon after  being strengthened by an alliance with the Duke of Normandy  he laid a detestable scheme for massacring all the Danes in the kingdom  This plot was carried on with such secrecy  that it was executed in one day  and all the Danes in England were destroyed without mercy  A massacre  so cruel and perfidious  instead of ending the long miseries of this wretched country  only made way for new and greater calamities than before   Swayne  King of Denmark  exasperated by the slaughter of his countrymen  and  among the rest  of his own sister  who was beheaded in Ethelred s presence  soon after landed in England  and filled the whole kingdom with the marks of an horrid vengeance  obliging Ethelred to fly to Normandy for relief  The English  unable to oppose  yet unwilling to submit  for a short time groaned under the Danish yoke  and again  upon an opportunity given  called their banished Monarch back   50 to his throne  Ethelred returned  but  being a weak  as well as a cruel Prince  he lost the hearts of his subjects  and  with their love  all his authority  He never  therefore  could recover strength enough to oppose the forces and numbers of the Danes  to whom many of the English nobles  as well as commonalty  had  in his absence  submitted   Swayne was the first Danish Monarch who swayed the English sceptre  but he died before he could be said to come to a peaceable enjoyment of what he had so hardly toiled for  His son Canute  however  atchieved what the father had begun  Edmund Ironside  elected by the English  who was his rival in government  and who succeeded Ethelred in this disputed sovereignty  continued  for a short time  to oppose the progress of the Danish conquests with success  but  Canute gaining a bloody victory over the forces of this Monarch  he was obliged  first  to a division of the kingdom  and his untimely death  soon after  gave Canute quiet and undisturbed possession of the whole   This fierce Monarch cut off some of the Royal Saxon line  and forced others into exile  He was at once King of England  Denmark  and Norway  and  from the extent of his dominion  perhaps  rather than from the greatness of his mind  he received  from historians  the title of Canute the Great  The end of his life  however  was very different from the beginning  the first part of it was marked with invasion  rapine  and cruelty  but the latter equally remarkable for justice  humanity  and religion  Upon a certain occasion  being desirous of shewing his flatterers how lttle he deserved the exaggerated praise with which they loaded him  he ordered a chair to be brought  and  seating himself on the sea shore  where the   51 tide was about to flow  he addressed the sea in this manner    O sea  thou art under my dominion  and the land which I sit upon is mine  I charge thee  approach no further  nor dare to wet the feet of thy Sovereign   the tide  however  advancing as usual  he turned to his courtiers  and observed  that the titles of Lord and Master only belonged to him whom both earth and seas were
