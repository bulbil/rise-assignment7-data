me  else expect to see me        carried by your door a bleeding deathless corpse  the victim of        your cruelty  instead of your compassion to your most grateful        adorer  and everlasting slave            R  WILDLY         In a postscript to this   pursued Miss Forward   he told me that he   would be in the church porch in the afternoon  hoping to receive my   answer by the same means I had directed him to convey to me the dictates   of his heart        I read this letter over and over  as you may easily guess  by my   remembering the contents of it so perfectly  but it is impossible for me   to express the perplexity I was in how to reply to it  I do not mean how   to excuse myself from granting the interview he so passionately   requested  for that  perhaps  I wished for with as much impatience as he   could do  but I was distracted at not being able to contrive any   practicable method for our meeting        O Miss Betsy  how did I long for you  or such a friend as you  to   assist me in this dilemma  But there was not one person in the whole   house I dared trust with such a secret  I could not eat a bit of dinner    nor scarce speak a word to any body  so much were my thoughts taken up   with what I should do  I was resolved to see him  and hear what he had   to say  whatever should be the consequence  at last I hit upon a way    dangerous indeed in every respect  and shameful in a girl of my   condition  yet  as there was no other  the frenzy I was possessed of    compelled me to have recourse to it        You must remember  my dear Miss Betsy   continued she  with a deep   sigh   the little door at the farther end of the garden  where  by your   kind contrivance  young Sparkish was introduced  it was at this door I   determined to meet Mr  Wildly  This  you may be sure  could not be done   by day without a discovery  some one or other being continually running   into the garden  I therefore fixed the rendezvous at night  at an hour   when I was positive all the family would be in bed  and ordered it in   this manner        Chance aided my ill genius in my undoing  I lay at that time alone    Miss Bab  who used to be my bedfellow  was gone home for a fortnight  on   account of a great wedding in their family  and I thought I could easily   slip down stairs  when every body was asleep  and go through the   kitchen  from which  you know  there is a passage into the garden  I   took no care for any thing  but to prevent the disappointment of my   design  for I apprehended nothing of ill from a man who adored me  and   of whose will and actions I foolishly imagined I had the sole command        The settling this matter in my mind engrossed all my thoughts  till the   bell began to ring for divine service  and I had only time to write   these lines in answer to his billet             To Mr  Wildly            Sir            I have always been told it was highly criminal in a young maid         like me  to listen to the addresses of any man  without receiving        the permission of her parents for so doing  yet I hope I shall        stand excused  both to them and you  if I confess I am willing to        be the first to hear what so nearly concerns myself  I have but one        way of speaking to you  and  if your love be as sincere and fervent        as you pretend  you will not think it too much to wait between the        hours of eleven and twelve this night  at a green door in the wall        which encompasses our garden  at the farther end of the lane         leading to that part of Lord      s park  where we first saw each        other  You will find me  if
