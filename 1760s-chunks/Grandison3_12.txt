O Hara is the name she owns   She addressed herself to my Lord  I am the mother of Emily Jervois  my Lord  This gentleman  Major O Hara is my husband   The Major bowed  strutted  and acknowleged her for his wife  And this gentleman  my Lord  said he  is Captain Salmeret  a very brave man  He is in foreign service  His Lady is my own sister   My Lord took notice of each   I understand  my Lord  that my daughter is here  I desire to see her   One of my Lord s servants  at that time  passing by the door  which was open  Pray Sir  said she to him  let Miss Jervois know  that her mamma is come to see her  Desire her to come to me   Major  I long to see my new daughter  I hear she is a charming young Lady  She may depend upon the •nd e•s of a f••her from me     29  Capt  De man of honour and good nature be my broder s general cha ract  er  I do assure your Lordship   He spoke English as a Frenchman  my Lord says  but pronounced the word character as an Irishman   Major  bowing   No need of this  my dear friend  My Lord has the cha ract  er of a fine gentleman himself  and knows how to receive a gentleman who waits upon him with due respect   Lord L  I hope I do  But  madam  you know whose protection the Lady is in   Mrs  O Hara  I do  my Lord  Sir Charles Grandison is a very fine gentleman   Capt  De vinest cha ract  er in de vorld  By my salvation  every body say so   Mrs  O Hara  But Sir Charles  my Lord  is a very young gentleman to be guardian to so young a creature  especially now that she is growing into woman  I have had some few faults  I own  Who lives  that has not  But I have been basely scandalized  My first husband had his  and much greater than I had  He was set against me by some of his own relations  Vile creatures —He left me  and went abroad  but he has answered for all by this time  and for the scanty allowance he made me  his great fortune considered  But as long as my child will be the better for it  that I can forgive —Emily  my dear —  She stepped to the door on hearing the rustling of silks  supposing her at hand  but it was Miss Grandison  followed by a servant with chocolate  to afford her pretence to see the visitors  and at the same time having a mind to hint to them  that they were not to expect to be asked to stay to dinner   It is to Miss Grandison that I owe the description of each  the account of what passed  and the broken dialect   Mrs  O Hara has been an handsome woman  but   30 well might Sir Charles be disgusted with her aspect  She has a leering  fly  yet confident eye  and a very bold countenance  She is not ungenteel  yet her very dress denotes her turn of mind  Her complexion  sallowish  streaked with red  makes her face  which is not so plump as it once has been  look like a withering John apple that never ripened kindly  Miss Grandison has a way of saying ill natured things in such a good natured manner  that one cannot forbear smiling  tho  one should not altogether approve of them  and yet sometimes one would be ready to wonder how she came by her images   The Major is pert  bold  vain  and seemed particularly sond of his new scarlet coat and laced waistcoat  He is certainly  Miss Grandison says  a low man  tho  a soldier  Anderson  added she  is worth fifty of him  His face  fiery and highly pimpled  is set off to advantage by an enormous solitaire  His bad and straggling teeth are shewn continually by an affected laugh  and his empty discourse is interlarded with eaths  which  with my uncle s leave  I shall omit   Captain Salmonet  she says  appeared to her in a middle way between a beau and a Dutch boor  aiming at gentility  with a person and shape uncommonly clumsy   They both assumed military airs  which not sitting naturally  gave them what Miss Grandison called  The swagger of soldierly importance   Emily was in her own apartment  almost fainting with terror  For the servant  to whom Mrs  O Hara had spoken  to bid her daughter come to her  had officiously carried up the message   To what Mrs  O Hara had said in defence of her own character  my Lord answered  Mr  Jervois had  a right  madam  to do what he pleased with a fortune acquired by his own industry  A disagreement in marriage is very unhappy  but in this case  as in a duel  the survivor is hardly ever in fault  I have
