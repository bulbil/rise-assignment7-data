spirit inspires and actuates the air  and is in it a breath of   life to all his creatures  He blooms in the blossom  and unfolds hi         320 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      the rose  He is fragrance in flowers  and flavour in fruits  He   holds infinitude in the hollow of his hand  and opens his world of   wonders in the minims of nature  He is the virtue of every heart   that is softened by a sense of pity or touch of benevolence  He   coos in the turtle and bleats in the lamb   and  through the paps of   the stern bear and implacable tigress  he yields forth the milk of   loving kindness to their little ones  Even  my Harry  when we   hear the delicious enchantment of music  it is but an external   sketch and faint echo of those sentimental and rapturous tunings   that rise up  throughout the immensity of our God  from eternity to   eternity      Thus all things are secretly pregnant with their God  And the   lover of sinners  the universal Redeemer  is a principle of good   within them  that contends with the malignity of their lapsed state    And thus  as the apostle speaks  All nature is in travail  and   groaneth   to be delivered from the evil   till the breath of the   love of God shall kindle upon the final fire  out of which the new   heavens and new earth shall come forth  as gold seven times re    fined  to shine for ever and ever       Harry  agreeable to his covenant with Signer Volanti  had penned   the following advertisement  and inserted it in all the public papers    to wit     On Saturday next  between the hours of ten and twelve in   the forenoon  the celebrated Dominico Jachimo Tonino Volanti will   take his flight from the spire of Clement s steeple  and alight at the   distance of two bows shot  on the Strand   and this he will perform   before the eyes of all people       On the impatiently expected morning  Harry took Mr  Clement   with him in a hackney chaise  and found an innumerable concourse    as well of the gentry in their carriages as of the populace on foot    London had poured forth its numbers to behold this astonishing   flight  The windows were all eyes on every side  and the house    tops were hung with clusters of people as of bees      After Harry had surveyed the crowd with inward titillation  ho   whispered to Clement  and said You shall see now what a sudden   discomfiture I will make of this huge army      He then put forth his head and said to all around Do not ye   perceive  my friends  what fools we are all made   do not ye remem    ber that this is the first of April       He had scarce spoken the words  when they spread from man to   man  and soon were muttered throughout the assembly  And then   louder  and more loud  the first of April   the first of April   was re    peated all about      The company now began to be in motion  All heads were in    stantly withdrawn from the late thronged windows  and the house    tops began to be cleared with a shameful caution      Immediately was heard the rolling of many wheels  and the lashing   of many whips  while every coachman pressed through the crowd  im    patient to deliver his honourable freight from public shame  But   the public now began to relish a joke that was so much against   their betters  and in peals of laughter  and united shouts of   triumph  they echoed and re echoed after them  April fook  April   fools          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  321     Among others Lord Bottom had come with his friend Rakely   in   an elevated phaeton  of which his lordship was charioteer  As   they happened to brush close by Harry s carriage  swearing and   puffing  and lashing and cursing at the crowd  Harry cried to his   old enemy You need not be in so violent a hurry  my lord    perhaps you are not so great a FOOL as you imagine       The fools of fashion were scarce withdrawn  when a long and   strong rope was let down from the top of the steeple  to which it   was fastened at the upper end  A man then  laying hold on it   below  dragged it along through the crowd  and braced it  at a great   distance
