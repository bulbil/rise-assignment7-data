 and a scandal to my family  O  Harriot  it will be no more than what I expect if you should   117 both despise and detest me—Yet when my story  my melancholy story comes to be related  when you find how basely  how cruelly I have been betrayed  I know your tender heart will bleed at what I have suffered  and I know also that the generosity of your disposition will be sensibly affected if during a period in which I have been most entitled to your pity  I have been materially lessened in your esteem  To begin then at once  know that the specious  the sanctified Mrs  Darnel  who had such obligations to our family  and in whose house I was to find so certain an asylum  is a fiend of darkness  an instrument of hell  a priestess of destruction   For the first day or two of my residence at her house  after I was turned out from my father s  she seemed so heartily touched with my misfortune  and so immediately interested in my   118 welfare  that abstracted from the closeness of our relation  she acquired a considerable share of my esteem  and I could not help considering her as a woman of unbounded good nature  who was kindly appointed by the pitying hand of Providence to mitigate the severity of my affliction—Actuated by this opinion  I made her acquainted with my whole heart  and determined as she had the character of being extremely sensible  and devout  to regulate my conduct entirely by her advice  till I should be happily blest with the forgiveness of my father   I had not  however  been at her house above three days  when she began to alter her tone a little  instead of lamenting the unhappy step I had taken  as she did first  she spoke of it with more and more indifference  and at last pretty plainly insinuated  that I had   119 erred rather against the severities of custom  than the laws of morality—that the very best women in the kingdom had not always been able to preserve themselves unsullied  and that it was even idle to distress myself so much on account of a slip  which she herself knew would not be in the least prejudicial to my fortune  I must confess I was so astonished to hear a woman  of whose delicacy in matters of reputation I entertained the highest opinion  so easily reconciled to an action I considered as criminal  as it was scandalous  and to be no less repugnant to the principles of virtue than the customs of society  I therefore continued silent some moments  hoping that I had misconceived her meaning  and expecting that she would explain herself more to my satisfaction  but here I was totally disappointed  for mistaking my silence as a mark of my approbation  she ventured   120 to be still more explicit  and delivered herself to the following purpose  with an air half gay  half serious  yet carefully attending through the whole  to the various changes of my countenance     Indeed  my dear Miss Mildmay  to be candid with you  I cannot imagine however widely I differ from the sentiments of the righteous over much  that the indulgence of the passions is any way repugnant to the laws of morality—I shall grant that the indulgence of them in a manner conformable to the practice of one s country is the most eligible mode  but where people are not married  human nature  as the poet says  will be human nature  and a casual lapse from the rigid rules of form must be sometimes expected  Come my dear   continued the unblushing creature   taking hold of my hand  that Harold is a villain  but if   121 you will be governed by me  your little affair with him shall by no means deprive you of a good husband  You recollect your old admirer Sir Harry Hastings  Sir Harry passionately loves you  and has followed you up to town  to make another tendre of a heart  which has long been devoted to your service  he is my intimate acquaintance  and has in fact requested my assistance  and if you have no objection shall drink tea with us this evening     You cannot imagine  my dear Harriot  what indignation I felt during the whole time of this delicate harangue  yet willing to discover her utmost designs  I endeavoured to bridle my impatience till she had finished it  When she concluded  I strove to assume as unembarrassed a tone of voice as I was able  and fixing my eyes with an unremitting attention upon her s    122 I think this was someting like my reply   —When I was free enough  madam  in obedience to the commands of a mother  to take up my residence at your house  I never expected to be insulted with a conversation of this nature  I did not scruple to acknowledge that I had been accidentally guilty  but at the same time I was in hopes Mrs  Darnel would good naturedly consider  that I was far from being habitually depraved—How therefore she can so widely mistake my character  or rather how she can act in a manner so unworthy of her own as to become a kind of advocate for dishonour  fills me with an equal degree
