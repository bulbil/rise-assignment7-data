the youth no sooner recognized  than his cheeks were  covered with a crimson dye  and he began to tremble with violent  agitation  for he at once guessed the import of the billet  which he  kissed with great reverence and devotion  and was not at all surprised  when he read the following words          Sir   I have performed a sufficient sacrifice to my       reputation  in retaining hitherto the appearance of that       resentment which I had long ago dismissed  and as the       late favourable change in my situation empowers me to       avow my genuine sentiments  without fear of censure  or       suspicion of mercenary design  I take this opportunity       to assure you  that  if I still maintain that place in       your heart which I was vain enough to think I once       possessed  I am willing to make the first advances to an       accommodation  and have actually furnished my brother       with full powers to conclude it in the name of your       appeased   Emilia     Pickle  having kissed the subscription with great ardour  fell upon his  knees  and lifting up his eyes   Thank Heaven   cried he  with an air  of transport   I have not been mistaken in my opinion of that generous  maid  I believed her inspired with the most dignified and heroic  sentiments  and now she gives me a convincing proof of her magnanimity   It is now my business to approve myself worthy of her regard  May Heaven  inflict upon me the keenest arrows of its vengeance  if I do not  at  this instant  contemplate the character of Emilia with the most perfect  love and adoration  yet  amiable and enchanting as she is  I am  more  than ever  determined to sacrifice the interest of my passion to my  glory  though my life should fail in the contest  and even to refuse  an offer  which  otherwise  the whole universe should not bribe me to  forego    This declaration was not so unexpected as unwelcome to his friend  Gauntlet  who represented that his glory was not at all interested in  the affair  because he had already vindicated his generosity in  repeated proffers to lay his whole fortune at Emilia s feet  when it  was impossible that anything selfish could enter into the proposal   but that  in rejecting her present purpose  he would give the world  an opportunity to say  that his pride was capricious  his obstinacy    6 22 15  3 45 PM   invincible  and his sister would have undeniable reason to believe   that either his passion for her was dissembled  or the ardour of it  considerably abated   In answer to these remonstrances  Pickle observed  that he had long  set the world at defiance  and  as to the opinion of Emilia  he did not  doubt that she would applaud in her heart the resolution he had taken   and do justice to the purity of his intention  It was not an easy task  to divert our hero from his designs at any time of life  but  since his  confinement  his inflexibility was become almost insurmountable  The  captain  therefore  after having discharged his conscience  in assuring  him that his sister s happiness was at stake  that his mother had  approved of the step she had taken  and that he himself should be  extremely mortified at his refusal  forbore to press him with further  argument  which served only to rivet him the more strongly in his own  opinion  and undertook to deliver this answer to Emilia s letter          Madam   That I revere the dignity of your virtue with the       utmost veneration  and love you infinitely more than life        I am at all times ready to demonstrate  but the sacrifice       to honour it is now my turn to pay  and such is the rigour       of my destiny  that  in order to justify your generosity        I must refuse to profit by your condescension  Madam  I am       doomed to be for ever wretched  and to sigh without ceasing       for the possession of that jewel  which  though now in my       offer  I dare not enjoy  I shall not pretend to express the       anguish that tears my heart  whilst I communicate this fatal       renunciation  but appeal to the delicacy of your own       sentiments  which can judge of my sufferings  and will        doubtless  do justice to
