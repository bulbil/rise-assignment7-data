to me  and  in a very low whisper  said    Ah Harold  you see the sweetness and delicacy of my poor girl—the day is now so near she cannot look at you with any degree of resolution   Unhappy old man  little does he imagine what a loose all that wonderful sweetness and delicacy can give to the dictates of an unhallowed imagination—Little does he think how she burned in my arms last night  and poured out her whole soul in the most passionate storm of a voluptuous inclination  But  alas  Melmoth    76 why do I harrow up my recollection with that cursed night—it has given me an eternal aversion to the only woman I can ever look upon with tenderness  and fastened all the scorpions of an invincible hatred to the bosom of an extravagant love  You can scarcely imagine  my dear Melmoth  what I felt at her approach—My indignation was no less excited than my transport  and I could not help saying to myself   how astonishingly is that creature calculated to deceive  This moment  when I know her stained and polluted  what an angel like air she assumes  as if utterly unconscious of a blot  and no less unsullied in her mind  than faultless in her person   In reality  Melmoth  the more innocent she seems now  the more I have hereafter to apprehend  since the same air of purity which at present varnishes over the crime I am sensible of—may  in future    77 serve to conceal a thousand  which may be necessary for my knowledge  though destructive to my felicity—A few hours  however  will determine my fate with regard to Miss Mildmay  this is Monday  and Saturday next the wedding is to be celebrated  none of the company are yet arrived  so that the sooner matters are brought to an eclaircissement the better  Dear Melmoth  pity my situation  and believe me  with the utmost affection     R  HAROLD     78  LETTER VII  Mrs  MILDMAY to the Right Hon  the Countess of HAVERSHAM    O LADY Haversham  what shall I do  or where shall I go—your inhuman brother has broke my heart—and my unfortunate child  that was once the darling of my age  is now cast out from the arms of her father  and exposed as well to the detestation as the contempt of all her family  If I can any way support my spirits to go through with the shocking story you shall be acquainted with all—you have fine sense  lady Haversham  you have great humanity—and can allow for the distraction of an unhappy mother  torn in a moment from the enjoyment of all her hopes  and doomed to languish out the little remainder of her days in equal wretchedness and disgrace     79Here my poor Mr  Mildmay and I were felicitating each other at the prospect of an approaching union between our family and your s  and waiting with impatience for the day which was to secure our child in the protection of a worthy husband—Nothing but your presence  the presence of our son  and the company of a few particular friends  was wanting to complete our happiness—O that we could have prevailed upon you to accompany your cruel brother down  The irreparable injury which has murdered all our tranquility  had then never happened  and we should now be exulting in felicity  instead of sinking beneath a load of unutterable shame and distress   I was sitting in my own parlour this morning  reading my favourite Sherlock upon Death  when Sally  my daughter s maid  screamed out from the top of the   80 stairs  that her mistress was dying  Terrified at this information  as you may naturally imagine  I hastened to her assistance  and found the unfortunate girl in a very strong hysteric  stretched upon the floor  and Sally in vain attempting to raise her up  By this time  two or three of the other women servants  joined us  and we lifted her between us into an arm chair  where  with a great deal of difficulty  she was brought a little to herself—She scarcely recovered  however  when she fell into another fit  and continued in a course of successive faintings for several hours—so that I thought it prudent to send a chariot  and six of our best horses  for doctor Webley  About five o clock in the evening she became pretty well composed  and the excessive fatigue she had undergone threw her into a profound sleep  in which she lay till very near twelve—During the principal   81 part of this melancholy scene  my poor Mr  Mildmay and I were not five minutes absent from the room  Her father  you know  doated on her  if possible  with a degree of tenderness more piercingly sensible than myself—he hung over her continually  in an agony of speechless distraction  tore the white hair from his temples  or turned up his eyes towards Heaven  as if he meant to expostulate with the Divine Being  for visiting his daughter with such an affliction  at a time when he looked for nothing but the most perfect content  His distress you may easily conclude was a considerable aggravation of what I felt for my wretched child  and  though I endeavoured to console him  every effort which I made
