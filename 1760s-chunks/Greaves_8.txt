lightning  But this assertion was not confirmed by the young lady herself  who eyed him with a sullen regard  indicating displeasure  though not indifference  and when questioned by her mother  replied   A doan t maind what a says  so a doan t  vor all his goalden jacket  then    In the meantime the surgeon had performed the operation of phlebotomy on the squire  who was lifted into a chair  and supported by the landlady for that purpose  but he had not as yet given any sign of having retrieved the use of his senses  And here Mr  Fillet could not help contemplating  with surprise  the strange figure and accoutrements of his patient  who seemed in age to be turned of fifty  His stature was below the middle size  he was thick  squat  and brawny  with a small protuberance on one shoulder  and a prominent belly  which  in consequence of the water he had swallowed  now strutted beyond its usual dimensions  His forehead was remarkably convex  and so very low  that his black bushy hair descended within an inch of his nose  but this did not conceal the wrinkles of his front  which were manifold  His small glimmering eyes resembled those of the Hampshire porker  that turns up the soil with his projecting snout  His cheeks were shrivelled and puckered at the corners  like the seams of a regimental coat as it comes from the hands of the contractor  His nose bore a strong analogy in shape to a tennis ball  and in colour to a mulberry  for all the water of the river had not been able to quench the natural fire of that feature  His upper jaw was furnished with two long white sharp pointed teeth or fangs  such as the reader may have observed in the chaps of a wolf  or full grown mastiff  and an anatomist would describe as a preternatural elongation of the dentes canini  His chin was so long  so peaked  and incurvated  as to form in profile  with his impending forehead  the exact resemblance of a moon in the first quarter  With respect to his equipage  he had a leathern cap upon his head  faced like those worn by marines  and exhibiting in embroidery  the figure of a crescent  His coat was of white cloth  faced with black  and cut in a very antique fashion  and  in lieu of a waistcoat  he wore a buff jerkin  His feet were cased with loose buskins  which  though they rose almost to his knee  could not hide that curvature  known by the appellation of bandy legs  A large string of bandaliers garnished a broad belt that graced his shoulders  from whence depended an instrument of war  which was something between a back sword and a cutlass  and a case of pistols were stuck in his girdle   Such was the figure which the whole company now surveyed with admiration  After some pause  he seemed to recover his recollection  He rolled about his eyes around  and  attentively surveying every individual  exclaimed  in a strange tone   Bodikins  where s Gilbert   This interrogation did not savour much of sanity  especially when accompanied with a wild stare  which is generally interpreted as a sure sign of a disturbed understanding  Nevertheless  the surgeon endeavoured to assist his recollection   Come   said he   have a good heart —How dost do  friend    Do   replied the squire   do as well as I can —That s a lie too  I might have done better  I had no business to be here    You ought to thank God and your master   resumed the surgeon   for the providential escape you have had    Thank my master   cried the squire   thank the devil  Go and teach your grannum to crack filberds  I know who I m bound to pray for  and who I ought to curse the longest day I have to live    Here the captain interposing   Nay  brother   said he   you are bound to pray for this here gentleman as your sheet anchor  for  if so be as he had not cleared your stowage of the water you had taken in at your upper works  and lightened your veins  d ye see  by taking away some of your blood  adad  you had driven before the gale  and never been brought up in this world again  d ye see    What  then you would persuade me   replied the patient   that the only way to save my life was to shed my precious blood  Look ye  friend  it shall not be lost blood to me —I take you all to witness  that there surgeon  or apothecary  or farrier  or dog doctor  or whatsoever he may be  has robbed me of the balsam of life —He has not left so much blood in my body as would fatten a starved flea —O  that there was a lawyer here to serve him with a siserari    Then fixing his eyes upon Ferret  he proceeded   An t you a limb of the law  friend —No  I cry you mercy  you
