 however  labouring to make themselves a future and a tremendous enemy     Their insensibility excited my highest compassion  and blotted my own uneasiness a while from my mind  It even appeared as a duty incumbent upon me to attempt to reclaim them  I resolved therefore once more to return  and in spite of their contempt to give them my advice  and conquer them by perseverance  Going therefore among them again  I informed Mr  Jenkinson of my design  at which he laughed   Page  105  but communicated it to the rest  The proposal was received with the greatest goodhumour  as it promised to afford a new fund of entertainment to persons who had now no other resource for mirth  but what could be derived from ridicule or debauchery     I therefore read them a portion of the service with a loud unaffected voice  and found my audience perfectly merry upon the occasion  Lewd whispers  groans of contrition burlesqued  winking and coughing  alternately excited laughter  However  I continued with my natural solemnity to read on  sensible that what I did might amend some  but could itself receive no contamination from any     After reading  I entered upon my exhortation  which was rather calculated at first to amuse them than to reprove  I previously observed  that no other motive but  Page  106  their welfare could induce me to this  that I was their fellow prisoner  and now gained nothing by preaching  I was sorry  I said  to hear them so very prophane  because they got nothing by it  but might lose a great deal      For be assured  my friends    cried I    for you are my friends  however the world may disclaim your friendship  though you swore twelve thousand oaths in a day  it would not put one penny in your purse  Then what signifies calling every moment upon the devil  and courting his friendship  since you find how scurvily he uses you  He has given you nothing here  you find  but a mouthful of oaths and an empty belly  and by the best accounts  I have of him  he will give you nothing that s good hereafter    If used ill in our dealings with one man  we naturally go elsewhere  Were it not worth your while then  just to try  Page  107  how you may like the usage of another master  who gives you fair promises at least to come to him  Surely  my Friends  of all stupidity in the world  his must be greatest  who  after robbing an house  runs to the thieftakers for protection  And yet how are you more wise  You are all seeking comfort from him that has already betrayed you  applying to a more malicious being than any thieftaker of them all  for they only decoy  and then hang you  but he decoys and hangs  and what is worst of all  will not let you loose after the hangman has done      When I had concluded  I received the compliments of my audience  some of whom came and shook me by the hand  swearing that I was a very honest fellow  and that they desired my further acquaintance  I therefore promised to repeat my lecture next day  and actually conceived  Page  108  some hopes of making a reformation here  for it had ever been my opinion  that no man was past the hour of amendment  every heart lying open to the shafts of reproof  if the archer could but take a proper aim  When I had thus satisfied my mind  I went back to my apartment  where my wife had prepared a frugal meal  while Mr  Jenkinson begged leave to add his dinner to ours  and partake of the pleasure  as he was kind enough to express it  of my conversation  He had not yet seen my family  for as they came to my apartment by a door in the narrow passage  already described  by this means they avoided the common prison  Jenkinson at the first interview therefore seemed not a little struck with the beauty of my youngest daughter  which her pensive air contributed to heighten  and my little ones did not pass unnoticed      Alas  Doctor    cried he    these children are too handsome and too good for such a place as this    Page  109     Why  Mr  Jenkinson    replied I    thank heaven my children are pretty tolerable in morals  and if they be good  it matters little for the rest     I fancy  sir    returned my fellow prisoner    that it must give you great comfort to have this little family about you     A comfort  Mr  Jenkinson    replied I    yes it is indeed a comfort  and I would not be without them for all the world  for they can make a dungeon seem a palace  There is but one way in this life of wounding my happiness  and that is by injuring them     I am afraid then  sir
