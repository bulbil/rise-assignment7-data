caught finery   Such was the learning of this period  it flourished without encouragement  and the English taste seemed to diffuse itself over all Europe  The French tragedies began to be written after the model of ours  our philosophy was adopted by all who pretended to reason for themselves  At present  however  when the learned of Europe are turned to the English writers for instruction  all spirit of learning has ceased amongst us  So little has been got by literature for more than an age  that none chuse to turn to it for preferment  Church preferments  which were once given as the rewards of learning  have  for some time  deviated to the intriguing  venal  and base  All desire of novelty  in thinking  is suppressed amongst us  and our scholars  more pleased with security and ease than honour  cooly follow the reasonings of their predecessors  and walk round the circle of former discovery     142  LETTER XVII   UPON the death of George I  his son George II ascended the throne  of inferior abilities to th late King  and consequently still more strongly at¦tached to his dominions on the continent  The va¦rious subsidies that had been in the last reign grant¦ed  to maintain foreign connexions  were still kept u in this and the late system of politics  underwent n sort of alteration  The rights and privileges of th throne of England were  in general  committed t the minister s care  the royal concern being chief… fixed upon balancing the German powers  and gain¦ing an ascendancy for the Elector of Hanover i the Empire  The ministry was  at first  divided be¦tween Lord Townshend  a man of extensive know¦ledge  the Earl of Chesterfield  the only man of ge¦nius employed under this government  and Sir Ro¦bert Walpole  who soon after engrossed the greate share of the administration to himself   Sir Robert Walpole  who is to make the principa figure in the present reign  had  from low begin¦nings  raised himself to the head of the treasury Strongly attached to the house of Hanover  and serv¦ing it at times  when it wanted his assistance  he sti… maintained the prejudices with which he set out and  unaware of the alteration of sentiments in th nation  still attempted to govern by party  He  pro¦bably  like every other minister  began by endeavou¦ing to serve his country  but  meeting with stron opposition  his succeeding endeavours were rath… employed in maintaining his post  than of being ser¦viceable in it  The declining prerogative of th crown might have been an early object of his atten¦tion  but  in the sequel  those very measures whic he took to increase it  proved to be the most effec¦tual means of undermining it  As latterly all h…  143 aims were turned only to serve himself  and his friends  he undertook to make a majority in the house of commons  by bribing the members  and  what was still worse  avowed the corruption  As all spirit of integrity was now laughed out of the kingdom  and as the people were held to duty by no motives of religious obedience to the throne  patriotism was ridiculed  and venality practised without shame  As such a disposition of things naturally produced opposition  Sir Robert was possessed of a most phlegmatic insensibility to bear reproach  and a calm dispassionate way of reasoning upon such topics as he desired to enforce  His discourse was fluent without eloquence  and his reasons convincing  without any share of elevation   The house of commons  which  in the preceding reign  had been distinguished into Whigs and Jacobites  now underwent another change  and was again divided into the Court and Country party  The Court party were for favouring all the schemes of the ministry  and applauding all the measures of the crown  They regarded foreign alliances as conducive to internal security  and paid the troops of other countries for their promises of future assistance  Of these Sir Robert was the leader  and such as he could not convince by his eloquence  he undertook to buy over by places and pensions  The other side  who called themselves the Country party  were entirely averse to continental connexions  they complained that immense sums were lavished on subsilies  which could never be useful  and that alliances were bought with money  which should be only rewarded by a reciprocation of good intentions  These ooked upon the frequent journies of the King to his Electoral dominions with a jealous eye  and somemes hinted at the alienation of the royal affections …om England  Most of these had been strong as…rtors of the Protestant succession  and  not fearing   144 the reproach of Jacobitism  they spoke with stil greater boldness  As the Court party generally threatened the house of commons with imaginary danger to the state  so these of the Country usually de claimed against the incroachments of the preroga¦tive  The threats of neither were founded i truth  the kingdom was in no danger from abroad nor was internal liberty in the least infringed by th crown  On the contrary  those who viewed the stat with an unprejudiced eye  were of opinion that th prerogatives of the crown were the only part of th constitution that was growing every day weaker  tha while the King s thoughts were turned to foreig concerns
