 had been very uneasy at her staying out so late  especially as she was   alone  was equally rejoiced at her return  but  as well as Lady   Mellasin  was surprized on hearing by what accident she had been   detained  they knew not how to judge of it  there was no circumstance in   the whole affair which could make them think Mr  Bloomacre had any   designs of the sort Lord      had suggested  yet did Mr  Goodman think   himself obliged  as the young lady s guardian  to go to that gentleman    and have some talk with him concerning what had passed  Accordingly  he   went the next morning to his house  but  not finding him at home  left   word with his servant that he desired to speak with him as soon as   possible  he came not  however  the whole day  nor sent any message to   excuse his not doing so  and this neglect gave Mr  Goodman  and Miss   Betsy herself  some room to suspect he was no less guilty than he had   been represented  since had he been perfectly innocent  it seemed   reasonable to them to think he would have come  even of his own accord    to have learned of Miss Betsy the motive of her leaving him in so abrupt   and odd a manner  but how much they wronged him will presently appear    and they were afterwards convinced       There was an implacable animosity between Lord      and Mr  Bloomacre    on account of the former s pretending a right to some lands which the   other held  and could not be dispossessed of by law  As his lordship   knew Mr  Bloomacre was not of a disposition to bear an affront tamely    he had no other way to vent his spleen against him  than by villifying   and traducing him in all companies he came into  but this he took care   to do in so artful a manner  as to be enabled either to evade  or render   what he said impossible to be proved  in case he were called to an   account for it       The affair of Miss Betsy  innocent as it was  he thought gave him an   excellent opportunity of gratifying his malice  he went early the next   morning to the dean  complained of an insult offered to his house by Mr    Bloomacre  on the score of his sister having brought in a young lady    whom that gentleman had detained in the cloisters  and was going to   carry off  by the assistance of some friends he had with him  in a   hackney coach       The dean  who was also a bishop  was extremely incensed  as well he   might  at so glaring a profanation of that sacred place  and the moment   Lord      had taken his leave  sent for Mr  Bloomacre to come to him    That gentleman immediately obeying the summons  the bishop began to   reprimand him in terms  which the occasion seemed to require from a   person of his function and authority  Mr  Bloomacre could not forbear   interrupting him  though with the greatest respect  saying nothing could   be more false and base  than such an accusation  that whoever had given   such an information was a villain  and merited to be used as such  The   prelate  seeing him in this heat  would not mention the name of his   accuser  but replied coolly  that it was possible he might be wronged    but to convince him that he was so  he must relate to him the whole   truth of the story  and on what grounds a conjecture so much to the   disadvantage of his reputation had been formed  On which Mr  Bloomacre   repeated every thing that had passed  and added  that he was well   acquainted with the family where the young lady was boarded  and that he   was certain she would appear in person to justify him in this point  if   his lordship thought it proper   But   said the bishop   I hear you   affronted the Lord       by thundering at his door  and abusing his   servants     No  my lord   answered Mr  Bloomacre   Lord       though   far from being my friend  will not dare to alledge any such thing   against me  We were  indeed  a little surprized to see the young lady    who was with us  snatched away in so odd a fashion by his sister  who we   easily perceived had not the least acquaintance with her  We continued   walking  however  in the cloister  till the man whom we had sent for a   coach returned
