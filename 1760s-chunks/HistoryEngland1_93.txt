for the future  till a court  somewhat resembling the inquisition  was established  which continued the slaughters without remorse  In this reign five bishops  twenty one ministers  and above eight hundred others  went to the flames in maintenance of the truth  numbers died in prison  and several by whips and tortures were forced to abjure   Yet  still in this dismal situation with respect to religion  the temporal concerns of the nation were conducted with very little better success  Calais  which had long been possessed by the English  and was a curb to the ambition of France  was taken in this reign by the Duke of Guise  and all the English drove out of it  as the great Edward had drove the French out two hundred years before  The Queen was only bent on ruining Protestants  and took no care to defend her dominions   Philip  her husband  seemed no way pleased with his alliance  the Queen  some time after their marriage  was delivered of a false conception  This created disgust in him  he quitted England  therefore  to pursue his own schemes in Flanders  leaving   273 the Queen sufficiently mortified at his coldness for her  of which he gave repeated proofs   The loss of Calais  and the disappointment with regard to her pregnancy  soon excited murmurs among the people  The Protestants now exerted their influence in exposing the weakness of the government and the cruelty of the council  but no person had a greater share of reproach than the Queen  and none felt it so severely  The house of commons  that had hitherto been all along so submissive  now also testified their displeasure  and refused to grant a subsidy  though she condescended to lay the bad state of her affairs before them  During these mortifications her health sensibly declined  she was naturally melancholy and sullen  and her repeated disappointments increased her distemper  She had been ill attended during her pretended pregnancy  having committed herself to the care of women  and neglected the advice of her physicians  After having been for some time afflicted with the dropsy  this disorder carried her off in the forty third year of her age  after a reign of about five years  Had she been born at any other period  she might have been a good Princess  but her zeal for religion was louder than the calls of humanity  Henry VIII  her father  acted like a tyrant and a persecutor from vicious motives  and he knew it  Mary was both a tyrant and a persecutor from motives of virtue  and she was never undeceived   I am   c     274  LETTER XXXIV   WERE we to adopt the maxim in morals  that evil may be done for the production of good  one might say that the persecutions in Mary s reign were permitted only to bring the kingdom over to the Protestant religion  Nothing could preach so effectually against the cruelty and the vices of the Monks  as the actions of the Monks themselves  wherever heretics were to be burnt  they were always present  rejoicing at the spectacle  insulting the fallen  and frequently the first to thrust the flaming brand against the faces of the condemned  The English were effectually converted by such sights as these  to bring any people over to any opinion  it is only necessary to persecute instead of attempting to convince  the people had formerly embraced the reformed religion from fear  they were now internally Protestants from inclination   We have hitherto seen England like the element that surrounds it  ever unsettled and stormy  ever sinking under foreign invasion or domestic disputes  it had felt a short interval of happiness  indeed  under Henry VII  but his successors soon disturbed that felicity  and laid the country once more in blood  At length the genius of the people prevailed over all opposition  and England was now about to make its own happiness  and to set mankind an example of industry  commerce  freedom  learning  opulence  and power   To Mary succeeded her sister Elizabeth  who was unanimously declared Queen at the accustomed places  and with the acclamations of the people  Elizabeth had her education in that best of schools    275 the school of adversity  as during the life of her sister  who had no children  she was next heir to the throne  and at the same time was known to be of the Protestant religion  she was obnoxious to the reigning tyrant for two reasons  it was feared she might aspire to the throne during her sister s life  but it was still more reasonably apprehended  that she would  if ever she came to the crown  make an innovation in that religion which Mary took so much pains to establish  The Bishops  who had shed such a deluge of blood  foresaw this  and often told Mary  that her destroying meaner heretics was of no advantage to the state  unless she attacked the principal heretic  that it was to no purpose to lop off the branches while the body of the tree was suffered to stand  Mary saw and acknowledged the justice of their observations  confined her sister with proper guards  and only waited for some new insurrection  or some favourable pretext to destroy her  her own death
