I had a thousand things to say—But I have lost them all —Go thou  in peace  and be happy  And God Almighty make me so  Adieu  dearest of men   She condescendingly inclined her cheek to me  I saluted her  but could not utter to her what yet was upon my lips to speak   She withdrew her hand  She seemed to want support  Her mother and sister hastened to her  I stopt at the door  Her eyes pursued my motions  By her uplifted hands she seemed praying for me  I was apprehensive of her fainting  I hastened towards her  but restraining myself  just as I had reached her  again hurried to the door  And on my knees  with clasped hands  audibly there besought God to sustain  support  preserve  the noble Clementina  And seeing her seated in the arms of both Ladies  I withdrew to Mr  Lowther s apartment  and shut myself in for a few moments  When a little recovered  I could not but step in to my Jeronyme  He was alone  drying his eyes as he sat  But seeing me enter  he burst out into fresh tears  Once more  my Jeronymo—I would have comforted him  but wanted comfort myself   O my Grandison  embracing me  as I did him—  CLEMENTINA  The angel CLEMENTINA  Ah  my Jeronymo —Grief again denied me further speech for a moment  I saw that my emotion increased his—Love  love  said I  the dear—I would have added CLEMENTINA  Page  250 but my trembling lips refused distinct utterance to the word —I tore myself from his embrace  and with precipitation left the tenderest of friends   About eleven  according to the English numbering of the hours  I sent to know how the whole family did  Father Marescotti returned with my servant  He told me  that the Lady fainted away after I was gone  But went to rest as soon as recovered  They all were in grief  he said  He was charged with the best wishes  and with the blessings  of every one  with those of the two Marchionesses in particular  Signor Jeronymo was so ill  that one of his Italian surgeons proposed to fit up with him all night  for Mr  Lowther had desired to accompany me as far as Modena  And him I charged with my compliments to each person of the family  and with my remembrances to servants  who well deserved kindness from me  and who  Father Marescotti told me  were all in tears on my departure  I prevailed on the Father himself to make my acknowlegements to the good Camilla  He offered  and I thankfully accepted of  his prayers for my health and happiness  which he put up in the most servent manner  on his knees  and then embracing me  with a tenderness truly paternal  we parted  blessing each other   This morning early  I set out  The Count of Belvedere rejoiced to see me  and called me kind  for being his guest  though but for one night  for I shall pursue my journey in the morning  He assures me  that he will make me a visit in England   You will hardly  till I arrive at Paris  have another Letter  my dear Dr  Bartlett  from  Your ever affectionate CHARLES GRANDISON   Page  251  LETTER XL  Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  To Dr  BARTLETT    Paris  Aug  31  Paris  Sept  11   I Set out from Parma early on Tuesday morning  as I intended  The Count of Belvedere was so obliging  as to accompany me to Pavia  where we parted with mutual civilities   I paid my respects to Lady Sforza at Milan  as I had promised  She received me with great politeness  Our conversation chiefly turned on the differences between the other branches of her family  on one part  and herself  and Lady Laurana  on the other  She owned  that when she sent to desire a visit from me  she had supposed  that the alliance between them and me was a thing concluded upon  and that she intended  by my mediation  to reconcile herself to the family  if they would meet her half way   She was so indiscreet  as they lay general blame on her noble niece  as a person given up to a zeal that wanted government  She threw out hints  injurious to the sincerity of the three brothers  as well as to that of the father and mother  with regard to me  All which I discountenanced   I have hardly ever conversed with a woman so artful as Lady Sforza  I wonder not  that she had the address to fire the Count of Belvedere with impatience  and to set him on seeking to provoke me to an act of rashness  which  after what had happened between me and the young Count Altieri  some years ago  at Verona  might have been fatal to one  if not to both  and  by that means  rid Italy  if not the world  of me  and  at the same time  revenged herself on the Count  for rejecting her daughter  who  as I have told you
