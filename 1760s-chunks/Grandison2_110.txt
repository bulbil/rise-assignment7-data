by listening to a clandestine address  to recover herself  Your father  my dear  but you might not know that  could have absolved you from this promise a  You have not now  however  any body to controul you  You are absolutely your own mistress  And I see not but a promise—But  pray  of what nature was this promise   Miss Gr  O my folly —I declared  that I never would marry any other man without his consent  while he was single  By this means  to my confusion  I own  that I made him my father  my guardian  my brother  at least  I made the influences over me  of such of them as had been living  of no avail  in the most material article of my life  teazed  as I told you  into it  and against my judgment   Soon after  he let me know  as I said  in his own hand writing  what an illiterate  what a mere supersicial man I had entered into treaty with  And ever since I have been endeavouring by pen  as well as in person  to get him to absolve me from my rash promise  And this was my view and endeavour before I had a title to the independence  in which  Sir  you was so good as to establish me   I once thought  proceeded she  that he would   275 easily have complied  and have look d out elsewhere for a wife  for I sought not to fetter him  as you justly call it  He was not of so much consequence with me  and this renders me  perhaps  the less excuseable —But you held me not long enough in suspense  as to the great things you intended to do for me  to enable me to obtain that release from Captain Anderson  which I was meditating to procure  before he knew what those were   All this time I kept my own secret  I had not confidence enough in the steps I had so rashly taken  indeed had not humility enough  to make any living creature acquainted with my situation  And this was the reason  I suppose  that I never was guessed at  or found out  The proverb says▪ Two can keep a secret  when one is away  But my Harriet knows  I bowed  that I very early  in my knowledge of her  dropt hints of an entanglement  as I ludicrously called it  for I could not  with justice  say Love   Sir  Ch  Charming frankness  How do your virtues shine thro  your very mistakes —But there are many women who have suffer d themselves to be worse entangled  even beyond recovery  when they have not had to plead the apprehensions which you had at entering into this affair   Miss Gr  You are Sir Charles Grandison  Sir  I need no• say more  We often dread  in rash encounter• to make those communications  which only can be means to •••ricate us from the difficulties into which we have plunged ourselves  Had I  for the last six or seven years of my life  known my brother as I now know him  had I been indulged in a correspondence with him in his absence  not a step would I have taken  but with his approbation   Sir Ch  Perhaps I was too implicit on this occasion  But I always thought it more safe in a disputable case  to check than to give way  to an inclination  My father knew the world  He was not an ill natured man    276 He loved his daughters  I had not the vanity to imagine  that my sisters  the youngest near as old as myself  would want my advice  in material articles  And to break thro  a father s commands  for the sake merely of gratifying myself—I don t know how—But I could not do it  And as a considerate person  when he has lost a dear friend  and more particularly a parent  is apt to recollect with pleasure those instances in which he has given joy to the departed  and with pain the contrary  methinks I am the more satisfied with myself  for having obeyed a command  that however  at the time  I knew not how to account for   Miss Gr  You are happy  brother  in this recollection  I should be more unhappy than I am  on your principles  had I vexed my father in this affair  Thank God  he knew nothing of it  But now  Sir  I have told you the whole truth  I have not aggravated the failings of Captain Anderson  nor wish to do so  for the man that once I had but the shadow of a thought to make one day my nearest relation  is intitled  I think  to my good wishes  tho  he prove not quite so worthy  as I once believed him   Permit me  however  to add  that Captain Anderson is passionate  overbearing  I have never of late met him  but with great reluctance  Had I not come to Colnebrooke  I should have seen him  as I confessed  but it was with the resolution that I had
