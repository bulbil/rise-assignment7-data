the happy   days which produced them   but if you consider the long intervals   between  and the innumerable bad ones which appeared along wdth   them  but are now lost in the wreck of time  you will find that you   have not so great reason to complain of the present decline of genius   as you may have imagined  I do not  by this  mean that every one   who pretends to write is possessed of that genius  or that all the   pieces offered to the stage are proper for representation  On the       Apparently this is intended for John Beard  1716   91   actor and   manager of Covent Garden  fiom 1761 1767  Beard was also a noted   singer  ChurchUl says in the Bosciad â€”       Let slavish minstrels pour the enervate lay     To Britons far more noble pleasures spring     In native notes  whilst Beard and Vincent sing        Garrick may  however  be the individual referred to   as already ob    served  he made common cause with Beard against the agitators          378 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     contrary  many who want every qualification indispensable to   success in such attempts make them every day in defiance of reason    and strive to obtrude upon the public works which are a reproach   to common sense  The motives of this are obvious  Whenever   a man is at a loss how to spend his time  or wants to raise a little   money  down he sits and writes a play  The consequence of this   is  that the very reasons which made him turn poet necessarily   preclude him from success  Idleness prevents that care â€” that   limoe labor â€” which alone can make a performance proper for public   representation  and distress depresses the imagination  and hinders   its rising to that happy boldness which is the essence of poetry      It appears from hence  that if the managers of theatres from   interested motives are often to blame for rejecting good pieces    poets  or those who would be thought such   are much oftener cul    pable for offering them bad ones  The difference of opinion un    avoidable on this account occasions the difficulty in their inter    course  But in this the contest is not equal  The word of a manager   is decisive  while the poet has nothing left but to vent his resent    ment in unavailing  and often unjust  complaints and abuse  in   which those who have least right are always loudest  for  enamoured   with the beauty of their own offspring  like the ape in the fable    they throw dirt at all who presume to find fault with it  But severe   as it mxist be to suffer this  it is not the greatest difficulty the manager   has to encounter with them  Not satisfied with the civil refusal of   affected delays and excuses  they mu st have a direct answer  which   they controvert with all their power  and oblige him to support by   such arguments as must give him pain  if he has either politeness   or good nature   though  after all  instead of convincing them  he   only gets theirs and their friends  ill will  and arms all their tongues   against him      It is not to be doubted but the evasions which managers use to   shift off good pieces are as grossly offensive to moral propriety    truth  and candour  as the arguments of authors in defence of bad   ones can possibly be to reason   but as I did not happen to be   witness to any instances of them  I shall confine my account to   the latter          CH 4 PTER X  I     chrysal s master sits in judgment on some pieces ofpebed to   him â€” a poet of fashion enters â€” the aeottments by which     HE SUPPORTS HIS WORK AGAINST THE OBJECTIONS OF CHRYSAL s   MASTER  WHO MAKES SOME CUEIOUS DRAMATICAL STRICTURES â€”   THE POET  DRIVEN FROM HIS LAST RETREAT  THE INTEREST OF HIS   OEEAT FRIENDS  BY THE COMMON CANT OF THE HOUSE s EEINa   FULL FOR THE SEASON  DEPARTS IN A RAGE  DENOUNCING THEIB   RESENTMENT  WHICH CHEYSAL s MASTER SHOWS HIS REASON NOT   TO FEAR THE EFFECTS OF     The important morning after I came into the possession of the   manager was big with the fate of many a poetical performance  the         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 379     authors of which were appointed to come there for his decisive   answer  Accordingly  as soon as he had breaJifasted  he repaired   to his tribunal  where he had been waited
