   LETTER XCII   92   To Mrs  MELMOTH  at Montreal   Silleri  March 19   I AM sorry  my dear Madam  you should know so little of my heart  as to suppose it possible I could have broke my engagements with Sir George from any motive but the full conviction of my wanting that tender affection for him  and that lively taste for his conversation  which alone could have ensured either his felicity or my own  happy is it for both that I discovered this before it was too late  it was a very unpleasing circumstance  even under an intention only of marrying him  to find my friendship stronger for another  what then would it have been under the most sacred of all engagements  that of marriage  What wretchedness would have been the portion of both  had timidity  decorum  or false honor  carried me  with this partiality in my heart  to fulfill those views  entered into from compliance to my family  and continued from a false idea of propriety  and weak fear of the censures of the world       The same reason therefore still subsisting  nay being every moment stronger  from a fuller conviction of the merit of him my heart prefers  in spite of me  to Sir George  our union is more impossible than ever       I am however obliged to you  and Major Melmoth  for your zeal to serve me  though you must permit me to call it a mistaken one  and to Sir George  for a concession which I own I should not have made in his situation  and which I can only suppose the effect of Major Melmoth s persuasions  which he might suppose were known to me  and an imagination that my sentiments for him were changed  assure him of my esteem  though love is not in my power       As Colonel Rivers never gave me the remotest reason to suppose him more than my friend  I have not the least right to disapprove his marrying  on the contrary  as his friend  I ought to wish a connexion which I am told is greatly to his advantage       To prevent all future importunity  painful to me  and  all circumstances considered  degrading to Sir George  whose honor is very dear to me  though I am obliged to refuse him that hand which he surely cannot wish to receive without my heart  I am compelled to say  that  without an idea of ever being united to Colonel Rivers  I will never marry any other man       Were I never again to behold him  were he even the husband of another  my tenderness  a tenderness as innocent as it is lively  would never cease  nor would I give up the refined delight of loving him  independently of any hope of being beloved  for any advantage in the power of fortune to bestow       These being my sentiments  sentiments which no time can alter  they cannot be too soon known to Sir George  I would not one hour keep him in suspence in a point  which this step seems to say is of consequence to his happiness       Tell him  I entreat him to forget me  and to come into views which will make his mother  and I have no doubt himself  happier than a marriage with a woman whose chief merit is that very sincerity of heart which obliges her to refuse him       I am  Madam   Your affectionate   c   EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER XCIII   93   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Thursday   YOUR brother dines here to day  by my father s invitation  I am afraid it will be but an awkward party       Emily is at this moment an exceeding fine model for a statue of tender melancholy       Her anger is gone  not a trace remaining   tis sorrow  but the most beautiful sorrow I ever beheld  she is all grief for having offended the dear man       I am out of patience with this look  it is so flattering to him  I could beat her for it  I cannot bear his vanity should be so gratified       I wanted her to treat him with a saucy  unconcerned  flippant air  but her whole appearance is gentle  tender  I had almost said  supplicating  I am ashamed of the folly of my own sex  O  that I could to day inspire her with a little of my spirit  she is a poor tame household dove  and there is no making any thing of her   Eleven o clock      For my shepherd is kind  and my heart is at ease     What fools women are  Lucy  He took her hand  expressed concern for her health  softened the tone of his voice  looked a few civil things with those expressive lying eyes of his  and without one word of explanation all was forgot in a moment         Good night  Yours   A  FERMOR       Heavens  the fellow is here  has followed me to my dressing room  was ever any thing so confident
