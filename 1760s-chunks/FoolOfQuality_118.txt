a nurse keeper  she then   held her hands over him  and raised her eyes to heaven in blessing   for some time  Again she fixed them on his face  and gazing upon   him  as it were  for a last farewell look  tear dropped after tear in   a pathetic and affectionate silence      Being conducted to the Old Bailey  my wife on entering the   court turned suddenly pale   and her countenance was downcast   with a diffidence that she could not for some time overcome  The   concourse was excessively great  and chiefly consisting of the nobility   and gentry of both sexes  The great man himself was there  with   a crowd of his dependants  and all the male and female relations   and friends of the deceased      I gave my Arabella the salts to smell to   and  as she weakly   and bashfully advanced to the bar  a confused and jarring murmur   was held on all sides  and the words impudence and innocence   resounded throughout      When  according to order  she had held up her hand and heard   her indictment  the judge  with a countenance and voice equally   stern  demanded guilty  or not guilty   She answered  Guilty  my   lord  I confess  of the death of Lord Stivers   but never guilty of   any kind of robbery or malice  Woman  said the judge  you confess   yourself guilty  and I shall proceed to your sentence  But I ask   you  for the last time  guilty or not guilty  Not guilty  my lord    she then rejoined   if to do what I approve  and shall never repent   of  is not to be guilty      Again the murmur was repeated  but continued much longer    and with more virulence on the one part  and more concern on the   other      I shall not detain you  sir  with an account of the examination of   the two first witnesses  one of whom had been our own servant    girl  and the other the principal footman of Lord Stivers  They   had all manner of encouragement and countenance from the court    and concurred in every circumstance that could serve for condemna    tion  The sound of triumph was heard through all the gentry  and   the populace sighingly gave my Arabella for lost      The third witness was then called  He was a very genteel and   modest looking young man  and was now out of livery      My lord  says he  with a respectful but resolute voice  before I   give my testimony in this case  I request that the two first   witnesses should be taken into custody  Into custody   cried the   3   do you know what you say   I do know what I say  my   and I repeat my request  that they should be taken into         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  103     custody  Why  friend  said the judge  they are as you are   they   are witnesses for the crown against a criminal  and no man has a   right to order them into custody  I say  rejoined the youth  with   an air still more determined  that they are witnesses against inno    cence  against his majesty  and against the laws   that they alone   are criminal   that I am evidence against them   and I again   require it of your lordship  of the jury  and of all present  that they   should not be permitted to make their escape      I see  exclaimed the judge  you are a prevaricating villain    but I shall trounce you before we part  Where is this fellow s   examination       My lord  my lord  said the young man  with somewhat of a   severe and sarcastical tone  you were not placed there to prejudicate   in any matter  no more than I was called here to be browbeat and   sentenced without trial  If you find that I prevaricate if you   desire to sift me as wheat  and find any chaff in me I refuse not   the bitterest punishment that our laws can inflict  But your lord    ship observes I am an evidence for the crown  and his majesty    God be praised  will not fix his tribunal in any unrighteousness    I therefore demand to be heard in the cause to which I am cited     and all present shall be assured that I speak nothing but the   truth  And you  gentlemen of the jury  I petition you to intercede   in favour of equity with his lordship  and to prevail that these   criminals
