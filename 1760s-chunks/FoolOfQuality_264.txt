not within the   capacity of any of the three estates distinct from the others     the frequent holding of parliaments is the vital food  without which   the constitution cannot subsist      The three estates originally  when assembled in parliament  sat   together consulting in the open field  Accordingly  at Kunning   Mead  five hundred years ago  King John passed the great charter    as therein is expressed  by the advice of the lords spiritual and   temporal  by the advice of several commoners  by name recited   et   aliorum fidelium  and of others his faithful people  And  in the   twenty first clause of the said charter  he covenants that   for   having the common council of the kingdom to assess aids  he will   cause the lords spiritual and temporal to be summoned by his writs          282 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      and moreover  that he will cause the principal commoners  or those    vho held from him in chief  to be generally summoned to said   parliaments by his sheriffs and bailiffs       In the said assemblies  however  the concourse became so great   and disorderly  and the contests frequently so high  between the   several estates  in assertion of their respective prerogatives and   privileges  that they judged it more expedient to sit apart  and   separately to exercise the offices of their respective departments      As there is no man or set of men  no class or corporation  no   village or city  throughout the kingdom  that is not represented by   these their delegates in parliament  this great body politic  or   representative of the nation  consists  like the body natural  of a   head and several members  which  being endowed with different   powers for the exercise of different offices  are yet connected by   one main and common interest  and actuated by one life or spirit   of public reason  called the laws      In all steps of national import the king is to be conducted by   the direction of the parliament  his great national council a council   on whom it is equally incumbent to consult for the king with whom   they are connected  and for the people by whom they are delegated    and whom they represent  Thus the king is  constitutionally  to be   guided by the sense of the parliament  and the parliament alike is    constitutionally  to be guided by the general sense of the people    The two estates in parliament are the constituents of the king  and   the people  mediately or immediately  are the constituents of the   two estates in parliament      Now  while the three estates act distinctly within their respective   departments  they affect  and are reciprocally affected  by each   other  This action and reaction produces that general and system    atic control which  like conscience  pervades and superintends the   whole  checking and prohibiting evil from every part of the con    stitution  And from this confinement of every part to the rule of   right reason  ariseth the great law of liberty to all      For instance   the king has the sole prerogative of making war     c    but then the means are in the hands of the people and their   representatives      Again To the king is committed the whole executive power     but then the ministers of that power are accountable to a tri    bunal from which a criminal has no appeal or deliverance to look   for      Again To the king is committed the cognizance of all causes     but should his judges or justiciaries pervert the rule of righteous    ness  an inquisition  impeachment  and trial impends  from whose   judgment the judges cannot be exempted      Again The king hath a negative upon all bills  whereby his own   prerogatives are guarded from invasion   but should he refuse the   royal assent to bills tending to the general good of the subject  the   commons can also withhold their bills of assessment  or annex the   rejected bills to their bill of aids  and they never failed to pass in   such agreeable company      Lastly To the king is committed the right of calling the two   estates to parliament   but should he refuse so to call them  such a         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  283     refusal would be deemed   an abdication of the constitution     and   no one need be told at this day  that  an abdication of the   constitution is an abdication of the throne       Thus  while the king
