sudden and unexpected fate had at the first overwhelmed her soul  yet    when those emotions were a little evaporated  she rather indulged   affliction  because she thought it her duty to do so  than endeavoured   any way to combat with it       It was not  therefore  very difficult to reason her out of a melancholy   which she had in a manner forced upon herself  and was far from being   natural to her  and when once convinced that she ought to be easy under   this stroke of Providence  became entirely so       The painful task she had imposed upon her mind being over  more   agreeable ones succeeded  the remembrance of Mr  Trueworth  his   recovered love  the knowledge he had of hers  and the consideration that   now both of them were in a condition to avow their mutual tenderness   without a crime  could not but transfuse a sensation more pleasing than   she had ever before been capable of experiencing       In the mean time  that gentleman passed through a variety of emotions on   her account  nor will it seem strange he should do so to any one who   casts the least retrospect on his former behaviour  he had loved her   from the first moment he beheld her  and had continued to love her for a   long series of time with such an excess of passion  that not all his   reason on her ill treatment of him  and her supposed unworthiness  was   scarce sufficient to enable him wholly to desist  a new amour was   requisite to divide his wishes  the fondness and artful blandishments of   Miss Flora served to wean his heart from the once darling object  but   there demanded no less than the amiable person  and more amiable temper    of Miss Harriot  to drive thence an idea so accustomed to preside  All   this  however  as it appeared  did not wholly extinguish the first   flame  the innocence of the charming Miss Betsy fully cleared up  all   the errors of her conduct reformed  rekindled in him an esteem  the   sight of her  after so many months absence  made the seemingly dead   embers of desire begin to glow  and  on the discovery of her sentiments   in his favour  burst forth into a blaze  he was not master of himself in   the first rush of so joyous a surprize  he forgot she was married  he   approached her in the manner the reader has already been told  and for   which he afterwards severely condemned himself  as thinking he ought to   be content with knowing she loved him  without putting her modesty to   the blush by letting her perceive the discovery he had made       As Lady Loveit  without suspecting the effect which her discourse   produced  had been often talking of the ill treatment she received from   Mr  Munden  and the necessity she had been under of quitting his house    the sincere veneration she now had for her made him sympathize in all   the disquiets he was sensible she sustained  but when he heard this   cruel husband was no more  and  at the same time  was informed in what   manner she behaved  both in his last moments  and after his decease    nothing  not even his love  could equal his admiration of her virtue and   her prudence       What would he not now have given to have seen her  but he knew such a   thing was utterly impracticable  and to attempt it might lose him all   the tenderness she had for him  his impatience  however  would not   suffer him to seem altogether passive and unconcerned at an event of so   much moment to the happiness of them both  and he resolved to write  but   to find terms to express himself so as not to offend either her   delicacy  by seeming too presuming  or her tenderness  by a pretended   indifference  cost him some pains  but  at length  he dictated the   following little billet             To Mrs  Munden            Madam            I send you no compliments of condolence  but beg you to be        assured  that my heart is too deeply interested in every thing        that regards you  to be capable of feeling the least satisfaction        while yours remains under any inquietude  all I wish at present is         that you would believe this truth  which  if you do  I know you        have too much justice  and too much generosity  to lavish all your
