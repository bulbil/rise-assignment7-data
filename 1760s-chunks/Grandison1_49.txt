my visits to your cousins  madam   Not on my account  Sir   You will not withdraw if I come  You will not refuse seeing me   As you will be no visitor of mine  I must be allowed to act accordingly  Had I the least thought of encouraging   117 your addresses  I would deal with you as openly as is consistent with my notions of modesty and decorum   Perhaps  madam  from my gay behaviour at Lady Betty Williams s  you think me too airy a man  You have doubts of my sincerity  You question my honour   That  Sir  would be to injure myself   Your objections  then  dear madam  Give me  I beseech you  some one material objection   Why  Sir  should you urge me thus —When I have no doubt  it is unnecessary to look into my own mind for the particular reasons that move me to disapprove of the addresses of a gentleman whose professions of regard for me  notwithstanding  intitle him to civility and acknowlegement   By my soul  madam  this is very comical   I do not like thee Dr  Fell    The reason why  I cannot tell—  But I don t like thee  Dr  Fell    Such  madam  seem to me to be your reasons   You are very pleasant  Sir  But let me say  that if you are in earnest in your professions  you could not have quoted any thing more against you than these humorous lines  since a dislike of such a nature as is implied by them  must be a dislike arising from something resembling a natural aversion  whether just or not  is little to the purpose   I was not aware of that  replied he  But I hope yours to me is not such a one   Excuse me  cousin  said I  turning to Mrs  Reeves  But I believe I have talked away the tea time   I think not of tea  said she   Hang tea  said Mr  Reeves   The devil fly away with the tea kettle  said Sir Hargrave  let it not have entrance here  till I have said what I have further to say  And let me tell you    118 Miss Byron  that tho  you may not have a dying lover  you shall have a resolute one  For I will not cease pursuing you till you are mine  or till you are the wife of some other man   He spoke this fiercely  and even rudely  I was disgusted as much at his manner  as with his words   I cannot  replied I  but congratulate myself on one felicity  since I have been in your company  Sir  and that is  That in this whole conversation   and I think it much too long  I have not one thing to reproach myself with  or be sorry for   Your servant  madam  bowing —But I am of the contrary opinion  By heaven  madam  with anger  and an air of insolence  I think you have pride  madam —  Pride  Sir   Cruelty —  Cruelty  Sir —  Ingratitude  madam   I thought it was staying to be insulted  All that Sir John Allestree had said of him came into my head   Hold  Sir   for he seemed to be going on  Pride  Cruelty  Ingratitude  are crimes black enough  If you think I am guilty of them  excuse me that I retire for the benefit of recollection —And  making a low courtesy  I withdrew in haste  He besought me to return  and followed me to the stairs foot   He shewed his pride  and his ill nature too  before my cousins  when I was gone  He bit his lip  He walked about the room  then sitting down  he lamented  defended  accused  and re defended himself  and yet besought their interest with me   He was greatly disturbed  he owned  that with such honourable intetnions  with so much POWER to make me happy  and such a WILL to do so  he should be refused  and this without my assigning one reason for it   And my cousins  to whom he again referred on that head  answering him  that they believed me disengaged in my affections—D—him  he said  if he could account then for my behaviour to him     119 He  however  threatned Mr  Orme  Who  if any  he said  was the man I favoured  I had acknowleged  that neither Greville nor Fenwick were  My proud repulse had stung him  he owned  He begged  that they would send for me down in their names   They liked not the humour he seemed to be in well enough to comply with his request  and he sent up in his own name   But I returned my compliments  I was busy in writing  And so I was—to you  my Lucy   I hoped Sir Hargrave  and my cousins  would excuse me  I put them in  to soften my refusal   This still more displeased
