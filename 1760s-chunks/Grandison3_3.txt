the best man in it  Only say  you are not angry with me  Say that you can and do forgive me   Forgive you  my Charlotte I—I do  But can you say  that you came not honestly by that letter  and yet forgive yourself  But  my dear Miss Grandison  instantly replace it  and do you watch over me  like a true friend  if in a future hour of weakness you should find me desirous to know any of the contents of a paper so naughtily come at  I own that I had like to have been overcome  And if I had  all the information it would have given me  could never have recompensed me for what I should have suffered in my own opinion  when I reflected on the means by which I had obtained it   Superior creature  how you shame me  I will replace the letter  And I promise you  that if I cannot forget the contents of it myself  and yet they are glorious to my brother  I will never mention any of them to you  unless the letter be fairly communicated to you  and to us all   I threw my arms about her neck  She fervently returned the sisterly embrace  We separated  she retiring at one door  in order to go up to replace the letter  I at the other  to re consider all that had passed on the occasion  And I hope I shall love her the better for taking so kindly a behaviour so contrary to what her own had been     7 Well  but  don t you congratulate me  my dear  on my escape from my curiosity  I am sure my grandmamma  and my aunt  will be pleased with their girl  Yet it was an hard struggle  I own  In the suspense I am in  a very hard struggle  But tho  wishes will play about my heart  that I knew such of the contents as it might concern me to know  yet I am infinitely better pleased that I yielded not to the temptation  than I should have been  if I had  And then  methinks  my pride is gratified in the superiority this lady ascribes to me over herself  whom so lately I thought greatly my superior   Yet what merit have I in this  Since if I had considered only rules of policy  I should have been utterly wrong  had I yielded to the temptation  For what use could I have made of any knowlege I might have obtained by this means  If any proposal is to be made me  of what nature soever  it must  in that case  have appeared to be quite new to me  And what an affectation must that have occasioned  what dissimulation  in your Harriet —And how would a creature  educated as I have been  have behaved under such trials as might have arisen from a knowledge so faultily obtained   And had I been discovered  had I given cause of suspicion  either to Dr  Bartlett  or Sir Charles  I should have appeared as the principal in the fact  It would have been mean to accuse Miss Grandison  as the tempter  in a temptation yielded to with my eyes open  And should I not have cast a slur upon that curiosity which Dr  Barlett before had not refused to gratify  as well as shut myself out from all future communications and confidence   It is very possible  besides  that  unused as I have been to artifice and disguise  I should have betrayed myself  especially had I found any of the contents of the letter very affecting   Thus you see  Lucy  that policy  as well as rectitude   8 of manners  justify me  And in this particular I am an happy girl   Miss Grandison has just now told her sister what passed between us  Lady L  says  she would not have been Miss Grandison  in taking the letter  by what means soever come at  for how  said she  did I know what secrets there might be in it  before I read it  But I think verily  when it had been got at  and offered me  I could not have been Miss Byron   And she threw her arms about me  and hugged me to her  Dear creature  said she  you must be Lady Grandison—Must  said Miss Grandison  She shall   Who  Lucy  whether that may ever come to pass  or not  would not  on reflection  thus approved by both sisters  rejoice that she conquered her curiosity  and acted as she did   Miss Grandison talked to Lady L  of its being likely that her brother would go to Bologna  Of a visit he is soon to make to Grandison hall  and she to go with him  Of his going to Paris  in order to settle some matters relating to the Will of his late friend Mr  Danby—  Well  Lucy  my time in town is hastening to its period  Why am I not reminded  that my three allotted months are near expired  Will you receive the poor girl  who perhaps will not be able to carry down with her the heart she brought up
