 I observed besides some reduced officers dancing attendance to Captain Chinchilla s tune  and catching cold in fishing for a pension  which was never likely to pay the doctor for their cure  If the duke did not satisfy their wants  he put a pleasant face upon their importunities  and it struck me that he returned a civil answer to all applicants   We waited patiently till the routine of ceremony was despatched  Then said Don Diego  My lord  this is Gil Blas de Santillane  the young man appointed by your excellency to succeed Don Valerio  The duke now took more particular notice of me  saying obligingly  that I had already earned my promotion by my services  He then took me to a private conference in his closet  or rather to an examination  My birth  parentage  and course of life were the objects of his inquiry  nor would he be satisfied without the particulars  and those in the spirit of sincerity  What a career to run over before a patron  Yet it was impossible to lie  in the presence of a prime minister  On the other hand  my vanity was concerned in suppressing so many circumstances  that there was no venturing on an unqualified confession  What cunning scene had Roscius then to act  A little painting and tattooing might decently be employed to disguise the nakedness of truth  and spare her unsophisticated blushes  But he had studied her complexion  as well as the beauties of her natural form  Monsieur de Santillane  said he with a smile on the close of my narrative  I perceive that hitherto you have had your principles to choose  My lord  answered I  colouring up to the eyes  your excellency enjoined me to deal sincerely  and I have complied with your orders  I take your doing so in good part  replied he  It is all very well  my good fellow  you have escaped from the snares of this wicked world more by luck than management  it is wonderful that bad example should not have corrupted you irreparably  There are many men of strict virtue and exemplary piety  who would have turned out the greatest rogues in existence  if their destinies had exposed them to but half your trials   Friend Santillane  continued the minister  ponder no longer on the past  consider yourself as to the very bone and marrow the king s  live henceforth but for his service  Come this way  I will instruct you in the nature of your business  He carried me into a little closet adjoining his own  which contained a score of thick folio registers  This is your workshop  said he  All these registers compose an alphabetical peerage  giving the heraldry and history of all the nobility and gentry in the several kingdoms and principalities of the Spanish monarchy  In these volumes are recorded the services rendered to the state by the present possessors and their ancestors  descending even to the personal animosities and rencounters of the individuals and their houses  Their fortunes  their manners  in a word  all the pros and cons of their character are set down according to the letter of ministerial scrutiny  so that they no sooner enter on the list of court candidates  that my eye catches up the very chapter and verse of their pretensions  To furnish this necessary information  I have pensioned scouts everywhere on the look out  who send me private notices of their discoveries  but as these documents are for the most part drawn up in a gossiping and provincial style  they require to be translated into gentlemanly language  or the king would not be able to support the perusal of the registers  This task demands the pen of a polite and perspicuous writer  I doubt not but you will justify your claim to the appointment   After this introduction  he put a memorial into my hand  taken from a large portfolio full of papers  and then withdrew from my closet  that my first specimen might be manufactured in all the freedom of solitude  I read the memorial  which was not only stuffed with a most uncouth jargon  but breathed a brimstone spirit of rancour and personal revenge  This was most foul  strange  and unnatural  for the homily was written by a monk  He hacked and hewed a Catalan family of some note most unmercifully  with what reason or truth  it must be reserved for a more penetrating inquirer to decide  It read for all the world like an infamous libel  and I had some scruples about becoming the publisher of the calumny  nevertheless  young as I was at court  I plunged head foremost  at the risk of sinking and destroying his reverence s soul  The wickedness  if there was any  would be put down to his running account with the recording angel  I therefore had nothing to do but to vilify  in the purest Spanish phraseology  some two or three generations of honest men and loyal subjects   I had already blackened four or five pages  when the duke  impatient to know how I got on  came back and said    Santillane  shew me what you have done  I am curious to see it  At the same time  casting his eye over the transcript  he read the beginning with much attention  It seemed to please him
