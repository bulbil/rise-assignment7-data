kingdom of England  and three hundred for Ireland      By this mean concession John secured his crown from a foreign invasion  but became effectually contemptible in the eyes of his people  still  however  he was not hated by his subjects  their hatred only was wanting to sink him into complete wretchedness  After being exposed to so many disgraceful humiliations  he now thought  at the expence of his honour  to spend the remaining years of his life in tranquillity  But  in proportion as he lost the esteem of the English  he lost their affections also  The former Monarchs supported their power by a nice opposition of the clergy and the barons  when they intended to humble the nobility  they granted new privileges to the church  when they desired to lessen the power of the clergy  they gave greater force to the temporal interests  John was ignorant of the manner of conducting this opposition  he had offended the clergy  and increased their power  without making them his friends  he had it only left now to offend his barons  to render himself obnoxious to every order of people  His former pusillanimity soon gave this powerful body hopes of expecting a renewal of those powers  of which they had been deprived in the preceding reign  They demanded  therefore  the re establishment of their ancient privileges  and John believed himself authorised to refuse them  This created new dissensions  the King  with a strange perverseness  in turn demanded their assistance for the recovery of his lost dominions on the continent  and they refused to follow him  Their refusal was soon followed by more open acts of hostility  they formed a confederacy  and  at an appointed   97 meeting  forced the King to grant all their demands  and sign that charter by which the English are said to hold their liberties at this day   The barons and the clergy by this seemed the only governors of the kingdom  the commonalty had no share in the legislature  they were passed away  with the lands on which they were born  by their haughty possessors  they were reckoned only as the sheep  oxen  and other moveable possessions  which were upon the estate  The guardian of an heir was to preserve the lands entire  and  to use the words of the Magna Charta    sine destructione et vasto hominum vel rerum   without destruction or waste of the men or the things upon it  The King  the Barons  and the clergy  were all  in reality  enemies to public liberty  Their party were so many factions in the nation  subversive of the rights of mankind  how they  in turn  helped to establish liberty  you shall see in my future correspondence     This charter was  in fact  giving the barons a definitive judgment upon whatsoever they thought proper to represent as a grievance  they were to prefer their complaints to the King  and he was  in forty days  to give them satisfaction  or they were legally impowered to command it  This was an infringement of the prerogative  which he complied with through fear  and  as soon as he was at liberty  he retracted all he had agreed to  he loudly complained of the force with which it had been exacted  and he demanded justice from the Pope  his new master   The Pope  who had lately excommunicated the King  now excommunicated the barons  the barons  exasperated  did exactly what the Pope had formerly done upon a like occasion  they offered   98 the crown of England to France  Philip  ever ready to profit by these commotions  accepted their offer with joy  but  fearing the Pope s displeasure if he assumed a title to what was now considered as a patrimony of the Holy See  prevailed upon the barons to elect his son Lewis  To this league of the barons with France the city of London lent its assistance  We should be careful to observe every beginning of power among the commons of England  and this seems to be one of the most obvious instances  This noble city was the first that freed itself from foeudal government  and ventured to follow leaders of its own appointment  in short it may  at this period  be looked upon as a little republic  fighting between the powers of aristocracy  represented in the barons  and of despotism  assumed by the King   In the mean time  the army of Lewis  which was called over to the assistance of the barons  committed strange disorders  while  on the other hand  that of John  which  like the former  was mostly composed of foreigners  was still more insolent and audacious  Never was England in a more deplorable condition  she had two armies of hungry foreigners in her bowels  ravaging the country in a merciless manner  and threatening ruin whichsoever proved victorious  John was  at length  deposed by his barons  and Lewis solemnly crowned at London  The new Monarch then first thought of having the Pope s sanction to his claim  The Pope debated in council the justice of a cause  which scarcely deserved a moment s hesitation  while John led his harrassed army from city to city  distrusting even his most faithful
