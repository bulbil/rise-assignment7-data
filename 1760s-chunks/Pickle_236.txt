waited upon the lord chief  justice  to whom I complained of the usage I had received from my lord   whose temper was teasing  tiresome  and intolerably capricious  Indeed   his behaviour was a strange compound of madness and folly  seasoned  with a small proportion of sense  No wonder then  that I  who am hot  and hasty  should be wretched  under the persecution of such a perverse  humourist  who used to terrify me  and scold at me the whole night  without intermission  and shake my pillow from time to time  that  I might not sleep  while he tormented me with his disagreeable  expostulations  I have been often frightened almost out of my senses  at  seeing him convulsed with the most unreasonable passion  and chagrined  to the highest degree of disgust  to find  by repeated observation  his  disposition so preposterous  that his satisfaction and displeasure never  depended upon the cause he had to be satisfied or disobliged  but  on  the contrary  when he had most reason to be pleased  he was always most  discontented  and very often in good humour when he had reason enough  for vexation    While I lived in Poland street  I was engaged with lawyers  and so  often visited by my father  that I could not dedicate my whole time as  usual to my lover  nor was it convenient that he should be seen in my  company  he therefore took a small house at Camberwell  whither I went  as often as I had an opportunity  and maintained the correspondence with  such eagerness and industry  that  although I was six months gone  with child  I have often  by myself  set out for his habitation  in a  hackney coach  at eleven o clock at night  and returned by six in the  morning  that I might be in my own bed when my father came to see  me  for I concealed my amour  as well as the effects of it  from his  knowledge  and frequently took water from the bridge  that my motions  might not be discovered  Nothing but the most passionate love could have  supported my spirits under such vicissitudes of fatigue  or enabled my  admirer to spend whole days by himself in such a solitary retirement    By this time  my lord was arrived in England  and employed in  discovering the place of my retreat  so that I lived in continual alarm   and provided myself with a speaking trumpet  which stood by my bedside   to be used in calling for assistance  in case my pursuer should make an  attack upon my lodgings    This situation being extremely uncomfortable  I had no sooner begun my  process against him  than I put myself entirely under the protection of  Mr  S    who conducted me to the house of a friend of his who lived in  the country  where I was secure from the attempts of my husband  The    6 22 15  3 45 PM   world had now given me up  and I had renounced the world with the most  perfect resignation  I weighed in my breast what I should lose in point  of character  with what I suffered in my peace at home  and found   that my reputation was not to be preserved  except at the expense of  my quiet  for his lordship was not disposed to make me easy  had I been  ever so discreet  I therefore determined to give up a few ceremonial  visits  and empty professions  for the more substantial enjoyments of  life    We passed our time very agreeably in various amusements with this  friend of Mr  S    until the term of my reckoning was almost expired   then returned to London  and took lodgings in Southampton street  where  I began to make the preparations for the approaching occasion  Here I  proposed to live with the utmost circumspection  I disguised my name   saw nobody but my lawyer and lover  and never approached the window lest  I should be discovered by accident  Notwithstanding these precautions   my French maid  whom I had sent for some of my clothes  was dogged in  her return  and next morning my lord took my lodgings by storm  Had he  given the assault in his person only  I make no doubt but he would have  suffered a repulse from the opposition of the Liegeoise  who made all  the resistance in her power  but was obliged to give way to superior  numbers  I was at that time abed  and hearing an unusual noise below   rang my bell  in order to know the cause of such disturbance  I drew my  curtain at the same time  and who should I see entering my chamber  but his lordship  attended by a constable  and the footman who had  discovered my retreat    Such an unexpected visit could not fail to affect me with surprise  and consternation  However  I summoned all my fortitude to my aid  and  perceiving the fellows were about to open my window shutters
