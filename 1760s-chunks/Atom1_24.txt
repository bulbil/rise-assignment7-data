scourge of human nature  and the inveterate enemy of Japan  To day  they glorified him as an unblemished hero  the protector of good faith  the mirror of honesty  the pattern of every virtue  a saint in piety  a devout votary to the White Horse  a friend to mankind  the fast ally and the firmest prop of the Japonese empire      130 The farm of Yesso  which they had so long execrated as a putrid and painful excrescence upon the breech of their country  which would never be quiet until this cursed wart was either exterminated or taken away  they now fondled as a favourite mole  nay  and cherished as the apple of their eye  One would have imagined that all the inconsistencies and absurdities which characterise the Japonese nation  had taken their turns to reign  just as the interest of Taycho s ambition required  When it was necessary for him to establish new principles  at that very instant their levity prompted them to renounce their former maxims  Just as he had occasion to fascinate their senses  the daemon of caprice instigated them to shut their eyes  and hold out their necks  that they might be led by the nose  At the very nick of time when he adopted the cause of Brut an tiffi  in diametrical    131 opposition to all his former professions  the spirit of whim and singularity disposed them to kick against the shins of common sense  deny the light of day at noon  and receive in their bosoms as a dove  the man before whom they had shunned as a serpent  Thus every thing concurred to establish for orator Taycho  a despotism of popularity  and that not planned by reason  or raised by art  but founded on fatality and finished by accident  Quos Jupiter vult perdere priùs dementat   Brut an tiffi being so amply gratified by the Japonese for his promise of forbearance with respect to the farm of Yesso  and determined  at all events  to make some new acquisition  turned his eyes upon the domains of Pol hassan akousti  another of his neighbours  who had formed a most beautiful colony in this part of Tartary  and rushed upon it at a minute s warning  His    132 resolution in this respect was so suddenly taken and quickly executed  that he had not yet formed any excuse for this outrage  in order to save appearances  Without giving himself the trouble to invent a pretence  he drove old Pol hassan akousti out of his residence  compelled the domestics of that prince to enter among his own banditti  plundered his house  seized the archives of his family  threatened to shoot the antient gentlewoman his wife  exacted heavy contribution from the tenants  then dispersed a manifesto in which he declared himself the best friend of the said Akousti and his spouse  assuring him he would take care of his estate as a precious deposit to be restored to him in due season  In the mean time  he thought proper to sequester the rents  that they might not enable Pol hassan to take any measures that should conduce to his own prejudice  As for    133 the articles of meat  drink  clothing  and lodging  for him and his wife and a large family of small children  he had nothing to do but depend upon Providence  until the present troubles should be appeased  His behaviour on this occasion  Peacock  puts me in mind of the Spaniard whom Philip II  employed to assassinate his own son Don Carlos  This compassionate Castilian  when the prince began to deplore his fate  twirled his mustachio  pronouncing with great gravity these words of comfort     Calla  calla  Senor  todo que se haze es por su bien     I beg your highness won t make any noise  this is all for your own good    or the politeness of Gibbet in the play called the Beaux Stratagem  who says to Mrs  Sullen    Your jewels  Madam  if you please—don t be under any uneasiness  Madam—if you make any noise  I shall blow your brains out—I have a particular regard for the ladies  Madam         134 But the possession of Pol hassan s demesnes was not the ultimate aim of Brut an tiffi  He had an eye to a fair and fertile province belonging to a Tartar princess of the house of Ostrog  He saw himself at the head of a numerous banditti trained to war  fleshed in carnage  and eager for rapine  his coffers were filled with the spoils he had gathered in his former freebooting expeditions  and the incredible sums payed him as an annual tribute from Japan  added to his other advantages  rendered him one of the most formidable chiefs in all Tartary  Thus elated with the consciousness of his own strength  he resolved to make a sudden irruption into the dominions of Ostrog  at a season of the year when that house could not avail itself of the alliances they had formed with other powers  and he did not doubt but that  in a few weeks  he should be able to subdue the whole    135 country belonging to the Amazonian princess  But I can tell thee  Peacock  his views extended even farther than the conquest of the
