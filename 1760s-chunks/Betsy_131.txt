her  I loaded her with the most   inveterate reproaches I could think of  Indeed  there required not much   study for my doing so  for I heartily hated her  After some time passed   in beseechings on her side  and railings on mine  one of the pretended   constables took me aside  as if to persuade me to more moderation  while   the other talked to her  and insinuated as if a sum of money might   compromise the matter  My husband also told her  that though he detested   me for what I had done  yet he wished her ladyship  for her own sake    would think of some way to pacify me   For   said he   a wife in these   cases has great power         The terror she was in of appearing before a civil magistrate  and of   being liable to suffer that punishment the law inflicts upon an   adultress  and consequently the loss of all her hopes of a marriage with   you  Sir  made her readily agree to do any thing I should require  I   seemed quite averse for a good while to listen to any terms of   accommodation  but at length affected to be overcome by the persuasions   of the men I brought with me  and her promise of allowing us a very   handsome support as soon as she became your wife  and should have it in   her power  This I made slight on  and told her  that I would not depend   upon her promise for any thing  It was then proposed  that she should   give a bond for a large sum of money to Mr  Marplus   That you may do   with safety   said he to her   as I shall have it in my own hands  and    you may be assured  will never put it in force to your prejudice         In fine  Sir   continued Mrs  Marplus   she agreed to this proposal    and  as it was then too late for the execution of what she had promised    on her making a solemn vow to fulfil it punctually the next day  I told   her she was at liberty to go home that night  but that I would not   withdraw the warrant I pretended to have taken out against her till all   was over        She was  indeed  too much rejoiced at the expectation of getting off   from the imaginary prosecution  to think of breaking her word  my wicked   husband  however  had the success of his design more greatly at heart   than to give her any long time for reflection  Accordingly  we went   pretty early the next morning to her lodgings  accompanied by one of   those who had assumed the character of constable  and who in reality had   formerly served the parish where he still lives in that capacity  and a   lawyer  previously directed to fill up the bond in the strongest and   most binding terms that words could form  There was not the least demur   or objection  on the part of her ladyship  she signed her name  and Mrs    Prinks  her woman  and the man we brought with us  set their hands as   witnesses        You see  Sir   pursued she   the drift of this contrivance  Lady   Mellasin was the instrument  but it was you that was ordained to suffer    there was no fixed sum or sums stipulated for the support we were to   receive from her  but Marplus was so continually draining her purse    that I have often been amazed by what arts she imposed on you to   replenish it  Whenever she began to make any excuse for not complying   with his demands  he presently threatened her with putting the bond in   force against you  by which means he extorted from her almost whatever   he required        One time in particular  he pretended to be under an arrest for three   hundred pounds  and she not having so much money by her  was obliged to   send Mrs  Prinks with her diamond necklace  to the pawnbroker s to make   it up  yet  would you believe it  Sir  notwithstanding all he got from   her ladyship  he kept me poor and mean  as you see  would not let me   have a servant  but made me wash his linen  and do all his drudgery    while he strutted about the town like a fine fellow  with his toupee   wig  and laced waistcoat  and  if I made the least complaint  would tell   me  in derision  that  as I had no children  I had nothing else to do   but to wait upon him  I bore all this  however
