   I could not with all my heart  So banish from your mind all doubt and   uneasiness  let a generous confidence in me take place  and let me see   it does  by your cheerfulness in this day s solemn business  and then I   will love you for ever       May God Almighty  sir  said I  reward all your goodness to me   That is   all I can say  But  oh  how kind it is in you  to supply the want of the   presence and comfortings of a dear mother  of a loving sister  or of the   kind companions of my own sex  which most maidens have  to soothe their   anxieties on the so near approach of so awful a solemnity   You  sir    are all these tender relations in one to me  Your condescensions and   kindness shall  if possible  embolden me to look up to you without   that sweet terror  that must confound poor bashful maidens  on such an   occasion  when they are surrendered up to a more doubtful happiness  and   to half strange men  whose good faith  and good usage of them  must be   less experienced  and is all involved in the dark bosom of futurity  and   only to be proved by the event       This  my dear Pamela  said he  is most kindly said  It shews me that you   enter gratefully into my intention  For I would  by my conduct  supply   all these dear relations to you  and I voluntarily promise  from my   heart  to you  what I think I could not  with such assured resolutions   of performance  to the highest born lady in the kingdom  For let me tell   my sweet girl  that  after having been long tossed by the boisterous   winds of a more culpable passion  I have now conquered it  and am not   so much the victim of your beauty  all charming as you are  as of your   virtue  and therefore may more boldly promise for myself  having so   stable a foundation for my affection  which  should this outward beauty   fail  will increase with your virtue  and shine forth the brighter    as that is more illustriously displayed by the augmented opportunities   which the condition you are now entering into will afford you   O the   dear charming man  how nobly  how encouragingly kind  was all this       I could not suitably express myself  And he said  I see my girl is at a   loss for words  I doubt not your kind acceptance of my declarations  And   when I have acted too much the part of a libertine formerly  for you   to look back without some anxiety  I ought not  being now happily   convicted  to say less   But why loses my girl her time  I will now only   add  that I hope for many happy years to make good  by my conduct  what   so willingly flows from my lips       He kissed me again  and said  But  whatever you do  Pamela  be cheerful    for else  may be  of the small company we shall have  some one  not   knowing how to account for your too nice modesty  will think there is   some other person in the world  whose addresses would be still more   agreeable to you       This he said with an air of sweetness and pleasantry  but it alarmed   me exceedingly  and made me resolve to appear as calm and cheerful as   possible  For this was  indeed  a most affecting expression  and enough   to make me  if any thing can  behave as I ought  and to force my idle   fears to give way to hopes so much better grounded   And I began almost    on this occasion  to wish Mr  Williams were not to marry me  lest I   should behave like a fool  and so be liable to an imputation  which I   should be most unworthy  if I deserved       So I set about dressing me instantly  and he sent Mrs  Jewkes to assist   me  But I am never long a dressing  when I set about it  and my master   has now given me a hint  that will  for half an hour more  at least    keep my spirits in a brisk circulation  Yet it concerns me a little too    lest he should have any the least shadow of a doubt  that I am not  mind   and person  entirely his       And so being now ready  and not called to breakfast  I sat down and   wrote thus far       I might have mentioned
