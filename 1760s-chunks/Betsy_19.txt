them may   so much engross the mind as to take it off from other objects  which   ought to have their share in it  Besides   continued she   there are but   too frequent proofs that an innate principle of virtue is not always a   sufficient guard against the many snares laid for it  under the shew of   innocent pleasures  by wicked and designing persons of both sexes  nor   can it be esteemed prudence to run one s self into dangers merely to   shew our strength in overcoming them  nor  perhaps  would even the   victory turn always to our glory  the world is censorious  and seldom   ready to put the best construction on things  so that reputation may   suffer  though virtue triumphs        Miss Betsy listened to all this with a good deal of attention  the   impudent attempt Gayland had made on her came fresh into her mind  and   made this lady s remonstrances sink the deeper into it  The power of   reflection being a little awakened in her  some freedoms also  not   altogether consistent with strict modesty  which others had offered to   her  convinced her of the error of maintaining too little reserve  she   thanked her kind adviser  and promised to observe the precepts she had   given       Lady Trusty  finding this good effect of what she had said  ventured to   proceed so far as to give some hints that the conduct of Miss Flora had   been far from blameless   And therefore   pursued she   I should be   glad  methinks  to see you separated from that young lady  though it   were but for a small time   and then gave her to understand how great a   pleasure it would be to her to get her down with her to L    e  if it   could be any way contrived that she should go without Miss Flora        As I have been so long from home   said she   I know I shall have all   the gentry round the country to welcome me at my return  and if you   should find the company less polite than those you leave behind  it will   at least diversify the scene  and render the entertainments of London   new to you a second time  when you come back        Miss Betsy found in herself a strong inclination to comply with this   proposal  and told Lady Trusty  she should think herself happy in   passing the whole summer with her  and as to Miss Flora  the same offer   might be made to her without any danger of her accepting it   I am not   of your opinion   said the other   the girl has no fortune  but what Mr    Goodman shall be pleased to give her  which cannot be very considerable    as he has a nephew in the East Indies whom he is extremely fond of  and   will make his heir  Lady Mellasin would  therefore  catch at the   opportunity of sending her daughter to a place where there are so many   gentlemen of estates  among whom she might have a better chance for   getting a husband than she can have in London  where her character would   scarce entitle her to such a hope  I will  however   pursued she   run   the risque  and chuse rather to have a guest whose company I do not so   well approve of  than be deprived of one I so much value        Miss Betsy testified the sense she had of her ladyship s goodness in the   most grateful and obliging terms  and Lady Mellasin and Miss Flora   coming home soon after  Lady Trusty said she was come on purpose to ask   permission for Miss Flora and Miss Betsy to pass two or three months   with her down in L    e       Lady Mellasin  as the other had imagined  seemed extremely pleased with   the invitation  and told her  she did her daughter a great deal of   honour  and she would take care things should be prepared for both the   young ladies to attend her on her setting out  Lady Trusty then told her   she had fixed the day for it  which was about a fortnight after this   conversation  and some other matters relating to the journey being   regulated  took her leave  highly pleased with the thoughts of getting   Miss Betsy to a place  where she should have an opportunity of using her   utmost endeavours to improve the good she found in her disposition  and   of weaning her  by degrees  from any ill habits she might have   contracted in that Babel of mixed company she was accustomed to at Lady   Mellasin s
