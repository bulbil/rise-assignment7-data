and peeping in    she gave a loud shriek  and drew suddenly back again  We then   entered together  and as I was prepared  by my knowledge of the   lady s virtue  for some dreadful catastrophe  I was the less shocked   and concerned at what I beheld      The floor was half covered with blood  My master lay in   the midst  already stiif and cold  and part of the fatal scissors   was still within the wound  We all stood for some time in silent   astonishment  and then  with joint tears  lamented his fate  At   length  says Deborah  I would gladly see if my bloody mistress has   taken care to provide for her journey  So saying  she stooped  and    taking his lordship s purse from his pocket  she counted down two   hundred and ninety seven guineas  She then took out his fine   gold repeater  and next his gold snuff box  and last  took his large   diamond ring from his finger      Come  my lads  says Deborah  my lord s silence gives consent    and we can no more be said to rob this piece of earth  than the   people in the mines who gather gold from clay  If my mistress is         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  105     ever taken she must suffer death for the murder   and they can do   no more to her for the robbery  and twenty such matters together    if you will therefore be of my council  we will comfort ourselves   as we ought for this melancholy business  and share a prize   between us that no one else had a right to  and that nobody   will want      Kobert did not hesitate long  In a little time he appeared more   sanguine than Deborah herself   and they urged me to join them bj   a number of interesting and cajoling instances  I was dispirited   I was affrighted   I saw a scene of blood and slaughter before me     and I doubted not that  if I refused them  I should be made the   second victim to their resentment and avarice  I pretended to   value the watch at an unmeasurable rate  and that I should be   greatly the gainer if I got it for my dividend  Mrs  Deborah then   went to her mistress s drawers  and taking out half a dozen silver   spoons  a tea equipage  and several articles in lace and cambrics    she fairly laid them before us   and observed at the same time that   her mistress would not call in a hurry to demand them  and that   the landlord would take all if we did not come in for snacks  She   then made a new division   she compelled me further to accept of   the snuff box  She gave the purse of gold entire to Kobert  and   contented herself with the diamond ring  some gold medals  my   lord s handkerchief  and the plunder of her mistress      While Mr  Longfield was in this part of his testimony  the fore    man of the jury cried out Stay  sir   Good people  pray stop those   witnesses there I see they are making off  And now do us the   favour to search their pockets  and to put what ye find into two   hats  severally  and to hand them up to us      This being accordingly done  Mr  Longfield  says the foreman    be pleased now to proceed      I have little further to say  replied Mr  Longfield  Here is my   noble master s watch  and here is his snuff box  They are un    doubtedly known to many honourable persons at present in court     and I bless my God that I have been enabled to preserve them    for the vindication of innocence  and the illustration of virtue  at   this day      Here Mr  Longfield paused   and the judge cried put Clerk    hand me up the examination of this prevaricator  This his lord    ship perused with a countenance and scrutiny apparently inveterate     but finding that the deponent had not touched upon the robbery    and that neither the words feloniously nor of malice were inserted   in that part that referred to the death of Lord Stivers  he tore the   examination into twenty pieces  Come  come  he cried again  I have   not yet done with this same Longfield  I perceive perfectly well   how he came by the watch and snuff box  The transference was   not difficult from the prisoner who stole them to this her con    federate  But tell us  my wonderfully honest friend  how came
