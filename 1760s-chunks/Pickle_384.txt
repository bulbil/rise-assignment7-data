supercilious neglect  for he could not bear the thought of being so  notoriously obliged by any person upon earth  With this view he quitted  the lieutenant  upon some slight pretence  after having told him  that  he could not have the pleasure of his company at dinner  because he was  engaged with a particular club of his fellow prisoners   Jack was a stranger to the punctilios of behaviour  and therefore did  not take this declaration amiss  but had immediate recourse to the  advice of his counsellor  Mr  Pipes  who proposed  that he should go to  the coffee house and kitchen  and give the people to understand that he  would pay for all such liquor and provisions as Mr  Pickle should order  to be sent to his lodging  This expedient was immediately practised  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   as there was no credit in the place  Hatchway deposited a sum of money   by way of security  to the cook and the vintner  intimating  that  there was a necessity for taking that method of befriending his cousin  Peregrine  who was subject to strange whims  that rendered it impossible  to serve him any other way   In consequence of these insinuations  it was that same day rumoured  about the Fleet  that Mr  Pickle was an unhappy gentleman disordered in  his understanding  and that the lieutenant was his near relation  who  had subjected himself to the inconvenience of living in a jail  with  the sole view of keeping a strict eye over his conduct  This report   however  did not reach the ears of our hero till the next day  when he  sent one of the runners of the Fleet  who attended him  to bespeak and  pay for a couple of pullets  and something else for dinner  to which  he had already invited his friend Hatchway  in hope of being able to  persuade him to retire into the country  after he had undergone a  whole day s mortification in the place  The messenger returned with  an assurance  that the dinner should be made ready according to his  directions  and restored the money  observing  that his kinsman had paid  for what was bespoke   Peregrine was equally surprised and disgusted at this information  and  resolved to chide the lieutenant severely for his unseasonable treat   which he considered as a thing repugnant to his reputation  Meanwhile   he despatched his attendant for wine to the coffee house  and finding  his credit bolstered up in that place by the same means  was enraged at  the presumption of Jack s friendship  He questioned the valet about  it with such manifestation of displeasure  that the fellow  afraid of  disobliging such a good master  frankly communicated the story which was  circulated at his expense  The young gentleman was so much incensed at  this piece of intelligence  that he wrote a bitter expostulation to the  lieutenant  where he not only retracted his invitation  but declared  that he would never converse with him while he should remain within the  place   Having thus obeyed the dictates of his anger  he gave notice to the  cook  that he should not have occasion for what was ordered  Repairing  to the coffee house  he told the landlord  that whereas he understood  the stranger with the wooden leg had prepossessed him and others with  ridiculous notions  tending to bring the sanity of his intellects in  question  and  to confirm this imputation  had  under the pretence of  consanguinity  undertaken to defray his expenses  he could not help  in  justice to himself  declaring  that the same person was  in reality   the madman  who had given his keepers the slip  that  therefore  he  the  landlord  would not find his account in complying with his orders  and  encouraging him to frequent his house  and that  for his own part  he  would never enter the door  or favour him with the least trifle of his  custom  if ever he should for the future find himself anticipated in his  payments by that unhappy lunatic   The vintner was confounded at this retorted charge  and  after  much perplexity and deliberation  concluded  that both parties were  distracted  the stranger in paying a man s debts against his will  and  Pickle  in being offended at such forwardness of friendship     6 22 15  3 45 PM   CHAPTER C    These Associates commit an Assault upon Crabtree  for which they  are banished from the Fleet  Peregrine begins to feel the effects of  Confinement   Our adventurer having dined at an ordinary  and in the afternoon retired  to his own apartment  as usual  with his friend Cadwallader  Hatchway  and his associate  after they had been obliged to discuss the provision  for which they had paid  renewed their conference upon the old subject   Pipes giving his messmate to understand  that Peregrine s chief  confidant was the old deaf bachelor  whom he had seen at his lodging the  preceding day  Mr
