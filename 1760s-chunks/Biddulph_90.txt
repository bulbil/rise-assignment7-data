as fierce and inexorable     Princess Gerrardina  to put the finishing hand to his adventures and most wonderful exploits  did  his wrath being moved thereby  like an ungentle knight  bury his sword in her snow white  but savage and unrelenting breast  whereat  being stung with remorse  he afterwards kills himself ’  Would not this be a pretty conclusion of my adventures  No  no  Sir George  expect better things from thy friend  I hope my knight errantry will not end so tragically  But hasten to make my peace with that gracious creature your sister  yet why do I name her and myself in the same sentence  She cares not for me  thinks not of me  or  if she does  it is with contempt  I said this before  and I must repeat it again  but tell her  what I have done was with a view to promote her happiness  Oh  may she be happy  whatever becomes of me  I know the means I have used will make her angry  but try to make her forgive the means for the motive’s sake  Tell her as much of this wild story as you think proper  but do not let her see it in my wild rambling language  that is only fit for your own eye   Your mother  I know  is out of all patience with me  I am black enough in her opinion already  This last action  as far as she has yet known of it  will dye me ten shades deeper  but pray put in a word for me there too  I know she will say  that ‘we are not to return evil for evil  and that it is not lawful to do evil  though to bring forth good ’ But put her in mind that there are such things as pious frauds  though  by the bye  I do not take this of mine to be one of them   ‘that wicked people are to have their arts opposed by arts  and that good people have not only been permitted  but commanded to execute vengeance on sinners ’ And you may hint at the children of Israel’s being ordered to spoil the Ægyptians  though far be it from me to spoil Mrs Gerrarde of any thing she has  This however  and as many wise sayings as you can collect for the purpose  you may string together  and be sure you tell her I have hopes of reclaiming Mrs Gerrarde from her evil courses  and do not despair of prevailing on her to go into a nunnery  for Mrs Gerrarde  you must know  was bred a Roman Catholic  though she conformed on marrying Captain Gerrarde   Now put all this into decent language  fit for that very good woman’s ears  for good I must call her  notwithstanding she was inexorable to me   I am fatigued with writing so long a letter—I feel my disorder increase upon me  I will be let blood  and hope soon to give you a    good account of my undertaking  Mean while  if I am not quite reprobated  write me a line  directed under cover to Monsieur Larou  at the Post house  Boulogne  Farewel  my dear Bidulph  sick or well  I am ever your’s   O F   December 7  Was there ever such a piece of knight errantry  What a mad cap is this  Pray  my dear  are you not astonished at him  I am sure I am  I had not an opportunity to finish the copying of this very long letter  which I began yesterday morning  till very late this night  My poor mother has been so restless  and so much out of order  these two days  I desired her leave to read to her Mr Faulkland’s history  for I can call it by no other name  as I sat by her bed side  She told me  I might let her know the substance of what he said  as it would fatigue her too much to attend to so long an epistle   You would have smiled  my Cecilia  at my good parent’s amazement  when I told her Mr Faulkland’s proceedings  and his reasons for them  She would scarce give credit to it at first  and I was obliged to repeat several circumstances to her over again  And so  said she  this was all on your account  and he had really no ill design on Mrs Gerrarde  I am glad of this for Miss Burchell’s sake  and shall be impatient to tell her of it  I begged of my mother to wait a while for the result of Mr Faulkland’s adventure  before she mentioned any thing of the matter to Miss Burchell  We do not yet know  said I  how this matter may turn out  Mr Faulkland  to be sure  will make haste to communicate to my brother the issue of this odd affair  and it will then be time enough to inform the young lady   My mother unwillingly consented to postpone a discovery which she knew would be so agreeable to Miss Burchell  I applaud her humanity  but think that  good and prudent as she is  she is too unreserved in her confidences  This strange business is  I think
