herself by supplications so humiliating  and yet so unavailing  she departed to her husband  and mourned with him the loss of a situation  which under a reign like that of Philip the Fourth  was little short of sovereign power   The accounts her ladyship brought from Madrid were wormwood to the duke  Your enemies  said she  sobbing  with the Duke of Medina Coeli at their head  are loud in the king s praises for your removal  and the people triumph in your disgrace with an insolent joy  as if the cloud of adversity were to be dispelled by the breath which dissolved your administration  Madam  said my master  follow my example  suppress your discontent  we must drive before the storm  when we cannot weather it  I did think  indeed  that my favour would only be eclipsed with the lamp of life  a common illusion of ministers and favourites  who forget that they breathe but at the good pleasure of their sovereign  Was not the Duke of Lerma as much mistaken as myself  though fondly relying on his purple  as a pledge for the lasting tenure of his authority   Thus did my lord duke preach patience to the partner of his cares  while his own bosom heaved under the direst pressure of anxiety  The frequent dispatches from Don Henry  who was staying about the court to pick up information  kept him continually on the fret  Scipio was the messenger  for he was still about the person of that young nobleman  though I had relinquished my post on his marriage  Sometimes we heard of changes in the inferior departments of office  solely for the purpose of wreaking vengeance on his creatures  and filling up the vacancies with his enemies  Then Don Lewis de Haro was represented as advancing in favour  and likely to be made prime minister  But the most mortifying circumstance of all was the change in the viceroyalty of Naples  which was taken from his friend  the Duke de Medina de Las Torres  and bestowed on the High Admiral of Castile  who was his bitterest enemy  For this there was no other motive but the pleasure of giving pain to a fallen favourite   For the first three months  his lordship gave himself up in his solitude a prey to disappointment and regret  but his confessor  a holy and pious Dominican  supporting his religious zeal with manly eloquence  succeeded in pouring the balm of consolation into his soul  By continually representing to him  with apostolic energy  that his eternal salvation was now the only object worth his care  he weaned him gradually from the uses of this world  His excellency was no longer panting for news from Madrid  but learning a new and important lesson  how to die  Madame d Olivarez too  making a virtue of necessity  sought refuge for herself in the maternal guardianship of her convent  where Providence had reared up  for her edification in faith and good works  a sisterhood of holy maidens  whose spiritual discourses fed her soul  as if with manna in the wilderness  My master s peace within his own bosom advanced  as he withdrew more backward from sublunary things  The employment of his day was thus laid out  almost the whole morning was devoted to religious duties  till dinner time  and after dinner  for about two hours  he played at different games with me and some of his confidential domestics  be then generally retired alone into his closet till sunset  when he walked round his garden  or rode out into the neighbourhood either with his confessor or me   One day when I was alone with him  and was particularly struck with his apparent self complacency  I took the liberty of congratulating his lordship on his complete reconciliation to retirement  Use  however late acquired  is second nature  answered he  for though I have all my life been accustomed to the bustle of business  I assure you that I become every day more and more attached to this calm and peaceful mode of life       CH  XI     A change in his lordship for the worse  The marvellous cause  and melancholy consequences  of his dejection   HIS excellency sometimes amused himself with gardening  by way of variety  One day as I was watching his progress  he said jokingly  You see  Santillane  a fallen minister can turn gardener at last  Nature will prevail  my lord  answered I  You plant and water something useful at Loeches  while Dionysius of Syracuse whipped school boys at Corinth  My master was not displeased either with the comparison or the compliment  We were all delighted at the castle to see our protector  rising above the cloud of adversity  take pleasure in so novel a mode of life  but we soon perceived an alarming change  He became gloomy  thoughtful  and melancholy  Our parties at play were all given up  and no efforts could succeed to divert his mind  From dinner  time till evening he never left his closet  We thought the dreams of vanished greatness had returned to break his rest  and in this opinion the reverend Dominican gave the rein to his eloquence  but it could not outstrip the course of that hypochondriac malady  which triumphed over all opposition   It
