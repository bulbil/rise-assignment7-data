truly pleasing it is to indulge that hope  England may yet  experience some happy age  when wisdom  and valour  and virtue shall  conspire to bless and to exalt her  Some glorious Monarch may yet hold  her imperial sceptre  flourishing in all the pride of youth  loved and  revered by his grateful people  and dreaded by the enemies of justice  and  his kingdom  Perhaps the pious care of some illustrious parent may have  formed his mind to all princely virtues  perhaps some noble friend of  exalted merit and unsullied integrity may have aided the glorious work   Wisdom and justice may guide his councils  and valour lead forth his  victorious armies  the united voice of a happy people may bless him  and  the united force of all his enemies may sink before him  If heaven  should be thus gracious to our country  could its transcendent favour  admit of any accession —Yes  let the happiness  dissused from the  throne  be reflected back on such a Monarch  Let him be amply rewarded   in a princely consort  fitted to grace his royal seat  and relieve his  generous cares —Then let the ardent prayers of his people be accepted   Let the princely pair flourish  and very late pay the debt of nature   from heir to heir let their virtues be transmitted  and immortal be the  glories and blessings of their reign         The spirit of the good Knight was elevated and inflamed by this idea of  public selicity  the most exalted and compleat which his imagination  could form  and William seemed to forget his private grief  and to be  wrapt in the same pleasing dream  And now they approached towards the  city of Marlborough where Henry still held his court  The distant view  of this royal seat raised a violent agitation in the breast of  Salisbury  He was now on the point of breaking from his obscurity  and  once more shining forth in his native sphere  and he selt all the  emotion of an high and noble mind  impatient of wrongs  ready to urge  them boldly and resolutely to seek redress  He entered the city  when  suddenly his spirit was still farther agitated by a strange and  unexpected encounter  A small  but gallant  troop approached him  headed  by a youth of noble port  Their leader had already fixed his eyes upon  him  with marks of wonder  and  stoping  as if deprived of all power of  motion  pronounced the name of Salisbury  William came forward with  courtous demeanour  attentively surveying the stranger  who  at once ended his suspence  yet encreased his wonder  by declaring  himself the young Lord of Poictiers  that Chauvigny whom his generosity  had restored to an injurious father  A sudden exclamation of surprize  burst from the Earl  and an interval of silence ensued  at length he was  enabled to exclaim —        Good heavens  the son of the oppressor and murderer of my friend —And in  England —The father too  perhaps  is ready to insuit our wrongs  and  boast of his perfidious cruelty  —With his ashes  replied the youth    let his errors also lie buried  Dost thou love the good Les Roches  He  is my friend and father  extend thy love to me  and say  bless me with  the happy tidings  that the fair Jacqueline hath escaped the storm of  contention and misfortune  and lives in sasety  —Would to heaven    cried the Earl   that her father were now in England  to embrace and  bless her  to be witness of her noble nature  and to thank the faints  for her preservation         —The young Lord could no longer restrain his impatient ardour  they had  both alighted  and he now rushed on Earl William  and clung round his  neck  with all the extravagance of joy   What tho   said he       the brave Les Roches be still pursued by the severity of fortune  he may  be rescued  he may be yet restored to honour and happiness  Lord  William will not deny his assistance  he will aid me with his power   whilst I labour to restore him         —      Now  cried the Earl  I am indeed thy friend — But we are at the English  court  Here must I make a trial of my power  If the name of Salisbury be  not forgotten  if a few months of obscurity have not totally effaced the  remembrance of my birth  my actions  and my services  I shall yet obtain  redress of my private wrongs  and  if he still survives  I shall  relieve my friend         Thus saying  he rushed forward  with an aspect of Fiery resentment and  indignation  Chauvigny turned back with his followers  and attended him   expecting some important discovery  some explanation of what the Earl  had hastily and obscurely hinted  They
