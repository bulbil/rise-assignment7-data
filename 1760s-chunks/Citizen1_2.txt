a gloomy solemnity in the houses  the streets and the inhabitants  none of that beautiful gilding which makes a principal ornament in Chinese architecture  The streets of Nankin are sometimes strewed with gold leaf  very different are those of London  in the midst of their pavements  a great lazy puddle moves muddily along  heavy laden machines with wheels of unweildy thickness crowd up every passage  so that a stranger  instead of finding time for observation  is often happy if he has time to escape from being crushed to pieces   The houses borrow very few ornaments from architecture  their chief decoration seems to be a paltry piece of painting  hung out at their doors or windows  at once a proof of their indigence and vanity  Their vanity  in each having one of those pictures exposed to public view  and their indigence  in being unable to get them better painted In this respect  the fancy of their painters is also deplorable  Could you believe it  I have seen five black lions and three blue boars in less than a circuit of half a mile  and yet you know that animals of these colours are no where to be found except in the wild imaginations of Europe     5From these circumstances in their buildings  and from the dismal looks of the inhabitants  I am induced to conclude that the nation is actually poor  and that like the Persians  they make a splendid figure every where but at home  The proverb of Xixofou is  that a man s riches may be seen in his eyes  if we judge of the English by this rule  there is not a poorer nation under the sun   I have been here but two days  so will not be hasty in my decisions  such letters as I shall write to Fipsihi in Moscow  I beg you ll endeavour to forward with all diligence  I shall send them open  in order that you may take copies or translations  as you are equally versed in the Dutch and Chinese languages  Dear friend  think of my absence with regret  as I sincerely regret yours  even while I write  I lament our separation  Farewell   LETTER III  From Lien Chi Altangi  to the care of Fipsihi  resident in Moscow  to be forwarded by the Russian caravan to Fum Hoam  first president of the ceremonial academy at Pekin in China   THINK not  O thou guide of my youth  that absence can impair my respect  or interposing trackless desarts blot your reverend figure from my memory  The farther I travel I feel the pain of separation with stronger force  those ties that bind me to my native country  and you  are still unbroken  By every remove  I only drag a greater length of chain   Could I find aught worth transmitting from so remote a region as this to which I have wandered    6 I should gladly send it  but instead of this  you must be contented with a renewal of my former professions  and an imperfect account of a people with whom I am as yet but superficially acquainted  The remarks of a man who has been but three days in the country can only be those obvious circumstances which force themselves upon the imagination  I consider myself here as a newly created Being introduced into a new world  every object strikes with wonder and surprise  The imagination still unsated  seems the only active principle of the mind  The most trifling occurrences give pleasure  till the gloss of novelty is worn away  When I have ceased to wonder  I may possibly grow wise  I may then call the reasoning principle to my aid  and compare those objects with each other  which were before examined without reflection   Behold me then in London  gazing at the strangers  and they at me  it seems they find somewhat absurd in my figure  and had I been never from home it is possible I might find an infinite fund of ridicule in theirs  but by long travelling I am taught to laugh at folly alone  and to find nothing truly ridiculous but villainy and vice   When I had just quitted my native country  and crossed the Chinese wall  I fancied every deviation from the customs and manners of China was a departing from nature  I smiled at the blue lips and red foreheads of the Tonguese  and could hardly contain when I saw the Daures dress their heads with horns  The Ostiacs powdered with red earth  and the Calmuck beauties tricked out in all the finery of sheep skin appeared highly ridiculous  but I soon perceived that the ridicule lay not in them but in me  that I falsely condemned others   7 of absurdity  because they happened to differ from a standard originally founded in prejudice or partiality   I find no pleasure therefore in taxing the English with departing from nature in their external appearance  which is all I yet know of their character  it is possible they only endeavour to improve her simple plan  since every extravagance in dress proceeds from a desire of becoming more beautiful than nature made us  and this is so harmless a vanity that I not only pardon but approve it  A desire to be more excellent than others is what actually makes us so  and as thousands find a livelihood in society
