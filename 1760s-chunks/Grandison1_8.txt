till it was near him  He bowed to the very ground  with such an air of disconsolateness —Poor Mr  Orme —I wish d to have said one word to him  when we had passed him  But the coach flew—Why did the coach fly —But I waved my hand  and leaned out of the coach as far as I could  and bowed to him   O Miss Byron  said Mrs  Reeves  so said Mr  Reeves  Mr  Orme is the happy man  Did I think as you do  said I  I should not be so desirous to have spoken to him  But  methinks  I should have been glad to have once said  Adieu  Mr  Orme  for Mr  Orme is a good man   But  Lucy  my heart was softened at parting with my dear relations and friends  and when the heart is softened  light impressions will go deep   My cousins house is suitable to their fortune  Very handsome  and furnished in taste  Mrs  Reeves  knowing well what a scribbler I am  and am expected to be  has provided me with pen  ink  and paper  in abundance  She readily allowed me to take early possession of my apartment  that I might pay punctual obedience to the commands of all my friends on setting out  These  you know  were  to write in the   16 first hour of my arrival  And it was allowed to be to you  my dear  But  writing thus early  what can have occurred   My apartment is extremely elegant  A well furnish d book case  is  however  to me the most attracting ornament in it—Pardon me  dear Pen and Ink  I must not prefer any thing to you  by whose means  I hope to spend some part of every day at Selby House  and even at this distance  amuse with my prattle those friends that are always so partial to it   And now  my dear  my revered grandmamma  I ask your blessing—Yours  my ever indulgent aunt Selby—And yours  my honoured and equally beloved uncle Selby  Who knows but you will  now in absence  take less delight in teazing your ever dutiful Harriet  But yet I unbespeak not my monitor   Continue to love me  my Lucy  as I shall endeavour to deserve your Love  And let me know how our dear Nancy does   My heart bleeds for her  I should have held myself utterly inexcusable  had I accepted of your kindly intended dispensation  and come to town for three whole months  without repeating to her  by word of mouth  my Love  and my sympathising concern for her  What merit does her patience add to her other merits  How has her calamity endeared her to me  If ever I shall be heavily afflicted  God give me her amiable  her almost meritorious patience in sufferings   To my cousin Holles s  and all my other Relations  Friends  Companions  make the affectionate compliments of  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER V  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Jan  25   YOU rejoice me  my dear  in the hopes which you tell me  Dr  Mitchell from London gives   17 you in relation to our Nancy  May our incessant prayers for the restoration of her health be answered   Three things my aunt Selby  and you  in the name of every one of my friends  enjoined me at parting  The first  To write often  very often  were your words  This injunction was not needful  My heart is with you  and the good news you give me of my grandmamma s health  and of our Nancy  enlarges that heart  The second  to give you a description of the persons and characters of the people  I am likely to be conversant with in this great town  And  thirdly  Besides the general account which you all expected from me of the visits I made and received  you enjoined me to accquaint you with the very beginnings of every address  and even of every silent and respectful distinction  were your words  that the girl whom you all so greatly favour  might receive on this excursion to town   Don t you remember what my uncle Selby answer d to this —I do  And will repeat it  to shew  that his correcting cautions shall not be forgotten   The vanity of the Sex  said he  will not suffer any thing of this sort to escape our Harriet  Women  continued he  make themselves so cheap at the public places  in and about town  that new faces are more enquired after than even fine faces constantly seen  Harriet has an honest artless bloom in her cheeks  she may attract notice as a novice  But wherefore do you fill her head with an expectation of conquests  Women  added he  offer themselves at every public place  in rows  as at a market  Because three or four silly fellows here in the country  like people at an auction  who raise the price upon each other above its value  have bid for her  you think she will not be able to set her foot out
