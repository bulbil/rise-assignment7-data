kept close to my companion  and we both dined with the happy couple  who appeared to be suitably matched  The meal was not soon over  for the schoolmaster had the vanity to give three courses  for the purpose of cutting out his brothers  who had not been so magnificent in their hospitalities   After the banquet  all the guests expressed their longing to see Signor Thomas s play  not doubting but the performance of so extraordinary a genius would deserve all their ears  We came in front of the stage  the musicians had taken possession of the orchestra  for the overture and act tunes  While every one was waiting in profound silence for the rising of the curtain  the actors appeared on the boards  and the author  with the piece in his hand  sat down at the wing  in the prompter s place  Well might he call it a tragedy  for in the first act the King of Morocco  by way of diversion  shot an hundred Moorish slaves with arrows  in the second he beheaded thirty Portuguese officers  taken prisoners by one of his captains  and in the third and last  this monarch  surfeited with long indulged libertinism  set fire with his own hands to the seraglio where his wives were confined  and reduced it to ashes with its inhabitants  The Moorish slaves  as well as the Portuguese officers  were puppets on a very curious construction  and the palace  built of pasteboard  looked very naturally in flames by means of an artificial firework  This conflagration  accompanied by a thousand piercing cries  issuing from the ruins  concluded the piece  and the curtain dropped upon this amiable entertainment  The whole plain resounded with the applause of this fine tragedy  which spoke for the good taste of the poet  and proved that he knew where to look out for a subject   I did not suppose there was anything more to be seen after The Amusements of Muley Bugentuf  but I was mistaken  Kettle drums and trumpets announced a new exhibition    the distribution of prizes    for Thomas de la Fuenta  to give additional solemnity to his olympics  had made all his boys  as well dayscholars as boarders  write exercises  and on this occasion he was to give to those who had succeeded best  books bought at Segovia out of his own pocket  All at once were brought upon the stage two long forms out of the school  with a press full of old worm eaten books in fine new bindings  At this signal all the actors returned upon the stage  and took their places round Signor Thomas  who looked as big as the head of a college  He had a sheet of paper in his band  with the names of the successful candidates  This he gave to the King of Morocco  who began calling over the list with an authoritative voice  Each scholar  answering to his name  went humbly to receive a book from the hands of the bum jerker  after this he was crowned with laurel  and seated on one of the two benches to be exposed to the gaze of the admiring company  Yet  desirous as the schoolmaster might be to send the spectators away in good humour  he brought his eggs to a bad market  for  having distributed almost all the prizes to the boarders  according to the usual etiquette of pedagogues  that those who pay most must necessarily be the cleverest fellows  the mammas of certain day scholars caught fire at this instance of partiality  and fell foul of the disciplinarian thereupon  so that the festival  hitherto so much to the glory of the donor  seemed likely to have ended to the same tune as the carousal of the Lapithae     BOOK THE THIRD    CH  I     The arrival of Gil Blas at Madrid  His first place there   I MADE some stay with the young barber  At my departure  I met with a traveller of Segovia passing through Olm√©do  He was returning with four mules from a trading expedition to Valladolid  and took me by way of back carriage  We got acquainted on the road  and he took such a fancy to me that nothing would serve him but I must be his guest at Segovia  He gave me free quarters for two days  and when he found me determined to leave him for Madrid under convoy of a muleteer  he troubled me with a letter  begging me to deliver it in person according to the superscription  without hinting that it was a letter of recommendation  I was punctual in calling on Signor Matheo Melendez  He was a woollen draper  living at the gate of the Sun  at the corner of Trunkmaker street  No sooner had he broken the cover and read the contents  than he said with an air of complacency    Signor Gil Blas  my correspondent  Pedro Palacio  has written to me so pressingly in your favour  that I cannot do otherwise than offer you a bed at my house  moreover  he desires me to find you a good master  and I undertake the commission with pleasure  I have no doubt of suiting you to a hair   I embraced the offer of Melendez the more gratefully because my funds were getting
