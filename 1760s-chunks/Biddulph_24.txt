till you find a man who never offended in that way  I think  mother  you had better take a little boy from his nurse  breed him up under your own eye  and by the time Sidney is a good motherly gentlewoman  you may give her the baby to make a play thing of  For my own part  I am heartily sorry I ever interfered —People of such nice scruples had better chuse for themselves  but I cannot help thinking  that both Faulkland and I are very ill used  I told you  said my mother to me  how he would behave  Sir George  I desire you will not distress your sister thus  She saw me sadly cast down  I was ill and weak   if you have no respect for me  have a little tenderness for her —I beg your pardon  child  said he  I did not mean to distress you  I pity you  indeed Sidney  I could have cry’d at his using that expression  it humbles one so  Madam  to my mother   you shall be troubled no farther by my friend or myself  all I    shall say is this  that whenever my sister gets a husband of your ladyship’s chusing  I wish he may have half the worth of the poor rejected Faulkland   My brother left the room with these words  My mother was downright in a passion  but soon cooled on his withdrawing   My spirits were quite fatigued  and my mother left me  that I might take a little rest   What a strange alteration have a few days produced  our domestic peace broke in upon by the unlucky difference between my mother and my brother  My near prospect of—of—oh  let me be ingenuous  and say Happiness  vanished—Poor Mr Faulkland  Poor do I call him  for shame  Sidney—but let the word go  I will not blot it  Mr Faulkland forbid the house  myself harassed by a cruel disorder  and hardly able to crawl out of bed  All this fallen on me within these last fourteen black days  Then I dread the going abroad  or seeing company  I shall look so silly  for the intended wedding began to be talked of —and the curiosity of people to know the cause of it’s being broke off—What wild guesses will be made by some  and what lies invented by others  Then the ill natured mirth of one half of the girls of my acquaintance  and the as provoking condolements of the other hand—I am fretted at the thoughts of it—but it cannot be helped  I must bear it all—I wish I were well enough to get into the country  to be out of the reach of such impertinence   I long to know who this ill fated girl is  that has been the cause of all this  A gentlewoman  and very pretty  one that loves Mr Faulkland  and will shortly make him a parent  Thus my mother described her to Mr Faulkland  and he assented to it  Oh  fie  fie  Mr Faulkland  how could you be so cruel to her  How could you use me so ill  and Sir George knew of all this  and makes light of it  it is a strange story  My mother is severe in her virtue  but she is in the right—My brother would sacrifice every consideration to aggrandize his family—To make a purchase of the unhappy creature  and that without her knowlege too  it is horrid  Away  away from my thoughts  thou vile intruder—Return to your Bath mistress  she has a better right to you than I have  she implores your pity  she has no refuge but you  and she may be every way preferable to me—I wish I knew her name  but what is it to me  mine will never be Faulkland  hers ought  Perhaps Mr Faulkland may be induced to marry her  when he sees her in her present interesting situation  He says he will provide a retreat for her  to be sure he will have the compassion to visit her  and then who    knows what may happen  If I know my own heart  I think I do most sincerely wish he may make her his wife  but then I would not chuse to have it known suddenly  that might look as if he forsook me for her  That  I own  would a little hurt my pride  I wish not the truth to be known  for Mr Faulkland’s sake  but then I should not like to have a slur thrown on me   I will add no more to this  but send the packet off at all events  I think it will find you at Paris   August 1  My health promises to return  my mother praises me  and calls me a Heroine  I begin to fancy myself one  our pride sometimes stands in the place of virtue   Sir George went to Richmond yesterday  We have scarce seen him since the tift he had with us the other day  What strange creatures these men are  even the best of them  and how light they make of faults in one another  that shock us but to think of   My mother takes his behaviour very ill  he staid all night with
