of preparing for a march       In the mean time ambassadors from all the courts of Europe were sent to   his camp  most of them being apprehensive that they should be the next   who felt the terror of his arms  but those who had nothing of this kind   to dread  and more really his friends  made use of all the arguments in   their power to prevail on him to return to Stockholm  France in   particular sent courier after courier  remonstrating to him that his   glory was complete  that he had already exceeded Alexander  and should   now return covered  as he was  with lawrels  and let his subjects enjoy   the blessing of his presence  The court of St  Germains added their   entreaties to that of Versailles  but each were equally ineffectual  nor   could even the thoughts of the beautiful princess Louisa  his betrothed   spouse  and whom he was to marry at the end of this war  put a stop to   the vehemence of his impatience to revenge the many injuries he had   received from the czar of Muscovy       These were the sentiments by which this conquering monarch were   agitated  but Horatio  tho  no less fond of glory  had a softness in his   nature  which made him languish for the sight of his dear Charlotta    whom he had been absent from near two years  and being now blessed with   a fortune from the plunder of Saxony  which might countenance his   pretensions to her  passionately longed for an opportunity of returning   without incurring the censure of cowardice or ingratitude  By these   couriers he received letters from the baron de la Valiere  and several   others of his friends  but none from the father of Charlotta  nor did   any of them make any mention of that lady  tho  he knew the passion he   had for her was now no secret to any of them       He was very much surprized that the baron de Palfoy had not wrote    because as he had in a manner promised to correspond with him by   desiring him to write  he had a right to expect that favour when they   came to Alranstadt  for till then it was scarce possible  by reason of   the army s continual and uncertain motions  but he was much more so    that the baron de la Valiere had not been so good as to give him some   information of an affair  of which he could not be insensible his peace   so much depended  that he did not do it  he therefore presently   concluded  was owing to the having nothing pleasing to acquaint   him with       As love is always apprehensive of the worst that can possibly befal  he   thought now of nothing but her being obliged to give her hand to some   rival approved by her father   what avails it  cried he  that fortune   has raised me to an equality with her  if  by other means  I am   deprived of her       He was beginning to give way to a despair little befitting a soldier    when another courier arriving from Versailles with dispatches to the   king  he also received a packet  in which were three letters  The first   he cast his eye upon had on it the characters of Charlotta  amazed and   transported he hastily broke the seal  and found it contained   these lines        To Colonel  HORATIO          SIR        I have the permission of my father to pursue   my inclinations  in giving you this testimony   how sincerely I congratulate your good fortune    tho  I ought not to call it by that name  since I   find every body allows your rewards have not   exceeded your merits  but as neither has been   found deficient either for your ambition or the   satisfaction of your friends  all who are truly such   think you ought to be content  and run no future   hazards   Be assured you have many well wishers   here  among the number of whom you   will be guilty of great injustice not to place      CHARLOTTA DE PALFOY           How well were all the late anxieties he had endured attoned for by this   billet  it was short indeed  and wrote with a more distant air than he   might have expected  had the dear authoress been at liberty to pursue   the dictates of her heart  but as it informed him it was permitted by   her father  and was doubtless under his inspection  the knowledge that   he had authorized her to write at all  was more flattering to his hopes   of happiness than all she could have said
