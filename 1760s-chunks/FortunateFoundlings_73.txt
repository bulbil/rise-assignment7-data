  the carnival  and with it all the pleasures of this place will soon be   over  our loves may be continued elsewhere   suppose  Louisa  we go to   France  added she with a significant smile  that shewed it was her   intention to do so       Some company coming in  prevented any farther discourse on this head for   the present  but afterward she confirmed what she had now hinted at  and   told Louisa  that she had resolved to pass some little time in seeing   those places which were in her way to France  and afterwards meet the   count at Paris  on his return from the campaign  Louisa  unable to   determine within herself whether she ought to rejoice  or be sad at this   intended journey  fell into a sudden thoughtfulness  which the other at   that time took no notice of  but it served afterwards to corroborate the   truth of something she was told  and proved of consequence little to   be foreseen       The inconstant count  in the mean time  satieted with Melanthe  and as   much in love with Louisa as a man of his temper could be  was contriving   all the ways his inventive wit could furnish him with to get handsomely   rid of the one  and attain the enjoyment of the other  As he had spent   many years in a continual course of gallantry  and had made and broke a   thousand engagements  he easily found expedients for throwing off his   intercourse with Melanthe  but none that could give him the least   prospect of success in his designs on Louisa while they lived together   and continued friends  to part them therefore was his aim  and to   accomplish it the following method came into his head       On his first acquaintance with these ladies his design was wholly on   Louisa  but meeting a rebuff from her  his vanity rather than his   inclinations had made him turn his devoirs to Melanthe  who too easily   yielding to his suit  served but to heighten his desires for the other    the extravagant fondness of that unhappy woman rendering her visibly   uneasy at even the ordinary civilities she saw him behave with to any   other  discovered to him that jealousy was not the least reigning foible   of her foul  and the surest means to make her hate that person whom it   was not the interest of his passion she should continue to love  When   they were alone together one day at the place of their usual rendezvous    in the midst of the most tender endearments  he asked suddenly if she   had ever made Louisa the confident of his happiness  She was a little   surprized at the question  but answered that she had not  and desired to   know the reason of that demand  because  cried he  I am very certain she   is no friend to our loves  and by the manner in which she behaves to me    whenever she has the least opportunity of shewing her ill humour  I   imagined she either knew or suspected the affair between us       Melanthe  conscious she had hid nothing from her  and also sensible of   the little approbation she gave to her intrigue  was very much picqued   that she should have done any thing to make the count perceive   it   whatever she suspects  cried she  haughtily  she ought not to treat   with any ill manners a person whom I avow a friendship for  Vanity    answered he  sometimes gets the better of discretion in ladies of her   years   she knows herself handsome  and cannot have a good opinion of   the man who prefers any charms to her own   I imagine this to be the   cause why she looks on me with such disdain  and  whenever you are not   witness of her words  is so keen in satyrical reflections   On our first   acquaintance she looked and spoke with greater softness  and I can   impute it to no other motive than the pride of beauty  that this sudden   change has happened       All the time he was speaking  the soul of Melanthe grew more and more   fired with jealousy   It is natural for every one to imagine whatever   they like is agreeable to others  The distaste which Louisa had on many   occasions testified for the count  seemed now to have been only   affected   the melancholy she had been in  and the deep resvery she   remembered she had fallen into when first she informed her of their   amour  joined to convince her  that the advice she gave proceeded from a   motive very different from what she pretended       The wily count saw into the workings of her soul  and while he seemed as   if he would not
