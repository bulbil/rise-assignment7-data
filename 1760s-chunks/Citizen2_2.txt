the fair with a small cargoe of Chinese morality  If the Chinese have contributed to vitiate our tastle  I ll try how far they can help to improve our understanding  But as others have driven into the market in waggons  I ll cautiously begin by venturing with a wheel barrow  Thus resolved  I baled up my goods and fairly ventured  when  upon just entering the fair  I fancied the ice that had supported an hundred waggons before  cracked under me  and wheel barrow and all went to the bottom   Upon awaking from my reverie  with the fright  I cannot help wishing that the pains taken in giving   v this correspondence an English dress  had been employed in contriving new political systems  or new plots for farces  I might then have taken my station in the world  either as a poet or a philosopher  and made one in those little societies where men club to raise each others reputation  But at present I belong to no particular class  I resemble one of those solitary animals  that has been forced from its forest to gratify human curiosity  My earliest with was to escape unheeded through life  but I have been set up for half pence  to fret and scamper at the end of my chain  Tho  none are injured by my rage  I am naturally too savage to court any friends by fawning  Too obstinate to be taught new tricks  and too improvident to mind what may happen  I am appeased  though not contented  Too indolent for intrigue  and too timid to push for favour  I am—But what signifies what am I   〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉   〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉      unnumbered LETTERS FROM A CITIZEN of the WORLD TO HIS FRIENDS in the EAST   LETTER LXIII  From Lien Chi•l ••tangi to Hingpo  by the way of Moscow   GENEROSITY properly applied will supply every other external advantage in life  but the love of those we converse with  it will procure esteem and a conduct resembling real affection  but actual love is the spontaneous production of the mind  no generosity can purchase  no rewards encrease  nor no liberality continue it  the very person who is obliged  has it not in his power to force his lingring affections upon the object he should love  and voluntarily mix passion with gratitude     2Imparted fortune  and well placed liberality  may procure the benefactor good will  may load the person obliged  with the sense of the duty he lies under to retaliate  this is gratitude  and simple gratitude untinctured with love  is all the return an ingenuous mind can bestow for former benefits   But gratitude and love are almost opposite affections  love is often an involuntary passion  placed upon our companions without our consent  and frequently conferred without our previous esteem  We love some men  we know not why  our tenderness is naturally excited in all their concerns  we excuse their faults with the same indulgence  and approve their virtues with the same applause with which we consider our own  While we entertain the passion it pleases us  we cherish it with delight  and give it up with reluctance  and love for love is all the reward we expect or desire   Gratitude  on the contrary  is never conferred  but where there have been previous endeavours to excite it  we consider it as a debt  and our spirits wear a load till we have discharged the obligation  Every acknowledgment of gratitude is a circumstance of humiliation  and some are found to submit to frequent mortifications of this kind  proclaiming what obligations they owe  merely because they think it in some measure cancels the debt   Thus love is the most easy and agreeable  and gratitude the most humiliating affection of the mind  we never reflect on the man we love  without exulting in our choice  while he who has bound us to him by benefits alone  rises to our idea as a person   3 to whom we have in some measure  forfeited our freedom  Love and gratitude are seldom therefore found in the same breast without impairing each other  we may tender the one or the other singly to those we converse with  but cannot command both together  By attempting to encrease  we diminish them  the mind becomes bankrupt under too large obligations  all additional benefits lessen every hope of future return  and bar up every avenue that leads to tenderness   In all our connexions with society therefore  it is not only generous  but prudent  to appear insensible of the value of those favours we bestow  and endeavour to make the obligation seem as slight as possible  Love must be taken by stratagem  and not by open force  We should seem ignorant that we oblige  and leave the mind at full liberty to give or refuse its affections  for constraint may indeed leave the receiver still grateful  but it will certainly produce disgust   If to procure gratitude be our only aim  there is no great art in making the acquisition  a benefit conferred demands a just acknowledgment  and we have a right to insist upon our due   But it were much more prudent to forego our right on such an occasion  and exchange it
