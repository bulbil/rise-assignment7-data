Mr Faulkland prodigiously  her vexation was the greater  in finding her expectations disappointed  and could I have been so unjust to    the pretensions of another  or so indelicate in regard to myself  as to have overlooked Mr Faulkland’s fault  I knew my mother would be inflexible  I therefore resolved in earnest to banish him from my thoughts  I found my mother was mightily pleased with her own management of the conversation she had held with Mr Faulkland  I think I talked pretty roundly to him  said she  but there was no other way  he is an artful man  and I was resolved not to let him wind me about  He would make a merit of having formed no designs upon the young lady  why  possibly  he did not  till he found the poor soul was so smitten with him  that he thought she would be an easy prey  Sir George impudently insinuated  that a man must not reject a lady upon these occasions  I was ashamed to hint to Mr Faulkland at the circumstance of his having actually paid a price for the girl  it was too gross  and I think  had I mentioned it  must have struck him dumb  though very likely he might have had some subterfuge  even for that aggravating part of the story   How I am shock’d  my Cecilia  to think of this  I was glad my mother had spared his confusion on this particular  for though probably  as she observed  he had come prepared with some evasion to this charge  yet what a mean figure must a man make  who is reduced to disingenuous shifts  to excuse or palliate an action  despicable as well as wicked   My brother came in  during our discourse  to ask me how I did  My mother answered his question before I had time to speak  She is pretty well  thank God  and not likely to break her heart  though she knows your friend Mr Faulkland’s story  and she spoke it scornfully   My brother said  Sidney  Are you as averse to Mr Faulkland as my mother is  I replied  Brother  I wonder you can ask me that question  after what you have been just now told  I always said  answered he  that you did not know the value of the man  and now I am convinced of it  I wish he had never seen you  I wish so too  said I  Sir George walked about the room  and seemed vexed to death  For Heaven’s sake  madam   turning to my mother  now my sister is tolerably recovered  suffer her to see Mr Faulkland  let her hear what he has to say in his own vindication  I think you may trust to her honour  and her discretion  and if the affair appears to her in so heinous a light as it does to you  I will be contented to give Mr Faulkland up  but don’t shut your own ears  and your daughter’s too  against conviction   Sir  you are disrespectful  said my mother angrily  Dear brother  I    cry’d  I beg you will spare me on this subject  my mother has given me leave to judge for myself  she has repeated all that you have said  and all that Mr Faulkland has been able to urge on the occasion  and I am sorry to tell you  that I think myself bound never to have any farther correspondence with him  therefore you must excuse me for not seeing him  And so the match is broke off  cry’d Sir George  It is  said my mother peremptorily  It is  echoed I faintly  Why then  replied Sir George  and he swore   you will never get such another whilst you live  A pretty figure you’ll make in the world  when you give it for a reason that you refused such a man  after every thing was concluded upon  because truly you found that he had had an intrigue  Why  Sidney  you’ll be so laugh’d at  He addressed himself to me  though I knew he meant the reproof for my mother  Sir  answered she  neither your sister nor I shall trouble ourselves much about the opinion of people who can laugh at such things  You may put the matter into as ridiculous a light as you please  but this was no common intrigue  you know it was not  however you may affect to speak of it  I don’t suppose any of you are Saints  but I trust in Heaven  some are better than others  Oh  madam  madam  said my brother  if you knew the world as well I do  you would think that Mr Faulkland is one of the best  God forbid  my mother answered coolly  Well  well  madam  cry’d Sir George  I see it is to no purpose to argue  there are many families of more consequence than ours  and ten times the fortune  that will be very proud of Faulkland’s alliance  and will hardly make it an objection to him  that he was led into a foolish scrape by the wickedness of one woman  and the folly of another  If you make my sister wait for a husband
