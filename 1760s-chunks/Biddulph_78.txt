though he will continue long so  Well  Frank  said I  I am glad to hear your master and the children are well  Ah  madam  shaking his head as he opened the door to go out  it was a woeful day for us when you left South Park  God give every one their reward   November 22  I have not seen my brother these two days  he does not know  I believe  that Mr Arnold is come to town  though  if he did  I am sure he will not break his word  so that I am easy on that particular  My mother says she will go to Mr Arnold herself  to reason with him a little  I shall not oppose it  though I have no hopes of her being able to effect any thing in my favour  she is now laid up with a cold  and is not able to come out of her room  but she pleases herself with the thought of this visit  as soon as she is able to make it  She has planned what she intends to say to him  and is resolved to let him into the whole history of Miss Burchell  that he may know  she says  the full extent of Mrs Gerrarde’s wickedness  as what is there of which that woman is not capable  who could set to sale the honour of an innocent  unsuspecting creature  left to her guardianship   November 23  Amazing  my dear Cecilia  I thought I should wonder no more at any thing  yet is my wonder now raised to astonishment—I have just received a letter from Lady V——  I have read it over and over again  and can yet scarce believe my senses  Here it is in her own words   ‘I suppose you know  my dear Mrs Arnold  that your husband is in town  and that he left Mrs Gerrarde behind him for no other reason  I imagine  but that he did not chuse to be quite so scandalous as to let her travel with him  for we heard that she purposed following him in a few days  Patty  I conclude  may have informed you of thus much  but the extraordinary part of    the intelligence  I believe  is reserved for me to acquaint you with  Know then that Mrs Gerrarde is eloped  no body knows whither  Good  you say  good  should I say too  but for the conclusion of my story  It is with Mr Faulkland she is eloped  ’tis positively true  she went off with him in triumph last night in her own chariot  and neither of them have been heard of since  I own I am so much confounded at this  I scarce know what I write   ‘I am very glad  for your sake  that bad creature has quitted your husband  but that she should have drawn my cousin Faulkland in  is a matter of serious concern to me  It is evident the plan was previously concerted between them  for I am informed to day  that Mrs Gerrarde’s maid decamped at the same time  and took with her every thing valuable belonging to her mistress  several of her drawers being found open and empty  Mr Faulkland’s servants have also disappeared  so that we cannot conjecture which way they are gone   ‘Mr Faulkland  who was about leaving us  asked my permission to give a ball to the neighbouring ladies in our new room  which is just finished  As I concluded he would ask nobody but our own acquaintances  I readily consented  and my lord  you know  is fond of those frolics  I own I was surprized to see Mrs Gerrarde amongst the company  as undaunted as the modestest face there  I would not however confront Mr Faulkland so much  as to shew any disrespect to one  who was  at that time  his guest  but I was out of all patience to find that she  along with several others  was asked to supper  my too good natured lord joining in the invitation  Mr Faulkland made a pretence to wait on her home  and the audacious creature took that opportunity to march off with him   ‘Now  as Faulkland really purposed leaving V—— hall the next day  I think it would have been but decent in him to have forbore this piece of barefaced libertinism  till he was fairly from under our roof  He might have made his assignation in any other place  but  I suppose  the lady had a mind to shew the world she is above restraint  and chose to make her infamy a sort of triumph   ‘I am quite angry with my lord  for only laughing at this  and calling it a piece of spirited gallantry in them both  He says  he is delighted to think how your good man will shake his ears  when    he hears his mistress has left him in the lurch  and gone off with another lover  I should smile too  but that it makes me sad to think  that Mr Faulkland  of whom I had so good an opinion  should so impose upon my judgment  and forfeit his own character  for so vile a creature   ‘Pardon me  my dear madam  I am
