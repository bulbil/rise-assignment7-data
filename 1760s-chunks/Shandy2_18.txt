 replied my father  for I think it will presently appear that St  Paul and the Protestant divine are both of an opinion —As nearly so  quoth Dr  Slop  as east is to west —but this  continued he  lifting both hands  comes from the liberty of the press   It is no more  at the worst  replied my uncle Toby  than the liberty of the pulpit  for it does not appear that the sermon is printed  or ever likely to be     Go on  Trim  quoth my father     At first sight this may seem to be a true state of the case  and I make no doubt but the knowledge of right and wrong is so truly impressed upon the mind of man —that did no such thing ever happen  as that the conscience of a man  by long habits of sin  might  as the scripture assures it may  insensibly become hard —and  like some tender parts of his body  by much stress and continual hard usage  lose  by degrees  that nice sense and perception with which God and nature endow d it —Did this never happen —or was it certain that self love could never hang the least bias upon the judgment —or that the little interests below  could rise up and perplex the faculties of our upper regions  and    encompass them about with clouds and thick darkness —Could no such thing as favour and affection enter this sacred COURT —Did WIT disdain to take a bribe in it —or was asham d to shew its face as an advocate for an unwarrantable enjoyment —Or  lastly  were we assured  that INTEREST stood always unconcern d whilst the cause was hearing —and that passion never got into the judgment seat  and pronounc d sentence in the stead of reason  which is supposed always to preside and determine upon the case —Was this truly so  as the objection must suppose —no doubt then  the religious and moral state of a man would be exactly what he himself esteem d it —and the guilt or innocence of every man s life could be known  in general  by no better measure  than the degrees    of his own approbation and censure     I own  in one case  whenever a man s conscience does accuse him  as it seldom errs on that side  that he is guilty  and  unless in melancholy and hypocondriac cases  we may safely pronounce upon it  that there is always sufficient grounds for the accusation    But the converse of the proposition will not hold true —namely  that whenever there is guilt  the conscience must accuse  and if it does not  that a man is therefore innocent —This is not fact —So that the common consolation which some good christian or other is hourly administring to himself —that he thanks God his mind does not misgive him  and that  consequently     he has a good conscience  because he has a quiet one —is fallacious —and as current as the inference is  and as infallible as the rule appears at first sight  yet  when you look nearer to it  and try the truth of this rule upon plain facts —you see it liable to so much error from a false application —the principle upon which it goes so often perverted —the whole force of it lost  and sometimes so vilely cast away  that it is painful to produce the common examples from human life which confirm the account    A man shall be vicious and utterly debauched in his principles —exceptionable in his conduct to the world  shall live shameless  in the open commission of a sin which no reason or pretence can justify —a sin  by which    contrary to all the workings of humanity  he shall ruin for ever the deluded partner of his guilt —rob her of her best dowry  and not only cover her own head with dishonour —but involve a whole virtuous family in shame and sorrow for her sake —Surely  you will think conscience must lead such a man a troublesome life —he can have no rest night or day from its reproaches    Alas  CONSCIENCE had something else to do  all this time  than break in upon him  as Elijah reproached the God Baal —this domestic Godwas either talking  or pursuing  or was in a journey  or peradventure he slept and could not be awoke    Perhaps HE was gone out in company with HONOUR to fight a duel     to pay off some debt at play —or dirty annuity  the bargain of his lust  Perhaps CONSCIENCE all this time was engaged at home  talking loud against petty larceny  and executing vengeance upon some such puny crimes as his fortune and rank in life secured him against all temptation of committing  so that he lives as merrily    If he was of our church tho   quoth Dr  Slop  he could not — sleeps as soundly in his bed —and at last meets death as unconcernedly —perhaps much more so than a much better man    All this is impossible with us  quoth Dr  Slop  turning to my father —the case could not happen in our church —It happens in ours  however  replied my father  but too often —I own  quoth
