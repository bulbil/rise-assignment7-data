better  as I found from the nature of his wound that his situation was dangerous  I marched down stairs to my chaise with my handkerchief to my ear  and drove immediately off towards Bristol  giving previous directions  however  to the people of the house  who had not yet been alarmed  to take the most speedy and effectual care of the colonel   My first care on my arrival at Bristol  was to send Edwards in quest of some vessel immediately ready to sail  and in less than an hour he came back with intelligence that the captain of a ship bound to Rotterdam  was preparing to set off the next tide  As it was a matter of indifference to me which way I pursued my rout  I ordered him to agree with the Dutchman  and sat down to give you an account of this   179 unfortunate accident before I left the kingdom  You cannot imagine  Charles  how miserable it has made me—No less in disappointing the eagerness of my wishes to be reconciled to Louisa  than in loading the two families with additional distress  neither lady Haversham  nor Miss Mildmay will ever believe but what I have been entirely to blame in this curst rencounter  and should the colonel even recover  the danger into which I have thrown his life  must necessarily impede an accommodation with his sister—Then he is so implacable in his resentments  and his father is so carried away by the ridiculous notions of family reputation  that I much question whether he would not believe himself rather bound in honour to treat me with the grossest indignities  than to think of listening to any overtures which I may make towards a reconciliation  How cautiously my dear Melmoth  should   180 young fellows of any principle be in their conduct to women of character  since a single indiscretion can be productive of such numberless misfortunes  Here have I with as little villainy of intention as ever influenced the bosom of giddy headed youth  with little more in fact to charge myself than a mere want of circumspection  destroyed the reputation of a woman whom I passionately love  converted the smiling expectations of her whole family into anguish and disgrace  robbed her brother  perhaps  of his life  and sacrificed not only my own peace of mind for ever  but covered all my friends with confusion and distress  How some people  Melmoth  can preserve their tranquility with such a scene before them is to me astonishing  A man not utterly divested of feeling  must look with horror on himself where he has been the cause of such a complicated wretchedness    181 For my own part  thoughtless as I have been in many connections with the sex  the consequences which have resulted from this affair with Miss Mildmay  makes me detest what I formerly esteemed the principal source of felicity  and convinces me that a man of gallantry is no less a contemptible than a dangerous character  O  Charles  could my whole fortune recover that chearful serenity of mind which I possessed but a week ago  how readily would I think of making the purchase  but happiness is totally incompatible with guilt  and it is but just that he who is instrumental in the misery of others should experience the sharpest stings of misery himself   Before I conclude this letter  I must  however  mention some things to you relative to Miss Mildmay  By her mother s letter I understand  that she is to be supplied with money only as the good old lady can conveniently spare it    182 till time can so work upon the obstinate temper of her father  as to obtain some regular allowance for her establishment  all she has in the world is five hundred pounds  this is but a small sum for a lady of her fashion to live upon a whole year  tho  I suppose  she will not in her present circumstances choose to be very public  however  that she may suffer as little as possible upon my account  contrive through lady Haversham s means some method of making the dear girl receive a thousand pounds a year to support a carriage  and to purchase all the other conveniences which she has been used to in her father s house  I need not tell you  that the task I now impose is a difficult one  and that the execution of it will demand the utmost delicacy and address  Louisa is all soul  yet nobody knows how to give things a better manner than my sister  and if there is a possibility of managing the   183 matter I am sensible she will be able to effect it  It is unnecessary to say that I must on no account appear in the affair  If Miss Mildmay could be cheated into an opinion  that the allowance is made privately by her father  who is unwilling to shew how much he still loves her  or if—But damn it  I am all the time forgetting that her family would wonder by what method she was enabled to keep an equi  and  perhaps  from an opinion that it was by some sinister means—you understand me—become less inclined to forgive her—this way therefore will never do—Yet stay—I have it   Suppose my sister was secretly to make Mrs  Darnel the allowance I have been talking of for Louisa s ease  I have some little knowledge of Mrs
