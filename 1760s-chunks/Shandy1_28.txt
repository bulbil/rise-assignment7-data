you will see drawing a full length character against the light —that s illiberal —dishonest —and hard upon the character of the man who sits   Others  to mend the matter  will make a drawing of you in the Camera —that is most unfair of all —because  there you are sure to be represented in some of your most ridiculous attitudes   To avoid all and every one of these errors  in giving you my uncle Toby s character  I am determin d to draw it by  Page  172  no mechanical help whatever —nor shall my pencil be guided by any one wind instrument which ever was blown upon  either on this  or on the other side of the Alps —nor will I consider either his repletions or his discharges —or touch upon his Non Naturals —but  in a word  I will draw my uncleToby s character from his HOBBY HORSE   CHAP  XXIV   IF I was not morally sure that the reader must be out of all patience for my uncle Toby s character —I would here previously have convinced him  that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with  as that which I have pitch d upon   Page  173  A man and his HOBBY HORSE  tho  I cannot say that they act and re act exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other  Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind  and my opinion rather is  that there is something in it more of the manner of electrified bodies —and that by means of the heated parts of the rider  which come immediately into contact with the back of the HOBBY HORSE —By long journies and much friction  it so happens that the body of the rider is at length fill d as full of HOBBY HORSICAL matter as it can hold —so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature of the one  you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other   Page  174  NOW the HOBBY HORSE which my uncle Toby always rode upon  was  in my opinion  an HOBBY HORSE well worth giving a description of  if it was only upon the score of his great singularity  for you might have travelled from York to Dover —from Dover to Penzance in Cornwall  and from Penzance to York back again  and not have seen such another upon the road  or if you had seen such a one  whatever haste you had been in  you must infallibly have stopp d to have taken a view of him  Indeed  the gait and figure of him was so strange  and so utterly unlike was he  from his head to his tail  to any one of the whole species  that it was now and then made a matter of dispute —whether he was really a HOBBY HORSE or no  But as the Philosopher would use no other argument to the sceptic  who disputed with him against  Page  175  the reality of motion  save that of rising up upon his legs  and walking a cross the room —so would my uncle Toby use no other argument to prove his HOBBY HORSE was a HOBBY HORSE indeed  but by getting upon his back and riding him about —leaving the world after that to determine the point as it thought fit   In good truth  my uncle Toby mounted him with so much pleasure  and he carried my uncle Toby so well —that he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or thought about it   It is now high time  however  that I give you a description of him —But to go on regularly  I only beg you will give me leave to acquaint you first  how my uncle Toby came by him   Page  176  CHAP  XXV   THE wound in my uncle Toby s groin  which he received at the siege of Namur  rendering him unfit for the service  it was thought expedient he should return to England  in order  if possible  to be set to rights   He was four years totally confined —part of it to his bed  and all of it to his room  and in the course of his cure  which was all that time in hand  suffer d unspeakable miseries —owing to a succession of exfoliations from the oss pubis  and the outward edge of that part of the coxendix called the oss illeum —both which bones were dismally crush d  as much by the irregularity of the stone  which I told you was broke off the parapet   Page  177  —as by its size — though it was pretty large  which inclined the surgeon all along to think  that the great injury which it had done my uncle Toby s groin  was more owing to the gravity of the stone itself  than to the projectile force of it —which he would often tell him was a great happiness   My father at that time was just beginning business in London  and had taken a house —and as the truest friendship and cordiality subsisted between the two brothers —and that my father thought my uncle Toby could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as in his own house —he assign d him the very best apartment in it —And what was
