pronounced these words  than he began to caper about the room  and snap his fingers  crying in a transport    The day s our own —the day s our own    I gave him to understand that his triumph was a little premature  and that I had more difficulties to surmount than he was aware of  then I recounted to him the intelligence I had received from Banter —At which he changed colour  shook his head  and observed there was no faith in woman —I told him  I was resolved to make a bold push notwithstanding  although I foresaw it would lead me into a great expence  and bid him guess the sum I had lost last night at cards —He scratched his chin  and professed his abhorrence of cards  the very name of which being mentioned made him sweat with vexation  as it recalled the money dropper to his remembrance    But however  said he  you have to do with other guess people now —Why  I suppose  if you had a bad run last night  you would scarce come off for less than ten or twelve shillings   —I was mortified at this piece of simplicity  which I imagined  at that time  was all affected by way of reprimand for my folly  and asked with some heat  if he thought I had spent the evening in a cellar with chairmen and bunters  giving him to   122 know  at the same time time  that my expence amounted to eighteen guineas —It would require the pencil of Hogarth to express the astonishment and concern of Strap  on hearing this piece of news  the bason in which he was preparing the lather for my chin  dropped out of his hands  and he remained some time immoveable in that ludicrous attitude  with his mouth open  and his eyes thrust forward considerably beyond their station  but remembering my disposition  which was touchy and impatient of controul  he smothered his chagrin  and attempted to recollect himself —With this view he endeavoured to laugh  but in spite of his teeth  broke out into a whimper  took up his washball and pewter pot  scrubbed my beard with the one  and discharged the other upon my face —I took no notice of his confusion  but after he had fully recovered himself  put him in mind of his right  and assured him of my readiness to surrender his effects whenever he should think proper to demand them —He was nettled at my insinuation  which he thought proceeded from my distrust of his friendship  and begged I would never talk to him in that strain again  unless I had a mind to break his heart     This good creature s unalterable friendship for me affected me with the most grateful sentiments  and acted as a spur to my resolution of acquiring a fortune  that I might have it in my power to manifest my generosity in my turn —For this purpose  I determined to bring matters to a speedy conclusion with Melinda  well knowing that a few such nights as the last  would effectually incapacitate me from prosecuting that  or any other advantageous amour     123 While my meditation was busied in planning out my future conduct  Mr  Banter favoured me with a visit  and after breakfast  asked how I had passed the preceeding evening—I answered  I was very agreeably entertained at a private house —   Yes   said he  with a sarcastic smile  you deserved something extraordinary for the price you paid  —  I was surprised at his remark  and pretended ignorance of his meaning —   Come  come  Random  continued he  you need not make a mystery of it to me  the whole town has it —I wish that foolish affair between you and Bragwell at Hampstead had been less publick—It has set all the busy bodies at work to find out your real character and situation  and you cannot imagine what conjectures have already circulated at your expence  One suspects you to be Jesuit in disguise  another believes you are an agent from the Pretender  a third believes you to be an upstart gamester  because no body knows any thing of your family or fortune  a fourth is of opinion  that you are an Irish fortune hunter  —  This last hypothesis touched me so near  that  to conceal my confusion  I was fain to interrupt his detail  and damn the world for an envious meddling community  that would not suffer a gentleman to live without molestation  He took no notice of this apostrophe  but went on    For my own part  I neither know nor desire to know  who  or what you are  this I am certain of  that few people make a mystery of their origin and situation  who can boast of any thing advantageous in either —and my own opinion of the matter is  that you have raised yourself by your industry    124 from nothing to the appearance you now maintain  and which you endeavour to support by some matrimonial scheme  —  Here he fixed his eye  stedfastly upon me  and perceiving my face covered with blushes  told me  now he was confirmed in his opinion —   Look ye  Random   said he  I have divined your plan  and am
