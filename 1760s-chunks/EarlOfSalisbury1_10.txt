He demanded to know  if any man had dared to accuse him  if  he had an accuser  he defied him to the lists  and offered to prove his  falsehood and his own loyalty in single combat  Yet with what reserve so  ever these soldiers spoke of their commander  I learned clearly that his  remonstrances had not so great an effect on Count Savourè  as the power  and influence of Les Roches  who though he fought under his command  had  himself a numerous and formidable body of feudatory vassals  that  attended him in arms  and were attached to their Chief with an ardent  and invariable affection  It appeared plainly  that fear  for cruel  natures are most accessible to fear  had determined the imperious Count  to release my friend  when the first sudden passion of rage had somewhat  abated  and no appearance of danger had been discovered  My guards  informed me still farther  that on this very morning  Mal leon had  repented of his lenity  and that his apprehensions were again awakened   as he had received information  that on that part of the shore which  looks towards the main land of France  another vessel had been  discovered hovering about the island  with an appearance which fully  warranted suspicion  I readily concluded that this was no other than the  vessel in which my ransomed friends had embarked  and which still lay  off the shore in hopes of receiving me  But without discovering this  I  contented myself with earnestly disavowing  in general  all intentions  of an hostile nature  nor could I speak of the mean fears and insolent  severity of Mal leon but with a warm and passionate indignation  But  here our conference was interrupted by the arrival of another body  who  came  as they said  to take charge of me  and dismissed the others from  their attendance  I now expected to be led in triumph to the presence  of my enemy   but soon learned that I was to continue for some time in my present  situation  At this I ventured to express some surprize  But the looks  and words of sullen gloom and moroseness which these my new guards  assumed  obliged me to surpress all farther enquiries  I submitted  patiently to my fate  I was disarmed  and confined in the cottage under  the care of two soldiers  who seemed to command the party  the rest of  which they had disposed at some distance  in different situations  to  watch all approaches that might threaten rescue     Night advanced upon us  and I was left to my repose  but what repose  remained for a wretch tossed about thro  all the vicissitudes of danger   toil  and distress  by the capricious cruelty of fortune  A thousand  thoughts and a thousand passions encountered each other in my  distracted breast  I threw myself upon my hard and homely couch  and  started up by turns  like the feverish wretch  incessantly changing  in  fruitless search of ease  Nature seemed to lower upon me  and to thunder  terror into my affrighted ears  the loud storm and the roaring torrent  broke in upon the silence of night  and made darkness doubly dreadful   How did I then accuse the slow and indolent advances of time  that  tortured me with cruel delay  Oftentimes did I endeavour to compose my  troubled thoughts  and as often did the terrors of the night awaken my  distractions  Watchful and disordered as I was  my soul was soon  tortured with a new and terrible alarm  It was now the dead midnight  hour  on that side where my chamber looked down upon the troubled river   I plainly heard my two guards in dreadful conference encouraging each  other to the horrid purpose of murder    It is now  said one  the very  moment of execution  he sleeps  take you this dagger  and let us enter   when we have dispatched this Englishman  my orders are to plunge his  body in the river  that it may be thought he has escaped  observe me  well  and be assured of the favour of our Count  The dagger is the last  resource  No blood if possible  our first attempt must  be by strangling  — Accursed wretch   cried Randolph  with a sudden and  violent interruption   what was the crime of Salisbury  Is superior  worth so odious and insupportable  Can envy prove so  bloody  — Oftentimes  said Lord William  have I seen death loading the  fields of war with frightful carnage  and never did my soul shrink at  his approach  but now when he appeared in the form of a calm and  deliberate assassin  I at once lost all firmness  The cold dew issued  from every pore  I commended myself to heaven  and lay entranced in  dismay  A hideous interval of suspense succeeded  for the murderers had  not yet appeared  The torture of this delay was even worse than death   To this I had resigned myself  or even wished to receive it  Still I lay  in stupid
