interest  The other shall be kept for relieving  them  so that they may be again deposited with a second set of those  honourable usurers  and when they shall have been circulated in this  manner through a variety of hands  we will extort money from each of the  pawnbrokers  by threatening them with a public prosecution  for exacting  illegal interest  and I know that they will bleed freely  rather than  be exposed to the infamy attending such an accusation   The scheme was  feasible  and though not very honourable  made such an impression upon  the needy borrower  that he assented to the proposals  and  by our  hero s credit  the money was raised  The jewels were accordingly  purchased  pawned  relieved  and repledged by the agent  who undertook  to manage the whole affair  and so judiciously was the project executed   that he could have easily proved each lender guilty of the charge   Having thus far successfully transacted the business  this faithful  agent visited them severally on his own account  to give them  intimation  that his employer intended to sue them on the statute of  usury  upon which  every one for himself bribed the informer to withdraw  his evidence  by which alone he could be convicted  and having received  these gratifications  he had thought proper to retreat into France  with the whole booty  including the original thousand that put them in  motion  In consequence of this decampment  the borrower had withdrawn  himself  so that the lender was obliged to have recourse to his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   security    This was a very mortifying account to our young gentleman  who  in  vain  reminded the narrator of his promise  importing  that he would not  demand the money  until he should be called to an account by his ward   and observed  that  long before that period  the fugitive might appear  and discharge the debt  But the other was deaf to these remonstrances   alleging  that his promise was provisional  on the supposition that the  borrower would deal candidly and fairly  that he had forfeited all title  to his friendship and trust  by the scandalous scheme in which he had  embarked  and that his treacherous flight from his security was no proof  of his honesty and intended return  but  on the contrary  a warning  by  which he  the lender  was taught to take care of himself  He therefore  insisted upon his being indemnified immediately  on pain of letting the  law take its course  and Peregrine was actually obliged to part with  the whole sum he had so lately received  But this payment was not made  without extreme reluctance  indignation  and denunciation of eternal war  against the absconder  and the rigid creditor  betwixt whom he suspected  some collusion   CHAPTER XCI    Cadwallader acts the part of a Comforter to his Friend  and in his turn  is consoled by Peregrine  who begins to find himself a most egregious  Dupe   This new misfortune  which he justly charged to the account of his own  folly  recalled his chagrin  and though he endeavoured with all his  might to conceal the affair from the knowledge of Cadwallader  that  prying observer perceived his countenance overcast  The projector s  sudden disappearance alarming his suspicion  he managed his inquiries  with so much art  that in a few days he made himself acquainted with  every particular of the transaction  and resolved to gratify his  spleen at the expense of the impatient dupe  With this view  he took an  opportunity to accost him with a very serious air  saying a friend of  his had immediate occasion for a thousand pounds  and as Peregrine had  the exact sum lying by him  he would take it as a great favour if he  would part with it for a few months on undoubted security  Had Pickle  known the true motive of this demand  he would in all likelihood have  made a very disagreeable answer  but Crabtree had wrappped himself up so  securely in the dissimulation of his features  that the youth could not  possibly penetrate into his intention  and in the most galling suspense  replied  that the money was otherwise engaged  The misanthrope  not  contented with this irritation  assumed the prerogative of a friend  and  questioned him so minutely about the disposal of the cash  that  after  numberless evasions  which cost him a world of torture to invent  he  could contain his vexation no longer  but exclaimed in a rage   D   your  impertinence   tis gone to the devil  and that s enough     Thereafter   as it may be   said this tormentor  with a most provoking indifference  of aspect   I should be glad to know upon what footing  for I suppose  you have some expectation of advantage from that quarter      Sdeath   sir   cried the impatient youth   if I had any expectation from hell  I    6
