Populi Public Safety Security to the Persons and         266 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Properties of the People  constitutes the whole of England s   polity  Here empire is   Imperium lef um  the sway of law     it   is the dispensation of beneficence  of equal right to all   and this   empire rises supreme over king  lords  and commons  and is   appointed to rule the rulers to the end of time      Other states before now have been compounded  like ours  of   prince  peers  and people  the one  few  and many united  But the   error and failure of their constitution was this   The People  who   are the Fountain of all Power  either retained in their own hands   an authority which they never were qualified to wield   or deputed   it to trustees without account  without a provident resource  or   due reserve of potency  when  those instructed with government   should be found to betray their trust       The people of England  on the contrary  claim no authority in   government   neither in the framing  administration  or execution   of the laws by which they consent to be governed  They are   themselves imaged  and as it were epitomized  in their three   several estates  The king represents their majesty   the lords their   nobility  and the commons  more immediately  their legislative   power  The constitution is the inheritance of them and their   posterity   and theirs is the right and duty  at all times  to watch   over  assert  and reclaim it  Wherefore  as you find in history    when any of the three estates have usurped upon the others   even when all of them together have dared to violate the frame   of this salutary constitution   the people  to whom it belongs  have   never failed  as on the other day s revolution  to restore and re    instate it      England s three estates  of king  lords  and commons  are parts of   the people  under covenant with the people  and accountable to   the people   but the people  as a people  make not any of the said   estates  They are as a perpetual fountain  from whence the three   estates arise   or rather as a sea of waters  in which three exalted   waves should claim pre eminence  which yet shall not be able to   depart from their fund  but in rotation are dissoluble and resolvable   therein      Thus  however complicated the system of England s polity may   be  it is all rooted in  and branches from the trust of the people  the   trust of powers which they have granted to be returned in pro    tection  And  in truth  it makes little difference whether the   powers in such cases be granted or assumed   whoever either re    ceives or assumes such powers  save to the ends of beneficence    is equally guilty of usurpation and tyranny      Government can have no powers save the powers of the people     to wit  the power of their numbers  strength  and courage  in time   of war   and in peace  of their art and industry  and the wealth   arising therefrom  Whoever assumes to himself these powers  or   any part thereof  without the consent of the proprietors  is a robber    and should at least be divested of the spoil      On the other hand  if such powers are granted by the people  the   people cannot grant them for purposes to which they themselves   cannot lawfully apply them  No man  for instance  can arbitrarily   dispose of his own life or liberty  neither of the whole product of his         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  267     own labours   forasmuch as the lives of himself and his family should   be first sustained thereby  and his obligations to others fairly and   fully discharged  He cannot  therefore  grant an arbitrary disposal   of what he hath not an arbitrary disposal in himself  Much less   can any man grant a power over the lives  liberties  or properties   of other people  as it would be criminal and highly punishable in   himself to assail them      Hence it follows  as evident as any object at noon  that   no man    or body of men  can rightfully assume  or even accept  what no man   or body of men can rightfully grant   to wit  a power that is   arbitrary or injurious to others  And hence it necessarily follows
