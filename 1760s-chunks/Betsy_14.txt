you will expect        nothing from it but a last farewel  which you have promised to be        contented with  Till then  adieu        After finishing this little billet  she called the maid  whom Saving had   made his confidante  into the chamber  and asked her  when she expected   he would come for an answer  To which the other replied  that he had   appointed her to meet him at the corner of the street very early in the   morning  before any of the windows were open   Well  then   said Miss   Betsy  smiling  and putting the letter into her hands   give him this  I   do it for your sake  Nanny  for  I suppose  you will have a double fee   on the delivery     The gentleman is too much in love   answered she     not to be grateful        Miss Betsy passed the remainder of that day  and the ensuing night  with   that tranquillity which is inseparable from a mind unincumbered with   passion  but the next morning  remembering her promise  while Lady   Mellasin and Miss Flora were engaged with the beaux and belles at their   levee  she slipped out  and taking a chair at the end of the street    went to the milliner s according to appointment  She doubted not but the   impatience of her lover would have brought him there long before her    and was very much amazed to find herself the first comer  She knew not    however  but some extraordinary accident  unforeseen by him  might have   happened to detain him longer than he expected  and from the whole   course of his past behaviour  could find no shadow of reason to suspect   him of a wilful remissness  She sat down in the shop  and amused herself   with talking to the woman on the new modes of dress  and such like   ordinary matters  but made not the least mention of the motive which had   brought her there that morning  and the other  not knowing whether it   would be proper to take any notice  was also silent on that occasion    but Miss Betsy observed she often turned her head towards the window    and ran to the door  looking up and down the street  as if she expected   somebody who was not yet come       Miss Betsy could not forbear being shocked at a disappointment  which   was the last thing in the world she could have apprehended  She had    notwithstanding  the patience to wait from a little past eleven till   near two o clock  expecting  during every moment of that time  that he   would either come or send some excuse for not doing so  but finding he   did neither  and that it was near the hour in which Mr  Goodman usually   dined  she took her leave of the woman  and went home full of   agitations       The maid  who was in the secret  happening to open the door  and Miss   Betsy looking around and perceiving there was nobody in hearing  said to   hear   Nanny  are you sure you delivered my letter safe into Mr    Saving s hand     Sure  Miss   cried the wench   yes  as sure as I am   alive  and he gave me a good Queen Anne s guinea for my trouble  I have   not had time since to put it up   continued she  taking it out of her   bosom   here it is     Well  then  what did he say on receiving it     said Miss Betsy   I never saw a man so transported   replied she   he   put it to his mouth  and kissed it with such an eagerness  I thought he   would have devoured it   Miss Betsy asked no farther questions  but went   up to her chamber to pull off her hood  not being able to know how she   ought to judge of this adventure       She was soon called down to dinner  but her mind was too much perplexed   to suffer her to eat much       She was extremely uneasy the whole day for an explanation of what at   present seemed so mysterious  and this gave her little less pain than   perhaps she would have felt had she been possessed with an equal share   of love  but in the evening her natural vivacity got the better  and not   doubting but the next morning she should receive a letter with a full   eclaircissement of this affair  she enjoyed the same sweet repose as if   nothing had happened to ruffle her temper       The morning
