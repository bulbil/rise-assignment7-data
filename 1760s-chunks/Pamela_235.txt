In all things but these  my dear  continued   he  I expect you to be a lady  And my good mother was one of this   oldfashioned cut  and  in all other respects  as worthy a lady as any in   the kingdom  And so you have not been used to the new way  and may the   easier practise the other       Dear sir  said I  pray give me more of your sweet injunctions  Why   then  continued he  I shall  in the usual course  and generally  if not   hindered by company  like to go to bed with my dearest by eleven  and    if I don t  shan t hinder you  I ordinarily now rise by six in summer  I   will allow you to be half an hour after me  or so       Then you ll have some time you may call your own  till you give me your   company to breakfast  which may be always so  as that we may have done   at a little after nine       Then will you have several hours again at your disposal  till two   o clock  when I shall like to sit down at table       You will then have several useful hours more to employ yourself in  as   you shall best like  and I would generally go to supper by eight  and   when we are resolved to stick to these oldfashioned rules  as near as   we can  we shall have our visitors conform to them too  and expect them   from us  and suit themselves accordingly  For I have always observed    that it is in every one s power to prescribe rules to himself  It is   only standing a few ridiculous jests at first  and that too from such    generally  as are not the most worthy to be minded  and  after a while    they will say  It signifies nothing to ask him  he will have his own   way  There is no putting him out of his bias  He is a regular piece of   clock work  they will joke  and all that  And why  my dear  should we   not be so  For man is as frail a piece of machinery as any clock work   whatever  and  by irregularity  is as subject to be disordered       Then  my dear  continued the charming man  when they see they are   received  at my own times  with an open countenance and cheerful heart    when they see plenty and variety at my board  and meet a kind and   hearty welcome from us both  they will not offer to break in upon my   conditions  nor grudge me my regular hours  And as most of these people   have nothing to do  except to rise in a morning  they may as well come   to breakfast with us at half an hour after eight  in summer  as at ten   or eleven  to dinner at two  as at four  five  or six  and to supper   at eight  as at ten or eleven  And then our servants  too  will know    generally  the times of their business  and the hours of their leisure   or recess  and we  as well as they  shall reap the benefits of   this regularity  And who knows  my dear  but we may revive the good   oldfashion in our neighbourhood  by this means   At least it will be   doing our parts towards it  and answering the good lesson I learned at   school  Every one mend one  And the worst that will happen will be  that   when some of my brother rakes  such as those who broke in upon us  so   unwelcomely  last Thursday  are got out of the way  if that can ever be    and begin to consider who they shall go to dine with in their rambles    they will only say  We must not go to him  for his dinner time is over    and so they ll reserve me for another time  when they happen to suit it   better  or  perhaps  they will take a supper and a bed with me instead   of it       Now  my dearest  continued the kind man  you see here are more of my   injunctions  as you call them  and though I will not be so set  as to   quarrel  if they are not always exactly complied with  yet  as I know   you won t think them unreasonable  I shall be glad they may  as often as   they can  and you will give your orders accordingly to your Mrs  Jervis    who is a good woman  and will take pleasure in obeying you
