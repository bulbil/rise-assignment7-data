could easily be perceived that Olivia s anguish was still greater  After any of these interviews between her lovers  of which there were several  she usually retired to solitude  and there indulged her grief  It was in such a situation I found her one evening  after she had been for some time supporting a fictitious gayety —   You now see  my child    said I    that your confidence in Mr  Thornhill s passion was all a dream  he permits the rivalry of another  every way his inferior  though he knows it lies in his power to secure you by a candid declaration himself    —   Yes  pappa    returned she    but he has his reasons for this delay  I know he has  The sincerity of his looks and words convince me of his real esteem   Page  171  A short time  I hope  will discover the generosity of his sentiments  and convince you that my opinion of him has been more just than yours    —   Olivia  my darling    returned I    every scheme that has been hitherto pursued to compel him to a declaration  has been proposed and planned by yourself  nor can you in the least say that I have constrained you  But you must not suppose  my dear  that I will be ever instrumental in suffering his honest rival to be the dupe of your ill placed passion  Whatever time you require to bring your fancied admirer to an explanation shall be granted  but at the expiration of that term  if he is still regardless  I must absolutely insist that honest Mr  Williams shall be rewarded for his fidelity  The character which I have hitherto supported in life demands this from me  and my tenderness  as a parent  shall never influence my integrity as a man  Name then your day  let it be as distant as you think proper  and in the mean time take care to let  Page  172  Mr  Thornhill know the exact time on which I design delivering you up to another  If he really loves you  his own good sense will readily suggest that there is but one method alone to prevent his losing you for ever    —This proposal  which she could not avoid considering as perfectly just  was readily agreed to  She again renewed her most positive promise of marrying Mr  Williams  in case of the other s insensibility  and at the next opportunity  in Mr  Thornhill s presence  that day month was fixed upon for her nuptials with his rival     Such vigorous proceedings seemed to redouble Mr  Thornhill s anxiety  but what Olivia really felt gave me some uneasiness  In this struggle between prudence and passion  her vivacity quite forsook her  and every opportunity of solitude was sought  and spent in tears  One week passed away  but her lover made no efforts to restrain her nuptials  The succeeding week he was still assiduous  but not more open  On the  Page  173  third he discontinued his visits entirely  and instead of my daughter testifying any impatience  as I expected  she seemed to retain a pensive tranquillity  which I looked upon as resignation  For my own part  I was now sincerely pleased with thinking that my child was going to be secured in a continuance of competence and peace  and frequently applauded her resolution  It was within about four days of her intended nuptials  that my little family at night were gathered round a charming fire  telling stories of the past  and laying schemes for the future  Busied in forming a thousand projects  and laughing at whatever folly came uppermost    Well  Moses    cried I    we shall soon  my boy  have a wedding in the family  what is your opinion of matters and things in general    —   My opinion  father  is  that all things go on very well  and I was just now thinking  that when sister Livy is married to farmer Williams  we shall then have the loan of his cyderpress and brewing tubs for nothing    —   That  Page  174  we shall  Moses    cried I    and he will sing us Death and the Lady  to raise our spirits into the bargain    —   He has taught that song to our Dick    cried Moses    and I think he goes thro  it very prettily    —   Does he so    cried I    then let us have it  where s little Dick  let him up with it boldly    —   My brother Dick    cried Bill my youngest    is just gone out with sister Livy  but Mr  Williams has taught me two songs  and I ll sing them for you  pappa  Which song do you chuse  the Dying Swan or the Elegy on the death of a mad dog     The elegy  child  by all means    said I    I never heard that yet  and Deborah  my life
