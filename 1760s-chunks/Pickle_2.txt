 mouth  as no art or affectation could contract into any proportionable  dimension  then her piety was rather peevish than resigned  and did  not in the least diminish a certain stateliness in her demeanour and  conversation  that delighted in communicating the importance and honour  of her family  which  by the bye  was not to be traced two generations  back by all the power of heraldry or tradition   She seemed to have renounced all the ideas she had acquired before her  father served the office of sheriff  and the eye which regulated the  dates of all her observation  was the mayoralty of her papa  Nay  so  solicitous was this good lady for the support and propagation of the  family name  that  suppressing every selfish motive  she actually  prevailed upon her brother to combat with his own disposition  and  even surmount it so far  as to declare a passion for the person whom he  afterwards wedded  as we shall see in the sequel  Indeed  she was the  spur that instigated him in all his extraordinary undertakings  and I  question  whether he would or not have been able to disengage himself  from that course of life in which he had so long mechanically moved   unless he had been roused and actuated by her incessant exhortations   London  she observed  was a receptacle of iniquity  where an honest   unsuspecting man was every day in danger of falling a sacrifice to  craft  where innocence was exposed to continual temptations  and virtue  eternally persecuted by malice and slander  where everything was ruled  by caprice and corruption  and merit utterly discouraged and despised   This last imputation she pronounced with such emphasis and chagrin  as  plainly denoted how far she considered herself as an example of what she  advanced  and really the charge was justified by the constructions that  were put upon her retreat by her female friends  who  far from imputing  it to the laudable motives that induced her  insinuated  in sarcastic  commendations  that she had good reason to be dissatisfied with a place  where she had been so overlooked  and that it was certainly her  wisest course to make her last effort in the country  where  in all  probability  her talents would be less eclipsed  and her fortune more  attractive   Be this as it will  her admonitions  though they were powerful enough to  convince  would have been insufficient to overcome the languor and  vis inertiae of her brother  had she not reinforced her arguments  by  calling in question the credit of two or three merchants  with whom he  was embarked in trade   Alarmed at these hints of intelligence  he exerted himself effectually   he withdrew his money from trade  and laying it out in Bank stock  and  India bonds  removed to a house in the country  which his father had  built near the sea side  for the convenience of carrying on a certain  branch of traffic in which he had been deeply concerned   Here then Mr  Pickle fixed his habitation for life  in the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   six and thirtieth year of his age  and though the pangs he felt at  parting with his intimate companions  and quitting all his former  connections  were not quite so keen as to produce any dangerous disorder  in his constitution  he did not fail to be extremely disconcerted at his  first entrance into a scene of life to which he was totally a stranger   Not but that he met with abundance of people in the country  who  in  consideration of his fortune  courted his acquaintance  and breathed  nothing but friendship and hospitality  yet  even the trouble of  receiving and returning these civilities was an intolerable fatigue to  a man of his habits and disposition  He therefore left the care of  the ceremonial to his sister  who indulged herself in all the pride of  formality  while he himself  having made a discovery of a public house  in the neighbourhood  went thither every evening and enjoyed his pipe  and can  being very well satisfied with the behaviour of the landlord   whose communicative temper was a great comfort to his own taciturnity   for he shunned all superfluity of speech  as much as he avoided any  other unnecessary expense   CHAPTER II    He is made acquainted with the Characters of Commodore Trunnion and his  Adherents  Meets with them by Accident  and contracts an Intimacy with  that Commander   This loquacious publican soon gave him sketches of all the characters  in the county  and  among others  described that of his next neighbour   Commodore Trunnion  which was altogether singular and odd   The  commodore and your worship   said he   will in a short time be hand and  glove  he has a power of money  and spends it like a prince  that is  in  his own way  for to be sure he is a little humorsome  as the saying is   and swears woundily  though I ll be sworn he means no more harm than a
