 the King threw down his warder  and the heralds interposed  Richard ordered their lances to be taken away  and banished the Duke of Hereford for ten years  and the Duke of Norfolk for life  Nothing could be a stronger proof of that unaccountable error  which ever attended this King s designs  than this behaviour  the one was condemned   147 to exile  without being charged with any offence  and the other  without being convicted of any crime  The whole kingdom was displeased at the disappointment  and this determination  in those ferocious times  even seemed to argue cowardice in the King  The Duke of Norfolk was overwhelmed with grief and despondence  at the judgment awarded against him  he retired to Venice  where  in a little time  he died of sorrow and chagrin  Hereford  on the contrary  bore his fate with great resignation  and behaved with such respectful submission  when he went to take his leave  that the King remitted four years of his exile  From this he withdrew to Paris  where he met with a favourable reception from the French King  and  in all probability  would have married the only daughter of the Duke of Berry  had not the match been interrupted by the interposition of Richard  who sent the Earl of Salisbury  as his ambassador  to represent Hereford as a person who had been guilty of treasonable practices  and to assure the French court  that he would never be permitted to return to his own country  The Princes of the blood  alarmed at this declaration  broke off the match abruptly  and  when Hereford expostulated with them on the subject  made him acquainted with their reasons for retracting the assent they had already given to his proposal  Such complicated injuries could not fail to aggravate the resentment of the Duke against Richard  which he had hitherto concealed  and these  probably  first turned his thoughts upon acquiring the crown of England  No man could be better qualified for a project of this nature than the Duke of Hereford  he was cool  cautious  discerning  and resolute  he had distinguished himself by his   148 courage  both at home and abroad  he was the idol of the soldiery  and the favourite of the people  he was immensely rich  and  by blood or alliance  connected with all the noblemen in England  The greatest part of the kingdom not only murmured  but loudly exclaimed against the sentence of banishment which had been denounced against him  and ardently wished for an opportunity of doing him justice     It was not long before they were gratified in this particular  his father  the Duke of Lancaster  dying in February  the banished Duke of Hereford ought to have succeeded to his titles and estate  by virtue of his hereditary right  as well as of the letters patent which he had obtained  even after his sentence at Coventry  But Richard  notwithstanding his former grants  allured by the greatness of the prize  by a sentence no less unjust than avaricious  seized the deceased Duke s effects and estate  and decreed that the son s banishment should be perpetual  The laws and liberties of the people were now in a most deplorable state  there was scarce a man in the kingdom able  though all were willing  to oppose the arbitrary power usurped by the King  Finding himself above all restraint  he gave himself up to a soft and effeminate life  regardless of the good of the public  His ministers  not to be behind their Monarch  gave little attention to business  but saw  without any concern  the English nation fall into the utmost contempt  In this situation the people naturally turned their eyes upon the banished Duke  as the only person from whom they could expect redress  he was stimulated by private injuries  and had alliance and interest to give weight to his measures    149 The malecontents only waited for the absence of the King  to put these measures into execution   For this an occasion soon offered  the Earl of Marche  presumptive heir of the crown  having been appointed the King s Lieutenant in Ireland  was slain  in a skirmish  by the native Irish  and Richard was so incensed at this  that  with a numerous army  he went over to revenge his death in person  The Duke of Lancaster   for this was the title which the Duke of Hereford assumed after his father s death  being informed of Richard s departure from England  with three small vessels  landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire  at first only pretending that his sole aim was to obtain justice  The Earl of Northumberland  who had long been a malecontent  and Henry Piercy  his son  sirnamed Hotspur  immediately joined him with some troops  after this junction  the concourse of people coming to list under his banner was so great  that  in a few days  his army was threescore thousand strong  so eager were the nobles and people to put themselves under the protection of a Prince  who allured them with the prospect of freedom   Whilst these things were transacting in England  Richard was in Ireland in perfect security  the contrary winds  which continued to blow above three weeks  hindered his
