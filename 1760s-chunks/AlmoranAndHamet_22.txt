 whose whole power will be   exerted to oppress you  that he may enrich himself        A new fire was now kindled in their eyes  and their cheeks glowed with   indignation at the wrongs that threatened them  they were no longer   disposed to act upon the principles of fatality  as they had perversely   understood them  and they argued at once like reasonable and free   beings  whose actions were in their choice  and who had no doubt but   that their actions would produce adequate effects  They recollected that   OMAR had  in the reign of Solyman  often rescued them from such   oppression  as now threatened them  and that the power of HAMET had   since interposed in their behalf  when ALMORAN would have stretched his   prerogative to their hurt  or have left them a prey to the farmer of a   tax   Shall HAMET   said they   be deprived of the power  that he   employs only for our benefit  and shall it center in ALMORAN  who will   abuse it to our ruin  Shall we rather support ALMORAN in the wrong he   has done to HAMET  than HAMET to obtain justice of ALMORAN  HAMET is   our king  let him command us  and we will obey   This was uttered with a   shout that ecchoed from the mountains beyond the city  and continued   near a full hour  In the mean time  the multitude was increasing every   moment  and the troops that lay in and near the city  having taken arms    fell in with the stream  they were secretly attached to HAMET  under   whose eye they had been formed  and of whose bounty they had often   partaken  and their fear being removed by the general cry  which left   them no room to apprehend an opposition in favour of ALMORAN  they were   now at full liberty to follow their inclinations       In the mean time  ALMORAN  who had retired to the innermost court of the   palace  had heard the tumult  and was alarmed for his safety  he ran   from room to room  confused and terrified  without attempting or   directing any thing either for his defence or escape  yet he sent every   moment to know the state of the insurrection  and to what end its force   would be directed       Among those whom accident rather than choice had attached to the   interest of ALMORAN  were Osmyn and Caled  they were both distinguished   by his favour  and each had conceived hopes that  if he should possess   the throne alone  he would delegate his authority to him  ALMORAN now   ordered them to take the command of the troops  that were appointed to   attend his person as their peculiar duty  with as many others as had not   declared for HAMET  and to secure all the avenues that led to his   seraglio       OMAR and HAMET were now on horseback  and had begun to form the troops   that had joined them  and as many others as were armed  which were   before mingled together in a confused multitude  An account of this was   brought to ALMORAN by Osmyn  and threw him into a perturbation and   perplexity  that disgraced his character  and confounded his attendants    He urged Osmyn  in whom he most confided  to dispatch  without giving   him any orders to execute  then turning from him  he uttered  in a low   and inarticulate voice  the most passionate exclamations of distress and   terror  being struck with the thought that his guard might betray him    when he recollected himself  and perceived that Osmyn was still present    he burst into a rage  and snatching out his poignard  he swore by the   soul of the Prophet  that if he did not instantly attempt something  he   would stab him to the heart  Osmyn drew back trembling and confused  but   having yet received no orders  he would have spoken  but ALMORAN drove   him from his presence with menaces and execrations       The moment that Osmyn left him  his rage subsided in his fears  and his   fears were mingled with remorse   Which way soever I turn   said he   I   see myself surrounded by destruction  I have incensed Osmyn by   unreasonable displeasure  and causeless menaces  He must regard me at   once with abhorrence and contempt  and it is impossible  but he should   revolt to HAMET        In this agony  the terrors of futurity rushed upon his mind with all   their force  and he darted as if at the bite of a scorpion   To me     said he   death  that now approaches  will be but the beginning of   sorrow  I
