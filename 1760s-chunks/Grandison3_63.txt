He roared out  that he was a dead man        A second fellow had got up to the window  and was half in  He called out  to a third below  to hasten up after him on a ladder  which was generally left in an outhouse near the little garden        I hastened to this second fellow  who then fired a pistol  but happily missed me  and who  feeling my sword s point in his arm  threw himself  with a little of my help  out of the window  upon the third fellow  who was mounting the ladder  and knocked him off  And then both made their escape by the way they came        The fellow within had fainted  and lay weltering in his blood        By this time  the two women servants had let in our men  who had been alarmed by the report of the pistol  and by the report of the pistol  and by the screams of the women from their window  for they ventured not out of their chamber till they were called upon for entrance  by their fellow servant from below        The two footmen  by my direction  bound up the ruffian s shoulder  They dragged him down into the hall  He soon came to himself  and offered to make an ample confession        Poor Mr  Danby had crept into my room  and in   155 a corner of it had fainted away  We recovered him with difficulty        The fellow confessed  before a magistrate  the whole villainy  and who set him at work  The other two  being disabled by their bruises from flying far  were apprehended next day  The vile brother was sent after to Dunkirk  according to the intelligence given of him by the fellows  but he having informed himself of what had happened  got over from Calais to Dover        The wounded man  having lost much blood  recovered not  They were all three ordered to be executed  but  being interceded for  the surviving villains were sent to the gallies        It seems they knew nothing of Mr  Danby s having a guest with him  If they had  they owned they would have made their attempt another night      We were about to deliver our sentiments on this extraordinary event  when Sir Charles  turning to Lady L  Let me ask you  said he  the servant being withdrawn  Has Charlotte found out her own mind   Yes  yes  Sir  I believe she has opened all her heart to Miss Byron   Then I shall know more of it in ten minutes  than Charlotte would let me know in as many hours   Stand by  every body  said the humorous Lady—Let me get up  and make my brother one of my best courtesies   Sir Charles was just then called out to a messenger  who brought him Letters from town  He returned to us  his complexion heightened  and a little discomposed   I intended  madam  said he  to me  to have craved the honour of your company for half an hour in my Lord s library  on the subject we were talking of  But these Letters require my immediate attention  The messenger must return with my answer to two of   156 them  early in the morning  You will have the goodness  looking round him  to dispense with my attendance on you at supper  But perhaps  madam  to me  you will be so good  as  in one word  to say  No  or Yes  for Charlotte   Miss Gr  What  Sir to be given up without a preface —I beg your pardon  Less than ten words shall not do  I assure you  tho  from my sister Harriet   Sir Ch  Who given up  Charlotte  yourself  If so  I have my answer   Miss Gr  Or Lord G —I have not said which  Would you have my poor Lord rejected by a slighting monosyllable only   Lady L  Mad girl   Miss Gr  Why  Lady L  don t you see that Sir Charles wants to take me by implication  But my Lord G  is neither so soon lost  nor Charlotte so easily won  Harriet  if you would give up yourself at a first question  then I will excuse you if you give up me as easily  but not else   Harriet  If Sir Charles thinks a conference upon the subject unnecessary—Pray don t let us give him the trouble of holding one  His time  you see  is very precious   Can you guess  Lucy  at the humour I was in when I said this —If you think it was a very good one  you are mistaken  yet I was sorry for it afterwards  Foolish self betrayer  Why should I seem to wish for a conference with him  But that was not all—To be petulant with such a one  when his heart was distressed
