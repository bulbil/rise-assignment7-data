 inasmuch as I could neither flatter nor pimp for courtiers  nor prostitute my pen in defence of a wicked and contemptible administration —Before I could form one feasible project  I fell asleep  and my fancy was blessed with the image of my dear Narcissa  who seemed to smile upon my passion  and offer her hand as a reward for all my toils     Early in the morning  I went to the lodgings of my friend  whom I found exulting over his happy invention  for I no sooner entered his apartment  than he addressed me in these words  with a smile of self applause     Well  Mr  Random  a lucky thought may come into a fool s head sometimes —I have hit it—I ll hold you a button my plan is better than yours  for all your learning —But you shall have the preference in this as in all other things  therefore proceed  and let us know the effects of your meditation —and then I will impart my own simple excogitations  —  I told him  that not one thought occurred to me   77 which deserved the least notice  and signified my impatience to be acquainted with the fruits of his reflection —   As we have not  said he  money sufficient to maintain us during a tedious expectation  it is my opinion  that a bold push must be made  and I see none so likely to succeed as your appearing in the character of a gentleman  which is your due  and making your addresses to some lady of fortune who can render you independant at once —Nay  don t stare—I affirm that this scheme is both prudent and honourable  for I would not have you throw yourself away upon an old  toothless  wheezing dame  whose breath would stink you into a consumption in less than three months  neither would I advise you to assume the character of a wealthy  Squire  as your common fortune hunters do  by which means many a poor lady is cheated into matrimony  and instead of enjoying the pomp and grandeur that was promised  sees her dowry seized by her husband s rapacious creditors  and herself reduced to misery and despair —No  I know you have a soul that disdains such imposition  and are master of qualifications both of mind and body  which alone entitle you to a match  that will set you above the world —I have cloaths in my possession  that a Duke need not be ashamed to wear —I believe they will fit you as they are—if not  there are plenty of taylors in France —Let us take a short trip to Paris  and provide ourselves in all other necessaries  then set out for England  where I intend to do myself the honour of attending you in quality of valet —This will save you the expence of a   78 servant  shaving and dressing  and I doubt not but by the blessing of God  we shall bring matters to a speedy and fortunate issue  —  Extravagant as this proposal was  I listened to it with pleasure  because it flattered my vanity  and indulged a ridiculous hope I began to entertain of inspiring Narcissa with a mutual flame     After breakfast  Monsieur d Estrapes went to pay his devoirs to the Marquis  and was so successful in his application  that I obtained a discharge in a few days  upon which we set out for Paris —Here I had time to reflect and congratulate myself upon this sudden transition of fate  which to bear with moderation  required some degree of philosophy and self denial —This will be more obvious  if I give a detail of the particulars  to the quiet possession of which I was raised in an instant  from the most abject misery and contempt —My wardrobe consisted of five fashionable coats full mounted  two of which were plain  one of cut velvet  one trimed with gold  and another with silver lace  two frocks  one of white drab with large plate buttons  the other of blue  with gold binding  one waistcoat of gold brocard  one of blue sattin  embroidered with silver  one of green silk  trimmed with broad figured gold lace  one of black silk  with figures  one of white sattin  one of black cloth  and one of scarlet  six pair of cloth breeches  one pair of crimson  and another of black velvet  twelve pair of white silk stockings  as many of black silk  and the same number of fine cotton  one hat  laced with gold point d  Espagne  another with silver lace scolloped  a third with gold binding  and a fourth plain  three dozen of fine ruffled shirts  as many neckcloths  one dozen   79 of cambrick handkerchiefs  and the like number of silk  The other moveables which I possessed by the generosity and friendship of Strap  were  a gold watch with a chased case  two valuable diamond rings  two mourning swords  one with a silver handle  and a fourth cut steel inlaid with gold  a diamond stock buckle  and a set of stone buckles for the knees and shoes  a pair of silver mounted pistols with rich housings  a gold headed cane  and a snuff box of tortoise shell mounted with gold  having the picture of a lady in
