apprehensions that surrounded me in this house  to which she  and the doctor had been the principal cause of my coming  for my lord  had haunted and importuned them incessantly on this subject  protesting  that he loved me with the most inviolable affection  and all he desired  was  that I would sit at his table  manage his family  and share his  fortune  By these professions  uttered with an air of honesty and  good nature  he had imposed himself upon them for the best tempered  creature upon earth  and they used all their influence with me to take  him into favour  This has been the case with a great many people  who  had but a superficial knowledge of his disposition  but  in the course  of their acquaintance  they have never failed to discern and acknowledge  their mistake    The doctor  on his return from Tunbridge  to which place he had made a  trip by himself  found me ill abed  and the whole family in confusion   Surprised and concerned at this disorder  he entered into expostulation  with my lord  who owned  that the cause of his displeasure and disquiet  was no other than jealousy  He had informed him  that I had been seen  to walk out with Mr  Bal   in a morning  and that our correspondence had  been observed  with many additional circumstances  which were absolutely  false and groundless  This imputation was no sooner understood  than it  was resolved that the accuser should be examined in presence of us all   He accordingly appeared  exceedingly drunk  though it was morning  and  repeated the articles of the charge  as an information he had received  from a man who came from town to hang the bells  and was long ago  returned to London    This was an instance of his cunning and address  which did not forsake  him even in his hours of intoxication  Had he fixed the calumny on any  one of the servants  he would have been confronted and detected in his  falsehood  Nevertheless  though he could not be legally convicted   it plainly appeared that he was the author of this defamation  which  incensed Mr  Bal   to such a degree  that he could scarce be withheld  from punishing him on the spot  by manual chastisement  However  he  was prevailed upon to abstain from such immediate vengeance  as a step  unworthy of his character  and the affair was brought to this issue   that his lordship should either part with me or Mr  H    for I was fully  determined against living under the same roof with such an incendiary    This alternative being proposed  my lord dismissed his steward  and we  returned to town with the doctor and Mrs  S    for I had imbibed such  horror and aversion for this country seat  though one of the pleasantest  in England  that I could not bear to live in it  We therefore removed to  a house in Bond street  where  according to the advice of my friends  I  exerted my whole power and complaisance in endeavours to keep my husband    6 22 15  3 45 PM   in good humour  but was so unsuccessful in my attempts  that  if ever he  was worse tempered  more capricious  or intolerable  at one time than at  another  this was the season in which his ill humour predominated in the  most rancorous degree  I was scarce ever permitted to stir abroad  saw  nobody at home  but my old male friend  whom I have mentioned above  and  the doctor  with his lady  from whose conversation  also  I was at last  excluded    Nevertheless  I contrived to steal a meeting now and then with my late  benefactor  for whom I entertained a great share of affection  exclusive  of that gratitude that was due to his generosity  It was not his fault  that I compromised matters with my lord  for he was as free of his purse  as I was unwilling to use it  It would  therefore  have been unfriendly   unkind  and ungrateful in me  now that I was in affluence  to avoid all  intercourse with a man who had supported me in adversity  I think people  cannot be too shy and scrupulous in receiving favours  but once they are  conferred  they ought never to forget the obligation  And I was never  more concerned at any incident of my life  than at hearing that this  gentleman did not receive a letter  in which I acknowledged the last  proof of his friendship and liberality which I had occasion to use   because I have since learned that he suspected me of neglect    But to return to my situation in Bond street  I bore it as well as I  could for the space of three months  during which I lived in the midst  of spies  who were employed to watch my conduct  and underwent every  mortification that malice  power  and folly could inflict  Nay  so
