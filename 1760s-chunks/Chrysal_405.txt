sale neither   could do such great things  My novel  I thought    bade as fair for a good run  as anything   it was seasoned high to   the taste of the times  and yet it did very little more than pay          The sale   Ha   ha   ha   No  no   I did not depend upon that    My profit came in another way entirely         What can be your meaning   If it be not too great a secret    I should be much obliged to you to explain this matter  It may   possibly be of service to me          Why  on that account  and as I think I can depend upon your   honour  I don t much care if I do  If you are so much surprised    at my saying that I made my fortune by that pamphlet  what will   you think when I tell you further that I never wrote one line of it    nor was I any more concerned in the sale than you  who knew nothing   â  of the matter   But not to perplex you with guessing at what it   is impossible you should ever discover  You can be no stranger   to the noise that impostor made when he first came here  While   he did no more than tell his own story  it was thought  by his own   fraternity  to be the best way not to give it consequence by contra    dicting it  but let it die away of itself   beside  that possibly it might   not have been so easy to contradict it to any effect  while the persons    concerned were all living  and the facts fresh in everyone s memory    But when he went so far as to attack the whole body  and was   evidently undermining the foundation upon which they stood  by   tearing off the veil of antiquityi behind which they hid themselves    and exposing all their mystery to light  the matter became more   serious  and it was judged necessary to ruin his character   in order to invalidate the credit of his work  the merit of which   made a direct attack not only difficult  but also too doubtful of   success to hazard an affair of such importance upon it        For this reason  heaven and hell were conjured up  and every   engine set at work to prove his story of himself false in every par    ticular  and make him appear the most complicated villain that   ever existed  But the credit of those who made this attack upon   him was too low for it to have any effect  as their principles  and   the interested motives upon which they proceeded  were sufficiently   knovni  so that it only did him service by showing his consequence    While they were considering how to repair this defeat  necessity   suggested to me the lucky thought of offering them my assistance    I had already got some degree of credit by anticipating time in the   detection of two silly impostors   the absurdity of which would soon   have discovered them without my help  This gave weight to my   offer  Accordingly  they readily embraced it  and  desiring only       Alluding to Bower s History of the Pope   Bower stated that he had   intended to vindicate the doctrine of the Pope s supremacy  but had   been converted by the evidence to take the contrary view  Douglas   proved the authenticity of certain incriminating letters of Bower s   that had recently been published  and exposed his private character      2 William Lauder and Elizabeth Canning  see  487           490 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     the sanction of my name  for which  you may judge  I was well   paid   took all the trouble upon themselves        The reason which defeated them assisted me  Everything I was   thought to say carried weight  as appearing to proceed from the   highest candour and attachment to truth  as nothing else could   naturally be supposed to have made me take such pains to detect   an imposture  so favourable to the principles I professed myself    The public also had got enough of his story  and was ready to listen   to one against him  The consequence you know  His character   was ruined with the public  and of course a prejudice raised against   his work  which ruined that also  without the trouble of a regular   confutation  which  as I observed before  might not have been an   easy matter  and now T hope the mystery is explained to you           CHAPTER LVI
