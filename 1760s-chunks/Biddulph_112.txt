be sure you do it discreetly  and take care not to mention that paultry circumstance of her settlement  or any other private agreement with Pivet  I know Mrs Arnold’s delicacy would be hurt by the knowlege of this  therefore beware of dropping the least hint of it  at your peril  Tell Lady Bidulph I will pray devoutly for her daughter’s happiness  if what I have done will promote it  it will not a little contribute to my own  tho’ I begin to feel it is not to be expected in this life  at least by such a hopeless wanderer as I am   I could sit now  and indite melancholy verses  or write an elegy  or make my will  or do any other splenetic thing  in short  I have a good mind to turn monk and go into a monastery  I am sure I should have lady Bidulph’s vote for that   Adieu  my dear Bidulph  you will not hear from me again  perhaps  till I am in another region   Nov  30   December 17  What a strange man this is  my Cecilia  The more I reflect on his conduct  the more I am amazed  What a mixture is there in his nature  Wild to a romantic degree in his conceptions  yet how steady  how resolute  how consistent  in putting those flights of fancy into act  Generous he certainly is  how few men would put themselves to the trouble and expence that he has done  from such a disinterested  such a compassionate motive  Nay  on the contrary  I believe most men would be cruel enough to take a sort of pleasure in the vexation of a man  who had succeeded to the love of a mistress  once so much valued  and would enjoy a mean triumph in being  though without reason  the object of his jealousy  who had cut them off from all hope   Mr Faulkland is above this  I think myself highly indebted to him  whether the scheme he has in so extraordinary a manner undertaken for my service succeeds or not  Yet do I wish from my heart  that the separation between Mr Arnold and Mrs Gerrarde had been brought about by any other means  What if Mr Arnold should ever come at    the truth  though I think that hardly possible   might it not leave him more estranged from me than he is even now  or if he should  in consequence of this odd adventure  return to his poor banished wife  repent of his injurious suspicions of her  and restore her to his confidence and love  can he  can he ever restore to her that peace she has so long been a stranger to  Will no latent sparks of former unkindness ever rekindle and light up the fire of discord  How unwillingly do we repair the unprovoked injuries which we find we have done to others  Poor Mr Arnold  if I am so happy as to have my innocence cleared to him  how miserable will his own reflections make him  but if he is convinced  which has been my daily and hourly prayers   he shall not be unhappy  if I can make him otherwise  Oh  my dear  it is the wish  the ardent longing of my soul  to recover the esteem  though I lose the love  of Mr Arnold  for I call that Being to witness  who knows the secrets of all hearts  that since I have been his wife  I have never  even in thought  swerved from that perfect and inviolable fidelity which I vowed to him  What then must have been my sufferings  deprived of his love  cast out from his house  and branded with the dreadful name of an Adultress  For where is the difference between the intention and the act  To me there is no distinction  and the husband must be gross that makes one   My mother has suffered me to tell her the substance of Mr Faulkland’s letters  though she would not read them  I own I was better satisfied that she should receive her information thus  because his light manner of expressing himself in many places would have given her great offence  Sir George did not consider this when he submitted the letters to my mother’s as well as my perusal  Many grave animadversions did she make during my recital  and many times lift up her eyes in wonder at Mrs Gerrarde’s behaviour  She often said Mr Faulkland was frantic to undertake such a thing  and wished he had not taken such a terrible woman in hand  When I came to that part of the account where Mrs Gerrarde had been prevailed on to write to Mr Arnold  I begged she would give me leave to read the copy of the letter to her  as I assured her there was nothing in it but would give her pleasure   She consented  and I read it  leaving out Mr Faulkland’s apostrophes  My mother did not interrupt me  and finding she continued silent when I came to the conclusion  I looked at her  and saw tears running down her cheeks  Yes  my dear  my innocent child  said she  passionately throwing her arms round me  you were    wronged  God knows you were wronged  and
