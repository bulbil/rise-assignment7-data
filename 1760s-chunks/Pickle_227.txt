who were wiser than ourselves   and saw that nothing was so proper for us as a little repose    But how shall I relate the deplorable transition from envied happiness  to excess of misery which I now sustained  My month was hardly up  when  my dear husband was taken ill  perhaps the fatigue of body  as well as  mind  which he had undergone on my account  occasioned a fatal ferment  in his blood  and his health fell a sacrifice to his love  Physicians  were called from London  but alas  they brought no hopes of his  recovery  By their advice  he was removed to town  for the convenience    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of being punctually attended  Every moment was too precious to be thrown  away  he was therefore immediately put into the coach  though the day  was far spent  and I  though exceedingly weak  accompanied him in the  journey  which was performed by the light of flambeaus  and rendered  unspeakingly shocking by the dismal apprehension of losing him every  moment    At length  however  we arrived at our lodgings in Pall Mall  where I  lay by him on the floor  and attended the issue of his distemper in all  the agonies of horror and despair  In a little time his malady  settled upon his brain  and  in his delirium  he uttered such dreadful  exclamations  as were sufficient to pierce the most savage heart  What  effect then must they have had on mine  which was fraught with every  sentiment of the most melting affection  It was not a common grief that  took possession of my soul  I felt all the aggravation of the most acute  distress  I sometimes ran down the street in a fit of distraction  I  sent for the doctors every minute  I wearied Heaven with my prayers   even now my heart aches at the remembrance of what I suffered  and I  cannot  without trembling  proceed with the woeful story    After having lain insensible some days  he recovered the use of speech   and called upon my name  which he had a thousand times repeated while he  was bereft of reason  All hopes of his life were now relinquished  and  I was led to his bedside to receive his last adieus  being directed to  summon all my fortitude  and suppress my sorrow  that he might not be  disturbed by my agitation  I collected all my resolution to support me  in this affecting scene  I saw my dear lord in extremity  The beauties  of his youth were all decayed  yet his eyes  though languid  retained  unspeakable sweetness and expression  He felt his end approaching  put  forth his hand  and  with a look full of complacency and benevolence   uttered such a tender tale  good Heaven  how had I deserved such  accumulated affliction  the bare remembrance of which now melts me into  tears  Human nature could not undergo my situation without suffering an  ecstasy of grief  I clasped him in my arms  and kissed him a thousand  times  with the most violent emotions of woe  but I was torn from his  embrace  and in a little time he was ravished for ever from my view    On that fatal morning  which put a period to his life  I saw the  duchess of L   approach my bed  and  from her appearance  concluded that  he was no more  yet I begged she would not confirm the unhappy presage  by announcing his death  and she accordingly preserved the most emphatic  silence  I got up  and trod softly over his head  as if I had been  afraid of interrupting his repose  Alas  he was no longer sensible of  such disturbance  I was seized with a stupefaction of sorrow  I threw  up the window and  looking around  thought the sun shone with the most  dismal aspect  everything was solitary  cheerless  and replete with  horror    In this condition I was  by the direction of my friend  conveyed to  her house  where my faculties were so overpowered by the load of anguish  which oppressed me  that I know not what passed during the first days of  my unhappy widowhood  this only I know  the kind duchess treated me with  all imaginable care and compassion  and carried me to her country house   where I stayed some months  during which  she endeavoured to comfort  me with all the amusements she could invent  and laid me under  such obligations as shall never be erased from my remembrance  Yet   notwithstanding all her care and concern  I was  by my excess of grief     6 22 15  3 45 PM   plunged into a languishing distemper  for which my physicians advised me  to drink the Bath waters    In compliance with this prescription  I went thither towards the end of  summer  and found some benefit by adhering to their directions  Though  I seldom went abroad  except when I visited my
