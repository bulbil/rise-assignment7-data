O  said he  what pleasure you give me in this sweet foretaste of my   happiness  I will now defy the saucy  busy censurers of the world    and bid them know your excellence  and my happiness  before they  with   unhallowed lips  presume to judge of my actions  and your merit   And   let me tell you  my Pamela  that I can add my hopes of a still more   pleasing amusement  and what your bashful modesty would not permit you   to hint  and which I will no otherwise touch upon  lest it should   seem  to your nicety  to detract from the present purity of my good   intentions  than to say  I hope to have superadded to all these  such an   employment  as will give me a view of perpetuating my happy prospects    and my family at the same time  of which I am almost the only male       I blushed  I believe  yet could not be displeased at the decent and   charming manner with which he insinuated this distant hope  And oh    judge for me  how my heart was affected with all these things       He was pleased to add another charming reflection  which shewed me the   noble sincerity of his kind professions  I do own to you  my Pamela    said he  that I love you with a purer flame than ever I knew in my whole   life  a flame to which I was a stranger  and which commenced for you in   the garden  though you  unkindly  by your unseasonable doubts  nipped   the opening bud  while it was too tender to bear the cold blasts of   slight or negligence  And I know more sincere joy and satisfaction in   this sweet hour s conversation with you  than all the guilty tumults   of my former passion ever did  or  had even my attempts succeeded  ever   could have afforded me       O  sir  said I  expect not words from your poor servant  equal to these   most generous professions  Both the means  and the will  I now see  are   given to you  to lay me under an everlasting obligation  How happy   shall I be  if  though I cannot be worthy of all this goodness and   condescension  I can prove myself not entirely unworthy of it  But I   can only answer for a grateful heart  and if ever I give you cause    wilfully   and you will generously allow for involuntary imperfections     to be disgusted with me  may I be an outcast from your house and favour    and as much repudiated  as if the law had divorced me from you       But sir  continued I  though I was so unseasonable as I was in the   garden  you would  I flatter myself  had you then heard me  have   pardoned my imprudence  and owned I had some cause to fear  and to wish   to be with my poor father and mother  and this I the rather say    that you should not think me capable of returning insolence for your   goodness  or appearing foolishly ungrateful to you  when you was so kind   to me       Indeed  Pamela  said he  you gave me great uneasiness  for I love you   too well not to be jealous of the least appearance of your indifference   to me  or preference to any other person  not excepting your parents   themselves  This made me resolve not to hear you  for I had not got   over my reluctance to marriage  and a little weight  you know  turns the   scale  when it hangs in an equal balance  But yet  you see  that though   I could part with you  while my anger held  yet the regard I had then   newly professed for your virtue  made me resolve not to offer to violate   it  and you have seen likewise  that the painful struggle I underwent   when I began to reflect  and to read your moving journal  between my   desire to recall you  and my doubt whether you would return   though yet   I resolved not to force you to it   had like to have cost me a severe   illness  but your kind and cheerful return has dispelled all my fears    and given me hope  that I am not indifferent to you  and you see how   your presence has chased away my illness       I bless God for it  said I  but since you are so good as to encourage   me  and will not despise my weakness  I will acknowledge  that I   suffered more than I could have imagined  till I experienced it  in   being banished your presence in so much
