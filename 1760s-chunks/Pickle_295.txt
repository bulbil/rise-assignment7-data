affection and esteem   Nor was his gratitude confined to exterior civility  he offered him the  use of his interest at court  which was very powerful  and repeated his  desire of serving him so pressingly  that Peregrine thought he could not  dispense with the opportunity of assisting his absent friend Godfrey  in  whose behalf he begged the influence of his lordship   The earl  pleased with this request  which was another proof of the  young gentleman s benevolence  said  he would not fail to pay the utmost  regard to his recommendation  and in six weeks a captain s commission  was actually signed for the brother of Emilia  who was very agreeably  surprised at the intimation he received from the War Office  though  he was utterly ignorant of the canal through which he obtained that  promotion   CHAPTER LXXXV   Peregrine is celebrated as a Wit and Patron  and proceeds to entertain  himself at the Expense of whom it did concern   In the meantime  Peregrine flourished in the gay scenes of life  and   as I have already observed  had divers opportunities of profiting in the  way of marriage  had not his ambition been a little too inordinate  and  his heart still biased by a passion  which all the levity of youth could  not balance  nor all the pride of vanity overcome  Nor was our hero  unmarked in the world of letters and taste  he had signalized himself in  several poetical productions  by which he had acquired a good share of  reputation  not that the pieces were such as ought to have done much  honour to his genius  but any tolerable performance from a person of his  figure and supposed fortune  will always be considered by the bulk of  readers as an instance of astonishing capacity  though the very same  production  ushered into the world with the name of an author in less  affluent circumstances would be justly disregarded and despised  so  much is the opinion of most people influenced and overawed by ridiculous  considerations   Be this as it will  our young gentleman was no sooner distinguished  as an author  than he was marked out as a patron by all the starving  retainers to poetry  he was solemnised in odes  celebrated in epigrams   and fed with the milk of soft dedication  His vanity even relished this  incense  and  though his reason could not help despising those that  offered it  not one of them was sent away unowned by his munificence   He began to think himself  in good earnest  that superior genius which  their flattery had described  he cultivated acquaintance with the wits  of fashion  and even composed in secret a number of bon mots  which  he uttered in company as the impromptus of his imagination  In this  practice  indeed  he imitated some of the most renowned geniuses of the  age  who  if the truth were known  have laboured in secret  with the  sweat of their brows  for many a repartee which they have vended as the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   immediate production of fancy and expression  He was so successful in  this exercise of his talents  that his fame actually came in competition  with that great man who had long sat at the helm of wit  and  in a  dialogue that once happened between them  on the subject of a corkscrew   wherein the altercation was discharged  according to Bayes  slap for  slap  dash for dash  our hero was judged to have the better of his  lordship  by some of the minor satellites  that commonly surround and  reflect the rays of such mighty luminaries   In a word  he dipped himself so far in these literary amusements  that  he took the management of the pit into his direction  putting himself  at the head of those critics who call themselves the town  and in that  capacity chastised several players  who had been rendered insolent  and refractory by unmerited success  As for the new productions of the  stage  though generally unspirited and insipid  they always enjoyed the  benefit of his influence and protection  because he never disliked the  performance so much as he sympathized with the poor author  who stood  behind the scenes in the most dreadful suspense  trembling  as it were   on the very brink of damnation  Yet  though he extended his generosity  and compassion to the humble and needy  he never let slip one  opportunity of mortifying villainy and arrogance  Had the executive  power of the legislature been vested in him  he would have doubtless  devised strange species of punishment for all offenders against humanity  and decorum  but  restricted as he was  he employed his invention in  subjecting them to the ridicule and contempt of their fellow subjects   It was with this view he set on foot the scheme of conjuration  which  was still happily carried on  and made use of the intelligence of his  friend Cadwallader  though he sometimes converted this advantage to the  purposes of gallantry  being  as the reader may have perceived  of a  very amorous
