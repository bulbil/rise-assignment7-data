could  and then    going with his son to the seaside  they embarked for their nativo   country  in all the erultation of successful villany      But I went not with them  my British shape being of more value   in Europe than where he was going  My master left me with hia   banker  in exchange for the more fashionable coin of Spain  which   neighbourhood made better known there  My Hebrew master had   scarce left the banker  into whose hands he had given me  when in    came his Belgic friend  Van Hogan  all aghast at the news he had   received from him  and something else  which had come to his   knowledge since        Oh  Mynheer    said he    we are all blown up and undone  The   flood is pouring in upon us          What is the matter now  Mjmheer    replied the banker    that   throws you into this strange consternation   The worms have not   destroyed the dams  nor an earthquake swallowed up the Spice   Islands           Worse  worse  if possible  than even these  Those   stubborn    proud  self sufficient English have refused to release our ships that   were taken  carrying ammimition and provision to their enemies    80 that we are like not only to lose those ships  but also the advan    tage of the trade for the future  What can be done to avert this   blow           Eeally  Mjmheer  I cannot tell   the case is bad enough  to be   sure   but it is no more than was to be expected  It was not to   be thought that they would always remain such passive fools as   tamely to look on  while we supplied their enemies with necessaries   to carry on the war against them  without endeavouring to put a   stop to us          Death   I am almost mad to hear you talk thus   but say what   you will  my province shall never bear it  Why  I have received   advice this minute that all our ships  which were freighted for their   enemies  will be condemned  and that they are as little moved at   our menaces  as they were at our entreaties  If this continues    we shall not have a ship left in the Texel          Nay  mine shall escape  I am resolved          What will you do to save them           Not run them into the danger  Mjmheer          How  give up the trade           Most certainly  since it cannot be carried on with safety any   longer  and glad that I have come ofi so well         I do not understand you        â€¢ You are too warm  Mynheer  too sanguine in the pursuit of your   projects  While the surprise or fright of the late managers in   England gave me reason to think that they would not venture to       These dealings of the Dutch with the enemies of Britain  and the   consequent assertion of a right of search  were a sore point throughout   the long wars with France  Spain  and America  and eventually led to   our declaring war against Holland in 1778      o         210 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     Interrupt us  I carried on aa large a trade in this way as any other    but  as soon as I saw the people recover their senses  and the reins   put into other hands  I made a timely retreat with what I had   acquired          And what do you intend to do now           Keep fair with those whom I can get nothing by breaking with    and throw my business into another channel  by which management   I have already succeeded so far that I have got the British remit    tances to the parties engaged in the present war          Why  there may be something in this  and  if one scheme fails    I believe I will even follow your example          And pray  what is that  Mynheer           No more than the old cry of piracy   but this is so laid  that it   can hardly fail of success  We have bribed the
