have been informed  you have spoken disrespectful words against your captain  who to be sure  is the most honourable and generous commander in the king s service  without asparagement or acceptation of man  woman or child  —  Having uttered this elegant harrangue  on which he seemed to plume himself  Morgan replied    I do partly guess  and conceive  and understand your meaning  which I wish could be more explicite  But however  I do suppose  I am not to be condemned upon bare hear say  or if I am convicted of speaking disrespectfully of captain Oakhum  I hope there is no treason in my words  —   But there s mutiny  by G—d  and that s death by the articles of war  cried Oakhum  —In the mean time  let the witnesses be called  —  Hereupon Mackshane s servant appeared  and the boy of our mess  whom they had seduced and tutored for the purpose —The first declared  that Morgan  as he descended the cockpit ladder    269 one day  cursed the captain and called him a savage beast  saying  he ought to be hunted down as an enemy to mankind —   This  said the clerk  is a strong presumption of a design formed against the captain s life —For why  It presupposes malice afore thought  and a criminal intention a priori  —   Right  said the captain to this miserable grub  who had been an attorney s boy  you shall have law enough  here s Cook and Littlejohn for it    This evidence was confirmed by the boy  who affirmed  he heard the first mate say  that the captain had no more bowels than a bear  and the surgeon had no more brains than an ass —Then the centinel who heard our discourse on the poop was examined  and informed the court that the Welchman assured me  that captain Oakhum and doctor Mackshane would toss upon billows of burning brimstone in hell for their barbarity —The clerk observed  that here was an evident prejudication  which confirmed the former suspicion of a conspiracy against the life of captain Oakhum  for  because  how could Morgan so positively pronounce that the captain and surgeon would be damned  unless he had intention to make away with them before they could have time to repent —This sage explanation had great weight with our noble commander  who exclaimed    What have you to say to this  Taffy  you seem to be taken all a back  brother  hah  —  Morgan was too much of a gentleman to disown the text  although he absolutely denied the truth of the comment  Upon which the captain  strutting up to him  with a ferocious countenance  said    So  Mr  Son of a b—ch  you confess you honoured me with the names of bear and   270 beast  and pronounced my damnation  D—n my heart  I have a good mind to have you brought to a court martial and hanged  you dog  —  Here Mackshane having occasion for an assistant  interposed  and begged the captain to pardon Mr  Morgan  with his wonted goodness  upon condition that he the delinquent should make such submission as the nature of his misdemeanour demanded —Upon which the Cambro Briton  who on this occasion  would have made no submission to the Great Mogul  surrounded with his guards  thanked the doctor for his mediation  and acknowledged himself in the wrong for having called the image of Got  a beast    but  said he  I spoke by metaphor  and parable  and comparison  and types  as we signify meekness by a lamb  letchery by a goat  and craftiness by a fox  so we liken ignorance to an ass  and brutality to a bear  and fury to a tyger —therefore I made these similies to express my sentiments  look you  and what I said  before Got  I will not unsay before man nor peast neither  —  Oakhum was so provoked at this insolence  as he termed it  that he ordered him forthwith to be carried to the place of his confinement  and his clerk to proceed in the examination of me —The first question put to me  was touching the place of my nativity  which I declared to be the north of Scotland    The north of Ireland more liker  cried the captain  but we shall bring you up presently  —  He then asked what religion I professed  and when I answered    The protestant    swore I was as arrant a Roman as ever went to mass —   Come  come  clerk  continued he  catechise him a little on this subject  —  But before I relate the particulars of the clerk s enquiries  it will   271 not be amiss to inform the reader that our commander himself was an Hibernian  and  if not shrewdly belied  a Roman Catholick to boot —   You say you are a protestant  said the clerk  make the sign of the cross with your fingers  so  and swear upon it  to that affirmation  —  When I was about to perform this ceremony  the captain cried with some emotion    No
