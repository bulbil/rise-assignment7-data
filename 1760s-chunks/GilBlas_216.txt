the harpy talons of the world  the flesh  and the devil  But I must frankly own that all my other sins were pressed down and heaped high with ingratitude  far from overflowing with the milk of human kindness towards those who had conferred such a favour upon me  I abused them in terms that would have put any dictionary to the blush   Eight days thus passed in this wilderness of desolation  but on the ninth  for I had notched the hours and even the minutes on a stick  my fate seemed be ginning to take another turn  Crossing a little court  I met the house steward  a personage whose will was absolute  yes  the lady abbess herself was obedient to his will  He rendered an account of his stewardship to none but the corregidor  on whom alone he was dependent  and whose confidence in him was unbounded  His name was Pedro Zendono  and the town of Salsedon in Biscay laid claim to the honour of his birth  Figure to yourself a tall man  with the complexion of a mummy and the bare anatomy of a dealer in mortification  he might have sat for the penitent thief in a picture of the crucifixion  He scarcely ever cast a carnal glance towards us Magdalens  You never saw such a face of rank hypocrisy in all your life  though you have spent some part of it under the same roof with the archbishop  and are not unacquainted with the clergy of his diocese   But to return from this digression          I met this Signor Zendono  who said to me slily as he passed    Take comfort  my girl  I am sensibly affected with your wretched case  He said no more  and went on his way  leaving me to make my own comments on so concise and general a text As he looked like a good man  and there was no positive evidence to set against his looks  I was simpleton enough to fancy that he had taken the trouble of inquiring why I was shut up  and meant  not finding me so atrocious a culprit as to deserve such shameful insults  to take my part with the corregidor  But I was not up to the tricks of the Biscayan  he had a much longer head  He was turning over in his mind the scheme of an elopement  and made the proposal to me in profound privacy some days afterwards  My dear Laura  said he  your sufferings have taken such deep possession of my mind  that I have determined to end them  I am perfectly aware that my own ruin is involved in the measure  but needs must when the tender passion drives  To morrow morning do I intend to take you out of prison  and conduct you in person to Madrid  No sacrifice is too great for the pleasure of being your deliverer   I was very near fainting with surprise and joy at this promise of Zendono  who  concluding from my acknowledgments that my very life depended on my rescue  had the effrontery to carry me off next day in the face of the whole town  by the following device     He told the lady abbess that he had orders to take me before the corregidor  who was at his country box a few miles off  and without betraying himself by a single change of countenance  packed me off  with him for my companion  in a post chaise drawn by two good mules which he had bought for the occasion  Our only attendant was the driver  a servant of his own  and entirely devoted to the steward by stronger ties than those of gratitude  We began bowling away  not in the direction of Madrid  as I had taken for granted  but towards the frontiers of Portugal  whither we got in less time than it took the corregidor of Zamora to receive the deposition of our flight  and uncouple his pack or set them barking at our heels   Before we entered Braganza  the Biscayan made me put on man s clothes  with which he had taken the precaution of providing himself  Reckoning on me as being fairly launched in the same boat with him  he said to me in the inn where we put up  Lovely Laura  do not take it unkindly of me to have brought you into Portugal  The corregidor of Zamora will make our own country too hot to hold us  for in his eyes we are two criminals  under the weight of whose enormities it is not for Spain to groan  But we may set his malice at defiance in this distant realm  though at the present conjuncture under the dominion of the Spanish monarchy  At least we shall stand a better chance for safety here than at home  League your fortunes with those of a man who would follow you in prosperity or in adversity through the world  Let us fix our residence at Coimbra  There I will get employed as a spy for the inquisition  under the cover of that formidable tribunal  a refreshing shade for us  but Cimmerian darkness to its victims  our days will glide smoothly on in ease and pleasure  we shall fatten on the spoil of religious delinquency   A proposal so much to the point gave me to understand that I had to do
