   About Christmas we set out for England  accompanied by a little North  Briton  who lived with Lord B   as his companion  and did not at all  approve of our correspondence  whether out of real friendship for his  patron  or apprehension that in time I might supersede his own influence  with my lord  I shall not pretend to determine  Be that as it will  the  frost was so severe  that we were detained ten days at Calais before  we could get out of the harbour  and  during that time  I reflected  seriously on what my new lover proposed  As he was very young  and  unacquainted with the world  I thought my story might have escaped him   and therefore determined to give him a faithful detail of the whole   that he might not have anything to reproach me with in the sequel   besides  I did not think it honest to engage him to do more for me  than he might afterwards perhaps think I was worth  Accordingly  I  communicated to him every particular of my life  and the narration   far from altering his sentiments  rather confirmed his good opinion  by  exhibiting an undoubted proof of my frankness and sincerity  In short   he behaved with such generosity  as made an absolute conquest of my  heart  But my love was of a different kind from that which had formerly  reigned within my breast  being founded upon the warmest gratitude and  esteem  exclusive of any other consideration  though his person was very  agreeable  and his address engaging    When we arrived in England  I went directly to his country seat  about  twelve miles from London  where he soon joined me  and we lived some  time in perfect retirement  His relations being greatly alarmed with the  apprehension that Lord    would bring an action against him  though he  himself desired nothing more  and lived so easy under that expectation   that they soon laid aside their fears on his account    We were visited by Mr  H  B    a relation of my lord  and one Mr  R     of the Guards  who  with the little Scotchman and my lover  made an  agreeable set  among whom I enjoyed hunting  and all manner of country  diversions  As to Mr  H  B    if ever there was perfection in one    6 22 15  3 45 PM   man  it centred in him  or  at least  he  of all the men I ever knew   approached the nearest to that idea which I had conceived of a perfect  character  He was both good and great  possessed an uncommon genius  and  the best of hearts  Mr  R   was a very sociable man  had a good person   and cultivated understanding  and my lord was excessively good humoured   so that  with such companions  no place could be dull or insipid  For  my own part  I conducted the family  and  as I endeavoured to please and  make everybody happy  I had the good fortune to succeed  Mr  B   told  me  that before he saw me  he heard I was a fool  but finding  as he was  pleased to say  that I had been egregiously misrepresented  he courted  my friendship  and a correspondence commenced between us  Indeed  it was  impossible for any person to know him  without entertaining the utmost  esteem and veneration for his virtue    After I had lived some time in this agreeable retreat  my husband began  to make a bustle  He sent a message  demanding me from Lord B    then  came in person  with his nightcap in his pocket  intending to have  stayed all night  had he been asked  and attended by a relation  whom  he assured that I was very fond of him  and detained by force from his  arms  Finding himself disappointed in his expectations  he commenced a  law suit against Lord B    though not for a divorce  as we desired   but with a view to reclaim me as his lawful wife  His lawyers  however   attempted to prove criminal conversation  in hopes of extorting money  from my lover  But their endeavours were altogether fruitless  for no  servant of Lord B   s or mine could with justice say we were ever seen  to trespass against modesty and decorum  so that the plaintiff was  nonsuited  While this cause was depending  all my lover s friends  expressed fear and concern for the issue  while he himself behaved with  the utmost resolution  and gave me such convincing proofs of a strong  and steady affection  as augmented my gratitude  and riveted the ties of  my love  which was unblemished  faithful  and sincere    Soon after this event  I was seized with a violent fit of illness  in  which I was visited by my father  and attended by two physicians  one
