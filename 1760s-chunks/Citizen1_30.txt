 and his wife  now no longer a widow   Think not  my friend  that there is any thing chimerical in such an attempt  they already perform cures equally strange  What can be more truly astonishing than to see old age restored to youth  and vigour to the most feeble constitutions  yet this is performed here every day  a simple electuary effects these wonders  even without the bungling ceremonies of having the patient boiled up in a kettle  or ground down in a mill   Few physicians here go through the ordinary courses of education  but receive all their knowledge of medicine by immediate inspiration from heaven  Some are thus inspired even in the womb  and what is very remarkable  understand their profession as well at three years old as at threescore  Others have spent a great part of their lives unconscious of any latent excellence  till a bankruptcy  or a residence in goal  have called their miraculous powers into exertion  And others still there are indebted to their superlative ignorance alone for success  The more ignorant the practitioner  the less capable is he thought of deceiving  The people here judge  as they do in the east  where it is   93 thought absolutely requisite that a man should be an ideot before he pretend to be either a conjuror or a doctor   When a physician by inspiration is sent for  he never perplexes the patient by previous examination  he asks very few questions  and those only for form sake  He knows every disorder by intuition  He administers the pill or drop for every distemper  nor is more inquisitive than the farrier while he drenches an horse  If the patient lives  then has he one more to add to the surviving list  if he dies  then it may be justly said of the patient s disorder  that as it was not cured  the disorder was incurable   LETTER XXV  From the same   I WAS some days ago in company with a politician  who very pathetically declaimed upon the miserable situation of his country  he assured me  that the whole political machine was moving in a wrong track  and that scarce even abilities like his own could ever set it right again     What have we  said he  to do with the wars on the continent  we are a commercial nation  we have only to cultivate commerce like our neighbours the Dutch  it is our business to encrease trade by settling new colonies  riches are the strength of a nation  and for the rest  our ships  our ships alone will protect us    I found it vain to oppose my feeble arguments to those of a man who thought himself wise enough to direct   94 even the ministry  I fancied  however  that I saw with more certainty  because I reasoned without prejudice  I therefore begged leave  instead of argument  to relate a short history  He gave me a smile at once of condescention and contempt  and I proceeded as follows to describe  THE RISE AND DECLENSION OF THE KINGDOM OF LAO     Northward of China  and in one of the doubleings of the great wall  the fruitful province of Lao enjoyed its liberty and a peculiar government of its own As the inhabitants were on all sides surrounded by the wall  they feared no sudden invasion from the Tartars  and being each possessed of property  they were zealous in its defence   The natural consequences of security and affluence in any country is a love of pleasure  when the wants of nature are supplied  we seek after the conveniencies  when possessed of these  we desire the luxuries of life  and when every luxury is provided  it is then ambition takes up the man  and leaves him still something to wish for  the inhabitants of the country from primitive simplicity soon began to aim at elegance  and from elegance proceeded to refinement  It was now found absolutely requisite  for the good of the state  that the people should be divided  formerly the same hand that was employed in tilling the ground  or in dressing up the manufactures  was also in time of need a soldier  but the custom was now changed  for it was perceived  that a man bred up from childhood to the arts either of peace or of war  became more eminent by this means in his respective profession  The inhabitants   95 were therefore now distinguished into artizans and soldiers  and while those improved the luxuries of life  these watched for the security of the people   A country possessed of freedom has always two sorts of enemies to fear  foreign foes who attack its existence from without  and internal miscreants who betray its liberties within  The inhabitants of Lao were to guard against both  A country of artizans were most likely to preserve internal liberty  and a nation of soldiers were fittest to repel a foreign invasion  Hence naturally arose a division of opinion between the artizans and the soldiers of the kingdom  The artizans ever complaining  that freedom was threatned by an armed internal force  were for disbanding the soldiers  and insisted that their walls  their walls alone were sufficient to repel the most formidable invasion  the warriors  on the contrary  represented the power of the neighbouring kings
