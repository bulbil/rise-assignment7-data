 Married women are  on my principles  forbidden fruit  I abhor the seduction of innocence  I am too delicate  and  with all my modesty  too vain  to be pleased with venal beauty  what was I then to do  with a heart too active to be absolutely at rest  and which had not met with it s counterpart  Widows were  I thought  fair prey  as being sufficiently experienced to take care of themselves       I have said married women are  on my principles  forbidden fruit  I should have explained myself  I mean in England  for my ideas on this head change as soon as I land at Calais       Such is the amazing force of local prejudice  that I do not recollect having ever made love to an English married woman  or a French unmarried one  Marriages in France being made by the parents  and therefore generally without inclination on either side  gallantry seems to be a tacit condition  though not absolutely expressed in the contract       But to return to my plan  I think it an excellent one  and would recommend it to all those young men about town  who  like me  find in their hearts the necessity of loving  before they meet with an object capable of fixing them for life       By the way  I think the widows ought to raise a statue to my honor  for having done my possible to prove that  for the sake of decorum  morals  and order  they ought to have all the men to themselves       I have this moment your letter from Rutland  Do you know I am almost angry  Your ideas of love are narrow and pedantic  custom has done enough to make the life of one half of our species tasteless  but you would reduce them to a state of still greater insipidity than even that to which our tyranny has doomed them       You would limit the pleasure of loving and being beloved  and the charming power of pleasing  to three or four years only in the life of that sex which is peculiarly formed to feel tenderness  women are born with more lively affections than men  which are still more softened by education  to deny them the privilege of being amiable  the only privilege we allow them  as long as nature continues them so  is such a mixture of cruelty and false taste as I should never have suspected you of  notwithstanding your partiality for unripened beauty       As to myself  I persist in my opinion  that women are most charming when they join the attractions of the mind to those of the person  when they feel the passion they inspire  or rather  that they are never charming till then       A woman in the first bloom of youth resembles a tree in blossom  when mature  in fruit  but a woman who retains the charms of her person till her understanding is in its full perfection  is like those trees in happier climes  which produce blossoms and fruit together       You will scarce believe  Jack  that I have lived a week tête à tête  in the midst of a wood  with just the woman I have been describing  a widow extremely my taste  mature  five or six years more so than you say I require  lively  sensible  handsome  without saying one civil thing to her  yet nothing can be more certain       I could give you powerful reasons for my insensibility  but you are a traitor to love  and therefore have no right to be in any of his secrets       I will excuse your visits to my sister  as well as I love you myself  I have a thousand reasons for chusing she should not be acquainted with you       What you say in regard to my mother  gives me pain  I will never take back my little gift to her  and I cannot live in England on my present income  though it enables me to live en prince in Canada       Adieu  I have not time to say more  I have stole this half hour from the loveliest woman breathing  whom I am going to visit  surely you are infinitely obliged to me  To lessen the obligation  however  my calash is not yet come to the door       Adieu  once more   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XXXVII   37   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Oct  15   OUR wanderer is returned  my dear  and in such spirits as you can t conceive  he passed yesterday with us  he likes to have us to himself  and he had yesterday  we walked à trio in the wood  and were foolish  I have not passed so agreable a day since I came to Canada  I love mightily to be foolish  and the people here have no taste that way at all  your brother is divinely so upon occasion  The weather was  to use the Canadian phrase  superbe et magnifique  We shall not  I am told  have much more in the same magnifique style  so we intend to make the most of it  I have
