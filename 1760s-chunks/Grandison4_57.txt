their connexions and relations  near or distant  might be benefited by so reputable and useful an institution  To say nothing of the works of the Ladies in it  the profits of which perhaps will be thought proper to be carried towards the support of a foundation that so genteelly supports them  Yet I would have a number of hours in each day  for the encouragement of industry  that should be called their own  and what was produced in them  to be solely appropriated to their own use   A truly worthy divine  at the appointment of the Bishop of the diocese  to direct and animate the devotion of such a society  and to guard it from that superstition and enthusiasm which soars to wild heights in almost all Nunneries  would confirm it a blessing to the kingdom   I have another scheme  my Lord  proceeded Sir Charles—An Hospital for female Penitents  for such unhappy women  as having been once drawn in  and betrayed by the perfidy of men  find themselves  by the cruelty of the world  and principally by that of their own Sex  unable to recover the path of virtue  when perhaps  convinced of the wickedness of the men in whose honour they confided  they would willingly make their first departure from it the last   These  continued he  are the poor creatures who are eminently intitled to our pity  tho  they seldom meet with it  Good nature  and Credulity the child of good nature  are generally  as I have the charity to believe  rather than viciousness  the foundation of their crime  Those men who pretend they would not be the first destroyers of a woman s innocence  look upon these as fair prize  But  what a wretch is he  who seeing a poor creature exposed on the summit of a dangerous precipice  and unable  without an assisting hand  to find her way down  would rather push   143 her into the gulph below  than convey her down in safety   Speaking of the force put upon a daughter s inclinations  in wedlock  Tyranny and ingratitude  said Sir Charles  from a man beloved  will be more supportable to a woman of strong passions  than even kindness from a man she loves not  Shall not parents then  who hope to see their children happy  avoid compelling them to give their hands to a man who has no share in their hearts   But would you allow young Ladies to be their own choosers  Sir Charles  said Mr  Reeves   Daughters  replied he  who are earnest to choose for themselves  should be doubly careful that prudence justifies their choice  Every widow who marries imprudently  and very many there are who do  furnishes a strong argument in favour of a parent s authority over a maiden daughter  A designing man looks out for a woman who has an independent fortune  and has no questions to ask  He seems assured of findin indiscretion and rashness in such a one to befriend him  But ought not she to think herself affronted  and resolve to disappoint him   But how  said Lady G  shall a young creature be able to judge—  By his application to her  rather than to her natural friends and relations  by his endeavouring to alienate her affections from them  by wishing her to favour private and clandestine meetings  conscious that his petensions will not stand discussion  by the inequality of his fortune to hers  And has not our excellent Miss Byron  in the Letters to her Lucy  bowing to me  which she has had the goodness to allow us to read  helped us to a criterion     Men in their addresses to young women  she very happily observes  forget not to set forward the advantages by which they are distinguished  whether hereditary or acquired  while Love  Love  is all the cry of him who has no other to boast of        144 And by that means  said Lady Gertrude  setting the silly creature at variance with all her friends  he makes her fight his battles for him  and become herself the cat s paw to help him to the ready roasted chesnuts   But  dear brother  said Lady G  do you think Love is such a stay d deliberate passion  as to allow a young creature to take time to ponder and weigh all the merits of the cause   Love at first sight  answered Sir Charles  must indicate a mind prepared for impression  and a sudden gust of passion  and that of the least noble kind  since there could be no opportunity of knowing the merit of the object  What woman would have herself supposed capable of such a tindery fit  In a man  it is an indelicate paroxysm  But in a woman  who expects protection and instruction from a man  much more so  Love  at first  may be only fancy  Such a young Love may be easily given up  and ought  to a parent s judgment  Nor is the conquest so difficult as some young creatures think it  One thing  my good Emily  let me say to you  as a rule of some consequence in the world you are just entering into—Young persons  on
