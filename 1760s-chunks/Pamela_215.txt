  the secret  but that I ll leave to you       Sir  replied she  we all concluded it would be in a few days  and I   doubt it won t be long a secret  No  said he  I don t desire it should    but you know we are not provided for a public wedding  and I shall   declare it when we go to Bedfordshire  which won t be long  But the men    who lie in the outhouses  need not know it  for  by some means or other    my sister Davers knows all that passes       Do you know  sir  said she  that her ladyship intends to be down here   with you in a few days  Her servant told me so  who brought you the   letter you were angry at       I hope  said he  we shall be set out for t other house first  and shall   be pleased she loses her labour  Sir  continued she  her ladyship    proposes to be here time enough to hinder your nuptials  which she   takes  as we did  will be the latter end of next week  Well  said he    let her come  but yet I desire not to see her       Mrs  Jewkes said to me  Give me leave  madam  to wish you all manner   of happiness  But I am afraid I have too well obeyed his honour  to be   forgiven by you  Indeed  Mrs  Jewkes  returned I  you will be more   your own enemy than I will be  I will look all forward  and shall not   presume  so much as by a whisper  to set my good master against any one   he pleases to approve of  And as to his old servants  I shall always   value them  and never offer to dictate to his choice  or influence it by   my own caprices       Mrs  Jewkes  said my master  you find you have no cause to apprehend   any thing  My Pamela is very placable  and as we have both been sinners   together  we must both be included in one act of grace       Such an example of condescension  as I have before me  Mrs  Jewkes  said   I  may make you very easy  for I must be highly unworthy  if I did not   forego all my little resentments  if I had any  for the sake of so much   goodness to myself       You are very kind  madam  said she  and you may depend upon it  I will   atone for all my faults  by my future duty and respect to you  as well   as to my master       That s well said on both sides  said he  but  Mrs  Jewkes  to assure   you  that my good girl here has no malice  she chooses you to attend   her in the morning at the ceremony  and you must keep up her spirits   I   shall  replied she  be very proud of the honour  But I cannot  madam    but wonder to see you so very low spirited  as you have been these two   or three days past  with so much happiness before you       Why  Mrs  Jewkes  answered I  there can be but one reason given    and that is  that I am a sad fool   But  indeed  I am not ungrateful   neither  nor would I put on a foolish affectation  But my heart  at   times  sinks within me  I know not why  except at my own unworthiness    and because the honour done me is too high for me to support myself   under  as I should do  It is an honour  Mrs  Jewkes  added I  I was not   born to  and no wonder  then  I behave so awkwardly  She made me a   fine compliment upon it  and withdrew  repeating her promises of care    secrecy  etc       He parted from me with very great tenderness  and I came up and set to   writing  to amuse my thoughts  and wrote thus far  And Mrs  Jewkes being   come up  and it being past twelve  I will go to bed  but not one wink  I   fear  shall I get this night   I could beat myself for anger  Sure   there is nothing ominous in this strange folly   But I suppose all young   maidens are the same  so near so great a change of condition  though   they carry it off more discreetly than I          Thursday  six o clock in
