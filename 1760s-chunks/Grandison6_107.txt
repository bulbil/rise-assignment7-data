were my own innocent wishes and delights in the days of my youth      Tuesday  Five o Clock   MY uncle and Sir Charles came back to dinner  my grandmamma with them  She was so good as to give me her company  at the first word  Sir Charles  as we sat at dinner  and afterwards  saw me weak in mind  bashful  and not quite recovered  and he seemed to watch my uncle s eyes  and so much diverted him and all of us  that my uncle had not opportunity to put forth  as usual  How did this kind protection assure me  I thought myself quite well  and was so chearfully silent when Sir Charles talked  that my grandmamma and aunt  who had placed me between them  whispered me severally—You look charmingly easy  love—You look like yourself  my dear  Yet still this mischievous Greville ran in my head   My uncle took notice  that Sir Charles had said  he guessed at the writer of the note  He wished he would give him an item  as he called it  whom he thought of   You observe  Sir  answered Sir Charles  that the writer says  Mr  Greville was in wine  He professes to be an encourager of the people of the George in Northampton  He often appoints company to meet him there  I imagine the writer to be the head waiter of the house  The bills delivered me in  seem to have been writen in such a hand as the note  as far as I can carry the hand writing in my eye     267 Ads heart  said my uncle  that s undoubtedly right  Your name s up  Sir  I can tell you  among men  women  and children  This man  in his note  calls you  Look  else   the most generous and noble of men  He says  we shall never know the writer —Ads dines  the man must deal in art magic  that conceals himself from you  if you have a mind to find him out   Well  but  said Lucy  if this be so  I am concerned for the reality of the information  Such threatenings as Mr  Greville throws out  are not to be slighted  Very true  said my uncle  Mr  Deane and I  Mr  Deane will certainly be here by and by  will go  and discourse with Greville himself to morrow  please the Lord   Sir Charles begged that this matter might be left to his management  Mr  Greville and I  said he  are upon such a foot  as  whether he be so sincerely my friend as I am his  or not  will warrant a visit to him  and he cannot but take it as a civility  on my return into these parts   Should he be affronting  Sir Charles  Said my uncle—  I can have patience  if he should  He cannot be grosly so   I know not that  replied my uncle  Mr  Greville is a roister   Well  dear Mr  Selby  leave this matter to me  Were there to be danger  the way to avoid it  is not to appear to be afraid of it  One man s fear gives another courage  I have no manner of doubt of being able to bring Mr  Greville with me to an amicable dish of tea  or to dinner  which you please  to morrow   Ads heart  Sir  I wish not to see at either  the wretch who could threaten the life of a man so dear to us all   Sir Charles bowed to my uncle for his sincere compliment  I have nothing to do  said he  but to invite myself either to breakfast  or dine with him  His   268 former scheme of appearing to the world well with me  in order to save his spirit  will be resumed  and all will be right   My aunt expressed her fears  however  and looked at me  as I did at her  with a countenance  I suppose  far from being unapprehensive  But Sir Charles said  You must leave me  my dear friends  to my own methods  nor be anxious for my safty  I am not a rash man  I can pity Mr  Greville  and the man I pity  cannot easily provoke me   We were all the easier for what the charmingly cool  because truely brave  man said on a subject which has given us all so much terror   But was he not very good  my dear  not to say one word all this day of the important errand on which he came down  And to lead the subjects of conversation with design  as my aunt and grandmamma both thought  as well as I  that my uncle should not  and to give me time to recover my spirits  Yet when he did address himself to me  never were tenderness and respect so engagingly mingled  This my uncle observed  as well as my aunt and Lucy  How the duce  said he  does this Sir Charles manage it  He has a way no man but him
