with women  who inflame the passenger by their   appearance  their gesture  and their solicitations  but with houses  in   which every desire which they kindle may be gratified with secrecy and   convenience  it is in vain that  the feet of the prostitute go down to   death  and that her steps take hold on hell   what then can be hoped   from any punishment  which the laws of man can superadd to disease and   want  to rottenness and perdition  If you permit opium to be publickly   sold at a low rate  it will be folly to hope  that the dread of   punishment will render idleness and drunkenness strangers to the poor    If a tax is so collected  as to leave opportunities to procure the   commodity  without paying it  the hope of gain will always surmount the   fear of punishment  If  when the veteran has served you at the risque of   life  you withold his hire  it will be in vain to threaten usury and   extortion with imprisonment and fines  If  in your armies  you suffer it   to be any man s interest  rather to preserve the life of a horse than a   man  be assured  that your own sword is drawn for your enemy  for there   will always be some  in whom interest is stronger than humanity and   honour  Put no man s interest  therefore  in the ballance against his   duty  nor hope that good can often be produced  but by preventing   opportunities of evil        To these precepts of OMAR  HAMET listened as to the instructions of a   father  and having promised to keep them as the treasure of life  he   dismissed him from his presence  The heart of HAMET was now expanded   with the most pleasing expectations  but ALMORAN was pining with   solicitude  jealousy  and distrust  he took every opportunity to avoid   both OMAR and HAMET  but HAMET still retained his confidence  and OMAR   his suspicions                CHAP  V          In the mean time  the system of government was established which had   been proposed by OMAR  and in which HAMET concurred from principle  and   ALMORAN from policy  The views of ALMORAN terminated in the   gratification of his own appetites and passions  those of HAMET  in the   discharge of his duty  HAMET  therefore  was indefatigable in the   business of the state  and as his sense of honour  and his love of the   public  made this the employment of his choice  it was to him the   perpetual source of a generous and sublime felicity  ALMORAN also was   equally diligent  but from another motive  he was actuated  not by love   of the public  but by jealousy of his brother  he performed his task as   the drudge of necessity  with reluctance and ill will  so that to him it   produced pain and anxiety  weariness and impatience       To atone for this waste of time  he determined to crowd all that   remained with delight  his gardens were an epitome of all nature  and on   his palace were exhausted all the treasures of art  his seraglio was   filled with beauties of every nation  and his table supplied with   dainties from the remotest corners of his dominions  In the songs that   were repeated in his presence  he listened at once to the voice of   adulation and music  he breathed the perfumes of Arabia  and he tasted   the forbidden pleasure of wine  But as every appetite is soon satiated   by excess  his eagerness to accumulate pleasure deprived him of   enjoyment  Among the variety of beauty that surrounded him  the passion    which  to be luxurious  must be delicate and refined  was degraded to a   mere instinct  and exhausted in endless dissipation  the caress was   unendeared by a consciousness of reciprocal delight  and was immediately   succeeded by indifference or disgust  By the dainties that perpetually   urged him to intemperance  that appetite  which alone could make even   dainties tasteful  was destroyed  The splendor of his palace and the   beauty of his gardens  became at length so familiar to his eye  that   they were frequently before him  without being seen  Even flattery and   music lost their power  by too frequent a repetition  and the broken   slumbers of the night  and the languor of the morning  were more than   equivalent to the transient hilarity that was inspired by wine  Thus   passed the time of ALMORAN  divided between painful labours which he did   not dare to shun  and the search of pleasure which he could never find       HAMET  on the contrary  did not
