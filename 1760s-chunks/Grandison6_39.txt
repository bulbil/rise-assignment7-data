to  another  By praising her  he makes noble court to you  in supposing you  as you are  one of the most generous of women  How great is his compliment to both Ladies  when he calls Clementina the Miss Byron of Italy  Who  my dear  ever courted woman as my brother courts you  Indeed there can be but very few men who have such a woman to court   He suffers you not to ask for an account of the state of his heart from the time he knew you first  till now  He gives it to you  unasked  And how glorious is that account  both to you  and himself   Let us look back upon his conduct when last in Italy  and when every step seemed to lead to his being husband of another woman   The recovery of Clementina  and of her noble brother  seem to be the consequence of his friendly goodness  The grateful family all join to reward him with their darling s hand  her heart supposed to be already his  He  like the man of honour he is  concludes himself bound by his former offers  They accept him upon those terms  The Lady s merits thine out with transcendent lustre in the eyes of every one  even of us his sisters  and of you  Harriet  and your best friends  Must they not in his  to whom Merit was ever the first  Beauty but the second attractive  He had no tie to any other woman on earth  He had only the tenderness of his own heart  with regard to Miss Byron  to contend with  Ought he not to have contended with it  He did  and so far conquered  as to enable himself to be just to the Lady  whose great qualities  and the concurrence of her friends in his favour  had converted Compassion for her into Love  And who  that hear her story  can forbear to Love her  But with what tenderness  with what politeness  does he  in his Letter to his chosen correspondent  express himself of Miss Byron  He declares  that if she were not to be happy  it would be a great abatement   98 of his own felicity  You  however  remember how politely he recals his apprehensions that you may not  on his account  be altogether so happy as he wishes  as the suggestions of his own presumption  and censures himself for barely supposing  that he had been of consequence enough with you to give you pain   How much to your honour before he went over  does he account for your smiles  for yourfrankness of heart  in his company  He would not build upon them  Nor indeed could he know the state of your heart  as we did  He had not the opportunity  How silly was your punctilio  that made you sometimes fansy it was out of mere compassion that he revealed to you the state of his engagement abroad  You see he tells you  that such was his opinion of your greatness of mind  that he thought he had no other way but to put it in your power to check him  if his Love for you should stimulate him to an act of neglect to the Lady to whom  she having never refused him  and not being then in a condition either to claim him or set him free  he thought himself under obligation  Don t you revere him for his honour to her  the nature of her malady considered  What must he have suffered  in this conflict   Well  and now by a strange turn in the Lady  but glorious to herself  as he observes  the obstacle removed  he applies to Miss Byron for her favour  How sensible is he of what delicacy requires from her  How justly  respecting his Love for you  does he account for not postponing  for the sake of cold and dull form  as he justly expresses it  his address to you  How greatly does the Letter he delivered to you  favour his argument  Ah the poor Clementina  Cruel persuades her relations  I hate and pity them  in a breath  Never  before  did hatred and pity meet in the same bosom  as they do in mine  on this occasion  His difficulties  my dear  and the uncommon situation he is in  as if he were offering you but a divided Love    99 enhance your glory  You are reinstated on the Female throne  to the lowermost footstep of which you once was afraid you had descended  You are offered a man  whose perplexities have not proceeded from the entanglements of intrigue  inconstancy  perfidy  but from his own compassionate nature  And could you  by any other way in the world than by this supposed divided Love  have had it in your power  by accepting his humbly offered hand  to lay him under obligation to you  which he thinks he never shall be able to discharge  Lay him—Who —Sir CHARLES GRANDISON—For whom so many virgin hearts have sighed in vain —And what a triumph to our Sex is this  as well as to my Harriet   And now  Harriet  let me tell you  that my sister and I are both in great
