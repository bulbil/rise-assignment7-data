father  remains to sooth her sorrow  Behold him  see how all  the princely dignity of William already sits displayed in his youthful  front  and wonder not that Ela never can descend to any other passion         Thus obstinate and inexorable  the Countess ever added scorn and reproof  to her denial  insulted the love  and stung the pride of Raymond  whose  disgrace was soon no secret to his attendants  Of these  the first  and  principal in his confidence  was a man nurtured in courts  long  practised in the arts of flattery  and the homage of dependance   trained to watch the looks  the smiles  the frowns of a superior  to aid  his pleasures  to indulge his passions  to love  to  hate  as he directed  with an obsequiousness equalled only by the  insolence and oppression which he dealt out with unfeeling severity to  all beneath him  Subtile and expert he was in the arts of fraud and  circumvention  ever attentive to his own private intetest  patient   persevering  and sagacious in the means of advancing it  His name was  Grey  To him Raymond unbosomed his disordered thoughts  lamented his  despised love  and the unrelenting pride of Ela  which threatened to  blast all his hopes of ambition  The flatterer expressed the utmost  indignation  and as if the resolution of the Countess had been  unwarranted and injurious  injurious to the honour and dignity of  Raymond  he censured him with an artful semblance of sincerity and zeal   as if he himself had been the cause of his own repulse  He accused him  of indulging the perverseness and pride of this high dame  by the humble  and abject strain of his addresses  He persuaded him that in this place  he was now absolute lord and inheritor  who should command  and not  intreat  graced as he was by the royal favour  and supported by the  power of Hubert  The slightest hint was more than sufficient to enflame  the pride of Raymond  He yielded entirely to the pleasing delusion  and  already fancied himself undoubted heir of the house of Salsbury  and  master of its ample domain  The conditions on which the king had  assented to his petition  were totally forgotten  and he now determined  to act agreeably to that high character  in which his imagination had  arrayed him  and to extort that compliance to his wishes  which his  sollicitations could not obtain  Every thing was disposed at his  command  and the domestics and inhabitants of the castle taught to  acknowledge a new lord  To the Countess  he affected to appear  not as  an humble lover  but an imperious sovereign master  Yet  awed by her  dignity and beauty  he acted this part  not without constraint and  shame  and still repulsed  and still despised  he required all the  artifice and flattery of Grey  to suport him in his purpose  Yet  this  extraordinary change could not fail to alarm the  fears of the Countess  With surprise and helpless indignation she found  herself the prisoner of her guest  Her usual attendants were removed   and new domestics assigned  the creatures of her enemy  who performed  the due offices to her and to her infant son  not without respect and  care  but with sullen silence and reserve  and all her words and actions  were free to the observation of strange and unfriendly keepers  If  Raymond ventured to appear in her presence   for still he dreaded the  severity of her frown  with wild dismay  yet with the dignity of injured  greatness  she demanded an explanation of this mysterious conduct   whilst he only urged the necessity of an absolute compliance with his  desires  and left her agitated soul to divine the fatal consequences of  a refusal  Sometimes she endeavoured to expostulate  to speak her wrongs  boldly  and to menace her oppressors  but tears never failed to betray  her inward terror  and to discover a lively sense of the weakness of her  widowed state  Sometimes she called upon Lord William  and tormented  herself with the remembrance of the virtues and renown of her lost  protector  Sometimes she prest her son with an eager and passionate  fondness to her heart  and invoked every saint in heaven to save the  precious creature  For him much more anxious  than for her own fate  she  formed a thousand visionary schemes to rescue him from the oppressor   which like fantastical dreams  vanished  and left her to despair   Raymond  though insolent and cruel  yet still loved the unhappy  Countess  nor could he behold her distress without some pangs of  remorse  But his unrelenting minion was ever at hand  to condemn and  deride his weakness   so he deemed it  and to persuade him that nothing  but rigid authority and severe restraint could prevail upon the high  mind of Ela  and reduce her to what his abandoned flattery presumed to  call a reasonable compliance  Thus was her resolution still assailed   and still unconquered     But
