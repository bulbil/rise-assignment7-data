 and when Pallet recovered his recollection  and swore  that he would rather swallow porridge made of burning brimstone  than  such an infernal mess as that which he had tasted  the physician  in  his own vindication  assured the company  that  except the usual  ingredients  he had mixed nothing in the soup but some sal ammoniac  instead of the ancient nitrum  which could not now be procured   and appealed to the marquis  whether such a succedaneum was not an  improvement on the whole  The unfortunate petit maitre  driven to  the extremity of his condescension  acknowledged it to be a masterly  refinement  and deeming himself obliged  in point of honour  to evince  his sentiments by his practice  forced a few more mouthfuls of this  disagreeable potion down his throat  till his stomach was so much  offended  that he was compelled to start up of a sudden  and  in the  hurry of his elevation  overturned his plate into the bosom of the  baron  The emergency of this occasion would not permit him to stay and  make apologies for his abrupt behaviour  so that he flew into another  apartment  where Pickle found him puking and crossing himself with great  devotion  and a chair  at his desire  being brought to the door  he  slipped into it more dead than alive  conjuring his friend Pickle to  make his peace with the company  and in particular excuse him to the  baron  on account of the violent fit of illness with which he had been  seized  It was not without reason that he employed a mediator  for when  our hero returned to the dining room  the German got up  and was  under the hands of his own lacquey  who wiped the grease from a rich  embroidered waistcoat  while he  almost frantic with his misfortune   stamped upon the ground  and in High Dutch cursed the unlucky banquet   and the impertinent entertainer  who all this time  with great  deliberation  consoled him for the disaster  by assuring him that the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   damage done might be repaired with some oil of turpentine and a hot  iron  Peregrine  who could scarce refrain from laughing in his face   appeased his indignation by telling him how much the whole company  and  especially  the marquis  was mortified at the accident  and the unhappy  salacacabia being removed  the places were filled with two pies  one  of dormice liquored with syrup of white poppies  which the doctor had  substituted in the room of toasted poppy seed  formerly eaten with  honey  as a dessert  and the other composed of a hock of pork baked in  honey   Pallet  hearing the first of these dishes described  lifted up his hands  and eyes  and with signs of loathing and amazement  pronounced   A  pie made of dormice and syrup of poppies  Lord in heaven  what beastly  fellows those Romans were   His friend checked him for his irreverent  exclamation with a severe look  and recommended the veal  of which he  himself cheerfully ate  with such encomiums to the company  that the  baron resolved to imitate his example  after having called for a bumper  of Burgundy  which the physician  for his sake  wished to have been the  true wine of Falernum  The painter  seeing nothing else upon the table  which he would venture to touch  made a merit of necessity  and had  recourse to the veal also  although he could not help saying that he  would not give one slice of the roast beef of Old England for all the  dainties of a Roman Emperor s table  But all the doctor s invitations  and assurances could not prevail upon his guests to honour the hachis  and the goose  and that course was succeeded by another  in which he  told them were divers of those dishes  which among the ancients had  obtained the appellation of politeles  or magnificent   That which  smokes in the middle   said he   is a sow s stomach  filled with a  composition of minced pork  hog s brains  eggs  pepper  cloves  garlic   aniseed  rue  ginger  oil  wine  and pickle  On the right hand side are  the teats and belly of a sow  just farrowed  fried with sweet wine  oil   flour  lovage  and pepper  On the left is a fricassee of snails  fed   or rather purged  with milk  At that end next Mr  Pallet are fritters  of pompions  lovage  origanum  and oil  and here are a couple of pullets  roasted and stuffed in the manner of Apicius    The painter  who had by wry faces testified his abhorrence of the  sow s stomach  which he compared to a bagpipe  and the snails which had  undergone purgation  he no sooner heard him mention the roasted pullets   than he eagerly solicited a wing of the fowl  upon which the doctor  desired he would take the trouble of cutting them
