the prospect of land  which we dreaded to find unfriendly  Nor were  our fears mistaken  for when our last and utmost efforts had been  exerted to gain the shore  some wretched fishermen who had at first  gazed in expectation on our vessel  and at the sight of armed men  sled  precipitately into the country  appeared by their garb and language to  be French  and convinced us that the prospect of immediate destruction   was only changed for another no less dreadful  that of an hard and  tedious captivity  that of falling into the hands of men whom we had but  now defied and vanquished  and being made the victims of revenge for  blood still reeking upon our blades             We moored our boat  uncertain what course to pursue  whether to seek  refuge from our enemies in an unknown and tempestuous sea  or by  advancing forward to resign ourselves into their power  It was  however   soon resolved boldly to meet our danger  We moved on slowly and  circumspect  the sun played upon our armour  and its reflected beams  served as a direction to a small armed band that had been alarmed by  their countrymen  and now marched forth to seek their invaders  My  companions  little dismayed at such a superiority of numbers as they  had frequently repelled  unsheathed their swords  now their only  weapons  and stood  as men resolved to defend  their lives and liberty to the utmost  The undaunted shew of resistance  persuaded our enemies that some hostile design was meditated  and that  greater numbers were approaching to our support  They halted and  surveyed us  their bowmen discharged their shafts  and three of my  unhappy friends lay bleeding upon the earth  pouring out their lives  without a possibility of assistance  or the consolation of a brave  revenge  Our enemies  animated by their success  rushed upon us  they  felt our blades  but soon taught us that resistance was ineffectual   They surrounded my friends  and impatient to secure their captives   hurried them precipitately across the plain  but in their blind  unguided fury  left me at some distance singly engaged with their  commander  who with couched lance  spurred forward  and loudly called  upon me to yield myself his prisoner  or meet my fate  Active and  experienced in arms  I evaded his onset  and with this good sword   whose length and keenness had long been the terror of his countrymen  I  aimed a blow  which was received by his fiery charger  The beast grew  furious with anguish  and impatient of command soon cast his rider at  my feet  But I  who neither inclined  nor deemed it prudent to pursue  the work of death  ever ready to spare a prostrate foe  and nothing  disposed to provoke a severe vengeance on my companions  lifted my  beaver  and with looks of courtesy raised the leader from the ground  I  prepared to accost him  when  starting back  as if unable to support  some sudden and violent surprize  he stood speechless and motionless   casting his eyes to heaven  and fixing them on me by turns  Blessed  Saints —O noble Lord —thus did he exclaim  Twice my preserver  How shall  Les Roches repay thy exalted goodness  In the isle of Rhè  and thus  attended  But fly this moment  I must rejoin my friends  That path is  safe  it leads thee to a place of concealment  expect me soon  and  expect some return of gratitude      With  these words  the stranger  for such he still seemed to me  turned  hastily away  in pursuit of his troop  now leading off their prisoners  in triumph  Nor could I suddenly recover from my amazement  Mine eyes  still attended him  and marked his hasty steps  until he was lost in the  distant crowd  Then suddenly recollecting mine own danger  and his  friendly counsel  I took the path to which he had pointed  and measured  out the tedious way with limbs wearied and faint  and with a mind no  less harassed by tumultuous passions  Still confounded and perplexed   my thoughts sought in vain for that security  that concealment which the  stranger had promised  when turning mine eyes eagerly on every side in  search of some cheering object  they at length discovered at some  distance a large and venerable pile  It s windows crowded with the  foliage of their ornaments  and dimmed by the hand of the painter  it s  numerous spires towering above the roof  and the christian ensign on  it s front  declared it a residence of devotion and charity  Hither I  determined to bend my course  and to six here  my last and only hopes of  refuge  War had long taught me to support toil and abstinence  But   alas  my spirit now denied it s wonted assistance to my exhausted  strength  and when my limbs had laboured up the eminence on which this  mansion stood  with slow and
