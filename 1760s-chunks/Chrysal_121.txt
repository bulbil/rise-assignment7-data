who are engaged in the same   pursuits  and thereby discourage and prevent the rising to that   excellence  the want of which is objected to them  For though   there may not perhaps be any natural difference between the sexes    in the abilities of mind necessary to form a proper judgment of   any science  yet the female labours under such disadvantages from   a wrong education  that it is next to impossible for a woman to    exert the faculties of reason in any distinguished degree   the time   when the seeds of knowledge should be sown being devoted to    trifies or absurdities  that deserve a worse name  which by these   means take such possession of the mind as to influence the conduct   of the whole life  Some rare instances indeed there are  of women   who break through this oppression and rise above the prejudices   of such an education to a degree of eminence equal to the foremost   of the other sex  But this requires such uncommon strength of   genius  as is indulged to a very few  and was by no means the lot   of this person  all her pretensions to taste and judgment being   founded on her ability to reward them liberally in others  But   even in this  her injudicious vanity has always marred the good   effects of her generosity and wealth  for  not being able herself to    discern real merit  and disdaining to follow the opinions of others   for fear of passing unnoticed among the crowd  she blundered upon   the most unlucky method of distinguishing herself that ever entered   into a human head   for  as if her opinion waa of more weight than   that of all the world beside  she sets up to contradict the voice of   the public  and always patronizes those whom they reject and   decry      Such a conduct  as I said  naturally lays her open to the imposi    tions of flattery and fraud  Though she professes a taste for all   the finer arts  music is the particular object of her favour and   encouragement  As soon as a new performer arrives  if he is ii   distress  as is almost always the case  he immediately waits upon   this lady to implore her patronage  This necessarily introduce   a display of his abilities  which she never fails to reward muni    ficently  and profess her approbation of  but cautiously  and in   general terms only  that she may retract it afterwards  should the   public unluckily join with her  for her opinion is always in the   opposite scale to that of the rest of the world  But if he is dis    approved  she takes him under her immediate protection   she   invites him constantly to her table   she supplies him with money    with the most boundless profusion  and makes parties among that    crowd of company which her wealth and turn for expensive pleasure   constantly collect about her  to support him against the favourites    of the public  And to show that she does this merely from a spirit   of contradiction  should the most eminent of these fall off  or be   eclipsed by the superior merit of a rival  she instantly forgets the    animosities with which she pursued his success  and receives him   into her protection and patronage  admiring his grossest faults    and praising the very defects she decried before   while her gentle   mate is obliged to submit to this dissipation of his darling wealth    and to be the humble echo of her opinions  in all their various          126 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     â€¢changes  without daring to interpose a word in vindication of his   â€¢own judgment or authority  but thinking himself happy in being   permitted to make use of the pittances of his fortune  which he thus   contributes to public charities  to give him the opportunity of   assuming the momentary consequence you see      The many impositions which she has suffered from those rapacious   sycophants  would be sufficient to make any person see the folly   â  of such a conduct  who had not wilfully resolved against conviction    I shall just mention one instance  for the grossness and singularity   of it  and so conclude the disagreeable representation      To show her elegant taste in this most pleasing entertainment    and raise an opinion of her importance in the polite world  among   her tenants and neighbours in the country  whither she retires in   the summer  she always takes with her some of her favourite per    formers  who cannot fail to please persons who never had an oppor    tunity of hearing any better  and sometimes even will condescend    upon very particular occasions  as when she gives public entertajn
