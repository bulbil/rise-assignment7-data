next in remainder to the succession  others  tempted by the  smallness of the price  which rarely exceeded half a year s purchase  as  appears by many deeds  though they doubted the truth of the boy s being  dead  ran small risks  on the contingency of his dying before he should  be of age  or in hopes of his being prevailed upon to confirm the grants  of his father  and many more were treating with him on the same notions   when their transactions were suddenly interrupted  and the scheme  of raising more money for the present  defeated by the unexpected  appearance of the boy  who  being naturally sprightly and impatient of  restraint  had found means to break from his confinement  and wandered  up and down the streets of Dublin  avoiding his father s house  and  choosing to encounter all sorts of distress  rather than subject himself  again to the cruelty and malice of the woman who supplied his mother s  place  Thus debarred his father s protection  and destitute of any fixed  habitation  he herded with all the loose  idle  and disorderly youths in  Dublin  skulking chiefly about the college  several members and students  of which  taking pity on his misfortunes  supplied him at different    6 22 15  3 45 PM   times with clothes and money  In this unsettled and uncomfortable way  of life did he remain  from the year 1725 to the latter end of November   1727  at which time his father died  so miserably poor  that he was  actually buried at the public expense    This unfortunate nobleman was no sooner dead  than his brother Richard   now earl of A    taking advantage of the nonage and helpless situation  of his nephew  seized upon all the papers of the defunct  and afterwards  usurped the title of Lord A    to the surprise of the servants   and others who were acquainted with the affairs of the family  This  usurpation  bold as it was  produced no other effect than that of his  being insulted by the populace as he went through the streets  and the  refusal of the king at arms to enrol the certificate of his brother s  having died without issue  The first of these inconveniences he bore  without any sense of shame  though not without repining  conscious that  it would gradually vanish with the novelty of his invasion  and as to  the last  he conquered it by means well known and obvious    Nor will it seem strange  that he should thus invade the rights of an  orphan with impunity  if people will consider  that the late Lord  A   had not only squandered away his fortune with the most ridiculous  extravagance  but also associated himself with low company  so that he  was little known  and less regarded  by persons of any rank and figure  in life  and his child  of consequence  debarred of the advantages  which might have accrued from valuable connections  And though it was  universally known  that Lady A   had a son in Ireland  such was the  obscurity in which the father had lived  during the last years of his  life  that few of the nobility could be supposed to be acquainted with  the particular circumstances of a transaction in which they had no  concern  and which had happened at the distance of twelve years before  the date of this usurpation  Moreover  as their first information was no  other than common fame  the public clamour occasioned by the separation  might inspire such as were strangers to the family affairs with a  mistaken notion of the child s having been born about or after the time  of that event  The hurry and bustle occasioned by the arrival of the  lord lieutenant about this period  the reports industriously propagated  of the claimant s death  the obscurity and concealment in which the boy  was obliged to live  in order to elude the wicked attempts of his uncle   might also contribute to his peaceable enjoyment of an empty title  And  lastly  Lord Chancellor W    whose immediate province it was to issue  writs for parliament  was an utter stranger in Ireland  unacquainted  with the descents of families  and consequently did not examine farther  than the certificate enrolled in the books of the king at arms  Over and  above these circumstances  which naturally account for the success of  the imposture  it may be observed  that the hapless youth had not one  relation alive  on the side of his father  whose interest it was not to  forward or connive at his destruction  that his grandfather  the duke  of B    was dead  and that his mother was then in England  in a forlorn   destitute  dying condition  secreted from the world  and even from her  own relations  by her woman Mary H    who had a particular interest to  secrete her  and altogether dependent upon a miserable and precarious  allowance from the duchess of B    to whose caprice she was
