The very Judges also  being chosen by the court  were entirely devoted to the King  so that all conspired to lift him above justice  and induced him to call parliaments no more  whose maxims of government he found diametrically opposite to his own   He was therefore resolved to fix upon other methods of raising money  methods indeed which were practised by his predecessors  but at times when they had power to controll even justice  and force to compel their subjects to obey  Charles  in the midst of a civil war in Scotland  and the discontents of his people at home  at a time when one half of his subjects were preaching sedition  and the other half were learning to despise Kings  without army  and without treasures  resolved to reign with arbitrary power   With the taxes which he levied without parliaments in England  he undertook to bring about the reformation in Scotland  and therefore began  as his parliament was now no more  to collect a tax upon the subject called Ship money  This is that famous tax which first rouzed a whole nation  after an unsettled constitution of more than a thousand years  at length to fix and determine the bounds of their own freedom  and the King s prerogative   To give a sanction to the royal orders  this tax was backed by the opinion of all the Judges  who voted it to be customary and legal  Their opinion   11 will  at once  serve to explain the nature of this tax  and what they judged concerning it  It ran thus    We  every man by himself  and all of us together  have taken into serious consideration the case and question concerning Ship money  and it is our opinion  that when the good and safety of the Kingdom in general is concerned  and the Kingdom in danger  that your Majesty may  by writ under the great seal of England  command all your subjects of this your kingdom  at their charge  to provide and furnish such number of ships with men  victuals  and ammunition  and for such time as your Majesty shall think fit  for the defence and safety of this Kingdom from such danger and peril  And that  by law  your Majesty may compel the doing thereof  in case of refusal or refractoriness  And we are also of opinion  that in such case your Majesty is the sole judge both of the danger  and when and how the same is to he prevented and avoided   c     An order from the throne  thus backed by the opinion of all the Judges  it was thought  would be  at once  complied with  but the King was deceived  A private man  of courage and integrity  one John Hampden  stood forth as a champion for the people  and refused to pay a tax not authorized by parliament  The sum at which he was rated amounted to but twenty shillings  yet he refused to contribute even this  and brought his cause before the court of Exchequer  Never was a greater cause argued in any court before  The Judges  by their sentence  were to determine whether the nation  and their posterity  were to be subject to arbitrary power  or to enjoy freedom  The Judges determined in favour of servitude  Hampden was cast  and this only served to increase the discontents of the people   The discontent and opposition the King found among his English subjects  one would have thought  might serve to repress his ardour for reformation in the religion of Scotland  Having published an order   12 for reading the liturgy in the principal church in Edinburgh  the people received it with clamours and imprecations  the court party blamed their obstinacy  as the innovations were trifling  but this was retorted against themselves with still greater force  for labouring so earnestly at the establishment of trifles  The sedition in that kingdom  which had hitherto been secret  was now kept concealed no longer  rebellion had  as it were  set up its standard amongst them  Yet still the King could not resolve to desist from his design  and so prepossessed was he in favour of royal right  that he thought the very name of a King would influence them to return to duty  He was soon undeceived  the Scotch Calvinists  whose principles were republican  entered into a covenant to suppress the Bishops  and resist the King s authority  This was judged an open declaration of war  and Charles summoned the Nobility of England  who held lands of the crown  to furnish a proper number of forces to suppress them  To add to his supplies  he demanded a voluntary contribution from the Clergy  and by means of his Queen the Catholics also were pressed for their assistance  By these methods he found himself at the head of an undisciplined and reluctant army  amounting to about twenty thousand men  commanded by Generals more willing to negotiate than to fight  However  his superiority of number gave him a manifest advantage over the malecontents  who were not slow in marching to oppose him  Charles had inherited the peaceful disposition of his father  he was unwilling to come to extremities  although a blow  then struck with vigour  might have prevented many of his
