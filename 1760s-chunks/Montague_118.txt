rays of divinity       She has  beyond all I ever saw in either sex  the polish of the world  without having lost that sweet simplicity of manner  that unaffected innocence  and integrity of heart  which are so very apt to evaporate in a crowd       I ride out often alone  in order to have the pleasure of returning to her  these little absences give new spirit to our tenderness  Every care forsakes me at the sight of this temple of real love  my sweet Emily meets me with smiles  her eyes brighten when I approach  she receives my friends with the most lively pleasure  because they are my friends  I almost envy them her attention  though given for my sake        Elegant in her dress and house  she is all transport when any little ornament of either pleases me  but what charms me most  is her tenderness for my mother  in whose heart she rivals both me and Lucy       My happiness  my friend  is beyond every idea I had formed  were I a little richer  I should not have a wish remaining        Do not  however  imagine this wish takes from my felicity       I have enough for myself  I have even enough for Emily  love makes us indifferent to the parade of life        But I have not enough to entertain my friends as I wish  nor to enjoy the god like pleasure of beneficence       We shall be obliged  in order to support the little appearance necessary to our connexions  to give an attention rather too strict to our affairs  even this  however  our affection for each other will make easy to us        My whole soul is so taken up with this charming woman  I am afraid I shall become tedious even to you  I must learn to restrain my tenderness  and write on common subjects       I am more and more pleased with the way of life I have chose  and  were my fortune ever so large  would pass the greatest part of the year in the country  I would only enlarge my house  and fill it with friends       My situation is a very fine one  though not like the magnificent scenes to which we have been accustomed in Canada  the house stands on the sunny side of a hill  at the foot of which  the garden intervening  runs a little trout stream  which to the right seems to be lost in an island of oziers  and over which is a rustic bridge into a very beautiful meadow  where at present graze a numerous flock of sheep       Emily is planning a thousand embellishments for the garden  and will next year make it a wilderness of sweets  a paradise worthy its lovely inhabitant  she is already forming walks and flowery arbors in the wood  and giving the whole scene every charm which taste  at little expence  can bestow        I  on my side  am selecting spots for plantations of trees  and mean  like a good citizen  to serve at once myself and the public  by raising oaks  which may hereafter bear the British thunder to distant lands        I believe we country gentlemen  whilst we have spirit to keep ourselves independent  are the best citizens  as well as subjects  in the world       Happy ourselves  we wish not to destroy the tranquillity of others  intent on cares equally useful and pleasing  with no views but to improve our fortunes by means equally profitable to ourselves and to our country  we form no schemes of dishonest ambition  and therefore disturb no government to serve our private designs       It is the profuse  the vicious  the profligate  the needy  who are the Clodios and Catilines of this world       That love of order  of moral harmony  so natural to virtuous minds  to minds at ease  is the strongest tie of rational obedience       The man who feels himself prosperous and happy  will not easily be perswaded by factious declamation that he is undone        Convinced of the excellency of our constitution  in which liberty and prerogative are balanced with the steadiest hand  he will not endeavor to remove the boundaries which secure both  he will not endeavor to root it up  whilst he is pretending to give it nourishment  he will not strive to cut down the lovely and venerable tree under whose shade he enjoys security and peace       In short  and I am sure you will here be of my opinion  the man who has competence  virtue  true liberty  and the woman he loves  will chearfully obey the laws which secure him these blessings  and the prince under whose mild sway he enjoys them       Adieu    Your faithful  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CC   200   To Captain FITZGERALD   Oct  17   I EVERY hour see more strongly  my dear Fitzgerald  the wisdom  as to our own happiness  of not letting our hearts be worn out by a multitude of intrigues before marriage        Temple loves my sister  he is happy
