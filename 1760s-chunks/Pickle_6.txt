 d noise about this  engagement with the French  but  egad  it was no more than a bumboat  battle  in comparison with some that I have seen  There was old Rook and  Jennings  and another whom I ll be d  d before I name  that knew what    6 22 15  3 45 PM   fighting was  As for my own share  d ye see  I am none of those that  hallo in their own commendation  but if so be that I were minded to  stand my own trumpeter  some of those little fellows that hold their  heads so high would be taken all aback  as the saying is  they would  be ashamed to show their colours  d   my eyes  I once lay eight glasses  alongside of the Flour de Louse  a French man of war  though her mettle  was heavier  and her complement larger by a hundred hands than mine   You  Jack Hatchway  d   ye  what d ye grin at  D ye think I tell a  story  because you never heard it before     Why  look ye  sir   answered the lieutenant   I am glad to find you can  stand your own trumpeter on occasion  though I wish you would change the  tune  for that is the same you have been piping every watch for these  ten months past  Tunley himself will tell you he has heard it five  hundred times     God forgive you  Mr  Hatchway   said the landlord   interrupting him   as I am an honest man and a housekeeper  I never  heard a syllable of the matter    This declaration  though not strictly true  was extremely agreeable  to Mr  Trunnion  who  with an air of triumph  observed   Aha  Jack   I thought I should bring you up  with your gibes and your jokes  but  suppose you had heard it before  is that any reason why it shouldn t  be told to another person  There s the stranger  belike he has heard it  five hundred times too  han t you  brother   addressing himself to Mr   Pickle  who replying  with a look expressing curiosity   No  never   he  thus went on   Well  you seem to be an honest  quiet sort of a man   and therefore you must know  as I said before  I fell in with a French  man of war  Cape Finistere bearing about six leagues on the weather bow   and the chase three leagues to leeward  going before the wind  whereupon  I set my studding sails  and coming up with her  hoisted my jack and  ensign  and poured in a broadside  before you could count three rattlins  in the mizen shrouds  for I always keep a good look out  and love to  have the first fire     That I ll be sworn   said Hatchway   for the day we made the Triumph  you ordered the men to fire when she was hull to  by the same token we  below pointed the guns at a flight of gulls  and I won a can of punch  from the gunner by killing the first bird    Exasperated at this sarcasm  he replied  with great vehemence   You lie   lubber  D   your bones  what business have you to come always athwart  my hawse in this manner  You  Pipes  was upon deck  and can bear witness  whether or not I fired too soon  Speak  you blood of a       and that  upon the word of a seaman  how did the chase bear of us when I gave  orders to fire    Pipes  who had hitherto sat silent  being thus called upon to give his  evidence  after divers strange gesticulations  opened his mouth like  a gasping cod  and with a cadence like that of the east wind singing  through a cranny  pronounced   Half a quarter of a league right upon our  lee beam     Nearer  you porpuss faced swab   cried the commodore   nearer by  twelve fathom  but  howsomever  that s enough to prove the falsehood of  Hatchway s jaw  and so  brother  d ye see   turning to Pickle   I lay  alongside of the Flour de Louse  yard arm and yard arm  plying out great  guns and small arms  and heaving in stink pots  powder bottles  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   hand grenades  till our shot was all expended  double headed  partridge  and grape  then we loaded with iron crows  marlin spikes  and old nails   but finding the Frenchman took a good deal of drubbing  and that he had  shot away all our rigging  and killed and wounded a great number of our  men  d ye see  I resolved to run him on board upon his quarter  and so
