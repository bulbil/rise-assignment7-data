author s bed chamber  the picture was sketched in my own apartment  for you must know  gentlemen  that I am myself the heroe  Then putting himself into the attitude of   121 an orator  with all the emphasis of voice and action  he proceeded    Where the Red Lion flaring o er the way   Invites each passing stranger that can pay   Where Calvert s butt  and Parson s black champaign   Regale the drabs and bloods of Drury lane   There in a lonely room  from bailiffs snug   The muse found Scroggen stretch d beneath a rug   A window patch d with paper lent a ray   That dimly shew d the state in which he lay   The sanded floor that grits beneath the tread   The humid wall with paltry pictures spread   The royal game of goose was there in view   And the twelve rules the royal martyr drew   The seasons fram d with listing found a place   And brave prince William shew d his lamp black face   The morn was cold  he views with keen desire  The rusty grate unconscious of a fire   With beer and milk arrears the frieze was scor d   And five crack d tea cups dress d the chimney board   A night cap deck d his brows instead of bay   A cap by night—a stocking all the day   With this last line he seemed so much elated  that he was unable to proceed     There gentlemen  cries he  there is a description for you  Rablais s bed chamber is but a fool to it   A cap by night—a stocking all the day   There is sound and sense  and truth  and nature in the trifling compass of ten little syllables    He was too much employed in self admiration to observe the company  who by nods  winks  shrugs    122 and stifled laughter  testified every mark of contempt  He turned severally to each for their opinion  and found all however ready to applaud  One swore it was inimitable  another said it was damn d fine  and a third cried out in rapture Carissimo  At last addressing himself to the president  and pray  Mr  Squint  says he  let us have your opinion  Mine  answered the president   taking the manuscript out of the author s hands  may this glass suffocate me  but I think it equal to any thing I have seen  and I fancy   continued he doubling up the poem  and forcing it into the author s pocket  that you will get great honour when it comes out  so I shall beg leave to put it in  We will not intrude upon your good nature  in desiring to hear more of it at present  ex ungue Herculem  we are satisfied  perfectly satisfied  The author made two or three attempts to pull it out a second time  and the president made as many to prevent him  Thus though with reluctance he was at last obliged to sit down  contented with the commendations for which he had paid   When this tempest of poetry and praise was blown over  one of the company changed the subject  by wondering how any man could be so dull as to write poetry at present  since prose itself would hardly pay  Would you think it  gentlemen  continued he  I have actually written last week sixteen prayers  twelve bawdy jests  and three sermons  all at the rate of sixpence a piece  and what is still more extraordinary  the bookseller has lost by the bargain  Such sermons would once have gain d me a prebend s stall  but now alas we have neither piety  taste  nor humour among us  Positively if this season does not turn out better   123 than it has begun  unless the ministry commit some blunders to furnish us with a new topic of abuse  I shall resume my old business of working at the press  instead of finding it employment   The whole club seem to join in condemning the season  as one of the worst that had come for some time  a gentleman particularly observed that the nobility were never known to subscribe worse than at present   I know not how it happens  said he  though I follow them up as close as possible  yet I can hardly get a single subscription in a week  The houses of the great are as inaccessible as a frontier garrison at mid night  I never see a nobleman s door half opened that some surly porter or footman does not stand full in the breach  I was yesterday to wait with a subscription proposal upon my lord Squash the creolian  I had posted myself at his door the whole morning  and just as he was getting into his coach  thrust my proposal snugg into his hand folded up in the form of a letter from myself  He just glanced at the superscription  and  not knowing the hand  consigned it to his valet de chambre  this respectable personage treated it as his master  and put it into the hands of the porter  The porter grasped my proposal frowning  and  measuring my figure from top to toe  put it
