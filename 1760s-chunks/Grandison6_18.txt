to whom   Lady Anne S —Poor Lady Anne S  —I dare not tell my brothet how much she loves him  I am sure it would make him uneasy   Beauchamp desires his compliments to you  He is in great affliction  Poor Sir Harry is thought irrecoverable  Different physicians have gone their rounds with him  But the new ones only ask what the old ones did  that they may guess at something else to make trial of  When a patient has money  it is hard  I believe  for a physician to be honest  and to say  till the last extremity  That the Parson and Sexton may take him   Adieu  my love —Adieu  all my grandmammas  aunts  cousins  and kin s kin of Northamptonshire—Adieu   CHARLOTTE G   LETTER XII  Miss BYRON  To Lady G    Tuesday  Oct  3   A Thousand thanks to you  my dear Lady G  for the favour of your last  You have re assured me in it  I think I could not have been happy even in the affection of Sir Charles Grandison  were I to have found an abatement in the Love of his two sisters  Who  that knows you both  and that had been favoured with your friendship  could have been satisfied with the least diminution of it     45 I have a Letter from the Countess of D  a   She is a most generous woman     She even congratulates me  on your brother s account  from the conversation that passed between him and her  She gives me the particulars of that conversation  Exceedingly flattering are they to my vanity    I must  my dear  be happy  if you continue to love me  and if I can know that Lady Clementina is not unhappy  This latter is a piece of Intelligence  necessary  I was going to say  for my tranquility  For can your brother be happy  if that Lady be otherwise  whose grievous malady could hold in suspence his generous heart  when he had no prospects at the time  of ever calling her his     I pity from my heart Lady Anne S  What a dreadful thing is hopeless Love  the object so worthy  that every mouth is full of his praises  How many women will your brother s preference of one  be she who she will  disappoint in their first Loves  Yet out of a hundred women  how few are there  who  for one reason  or other  have the man of their choice   I remember  you once said  It was well that Love is not a passion absolutely invincible  But  however  I do not  my dear  agree with you in your notions of all Love matches  Love merely personal  that sort of Love which commences between the year of fifteen and twenty  and when the extraordinary merit of the object is not the foundation of it  may  I believe  and perhaps generally ought to  be subdued  But Love that is founded on a merit that every body acknowleges—I don t know what to say to the vincibility of such a Love  For myself  I think it impossible that I ever could have been the wife of any man on earth  and given him my affection in so entire a manner  as should  on reflexion  have acquitted my own heart—Tho  I hope I should not have been wanting in my general duties—And why impossible  Because I must   46 have been conscious  that there was another man whom I would have preferred to him  Let me add  that when prospects were darkest with regard to my wishes  I promised my grandmamma and aunt  to make myself easy  at least to endeavour to do so  if they never would propose to me the Earl of D  or any other man  They did promise me   Lady D  in her Letter to me     is so good as to claim the continuance of my correspondence    Most ungrateful  and equally self denying  must I be  if I were to decline my part of it     I have a Letter from Sir Rowland Meredith  a You  who have seen his former Letters to me  need not be shewn this  The same honest heart appears in them all  the same kind professions of paternal love  You love Sir Rowland  and will be pleased to hear that his worthy nephew is likely to recover his health  I cannot  however  be joyful that they are resolved to make me soon one more visit  But you will see that Mr  Fowler thinks  if he could be allowed to visit me once more  he should  tho  hoping nothing from the visit  be easier for the rest of his life  A strange way of thinking  supposing Love to be his distemper  Is it not   I have a Letter from Mr  Fenwick  He is arrived at his seat near Daventry  He has made a very short excursion abroad  He tells me in it  that he designs me a visit on a particular subject  If it be  as I suspect  to engage my interest with
