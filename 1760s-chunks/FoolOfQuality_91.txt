you are extremely unequal and   disproportioned   one moment you soar where no eye can see  and   straight descend with rapidity  to creep in the vulgar phrase of   chambermaids and children  Then you are so desultory that we   know not where to have you  you no sooner interest us in one   subject  than you drag us  however reluctant  to another  In short    I doubt whether you laid any kind of plan before you set about   the building   but we shall see how your fortuitous concourse of   atoms will turn out      Author  Do I want nature       Friend  No      Author  Do I want spirit       Friend  Kather too much of fire at times      Author  Do I want sentiment       Friend  Not altogether      Author  Then  sir  I shall be read and read again  in despite of   my own defects  and of all that you and your critics can say or do   against me  The truth is  that the critics are very far from being   bugbears to me  they have always proved my friends  my best   benefactors  They were the first who writ me into any kind of   reputation   and I am more beholden to their invectives than I am   to my own genius  for any little name I may have got in the world     all I have to fear is  that they are already tired of railing  and may     not deem me worth their further notice  But pray  my good sir      if you desire that I should profit by your admonitions  ought you   not to give me instances of the faults with which you reproach me       Friend  That would be time and labour altogether thrown away    as I have not the smallest hope of bringing you to confession    You are a disputant  a casuist  by your education   you are equally   studied and practised in turning any thing into nothing  or bringing   all things thereout  But do not flatter yourself that I have yet   given you the detail of half your faults   you are often paradoxical    and extremely peremptory and desperate in your assertions  In   this very last page you affirm that the character of a gentleman is   the most reverable  the highest of all characters      Author  I did  sir   I do affirm it  and will make it good      Friend  I knew it  sir  I knew it   but do not choose at present   to enter into the discussion  At the next pause I shall willingly   hear you on this question          70 THE FOOL OF QUALITY          CHAPTER VII      ON his return he ordered a fire and a bottle of wine into his   study  and sent for Mr  Clement  Mr  Clement  says he  sit down    I assure you  Mr  Clement  I am inclined to think very well of you    But pray let me have the narrative of your life and manners with    out disguise  An ingenuous confession and sense of past errors   has something in it  to me full as amiable  or more  than if a man   had never strayed      Sir  says Mr  Clement  I have indeed been faulty  very faulty in   my intentions  though God has hitherto preserved me from any   very capital act  and has  by your hand  wonderfully brought me   to this day      HISTOBY OF THE MAN OP LETTEES      Bartholomew Clement  sir  a retailer of hardware on the Strand    is my father  He was low bred  and  as I believe  of narrow ca    pacity   but proceeding in what they call the dog trot of life  and   having a single eye to the making of money  he became vastly   rich  and has now a large income from houses and ground rents   in the city of Westminster  the fruits and acquisition of his own   application      I remember nothing of my mother except her fondness for me     nor of her character  except the tears that I have seen my father   shed when occasional circumstances have brought her fresh to his   memory  She died when I was in my seventh year  I was their   only surviving child   and my father transferred all his tenderness   for her to me      The love of my father was not the mere partiality or prejudice   of a parent   it
