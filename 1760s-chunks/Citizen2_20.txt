delicacy in the faces of their finest women  This may have introduced the use of paint  and paint produces wrinkles  so that a fine lady shall look like an hag at twenty three  But as in some measure they never appear young  so it may be equally asserted  that they actually think themselves never old  a gentle Miss shall prepare for new conquests at sixty  shall hobble a rigadoon when she can scarce walk without a crutch  she shall affect the girl  play her fan and her eyes  and talk of sentiments  bleeding hearts  and expiring for love  when actually dying with age  Like a departing philosopher  she attempts to make her last moments the most brilliant of her life   Their civility to strangers is what they are chiefly proud of  and to confess sincerely  their beggars are the very politest beggars I ever knew  in other places a traveller is addressed with a piteous whine  or a sturdy solemnity  but a French beggar shall ask your charity with a very genteel bow  and thank you for it with a smile and a shrugg   Another instance of this people s breeding I must not forget  An Englishman would not speak his native language in a company of foreigners where he was sure that none understood him  a travelling Hottentot himself would be silent if acquainted only with the language of his country  but a Frenchman shall talk to you whether you understand his language or not  never troubling his head whether you have learned French  still he keeps up the conversation  fixes his eye full in your face  and asks   58 a thousand questions  which he answers himself for want of a more satisfactory reply   But their civility to foreigners is not half so great as their admiration of themselves  Every thing that belongs to them and their nation is great  magnificent beyond expression  quite romantic  every garden is a paradise  every hovel a palace  and every woman an angel  They shut their eyes close  throw their mouths wide open  and cry out in rapture  Sacre  What beauty  O Ciel  what taste  mort de ma vie  what grandeur  was ever any people like ourselves  we are the nation of men  and all the rest no better than two legged barbarians   I fancy the French would make the best cooks in the world  if they had but meat  as it is  they can dress you out five different dishes from a nettle top  seven from a dock leaf  and twice as many from a frog s haunches  these eat prettily enough when one is a little used to them  are easy of digestion  and seldom overload the stomach with crudities  They seldom dine under seven hot dishes  it is true  indeed  with all this magnificence  they seldom spread a cloth before the guests  but in that I cannot be angry with them  since those who have got no linnen on their backs  may very well be excused for wanting it upon their tables   Even religion itself loses its solemnity among them  Upon their roads  at about every five miles distance  you see an image of the Virgin Mary dressed up in grim head cloaths  painted cheeks  and an old red petticoat  before her a lamp is often   59 seen burning  at which  with the saint s permission  I have frequently lighted my pipe  Instead of the Virgin you are sometimes presented with a crucifix  at other times with a wooden Saviour  fitted out in complete garniture  with sponge  spear  nails  pincers  hammer  bees wax  and vinegar bottle  Some of these images  I have been told  came down from heaven  if so  in heaven they have but bungling workmen   In passing through their towns  you frequently see the men sitting at the doors knitting stockings  while the care of cultivating the ground and pruning the vines falls to the women  This is perhaps the reason why the fair sex are granted some peculiar privileges in this country  particularly  when they can get horses  of riding without a side saddle   But I begin to think you may find this description pert and dull enough  perhaps it is so  yet in general it is the manner in which the French usually describe foreigners  and it is but just to force a part of that ridicule back upon them  which they attempt to lavish on others   Adieu   LETTER LXXVI  From the same   THE two theatres  which serve to amuse the citizens here  are again opened for the winter  The mimetic troops  different from those of   60 the state  begin their campaign when all the others quit the field  and at a time when the Europeans cease to destroy each other in reality  they are entertained with mock battles upon the stage   The dancing master once more shakes his quivering feet  the carpenter prepares his paradise of pasteboard  the hero resolves to cover his forehead with brass  and the heroine begins to scour up her copper tail  preparative to future operations  in short  all are in motion  from the theatrical letter carrier in yellow cloaths  to Alexander the Great that stands on a stool   Both
