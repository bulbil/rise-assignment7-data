their benignity  who is so likely to receive the balm of consolation as  Your ever dutiful and affectionate Daughter HAR  BEAUCLERK     P S   When I write to my dear mama I never know where to leave off—I should have told you that Butler  a very sensible fellow  who is servant to the colonel  has been sent away to London to make a minute enquiry at Mrs  Darnel s  in relation to Louisa—God grant the honest man may succeed  for  if friendship is liable to be attended with such anguish   104 as I feel upon this dear but unfortunate girl s account  I must  for the future  avoid every acquaintance with the most amiable part of my sex  for fear of being plunged into continual calamities       105  LETTER XVIII  Sir ROBERT HAROLD to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq    VIENNA  August 2   IT is in vain  my dear Melmoth  I find  for your unfortunate friend to continue any longer abroad  the change of country in no manner tends to alleviate the distresses of his bosom  nor erases in the least the form of that amiable wretch  that Miss Mildmay  from his recollection  If possible  she gives him every moment an additional pang  and  till he becomes utterly deprived both of memory and sense  he must feel the sharpest affliction on her account   In reality  Charles  though it is now twelve months since the infamous flight   106 of that unfortunate girl  I am rather more wretched than ever—She is continually present to my imagination  and I find  in spite of my pride and my reason  that she holds an absolute empire over my heart  and that I must actually cease to live before I can actually cease to love her  Don t despise me  however  my dear Melmoth—I blush for my own baseness  in suffering the abandoned woman even to steal a single instant upon my thoughts  but  alas  the more I would banish her  the more forcible she returns  and I am distracted with a perpetual round of tenderness and shame  of pity and indignation  wherever I go I am torn with a variety of opposite passions  and  to use the language of poor Sciolto    All within is anarchy and uproar        107How  Melmoth  when I received your first letter at Rotterdam  did my soul exult in the expectation of being completely happy with Louisa  The most distant insinuation of that delicacy which originally caused all our misfortunes  was then argued down into silence  and the universal joy which I thought would flow from a reconciliation  added to the tumultuous tide of transport that swelled about my heart from a still more natural cause  gave me an absolute foretaste of elysium —But Providence thought proper  by an accident which I considered  at that time  as the greatest of all calamities  to snatch me from the smiling destruction  and graciously counteracted the warmth of my wishes to preserve me from everlasting disgrace—O  Melmoth  had I been married to her before this fortunate discovery of her infamy—think what would have been the consequence —To the remotest   108 confine of the world I had pursued her  and  as Othello says    Had all her hairs been lives  my great revenge  Had stomach for them all   In fact  Charles  I should have proceeded upon some immediate act of desperation  and  perhaps  after I had sacrificed her to the justice of my resentment  it is more than probable I had been tempted to lay violent hands on myself     You see  however  my dear friend  from the conduct of this unhappy wretch  how much reason I had for supposing that the woman who deviates from the rules of virtue with one man  will have very little scruple to indulge the licentious turn of her disposition with another  you see what reason I had to set Louisa s crime down to the account of genuine constitution  instead of attributing it to the weakness of an   109 extravagant love—But your women of strong passions  Charles  are continually falling in love  every fresh object inspires a fresh desire  and when they have once conquered that exalted delicacy of sentiment  which is the principal bulwark of their honour  they give an unbounded license to enjoyment  and imagine that  since they have been familiar with one person  there can be no addition to their guilt by an equal familiarity with all  Thus  instead of an endeavour to recover the hallowed paths of innocence  they make a single indiscretion an excuse for the commission of a thousand  and indulge every rising gust of inclination  by arguing themselves into a belief that it cannot in the least increase the infamy of their characters   You pleased me extremely by your repeated accounts of colonel s Mildmay s   110 perfect recovery  Poor fellow  he now sees for what a worthless woman he ventured his life  and those mad headed puppies that are for resenting the ruin of a sister  impatient to be ruined  and one who places the principal of all felicities in her absolute destruction  will  I hope  be warned by Louisa s conduct  from hazarding their throats whenever a profligate hussey
