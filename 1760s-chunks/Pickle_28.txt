  6 22 15  3 45 PM   which to them was equally strange and inexplicable  this was no other  than such a reduction in the size of Mrs  Trunnion as might have been  expected after the birth of a full grown child  Startled at such an  unaccountable event  they sat in close divan  and concluding that  the case was in all respects unnatural and prodigious  desired that a  messenger might be immediately despatched for some male practitioner in  the art of midwifery   The commodore  without guessing the cause of her perplexity  ordered  Pipes immediately on this piece of duty  and in less than two hours  they were assisted by the advice of a surgeon of the neighbourhood   who boldly affirmed that the patient had never been with child  This  asseveration was like a clap of thunder to Mr  Trunnion  who had been   during eight whole days and nights  in continual expectation of being  hailed with the appellation of father   After some recollection  he swore the surgeon was an ignorant fellow   and that he would not take his word for what he advanced  being  comforted and confirmed in his want of faith by the insinuations of  the midwife  who still persisted to feed Mrs  Trunnion with hopes of a  speedy and safe delivery  observing that she had been concerned in many  a case of the same nature  where a fine child was found  even after all  signs of the mother s pregnancy had disappeared  Every twig of hope  how  slender soever it may be  is eagerly caught hold on by people who find  themselves in danger of being disappointed  To every question proposed  by her to the lady  with the preambles of  Han t you   or  Don t you    answer was made in the affirmative  whether agreeable to truth or not   because the respondent could not find in her heart to disown any symptom  that might favour the notion she had so long indulged   This experienced proficient in the obstetric art was therefore kept in  close attendance for the space of three weeks  during which the patient  had several returns of what she pleased herself with believing to be  labour pains  till at length  she and her husband became the standing  joke of the parish  and this infatuated couple could scarce be prevailed  upon to part with their hope  even when she appeared as lank as a  greyhound  and they were furnished with other unquestionable proofs of  their having been deceived  But they could not for ever remain under  the influence of this sweet delusion  which at last faded away  and was  succeeded by a paroxysm of shame and confusion  that kept the husband  within doors for the space of a whole fortnight  and confined his lady  to her bed for a series of weeks  during which she suffered all the  anguish of the most intense mortification  yet even this was subdued by  the lenient hand of time   The first respite from her chagrin was employed in the strict discharge  of what are called the duties of religion  which she performed with  the most rancorous severity  setting on foot a persecution in her own  family  that made the house too hot for all the menial servants  even  ruffled the almost invincible indifference of Tom Pipes  harassed the  commodore himself out of all patience  and spared no individual but  Lieutenant Hatchway  whom she never ventured to disoblige   CHAPTER XI      6 22 15  3 45 PM   Mrs  Trunnion erects a Tyranny in the Garrison  while her Husband  conceives an affection for his Nephew Perry  who manifests a peculiarity  of disposition even in his tender years   Having exercised herself three months in such pious amusements  she  appeared again in the world  but her misfortune had made such an  impression on her mind  that she could not bear the sight of a child   and trembled whenever conversation happened to turn upon a christening   Her temper  which was naturally none of the sweetest  seemed to have  imbibed a double proportion of souring from her disappointment  of  consequence  her company was not much coveted  and she found very few  people disposed to treat her with those marks of consideration which she  looked upon as her due  This neglect detached her from the society of an  unmannerly world  she concentrated the energy of all her talents in  the government of her own house  which groaned accordingly under her  arbitrary sway  and in the brandy bottle found ample consolation for all  the affliction she had undergone   As for the commodore  he in a little time weathered his disgrace  after  having sustained many severe jokes from the lieutenant  and now his  chief aim being to be absent from his own house as much as possible  he  frequented the public house more than ever  more assiduously cultivated  the friendship of his brother in law  Mr  Pickle  and in the course of  their intimacy conceived an affection for his nephew Perry  which did  not end but with his life  Indeed
