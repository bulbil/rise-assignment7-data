be delineated  He is generous and warm in his friendships  It is said that he is revengeful  but would he be a Spaniard if he were otherwise  In addition to this  he has been accused of ingratitude  for having driven the Duke of Uzeda and Friar Lewis Aliaga into banishment  though he owed them  according to common report  obligations of the most binding nature  and yet even this must not be looked into so narrowly under his circumstances  there are few breasts capacious enough to afford house room for two such opposite inmates as political ambition and gratitude   Donna Agnes de Zuniga Ã© Velasco  Countess of Olivarez  continued Joseph  is a lady to whom it is impossible to impute more than one fault  but that is a huge one  for it consists in making a market  and a market the most exorbitant in its terms  of her natural influence over the mind of her husband  As for Donna Maria de Guzman  who beyond all dispute is at this moment the very first match in Spain  she is a lady of first rate accomplishments  and absolutely idolized by her father  Regulate your conduct upon these hints  make your court with art and plausibility to these two ladies  and let it appear as if you were more devoted to the Count of Olivarez than ever you were to the Duke of Lerma before your forced excursion to Segovia  you will become a leading and powerful member of the administration   I should advise you  moreover  added he  to see my master  Don Balthasar  from time to time  for though you have no longer any occasion for his interest to push you forward  it will not be amiss to waste a little incense upon him  You stand very high in his good opinion  preserve your footing there  and cultivate his friendship  it may stand you in some stead on any emergency  I could not help observing  that as the uncle and nephew were in a certain sort partners in the government of the state  there might possibly be some little symptom of jealousy between brothers near the throne  On the contrary  answered he  they are united by the most confidential ties  Had it not been for Don Balthasar  the Count of Olivarez might probably never have been prime minister  for you are to know  that after Philip the Third had paid the debt of nature  all the adherents and partisans belonging to the house of Sandoval made a great stir  some in favour of the cardinal  and others on his son s behalf  but my master  a greater adept in court intrigue than any of them  and the count  who is nearly as great an adept as himself disconcerted all their measures  and took their own so judiciously for the purpose of stepping into the vacant place  that their rivals had no chance against them  The Count of Olivarez  being appointed prime minister  divided the duties with his uncle  Don Balthasar  leaving foreign affairs to him  and taking the home department to himself  the consequence is  that the bonds of family friendship are drawn closer between these two noblemen  than if political influence had no share in their mutual interests  they are perfectly independent in their respective lines of business  and live together on terms of good understanding which no intrigue can possibly affect or alter   Such was the substance of my conversation with Joseph  and the advantage to be derived from it was my own to make the most of  at all events  it was my duty to thank Signor de Zuniga for all the influence he had the goodness to exert in my favour  He assured me with infinite good breeding that he should avail himself of every opportunity as it arose to promote my wishes  and that he was very glad his nephew had behaved so as to meet my ideas  because he meant to refresh his memory in my behalf  being determined  as he was pleased to say  to place it beyond all manner of doubt how far he himself participated in all my views  and to make it evident that  instead of one fast friend  I had two  In terms like these did Don Balthasar  through mere friendship for Navarro  take the moulding of my fortunes on himself   On that same evening did I leave my paltry lodging to take up my abode at the prime minister s  where I sat down to supper with Scipio in my own suite of apartments  There were we both waited on by the servants belonging to the household  who as they stood behind our chairs  while we were affecting the pomp and circumstance of political elevation  were more likely than not to be laughing in their sleeves at the pantomime they had been ordered by their manager to play in our presence  When they had taken away and left us to ourselves  my secretary being no longer under restraint  gave vent to a thousand wild imaginations which his sprightly temper and inventive hopes engendered in his fancy  On my part  though by no means cold or insensible to the brilliant prospects which were opening on my view  I did not as yet yield in the least degree to the weakness of being thrust aside from the right line of my philosophy by temporal allurements  So much otherwise  that on
