 made his escape into Catalonia with every thing he could get together in jewels and ready money  He embarked at Barcelona  went over into Italy  enlisted in the Venetian service  and finally lost his life in the Morea  fighting against the Turks  In the mean time  a landed estate which constituted our whole revenue was confiscated  and I was left a widow with very little for my support  What was to be done in so pressing an emergency  There was nothing left to pay my travelling expenses back into the Asturias  And then what should I have done there  I should have got nothing from my family but a long string of condolences  which would have furnished me neither with food nor with raiment  On the other hand  I had been too well brought up to fall into those courses  into which too many poor young women are betrayed for the sake of a scandalous subsistence  There was but one thing remaining for me to determine on  I turned actress to preserve my morals   So tingling a sense of ridicule came over me  when Laura wound up her romance with this pious motive for turning actress  that I could scarcely refrain from relieving myself by a fit of laughter  But gravity was of too much consequence to be dispensed with  and I said to her with an air the counterpart of her own    My dear sister  I entirely approve of your conduct  and am heartily glad to meet with you at Grenada  and moreover settled on so respectable a footing   The Marquis de Marialva  who had not lost a word of all these fine speeches  swallowed down blindfold whatever Don Antonio s widow thought fit to drench his credulity with  He took part in the conversation too  and asked me whether I had any fixed employment in Grenada or elsewhere  I paused for a moment to consider whether and after what manner I should lie  but as there seemed no need in this case to draw on my invention  I told the truth by way of variety  In a plain matter of fact manner did I rehearse my introduction to the archbishop s palace  and my discharge therefrom  to the infinite amusement of his Portuguese lordship  To be sure  in telling the truth  I did not keep my word  for I could not help launching out a little at the archbishop s expense  in spite of my solemn promise given to Melchior  But the best of the joke was  that Laura  taking my story for a fiction invented after her example  burst out into peals of laughter  whereas the whimsicality of the circumstance would have raised a soberer mirth  had she known it to have been alloyed with the base ingredient of veracity   After having come to the end of my tale  which closed with just mentioning the lodging I had taken  dinner was announced  I instantly motioned to with draw  as if intending to take that frugal meal at home  but Laura would not hear of it  Do you mean to affront me  brother  said she  You must dine here  Indeed  I cannot think of your staying any longer at a paltry inn  You must positively board and lodge in my house  Send your trunks hither this very evening  there is a spare bed for you   His Portuguese lordship  possibly not altogether relishing this excess of hospitality even to a brother  then interfered between us  and said to Laura    No  Estella  you have not sufficient accommodation to give him a bed without inconvenience  Your brother seems to be a clever young fellow  and the circumstance of his being so nearly related to you  gives him a strong claim on my kindness  He shall be put at once upon my establishment  I am in want of a secretary  and shall delight in giving him the appointment  he shall be my right hand man  Let him be sure to come and sleep at my house this very night  I will order a room to be got ready for him  I will fix his regular salary at four hundred ducats  and if on better acquaintance I have reason as I trust I shall  to be satisfied with him  I will place him in a situation to laugh at the consequences of having been a little too plain spoken with his patron the archbishop   My acknowledgments to the marquis for this high honour were followed by those of Laura  who far exceeded me in powers of panegyric  Let us drop the subject  interrupted he  it is a settled point Settled as it was  he confirmed the contract on the lips of his green room Dulcinea  and went his way  She immediately pulled me by the arm into a closet  where  secure from interruption  she cried out  Cut my laces  I shall burst if I do not give way at once to the fit of laughter that is coming over me  And so she probably would  for she threw herself into an arm chair  and holding both her sides  shouted out her convulsive peal of mirth like a mad woman  It was impossible for me to refrain from following her example  When we had exhausted our risible propensities  Own  Gil Blas  said she  that we have just
