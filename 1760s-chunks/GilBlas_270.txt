on were not lost to my sober recollection  My neglect of filial piety struck home to my heart  and melted me into tears  When I recollected how much my childhood was indebted to my parents  what pains they had taken in my education  these affecting thoughts gave language for the moment to the still small voice of nature and gratitude  but the language was never translated into solid sense and service  An habitual callousness succeeded this transient sensation  and peremptorily cancelled every obligation of humanity  There are many fathers besides mine  who will acknowledge this portrait of their sons   Avarice and ambition  dividing me between them  annihilated every trace of my former temper  I lost all my gaiety  became absent and moping     in short  a most unsociable animal  Fabricio seeing me so furiously bent on accumulation  and so perfectly indifferent to him  very rarely came to see me  He could not help saying one day  In truth  Gil Blas  you are quite an altered man  Before you were about the court  you were always pleasant and easy  Now you are all agitation and turmoil  You form project after project to make a fortune  and the more you realize  the wider your views of aggrandizement extend  But this is not the worst  You have no longer that expansion of heart  those open manners  which form the charm of friendship  On the contrary  you wrap yourself round  and shut the avenues of your heart even to me  In your very civilities  I detect the violence you impose upon yourself  In short  Gil Blas is no longer the same Gil Blas whom I once knew   You really have a most happy talent for bantering  answered I  with repulsive jocularity  But this metamorphose into the shag of a savage is not perceptible to myself  Your own eyes  replied he  are insensible to the change  because they are fascinated  But the fact remains the same  Now  my friend  tell me fairly and honestly  shall we live together as heretofore  When I used to knock at your door in the morning  you came and opened it yourself  between asleep and awake  and I walked in without ceremony  Now  what a difference  You have an establishment of servants  They keep me cooling my heels in your ante chamber  my name must be sent in before I can speak to you  When this is got over  what is my reception  A cold inclination of the head  and the insolent strut of office  Any one would suppose that my visits were growing troublesome  Can you suppose this to be treatment for a man who was once on equal terms with you  No  Santillane  it can never be  nor will I bear it longer  Farewell  Let us part without ill blood  We shall both be better asunder  you will get rid of a troublesome censor  and I of a purse proud upstart who does not know himself   I felt myself more exasperated than reformed by his reproaches  and suffered him to take his departure without the slightest effort to overcome his resolution  In the present temper of my mind  the friendship of a poet did not seem a catch of sufficient importance to break one s heart about its loss  I found ample amends in the intimacy of some subaltern attendants about the king s person  with whom a similarity of humour had lately connected me closely  These new acquaintance of mine were for the most part men from no one knows where  pushed up to their appointments more by luck than merit  They had all got into warm berths  and  wretches as they were  measuring their own consequence by the excess of royal bounty  forgot their origin as scandalously as I forgot mine  We gave ourselves infinite credit for what told so much and bitterly to our disgrace  O fortune  what a jade you are  to distribute your favours at haphazard as you do  Epictetus was perfectly in the right  when he likened you to a jilt of fashion  prowling about in masquerade  and tipping the wink to every blackguard who parades the street       BOOK THE NINTH       CH  I     Scipio s scheme of marriage for Gil Blas  The match  a rich goldsmith s daughter  Circumstances connected with this speculation   ONE evening  on the departure of my supper company  finding myself alone with Scipio  I asked him what he had been doing that day  Striking a masterstroke  answered he  I intend that you should marry  A goldsmith of my acquaintance has an only daughter  and I mean to make up a match between you   A goldsmith s daughter  exclaimed I with a disdainful air  are you out of your senses  Can you think of tying me up to a trinket maker  People of a certain character in society  and on a certain footing at court  ought to have much higher views of things  Pardon me  sir  rejoined Scipio  do not take the subject up in that light  Recollect that nobility accrues by the male side  and do not ride a higher horse than a thousand jockeys of quality whom I could
