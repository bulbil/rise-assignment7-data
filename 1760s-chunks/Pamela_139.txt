stairs  said he  I had an invitation to a ball  which   is to be this night at Stamford  on occasion of a wedding  and I am   going to call on Sir Simon  and his lady and daughters  for the bride is   a relation of theirs  so I shall not be at home till Saturday  I come    therefore  to caution you  Mrs  Jewkes  before Pamela   that she may   not wonder at being closer confined  than for these three or four days   past   that nobody sees her  nor delivers any letter to her  in that   space  for a person has been seen lurking about  and inquiring after   her  and I have been well informed  that either Mrs  Jervis  or Mr    Longman  has written a letter  with a design of having it conveyed   to her  And  said he  you must know  Pamela  that I have ordered Mr    Longman to give up his accounts  and have dismissed Jonathan and   Mrs  Jervis  since I have been here  for their behaviour has been   intolerable  and they have made such a breach between my sister Davers   and me  as we shall never  perhaps  make up  Now  Pamela  I shall take   it kindly in you  if you will confine yourself to your chamber pretty   much  for the time I am absent  and not give Mrs  Jewkes cause of   trouble or uneasiness  and the rather  as you know she acts by my   orders       Alas  sir  said I  I fear all these good people have suffered for my   sake   Why  said he  I believe so too  and there was never a girl of   your innocence  that set a large family in such an uproar  surely   But   let that pass  You know both of you my mind  and  in part  the reason of   it  I shall only say  that I have had such a letter from my sister  as   I could not have expected  and  Pamela  said he  neither you nor I have   reason to thank her  as you shall know  perhaps at my return   I go in   my coach  Mrs  Jewkes  because I take Lady Darnford  and Mrs  Peters s   niece  and one of Lady Darnford s daughters  along with me  and Sir   Simon and his other daughter go in his chariot  so let all the gates be   fastened  and don t take any airing in either of the chariots  nor let   any body go to the gate  without you  Mrs  Jewkes  I ll be sure  said   she  to obey your honour       I will give Mrs  Jewkes no trouble  sir  said I  and will keep pretty   much in my chamber  and not stir so much as into the garden without her    to shew you I will obey in every thing I can  But I begin to fear  Ay    said he  more plots and contrivances  don t you   But I ll assure you    you never had less reason  and I tell you the truth  for I am really   going to Stamford this time  and upon the occasion I tell you  And so    Pamela  give me your hand  and one kiss  and then I am gone       I durst not refuse  and said  God bless you  sir  wherever you go   But   I am sorry for what you tell me about your servants       He and Mrs  Jewkes had a little talk without the door  and I heard her   say  You may depend  sir  upon my care and vigilance       He went in his coach  as he said he should  and very richly dressed    which looks as if what he said was likely  but really I have been used   to so many tricks  and plots  and surprises  that I know not what to   think  But I mourn for poor Mrs  Jervis   So here is Parson Williams    here s poor naughty John  here is good Mrs  Jervis  and Mr  Longman  and   Mr  Jonathan  turned away for me   Mr  Longman is rich  indeed  and so   need the less matter it  but I know it will grieve him  and for poor Mr    Jonathan  I am sure it will cut that good old servant to the heart  Alas   for me  what mischiefs am I the occasion of   Or  rather  my master    whose actions towards me have made so many of my kind friends forfeit   his favour  for my
