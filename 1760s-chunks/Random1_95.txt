 no  damme  I ll have no profanation neither —But go on with your interrogations  —   Well then  proceeded my examiner  how many sacraments are there  —  To which I replied    Two  —   What are they   said he     I answered    Baptism and the Lord s Supper  —   And so you would explode confirmation and marriage altogether   said Oakhum  I thought this fellow was a rank Roman  —  The clerk  though he was bred under an attorney  could not relrain from blushing at this blunder  which he endeavoured to conceal  by observing  that these decoys would not do with me who seemed to be an old offender —He went on  with asking if I believed in transubstantiation  but I treated the notion of the real presence with such disrespect that his patron was scandalized at my impiety  and commanded him to proceed to the plot —Whereupon this miserable pettifogger told me  there was great reason to suspect me of being a spy on board  and that I had entered into a conspiracy with Thomson and others not yet detected  against the life of captain Oakhum —To support which accusation  they adduced the testimony of our boy  who declared he had often heard the deceased Thomson and me whispering together  and could distinguish the words    Oakhum  rascal  poison  pistol    by which it appeared  we did intend   272 to use sinister means to accomplish his destruction  That the death of Thomson seemed to confirm this conjecture  who  either feeling the stings of remorse  for being engaged in such a horrid confederacy  or fearing a discovery  by which he must have infallibly suffered an ignominious death  had put a fatal period to his own existence —But what established the truth of the whole  was a book in cypher found among my papers  which exactly tallied with one found in his chest  after his disappearance  This  he observed  was a presumption very near proof positive  and would determine any jury in christendom to find me guilty —In my own defence  I alledged that I had been dragged on board at first very much against my inclination  as I could prove by the evidence of some people now in the ship  consequently could have no design of becoming spy at that time  and ever since had been entirely out of the reach of any correspondence that could justly intail that suspicion upon me —and as for conspiring against my captain s life  it could not be supposed that any man in his right wits would harbour the least thought of such an undertaking  which he could not possibly perform without certain infamy and ruin to himself  even if he had all the inclination in the world —That allowing the boy s evidence to be true  which I affirmed was false and malicious  nothing conclusive could be gathered from a few incoherent words  Neither was the fate of Mr  Thomson a circumstance more favourable for the charge  for I had in my pocket  a letter which too well explained that mystery  in a very different manner from that which was supposed  With these words I produced the following letter  which Jack Rattlin brought to me the   273 very day after Thomson disappeared  and told me it was committed to his care by the deceased  who made him promise not to deliver it sooner  The clerk taking it out of my hand  read aloud the contents  which were these     DEAR FRIEND   I AM so much oppressed with the fatigue I daily and nightly undergo  and the barbarous usage of doctor Mackshane  who is bent on your destruction  as well as mine  that I am resolved to free myself from this miserable life  and before you receive this  shall be no more  I could have wished to die in your good opinion  which I am afraid I shall forfeit by the last act of my life  but if you cannot acquit me  I know you will at least preserve some regard for the memory of an unfortunate young man who loved you —I recommend it to you  to beware of Mackshane  whose revenge is implacable —I wish all prosperity to you and Mr  Morgan  to whom pray offer my last respects  and beg to be remembered as your unhappy friend and countryman   WILLIAM THOMSON   This letter was no sooner read  than Mackshane  in a transport of rage  snatched it out of the clerk s hands  and tore it into a thousand pieces  saying  it was a villainous forgery  contrived and executed by myself —The captain and clerk declared themselves of the same opinion    274 notwithstanding I insisted on having the remains of it compared to other writings of Thomson  which they had in possession  and I was ordered to answer the last article of my accusation  namely  the book of cyphers found among my papers —   That is easily done  said I   What you are pleased to call cyphers  are no other than the Greek characters  in which  for my amusement  I kept a diary of every thing remarkable that has occurred to my observation since the beginning of the voyage  till the day on which I was
