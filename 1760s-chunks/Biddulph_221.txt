before I lose my senses  or my life  for both I cannot retain  hear the last act of your friend’s tragic story   My brother called on me this day  he gave me a letter directed to Mr Faulkland  which came under a cover to him  Read it  said he  it is from Ireland  and may contain something material for us to know   It was from the honest servant Mr Faulkland left behind him  See what he says  and then tell me if I ought to live any longer   ‘Honoured Sir   ‘I have the happiness to send you a piece of good news  which made me wish for wings to have flown over to you with it   ‘My lady  Heaven be praised  is not dead  nor so much as hurt  I am thankful for this  Sir  on your account  not her’s   ‘I don’t know what possessed the people at Mr Bond’s  to tell me she was dead  the mistake  to be sure  was occasioned by the great confusion the family were thrown into  and indeed  from what I myself saw  I was sure she was actually dead   ‘Major Smyth lived ’till the surgeon came  but had been speechless for two or three hours  and died whilst his wound was probing   ‘My lady had only fallen into a fit  and the major having bled prodigiously  she received a great deal of his blood upon her linen  and as he afterwards contrived to throw himself on the bed  which was at some distance from the place where she had fallen  it gave occasion to Mrs Bond  who was herself the first person that entered the room  after the sad accident  on finding my lady lying senseless  pale  and bloody  on the floor  to suppose she had been killed   ‘This alarm ran through the family  and was confirmed to me    by every one in it  as we servants soon quitted the chamber  and the major himself said  that you had discharged one of the pistols at your lady  and the other at him   ‘I returned to Mr Bond’s in the morning  after you were gone off  to enquire whether Major Smyth was alive or not  he was just then dead   ‘The waiting maid informed me  that my lady  to their great surprize  was recovered  having only been in a fainting fit  which held her above an hour  without her shewing any signs of life  and that she had fallen from one to another ’till morning  and she farther said  begging your honour’s pardon  it would be no great matter if she had died in one  for she believed it was for no good she went into the major’s room at that time of the night   ‘I staid about the house all the day to pick up what intelligence I could from the servants  Young Mr Bond  with two or three men  went to your house  and not finding you there  I suppose  rode in pursuit of you  but  Heaven be praised  you have escaped their hands   ‘The waiting maid  who is a very civil young woman  told me  in the evening  that my lady  being come a little to herself  though I believe not in her right mind  was informed of the major’s death  at which she was so exceedingly terrified  that finding herself ill besides  she confessed the whole truth of the matter  and proved  that the major died with a lie in his mouth  so that I hope Mr Bond’s family will not be so spiteful as to prosecute the affair any farther   ‘My lady was sent home directly in the chariot  as they could not bear the sight of her any longer in the house  She takes on mightily  but we all bless ourselves  that she is alive   ‘I shall make bold to inclose this  according to your order  to Sir George Bidulph  and as soon as I receive your commands about Master  shall make no delay in this unlucky place  I am   ‘Honoured Sir  ‘Your dutiful and obedient servant   ‘Frederick Hildy ’  June 26  Adieu  my Cecilia  adieu  nothing but my death should close such a scene as this     Here  to the editor’s great disappointment  Mrs Arnold’s interesting story broke off  that unhappy lady not having continued her journal any farther   But as this seemed to be one of the most affecting periods of her life  his curiosity induced him to enquire of the gentleman from whom he received those papers whether he could give him any farther light into her story  as he thought it not improbable that he might have learned  from his mother  some other particulars relating to her   His friend told him  that he knew his mother had drawn up a narrative of the subsequent remarkable events in the life of Mrs Arnold  at the request of a particular friend  that he had once heard it read  but  as he was then a boy  it made but little impression upon him  that afterwards  when he wanted to have his curiosity gratified  his mother told him  she could not find
