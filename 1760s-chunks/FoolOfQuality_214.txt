 carriages   for Master Harry would compel me to be as busy and   active in matters of charity as himself      However  sir  I am to tell you that Harry  with all his excellences         220 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      of person  heart  and understanding  will be accounted a mere idiot   among people of distinction  if he is not permitted to enter into some   of the fashionable foibles and fashionable vices of the age      We were taking a walk in the Mall  when we were met by the   Earl of Mansfield  who expressed great joy at seeing his old   acquaintance  as he called him   and he pressed us so earnestly to   dinner  that we could not  in manners  refuse him      There was a vast concourse of company  especially of the little   quality of both sexes  who came to pay their respects to young   Lord Bottom and his sister the Lady Louisa      Harry was received and saluted by Lady Mansfield and the   young lord  without any appearance of the old animosity  Some   time after dinner a large packet of letters was brought in to the   earl  and  making his excuse to Harry alone  he rose from the   table and retired to his closet      Lord Bottom and his sister then led the young males and females   to an adjoining apartment  where several card tables were laid   and   I began to tremble for the credit of my pupil on the occasion  as I   knew him to be a novice in such matters      In the mean time  the remaining ladies and gentlemen divided   into two or three parties at ombre   and I sauntered about the room    admiring the prints of the Ariadne and the Aurora  that were   taken from Guido  as also some capital paintings that the earl had   brought from Italy      I had spent above an hour in this pleasing amusement  and had   nearly made the tour of the whole dining room  when  as I stood at   a little distance behind my lady s chair  seeming inattentive to any   thing that passed  Lord Bottom entered on tiptoe  and tripping up   to his mother  and tittering and whispering in her ear What do   you think  mamma  said he   sure Master Fenton is a fool  a down    right fool  upon my honour   He does not know a single card in   the whole pack   he does not know the difference between the ace   of hearts and the nine of clubs  I do not think either that he   knows any thing of the difference or value of coin   for  as we passed   through the hall to day  a beggar asked for a halfpenny  and I saw   him slip a shilling into his hand  Indeed  mamma  he is the   greatest fool that ever I knew   and yet  poor fellow  he does not   seem to know any thing of the matter himself      During this oration of Lord Bottom on the virtues of his new   friend  I felt my whole body glow and tingle with concern   and   soon after Harry entered with the rest of the small quality    Master Fenton  cries my lady  I beg to speak with you  Don t you   know the cards  my dear   No  indeed  madam  Can t you play at   dice  No  madam  Can you play at draughts  polish  or chess    Not at all  madam  Why then  my dear  I must tell you that all   your father s fortune will never introduce you among people of any   breeding or of any fashion  Can you play at no kind of game    Master Harry   A little at fox and geese  madam  And pray  my   dear  said my lady smiling  which of the parties do you espouse     The part of the geese  madam  I thought as much  pertly cried   out my Lord Bottom   whereupon a loud laugh was echoed through   the room          THE FOOL OF QUALITY  221     Here my lady chid the company  and calling Harry to her again    for he had gone something aloof Tell me  I pray you  said she  why   you espouse the part of the geese  Because  madam  I always wish   that simplicity should get the better of fraud and cunning      The countess here looked astonished   and having gazed a while   at him  and caught and kissed him eagerly You are a noble fellow    she cried  and
