for the present  postponed  His fellow travellers were confounded at his mysterious  motions  which filled the heart of Jolter with anxiety and terror   This careful conductor was fraught with such experience of his pupil s  disposition  that he trembled with the apprehension of some sudden  accident  and lived in continual alarm  like a man that walks under the  wall of a nodding tower  Nor did he enjoy any alleviations of his fears   when  upon telling the young gentleman that the rest of the company were    6 22 15  3 45 PM   desirous of departing for Antwerp  he answered  they were at liberty to  consult their own inclinations  but  for his own part  he was resolved  to stay in Brussels a few days longer  By this declaration the governor  was confirmed in the opinion of his having some intrigue upon the anvil   In the bitterness of his vexation  he took the liberty of signifying his  suspicion  and reminding him of the dangerous dilemmas to which he had  been reduced by his former precipitation   Peregrine took his caution in good part  and promised to behave  with such circumspection as would screen him from any troublesome  consequences for the future  but  nevertheless  behaved that same  evening in such a manner as plainly showed that his prudence was nothing  else than vain speculation  He had made an appointment to spend the  night  as usual  with Mrs  Hornbeck  and about nine o clock hastened to  her lodgings  when he was accosted in the street by his old discarded  friend Thomas Pipes  who  without any other preamble  told him  that for  all he had turned him adrift  he did not choose to see him run full  sail into his enemy s harbour  without giving him timely notice of the  danger   I ll tell you what   said he   mayhap you think I want to curry  favour  that I may be taken in tow again  if you do  you have made a  mistake in your reckoning  I am old enough to be laid up  and have to  keep my planks from the weather  But this here is the affair  I have  known you since you were no higher than a marlinspike  and shouldn t  care to see you deprived of your rigging at these years  whereby I  am informed by Hornbeck s man  whom I this afternoon fell in with by  chance  as how his master has got intelligence of your boarding his  wife  and has steered privately into this port with a large complement  of hands  in order  d ye see  to secure you while you are under the  hatches  Now  if so be as how you have a mind to give him a salt eel for  his supper  here am I  without hope of fee or reward  ready to stand  by you as long as my timbers will stick together  and if I expect any  recompense  may I be bound to eat oakum and drink bilge water for life    Startled at this information  Peregrine examined him upon the  particulars of his discourse with the lacquey  and when he understood  that Hornbeck s intelligence flowed from the canal of his Flemish  footman  he believed every circumstance of Tom s report  thanked him for  his warning  and  after having reprimanded him for his misbehaviour at  Lisle  assured him that it should be his own fault if ever they should  part again  He then deliberated with himself whether or not he should  retort the purpose upon his adversary  but when he considered that  Hornbeck was not the aggressor  and made that unhappy husband s case his  own  he could not help quitting his intention of revenge  though  in his  opinion  it ought to have been executed in a more honourable manner  and  therefore he determined to chastise him for his want of spirit  Nothing  surely can be more insolent and unjust than this determination  which  induced him to punish a person for his want of courage to redress the  injury which he himself had done to his reputation and peace  and yet  this barbarity of decision is authorised by the opinion and practice of  mankind   With these sentiments he returned to the inn  and  putting a pair of  pistols in his pocket  ordered his valet de chambre and Pipes to follow  him at a small distance  so as that they should be within call in  case of necessity  and then posted himself within thirty yards of his  dulcinea s door  There he had not been above half an hour  when he  perceived four men take their station on the other side  with a view  as    6 22 15  3 45 PM   he guessed  to watch for his going in  that he might be taken unaware   But when they had tarried a considerable time in that corner  without  reaping the fruits of their expectation  their leader  persuaded that  the gallant had gained admittance by some secret means  approached the  door with his followers
