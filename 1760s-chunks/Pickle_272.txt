obliged the coachman to  drive into a wood near the road  I at first imagined that they wanted to  examine our passports  but was soon too well convinced of their design   and  though very much shocked at the discovery  found resolution enough  to suppress my concern  so that it should not aggravate the terrors  of the young woman  who had almost died with apprehension  I even  encouraged her to hope for the best  and  addressing myself to the  robbers in French  begged  in the most suppliant manner  that they  would spare our lives  upon which one of them  who was a little fellow   assured me  in the same language  that we had nothing to fear for our  persons    When we were conveyed in a state of dreadful suspense about  three quarters of a mile into the wood  the ruffians came into the  coach  and  taking my keys  which I kept ready in my hand for them   opened three large trunks that contained my baggage  and emptying them  of everything but my hoops and a few books  packed up their booty in a  cloth  then robbed me of my money and jewels  even to my shoe buckles  and sleeve buttons  took my footman s laced hat  and gave it  by way  of gratification  to a peasant  who came from behind the bushes  and  assisted them in packing    This affair being despatched  they ordered us to return to the road by  a different way from that in which we were carried into the wood  and  mounting their horses  rode off with the plunder  though not before  the little fellow  who was the least ferocious of the two  had come and  shaken me by the hand  wishing us a good journey  a compliment which I  heartily returned  being extremely well pleased with the retreat of two  such companions  who had detained us a whole half hour  during which   notwithstanding the assurance I had received  I was in continual  apprehension of seeing their operation concluded with the murder of  us all  for I supposed they were of that gang who had some time before  murdered a French officer  and used a lady extremely ill  after having  rifled her of all she had    Having thus undergone pillage  and being reduced to the extremity  of indigence in a foreign land  it is not to be supposed that my  reflections were very comfortable  and yet  though I sustained the whole  damage  I was the only person in the company who bore the accident with  any resolution and presence of mind  My coachman and valet seemed quite  petrified with fear  and it was not till I had repeated my directions  that the former drove farther into the wood  and took the first turning  to the right  in order to regain the road  according to the command of  the robbers  which I did not choose to disobey    This misfortune I suffered by the misinformation I received at Antwerp   where I would have provided myself with an escort  had not I been  assured that there was not the least occasion to put myself to such  extraordinary expense  And  indeed  the robbers took the only half hour  in which they could have had an opportunity of plundering us  for we no  sooner returned into the highway  than we met with the French artillery    6 22 15  3 45 PM   coming from Brussels  which was a security to us during the rest of our  journey  We were afterwards informed at a small village  that there was  actually a large gang of deserters  who harboured in that wood  from  which they made excursions in the neighbourhood  and kept the peasants  in continual alarms    Having proceeded a little way  we were stopped by the artillery  crossing a bridge  and  as the train was very long  must have been  detained till night  had not a soldier informed me  that  if I would  take the trouble to come out of my coach  and apply to the commandant   he would order them to halt  and allow me to pass  I took the man s  advice  and was by him conducted  with much difficulty  through the  crowd  to some officers  who seemed scarce to deserve the name  for   when I signified my request  they neither rose up  nor desired me to sit  down  but  lolling in their chairs  with one leg stretched out  asked   with an air of disrespectful raillery where I was going  and when I  answered   To Paris   desired to know what I would do there    I  who am naturally civil where I am civilly used  and saucy enough  where I think myself treated with disregard  was very much piqued at  their insolent and unmannerly behaviour  and began to reply to the  impertinent questions very abruptly  so that a very tart dialogue would  have ensued  had not the conversation been interrupted by a
