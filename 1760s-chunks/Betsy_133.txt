is privately preparing to go over   to Holland  Brussels  or some of those places  and settle there with a   young hussey  who they say is with child by him  and will leave me here   to starve  His lawyer  to whom he has assigned the bond  is to advance   fifteen hundred pounds upon it  on condition he has the residue of it to   himself  when you shall discharge the whole  Now it is in your power    Sir  to save yourself the payment of so much money  and relive a   much injured and distressed wife  by complaining to the Court of   Chancery of the imposition practised on you  and procure a  ne exeat   regnum  to prevent his escape        Here she gave over speaking  and Mr  Goodman  after a short pause    replied  that he could not at that instant resolve on any thing  but   added  that he would take some advice  and then let her know how far she   might be serviceable to him  on which she took her leave  after giving   him directions where she might be found                CHAPTER XV       Shews some part of the consequences produced by the foregoing   occurrence          Though Mr  Goodman very easily perceived the wife of Marplus had not   made the discovery she had done through any principle of conscience  or   true contrition for having been an accomplice in the base action she had   revealed  but merely in revenge of a husband  who had used her ill  and   was about to leave her  yet he thought it behoved him to draw all   advantages he could from the knowledge of so astonishing  and so   alarming a secret       He therefore wasted no time  either in unavailing reflections on his own   inconsiderateness  in marrying  at his years  a woman such as Lady   Mellasin  nor in exclamations on her ingratitude and perfidiousness    but  convinced beyond a doubt of the wrongs he had sustained  bent his   whole mind on doing himself justice  in as ample a manner as possible    on the aggressors       The lawyer  to whom he had applied the day before  was not only a person   who had transacted all the business he had in his way  but was also his   acquaintance of a long standing  and very good friend  and it was no   inconsiderable consolation  under so grievous a misfortune  that he was   not at a loss whom he should consult on an affair that required the   greatest integrity  as well as ability       That gentleman  luckily for Mr  Goodman s impatience  came to enquire   how he did after his last night s shock  just as he was preparing to   wait on him  in order to acquaint him with the more stabbing one he had   since received  This injured husband rejoiced  as much as the present   unhappy circumstances of his mind would permit  at the sight of his   friend  and related to him  in as brief a manner as he could  the sum   of the whole story he had received from Mrs  Marplus        Good God   said the lawyer  as soon as Mr  Goodman had given over   speaking   I am confounded  but  pray  Sir  how have you resolved to do    In what way will you proceed     That I must ask of you   replied Mr    Goodman  hastily   you may be certain I shall not be passive in this   matter  I only want to know what course I am to steer     Could you   consent   cried the lawyer  after a pause   to be divorced from Lady   Mellasin     Consent   said Mr  Goodman  with more warmth than before     the most terrible vexation I endure dwells in the consideration that   she is still my wife  Were that name once erased  I think I should be   easy     I hope then soon to see you so   said the other   but the first   thing we have to do is to get the affidavits of the two witnesses  and   then arrest Marplus  I shall order it so with his lawyer  whom I have   under my thumb  on account of some malpractices I have detected him in    that he shall not dare to procure bail for this unworthy client  In a   word  Sir   continued he   I do not doubt  the case being so plain  but   to relieve you from paying the penalty of the bond  but  in the mean
