 His is the most delicate of human minds   He led me to my seat  and taking his by me  still holding my passive hand—Ever since I have had the honour of Miss Byron s acquaintance  I have considered her as one of the most excellent of women  My heart demands alliance with hers  and hopes to be allowed its claim  tho  such are the delicacies of situation  that I scarcely dare to trust myself to speak upon the subject  From the first  I called Miss Byron my sister  but she is more to me than the dearest sister  and there is a more tender friendship that I aspire to hold with her  whatever may be the accidents  on either side  to bar a farther wish  And this I must hope  that she will not deny me  so long as it shall be consistent with her other attachments   He paused  I made an effort to speak  But speech was denied me  My face  as I felt  glowed like the fire before me   My heart  resumed he  is ever on my lips  It is tortured when I cannot speak all that is in it  Professions I am not accustomed to make  As I am not conscious of being unworthy of your friendship  I will suppose it  and farther talk to you of my affairs and engagements  as that tender friendship may warrant   Sir  you do me honour  was all I could say   I had a letter from the faithful Camilla  I hold not a correspondence with her  But the treatment that her young Lady met with  of which she had got some general intimations  and some words that the Bishop said to her  which expressed his wishes  that I would make them one more visit at Bologna  urged her to write  begging of me  for Heaven s sake  to go over  But unless one of the family had written to me  and by consent of others of it  what hope had I of a welcome  after I had been as often refused  as I had requested while I was in Italy  to be admitted to the   63 presence of the Lady  who was so desirous of one interview more —Especially  as Mrs  Beaumont gave me no encouragement to go  but the contrary  from what she observed of the inclinations of the family   Mrs  Beaumont is still of opinion  as in the conclusion of the Letter before you  that I should not go  unless the General and the Marquis join their requests to those of the Marchioness  the Bishop  and Father Marescotti  But I had no sooner perused the Bishop s Letter than I wrote  that I would most chearfully comply with his wishes  But that I should be glad that I might not be under any obligation to go farther than Bologna  where I might have the happiness to attend my Jeronymo  as well as well as his sister   I had a little twitch at my heart  Lucy  I was sorry for it  But my judgment was entirely with him   And now  madam  you will wonder  that you see not any preparations for my departure  All is prepared  I only wait for the company of one gentleman  who is settling his affairs with all expedition to go with me  He is an able  a skilful surgeon  who has had great practice abroad  and in the armies  And having acquired an casy fortune  is come to settle in his native country  My Jeronymo expresses himself dissatisfied with his surgeons  If Mr  Lowther can be of service to him  how happy shall I think myself  And if my presence can be a means to restore the noble Clementina—But how dare I hope it —And yet I am persuaded  that in her case  and with such a temper of mind  unused to hardship and opposition as she had been  the only way to recover her  would have been by complying with her in every thing that her heart or head was earnestly set upon  For what controul was necessary to a young Lady  who never  even in the height of her malady  uttered a wish or thought that was contrary to her duty either to God  or her parents  nor yet to the honour of her name  and  allow me  madam  to say  the pride of her sex     64 I am under an obligation to go to Paris  proceeded he  from the will of my late friend Mr  Danby  I shall stop there for a day or two only  in order to put things in a way for my last hand  on my return from Italy   When I am in Italy  I shall perhaps be enabled to adjust two or three accounts that stand out  in relation to the affairs of my Ward   This day at dinner I shall see Mrs Oldham  and her sons  and in the afternoon  at tea  Mrs  O Hara and her Husband  and Captain Salmonet   To morrow  I hope for the honour of your company  Madam  and Mr  and Mrs  Reeves at dinner  and be so good as to engage them for
