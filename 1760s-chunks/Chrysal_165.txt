anything that is proper          Sir    answered the author    I am much obliged to you   I   will take care that it shall be ready at the time  You are sensible   that I never think much of any labour to serve you  I have   finished all the pamphlets you ordered  about the ballad singer s   affair     Here they are   This is a letter from you to him that   lays him flat   I have quoted half the Fathers of the Church against   him   These two are letters to you  upon the subject   one as from   a great lord  and the other from a reverend divine  setting forth   the great benefits of your ministry  and exposing the profaneness   and immoraUty of his baUad  This here is a silly vindication of   his ballad  in a letter to the author  from one of his ranting com    panions   and this last is an address to the public against all those   irreligious and profane amusements of ballads  balls  routs  etc    This is a masterpiece   You see it as from myself  if you do not   choose to own it  though I do not know but it may have more   weight with your enemies if it appears as from another  So you   see I have worked hard to day  and now I believe we have done   with Mr Momus and his ballad          Why  ay   pretty well  I believe    said my master    But hold    I have a thought just come into my head  You must know that the   parson of the parish  has sent for that reprobate  that Momus  and   ordered him to alter the tune of his ballad  as it happened to have   several of the same notes with the psalm tunes  Now  as this is   known  what do you think of writing a letter to me  as from the   parson  setting forth what he has done  and insinuating that it was   the direction of the squire    This will clench the affair  After   such an authority  no one will dare to say a word in its behalf         Whitefield s replies to  and criticisms on The Minor      2 The Archbishop of Canterbury  s The King          ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 181     besides  it will have a good look to be taken notice of by such   people          That is true    answered the author    it will be so  and the parson s   notice shall not be thrown away  I ll do it to morrow morning  as   soon as I send you the exhortation        My master then wished him a good night  and left him to return   to his company  while he himself went directly home  to prepare   ior the duties of the next day      He had scarce slept off his debauch  when he was called to chant   his matin song  after which he did not fail to display the wound in   his temple  the occasion of which he promised to unfold to his con    gregation in the evening  This he did to raise a curiosity that should   gather his whole flock to hear so extraordinary an affair  as he   â€¢designed to propose a subscription  when their passions should be   warmed by such a horrid attempt upon their pastor      By the time he had finished this first work of the day  the exhorta    tion was brought him from the author  with which he went directly   to her grace i He found her  unfashionably early as it was for a   person of her rank to be even up   dressed  and waiting for him        Please your grace    said he    here is the exhortation your grace   desired of me  and I pray Heaven it may prove successful  I am   afraid I have made your grace wait  but I came the moment I had   finished the first duties of the morning  If your grace pleases  I   will do myself the honour to accompany your grace  Perhaps my   personal exhortation and prayer may have more effect  My ministry   lias often been blessed with astonishing success          I am sensible of that  doctor    answered her grace    but this   unhappy man is of such a strange temper that I apprehend he might   be guilty of some act of rashness  that might be dangerous to your   person  if you were to
