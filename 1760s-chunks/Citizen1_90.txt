go and see sights the whole day  and eat a warm supper when you come home at night  but for me  if I should run hunting after all these fine folk  what should I get by my journey but an appetite  and  God help me  I have too much of that at home already  without stiring out for it  Your people who may eat four meals a day and a supper at night  are but a bad example to such a one as I  No  master  as God has called me into this world in order to mend old shoes  I have no business with fine folk  and they no business with me   I here interrupted him with a smile   See this last  master  continues he  and this hammer  this last and hammer are the two best friends I have in this world  nobody else will be my friend  because I want a friend  The great folks you saw pass by just now have five hundred friends  because they have no occasion for them  now  while I stick to my good friends here  I am very contented  but when I ever so little run after sights and fine things  I begin to hate my work  I grow sad  and have no heart to mend shoes any longer    This discourse only served to raise my curiosity to know more of a man whom nature had thus formed into a philosopher  I therefore insensibly led him into an history of his adventures   I have lived  said he  a wandering life  now five and fifty years  here to day and gone to morrow  for it was my misfortune  when I was young  to   285 be fond of changing   You have been a traveller  then  I presume  interrupted I   I can t boast much of travelling  continued he  for I have never left the parish in which I was born but three times in my life  that I can remember  but then there is not a street in the whole neighbourhood that I have not lived in  at some time or another  When I began to settle and to take to my business in one street  some unforeseen misfortune  or a desire of trying my luck elsewhere  has removed me  perhaps a whole mile away from my former customers  while some more lucky cobler would come into my place  and make a handsome fortune among friends of my making  there was one who actually died in a stall that I had left  worth seven pounds seven shillings  all in hard gold  which he had quilted into the waistband of his breeches    I could not but smile at these migrations of a man by the fire side  and continued to ask if he had ever been married   Ay that I have  master  replied he  for sixteen long years  and a weary life I had of it  heaven knows  My wife took it into her head  that the only way to thrive in this world was to save money  so  though our comings in was but about three shillings a week  all that ever she could lay her hands upon she used to hide away from me  though we were obliged to starve the whole week after for it   The first three years we used to quarrel about this every day  and I always got the better  but she had a hard spirit  and still continued to hide as usual  so that I was at last tired of quarrelling  and getting the better  and she scraped and scraped at pleasure  till I was almost starved   286 to death  Her conduct drove me at last in despair to the ale house  here I used to sit with people who hated home like myself  drank while I had money left  and run in score when any body would trust me  till at last the landlady  coming one day with a long bill when I was from home  and putting it into my wife s hands  the length of it effectually broke her heart  I searched the whole stall after she was dead for money  but she had hidden it so effectually  that with all my pains I could never find a farthing    By this time my shoe was mended  and satisfying the poor artist for his trouble  and rewarding him besides for his information  I took my leave  and returned home to lengthen out the amusement his conversation afforded  by communicating it to my friend  Adieu   END of the FIRST VOLUME
