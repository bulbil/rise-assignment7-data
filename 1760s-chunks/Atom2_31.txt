and every rascal in Japan will whip thy a—se    Praff was afraid of the Beast s resentment  but Taycho bestrid him like a Colossus  and he crept through between his legs into a place of safety  This was the last time that the Orator appeared in public  Immediately after this occurrence it was found necessary to confine him to a dark chamber  and Yak strot was left to his own inventions     In this dilemma he had recourse   183 to the old expedient of changing hands  and as a prelude to this reform  made advances to Gotto mio  whom he actually detached from the opposition  by providing his friends and dependants with lucrative offices  and promising to take no steps of consequence without his privity and approbation  A sop was at the same time thrown to Twitz er  Zan ti fic  lulled with specious promises  discarded Toks the incendiary Bonze  Lob kob signed a neutrality  and old Fika kaka was deprived of the use of speech —in a word  the ill cemented confederacy of Strot s exoteric foes fell asunder  and Legion had now no rage but the rage of hunger to be appeased  But the Ximian favourite was still thwarted in his operations behind the curtain  for he had so often chopped and changed the figures that composed his motion    184 that they were all of different materials  so wretchedly sorted and so ill toned  that when they came upon the scene  they produced nothing but discord and disorder   The Japonese colony of Fatsisio had been settled above a century  and in the face of a thousand dangers and difficulties raised themselves to such consideration  that they consumed infinite quantities of the manufactures of Japan  for which they payed their mother country in gold and silver  and precious drugs  the produce of their plantations  The advantages which Japan reaped from this traffic with her own colonists  almost equalled the amount of what she gained by her commerce with all the other parts of Asia  Twitz er  when he managed the finances of Japan  had in his great wisdom planned  procured  and promulgated a   185 law saddling the Fatsisians with a grievous tax to answer the occasions of the Japonese government  an imposition which struck at the very vitals of their constitution  by which they were exempt from all burthens but such as they fitted for their own shoulders  They raised a mighty clamour at this innovation  in which they were joined by Legion  at that time under the influence of Taycho  who  in the assembly of the people  bitterly inveighed against the authors and abettors of such an arbitrary and tyrannical measure  Their reproach and execreation did not stop at Twitz er  but proceeded  as usual  to Yak strot  who was the general butt at which all the arrows of slander  scurrility  and abuse  were levelled  The puppets with which he supplied the places of Twitz er and his associates    186 in order to recommend themselves to Legion  and perhaps  with a view to mortify the favourite  who had patronized the Fatsisian tax  insisted upon withdrawing this imposition  which was accordingly abrogated  to the no small disgrace and contempt of the law givers  but when these new ministers were turned out  to make way for Taycho and his friends  the interest of the Fatsisians was again abandoned  Even the Orator himself declaimed against them with an unembarrassed countenance  after they had raised statues to him as their friend and patron  and measures were taken to make them feel all the severity of an abject dependance upon the legislature of Japan  Finally  Gotto mio acceded to this system  which he had formerly approved in conjunction with Twitz er  and preparations   187 were made for using compulsory measures  should the colonists refuse to submit with a good grace   The Fatsisians  far from acquiescing in these proceedings  resolved to defend to the last extremity those liberties which they had hitherto preserved  and  as a proof of their independence  agreed among themselves to renounce all the superfluities with which they had so long been furnished  at a vast expence  from the manufactures of Japan  since that nation had begun to act towards them with all the cruelty of a step mother  It was amazing to see and to hear how Legion raved  and slabbered  and snapped its multitudinous jaws in the streets of Meaco  when it understood that the Fatsisians were determined to live on what their own country afforded  They were represented and reviled   188 as ruffians  barbarians  and unnatural monsters  who clapped the dagger to the breast of their indulgent mother  in presuming to save themselves the expence of those superfluities  which  by the bye  her cruel impositions had left them no money to purchase  Nothing was heard in Japan but threats of punishing those ungrateful colonists with whips and scorpions  For this purpose troops were assembled and fleets equipped  and the blatant Beast yawned with impatient expectation of being drenched with the blood of its fellow subjects   Yak strot was seized with horror at the prospect of such extremities  for  to give the devil his due  his disposition was neither arbitrary nor cruel  but he had been hurried by evil counsellors into a train of false politics  the consequences of which he did
