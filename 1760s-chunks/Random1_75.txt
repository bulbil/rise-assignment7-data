telling me  I had got into the wrong port  advised me to seek out a more convenient harbour  where I could be safely hove down  for which purpose he made me a present of five guineas more —I was so touched with this singular piece of generosity  that for some time I had not power to thank him —However  as soon as I had recollected myself  I begged the favour of him to go with me to the next tavern  where I explained the nature of my disaster  and convinced him of the falsehood of what was reported to my prejudice so effectually  that he from that moment attached himself to me  and we lived in great harmony together  until he was obliged to go to sea  where he perished in a storm     Having lost my benefactor  and almost consumed the remains of his bounty  I saw myself   212 in danger of relapsing into my former necessity  and began to be very uneasy at the prospect of bailifs and jails —when one of the sisterhood  a little stale  advised me to take lodgings in a part of the town where I was unknown  and pass for an heiress  which might entrap some body to be my husband  who would possibly be able to allow me an handsome maintenance  or at wont screen me from the dread and danger of a prison  by becoming liable for whatever debts I should contract —I approved of this scheme  towards the execution of which my companion clubbed her wardrobe  and undertook to live with me in quality of my maid  with the proviso  that she should be reimbursed and handsomely considered out of the profits of my success —She was immediately detached to look out for a convenient place  and that very day hired a genteel apartment in Park street  whither I moved in a coach loaded with her baggage and my own —I made my first appearance in a blue riding habit trimmed with silver  and my maid acted her part so artfully  that in a day or two  my fame was spread all over the neighbourhood  and I was said to be a rich heiress just arrived from the country —This report brought a swarm of gay young fellows about me  but I soon found them out to be all indigent adventurers like myself  who crouded to me like crows to a carrion  with a view of preying upon my fortune —I maintained  however  the appearance of wealth as long as possible  in hopes of gaining some admirer more for my purpose  and at length  I attracted the regard of one who would have satisfied my wishes  and managed matters so well  that a day was actually fixed for our nuptials  In the interim  he begged leave to   213 introduce an intimate friend to me  which request as I could not refuse  I had the extreme mortification and surprize  to see next night  in that friend  my old keeper Horatio  who no sooner beheld me than he changed colour  but had presence of mind enough to advance and salute me  bidding me  with a low voice  be under no apprehension  for he would not expose me —In spite of this assurance  I could not recover myself so far  as to entertain them  but withdrew to my chamber on pretence of a severe head ach  to the no small concern of my adorer  who took his leave in the tenderest manner  and went off with his friend   Having imparted my situation to my companion  she found it high time for us to decamp  and that without any noise  because we were not only indebted to our landlady  but also to several tradesmen in the neighbourhood —Our retreat  therefore  was concerted and executed in this manner  Having packed up all our cloaths and moveables in small parcels  she  on pretence of fetching cordials for me  carried them at several times  to the house of an acquaintance  where she likewise procured a lodging  to which we retired  in the middle of the night  opening the street door  when every other body in the house was asleep —I was now obliged to aim at lower game  and accordingly spread my nets among trades people  but found them all too phlegmatic or cautious for my art and attractions  till at last I became acquainted with you  on whom I practised all my dexterity  not that I believed you had any fortune or expectation of one  but that I might transfer the burthen of such debts as I had incurred or could contract  from myself to another  and at the same time  avenge myself of your sex  by   214 rendering miserable  one who bore such resemblance to the wretch who ruined me —but heaven preserved you from my snares  by the discovery you made  which was owing to the negligence of my maid in leaving the chamber door unlocked  when she went to buy sugar for breakfast —The person in bed with me  was a gentleman whom I had allured the night before  as he walked homeward pretty much elevated with liquor  for by this time  my condition was so low  that I was forced to turn out  in the twilight  to the streets in hopes of prey —When I found myself detected and forsaken by you  I was
