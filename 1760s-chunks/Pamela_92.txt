her to an excuse  by   saying  that it was now best to defer it one Sunday  and till matters   were riper for my appearance  and she readily took hold of it  and   confirmed his opinion       After all  I hope the best  but if this should turn out to be a plot    I fear nothing but a miracle can save me  But  sure the heart of man is   not capable of such black deceit  Besides  Mr  Williams has it under his   own hand  and he dare not but be in earnest  and then again  though to   be sure he has been very wrong to me  yet his education  and parents    example  have neither of them taught him such very black contrivances    So I will hope for the best          Mr  Williams  Mrs  Jewkes  and I  have been all three walking together   in the garden  and she pulled out her key  and we walked a little in the   pasture to look at the bull  an ugly  grim  surly creature  that hurt   the poor cook maid  who is got pretty well again  Mr  Williams pointed   at the sunflower  but I was forced to be very reserved to him  for the   poor gentleman has no guard  no caution at all       We have just supped together  all three  and I cannot yet think that all   must be right   Only I am resolved not to marry  if I can help it  and I   will give no encouragement  I am resolved  at least  till I am with you       Mr  Williams said  before Mrs  Jewkes  he would send a messenger with   a letter to my father and mother   I think the man has no discretion   in the world  but l desire you will send no answer  till I have the   pleasure and happiness which now I hope for soon  of seeing you  He   will  in sending my packet  send a most tedious parcel of stuff  of my   oppressions  my distresses  my fears  and so I will send this with it     for Mrs  Jewkes gives me leave to send a letter to my father  which   looks well   and I am glad I can conclude  after all my sufferings  with   my hopes  to be soon with you  which I know will give you comfort  and   so I rest  begging the continuance of your prayers and blessings                                            Your ever dutiful DAUGHTER          MY DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I have so much time upon my hands that I must write on  to employ   myself  The Sunday evening  where I left off  Mrs  Jewkes asked me  If   I chose to be by myself  I said  Yes  with all my heart  if she pleased    Well  said she  after to night you shall  I asked her for more paper    and she gave me a bottle of ink  eight sheets of paper  which she said   was all her store   for now she would get me to write for her to our   master  if she had occasion   and six pens  with a piece of sealing wax    This looks mighty well       She pressed me  when she came to bed  very much  to give encouragement   to Mr  Williams  and said many things in his behalf  and blamed my   shyness to him  I told her  I was resolved to give no encouragement    till I had talked to my father and mother  She said  he fancied I   thought of somebody else  or I could never be so insensible  I assured   her  as I could do very safely  that there was not a man on earth I   wished to have  and as to Mr  Williams  he might do better by far  and I   had proposed so much happiness in living with my poor father and mother    that I could not think of any scheme of life with pleasure  till I had   tried that  I asked her for my money  and she said  it was above in her   strong box  but that I should have it to morrow  All these things look   well  as I said       Mr  Williams would go home this night  though late  because he would   despatch a messenger to you with a letter he had proposed from himself
