before the Doctor went  She brought me the compliments of the Bride  and Lord W  with their earnest request  that I would dine with them  Sir Charles was gone  she said  to make a farewel visit to the Danby set  but would be at home at dinner   It would be better for me  I think  Lucy  to avoid all opportunities of seeing him  Don t you think so —There is no such thing as seeing him with indifference▪ But  so earnestly invited  how could I deny   My cousins were also invited  But having engaged to be at home in the afternoon  they excused themselves   Miss Jervois whispered me at parting  I never before  said she  had an opportunity to observe the behaviour of a new married couple to each other  But is it customary  madam  for the Bride to be more snappish  as the Bridegroom is more obliging     130 Lady G  is very naughty  my dear  if she so behaves  as to give you reason to ask this question   She does  And upon my word  I see more obedience where it was not promised  than where it was  Dear madam  is not what is said at church to be thought of afterwards  But why did not the doctor make her speak out  What signified bowing  except a woman was so bashful that she could not speak   The bowing  my dear  is an assent  It is as efficacious as words  Lord G  only bowed  you know  Could you like to be called upon  Emily  to speak out   Why  no  But then I would be very civil and goodnatured to my husband  if it were but for fear he should be cross to me  But I should think it my duty as well—Sweet innocent   She went away  and left the doctor with me   When our hearts are set upon a particular subject  how impertinent  how much beside the purpose  do we think every other  I wanted the doctor to talk of Sir Charles Grandison  But as he fell not into the subject  and as I was afraid he would think me to be always leading him into it  if I began it  I suffered him to go away at his first motion  I never knew him so shy upon it  however   Sir Charles returned to dinner  He has told Lady L  who afterwards told us  that he had a hint from Mr  Galhard  senior  that if he were not engaged in his affections  he was commissioned to make him a very great proposal in behalf of one of the young ladies he had seen the Thursday before  and that from her father   Surely  Lucy  we may pronounce without doubt  that we live in an age in which there is a great dearth of good men  that so many offers sall to the lot of one  But  I am thinking   tis no small advantage to Sir Charles  that his time is so taken up  that he cannot stay long enough in any company to suffer them   131 to cast their eyes on other objects  with distinction  He left the numerous assembly at Enfield  while they were in the height of their admiration of him  Attention  love  admiration  cannot be always kept at the stretch  You will observe  Lucy  that on the return of a long absent dear friend  the rapture lasts not more than an hour  Gladdened  as the heart is  the friend received  and the friend  receiving  perhaps in less  than that time  can sit down quietly together  to hear and to tell stories  of what has happened to either in the ong regretted absence  It will be so with us  Lucy  when I return to the arms of my kind friends  And now  does not Sir Charles s proposed journey to Italy endear his company to us   The Earl of G  Lady Gertrude  and two agreeable nieces of that Nobleman s  were here at dinner  Lady G  behaved pretty well to her Lord before them  But I  who understood the language of her eyes  saw them talk very saucily to him  on several occasions  My Lord is a little officious in his obligingness  which takes off from that graceful  and polite frankess  which so charmingly  on all occasions  distinguishes one happy man  who was then present  Lord G  will perhaps appear more to advantage in that person s absence   Mr  Beauchamp was also present  He is indeed an agreeable  a modest young man  He appeared to great advantage  as well in his conversation  as by his behaviour  And not the less for subscribing in both to the superiority of his friend  who nevertheless endeavoured to dr•• him out  as the first man   After dinner  Lady L  Lady G  and I  found an opportunity to be by ourselves for one half hour  Lady G  asked Lady L  what she intended to do with the thousand poun•• with which Lord W  had so generously presented her —Do with it  my dear —What do you
