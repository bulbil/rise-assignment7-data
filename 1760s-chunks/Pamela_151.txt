to read them  if you thought fit  He put them into his pocket  and   said  You have more than these  Yes  sir  but all they contain  you know   as well as I   But I don t know  said he  the light you put things in    and so give them me  if you have not a mind to be searched       Sir  said I  I can t stay  if you won t forbear that ugly word   Give   me then no reason for it  Where are the other papers  Why  then  unkind   sir  if it must be so  here they are  And so I gave him  out of   my pocket  the second parcel  sealed up  as the former  with this   superscription  From the naughty articles  down  through sad attempts    to Thursday the 42d day of my imprisonment  This is last Thursday  is   it  Yes  sir  but now you will see what I write  I will find some other   way to employ my time  for how can I write with any face  what must be   for your perusal  and not for those I intended to read my melancholy   stories       Yes  said he  I would have you continue your penmanship by all means    and  I assure you  in the mind I am in  I will not ask you for any after   these  except any thing very extraordinary occurs  And I have another   thing to tell you  added he  that if you send for those from your   father  and let me read them  I may  very probably  give them all back   again to you  And so I desire you will do it       This a little encourages me to continue my scribbling  but  for fear of   the worst  I will  when they come to any bulk  contrive some way to   hide them  if I can  that I may protest I have them not about me  which    before  I could not say of a truth  and that made him so resolutely bent   to try to find them upon me  for which I might have suffered frightful   indecencies       He led me  then  to the side of the pond  and sitting down on the slope    made me sit by him  Come  said he  this being the scene of part of your   project  and where you so artfully threw in some of your clothes  I will   just look upon that part of your relation  Sir  said I  let me then walk   about  at a little distance  for I cannot bear the thought of it  Don t   go far  said he       When he came  as I suppose  to the place where I mentioned the bricks   falling upon me  he got up  and walked to the door  and looked upon   the broken part of the wall  for it had not been mended  and came back    reading on to himself  towards me  and took my hand  and put it under   his arm       Why  this  said he  my girl  is a very moving tale  It was a very   desperate attempt  and  had you got out  you might have been in great   danger  for you had a very bad and lonely way  and I had taken such   measures  that  let you have been where you would  I should have had   you       You may see  sir  said I  what I ventured  rather than be ruined  and   you will be so good as hence to judge of the sincerity of my profession    that my honesty is dearer to me than my life  Romantic girl  said he    and read on       He was very serious at my reflections  on what God had enabled me to   escape  And when he came to my reasonings about throwing myself into the   water  he said  Walk gently before  and seemed so moved  that he turned   away his face from me  and I blessed this good sign  and began not so   much to repent at his seeing this mournful part of my story       He put the papers in his pocket  when he had read my reflections  and   thanks for escaping from myself  and said  taking me about the waist  O   my dear girl  you have touched me sensibly with your mournful relation    and your sweet reflections upon it  I should truly have been very   miserable had it taken effect  I see you have been used too roughly  and   it
