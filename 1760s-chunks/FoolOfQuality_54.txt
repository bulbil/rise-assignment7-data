 said my lord  my son Harry pays you a very par    ticular and very deserved compliment   he puts me in mind of that         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  23     sort of instinct by which a strange dog is always sure to discover    and to apply to the most benevolent person at table  Indeed  my   lord  said Mr  Meekly  caressing the child   I know not whether by   instinct  or by what other name  to call my own feelings  but   certain it is  that the first moment I saw him in his little peasant   petticoats  I found my heart strongly affected toward him      In a short time my lady retired with the children  and left the   earl and Mr  Meekly over a temperate bottle  Mr  Meekly  said   my lord  taking him cordially by the hand   I rejoice at the ad    vantage of our late acquaintance  or rather I repine that it was   not earlier  I am greatly interested  sir  in asking you a few   questions  if I thought I might do it without offence  Are you any   way straitened in your circumstances  No  my lord  But would   you not wish them more affluent would you not wish  that your   power of doing good were more extensive  more answerable to the   benevolence of your own inclinations   I cannot say that I would    my lord  I have upwards of seven hundred a year clear income     and that is considerably more than I have occasion to expend  It   would be indelicate  replied the earl  very indelicate to own  that   I am sorry for your prosperity   and yet I find that I should have   been happy in your distress  in the power it would have given me   to serve  to oblige you  I want a friend I want just such a friend   as Mr  Meekly   and I know of no price at which I would not gladly   purchase him  My lord  I am yours  freely  affectionately yours    without fee or condition  Sir  rejoined my lord  as I find that I   cannot make out a title to your particular attachment  I am content   to be taken into the general circle of your benevolence      The world  Mr  Meekly  think me the happiest of men   blessed   in my family  in my friends   with health  honours  affluence   with   the power of gratifying every wish that human fancy can form    But  alas   my sensations are very far from affirming their judg    ment of these matters   and I will deserve your advice  your con    solation  if you can afford it  by unbosoming myself to you without   reserve      When I reflect on my past life  I look on many parts of it with   repentance  and on the whole with regret  Not that I wish the   return of pleasures that I now despise  or of years spent in a   manner that virtue and common sense must equally disapprove    but I am arrived at my evening of life  like a sportsman who    having been in pursuit of game all the day  returns homeward    sorrowful  fatigued  and disappointed  With every advantage that   could gratify either my vanity or my appetites  I cannot affirm   that I ever tasted of true enjoyment   and I now well perceive   that I was kept from being miserable  merely by amusement and   dissipation      As I had the misfortune to be born to a title and a vast estate    all people respected in me the possession of those objects which   they themselves were in pursuit of  I was consequently beset with   sycophants and deceivers of all sorts  and thereby trained from my   infancy to unavoidable prejudices  errors  and false estimates of   every thing  I was not naturally ill disposed  but I was perpetually   seduced from all my better tendencies          24 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      Both my parents died before I arrived at those years wherein our   laws allow of any title to discretion  I had but one brother  Oh    that dear brother  how many sighs he has cost me   I was older   than him by about seven years  and this disparity of our age    together with the elevating notion of my birthright  gave me the   authoritative airs of a father without a father s tenderness towards   him  This mutually prevented that cordiality  that sympathy  I   may say  by which brothers should be cemented during their mi    nority  And when
