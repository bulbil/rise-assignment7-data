and even in my deliverance  did I turn my eye to myself  and from myself  with the disgust that made a part  and that not a light one  of my punishment   And so much  my Lucy  for masquerades  and masquerade dresses  for ever   Pray let not any body unnecessarily be acquainted with this shocking affair  particularly neither Mr  Greville  nor Mr  Fenwick  It is very probable  that they  especially Mr  Greville  would be for challenging Sir Hargrave  were it only on a supposition that it would give him an interest in me in the eye of the world  You know that Mr  Greville watches for all opportunities to give himself consequence with me   Were any farther mischief to happen to any body  I should be grieved beyond measure  Hitherto I have   236 reason to think  that a transaction so shocking is not very unhappily concluded  May the vile man sit himself down satisfied  and I shall be willing to do so too  provided I never more behold his face   MR  Reeves will send you with the above paccuet  a Letter from Sir Charles Grandison  inclosing one from that vile Wilson  I can write no more just now  and they will sufficiently explain themselves   Adieu  my dearest Lucy  I need not say how much I am  and will ever be   Your faithful and affectionate HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXXIV  Sir CHA  GRANDISON To ARCHIB  REEVES  Esq  Canterbury Feb  22   Dear Sir   THE inclosed long Letter is just now brought to me  I pretend not to judge of the writer s penitence  Yet his confessions seem ingenuous  and he was not under any obligation to put them on paper   As I presume that you will not think it adviseable to make the ineffectual attempt upon Miss Byron public by a prosecution  perhaps your condescending to let the man s sister know  that her brother  if in earnest  may securely pursue the honest purposes he mentions  may save the poor wretch from taking such courses as might be fatal  not only to himself  but to innocent persons  who otherwise may suffer by his being made desperate   The man  as you will see by his Letter  if you had not a still stronger proof  has abilities to do mischief  He has been in bad hands  as he tells us  from his youth upwards  or he might have been an useful member of society  He is a young man  and if yet he could be made so  his reformation will take from the   237 number of the profligate  and add to that of the hopeful  and who knows how wide the circle of his acquaintance is  and how many of them may be influenced by his example either way  If he marry the not dishonest young woman  to whom he seems to be contracted  may not your lenity be a means of securing a whole future family on the side of moral honesty   His crime  as the attempt was frustrated  is not capital  And  not to metion the service of such an evidence as this  should Sir Hargrave seek for a legal redress  as he sometimes weakly threatens  my hope makes me see a further good that may be brought about by this man s reformation  Wicked masters cannot execute their base views upon the persons of the innocent  without the assistance of wicked servants  What a nest of vipers may be crushed at once  or  at least  rendered unhurtful  by depriving the three monsters he names of the aid of such an agent  Men who want to save appearances  and have estates to forfeit  will sometimes be honost of necessity  rather than put themselves into the power of untried villains   You will be so good as to make my compliments to your Lady  and to our lovely ward  You see  Sir  that I join myself with you in the honour of that agreeable relation   I hope the dear Lady has perfectly recovered her health and spirits  I am  good Mr  Reeves   Your most faithful and obedient Servant  CHARLES GRANDISON   LETTER XXXV  To the Honourable Sir CHARLES GRANDISON  Bart   Saturday  Feb  18   IN what an odious light must that wretch appear before the worthiest of men  who cannot but abhor himself     238 I am the unhappy man who was hired into the service of the best of young Ladies  Whom I was the means of betraying into the power of Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  from the Ball in the Hay market on Thursday night last   Your honour has made yourself an interest in Miss Byron s fate  as I may say  by your powerful protection  Pardon me if I give you some account of myself  and of transactions which perhaps will otherwise never be known  And this in justice to all round   My parentage was honest  My education was above my parentage  I set out with good principles  But I fell into a bad service  I was young  and of a good natural disposition  but had not virtue enough to resist a temptation  I could not say No
