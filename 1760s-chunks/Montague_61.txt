 I flew to meet him  and left my love to finish the conversation alone   Twelve o clock       I am the happiest of all possible women  Fitzgerald is in the sullens about your brother  surely there is no pleasure in nature equal to that of plaguing a fellow who really loves one  especially if he has as much merit as Fitzgerald  for otherwise he would not be worth tormenting  He had better not pout with me  I believe I know who will be tired first   Eight in the evening       I have passed a most delicious day  Fitzgerald took it into his wise head to endeavor to make me jealous of a little pert French woman  the wife of a Croix de St  Louis  who I know he despises  I then thought myself at full liberty to play off all my airs  which I did with ineffable success  and have sent him home in a humor to hang himself  Your brother stays the evening  so does a very handsome fellow I have been flirting with all the day  Fitz was engaged here too  but I told him it was impossible for him not to attend Madame La Brosse to Quebec  he looked at me with a spite in his countenance which charmed me to the soul  and handed the fair lady to his carriole       I ll teach him to coquet  Lucy  let him take his Madame La Brosse  indeed  as her husband is at Montreal  I don t see how he can avoid pursuing his conquest  I am delighted  because I know she is his aversion       Emily calls me to cards  Adieu  my dear little Lucy   Yours   A  FERMOR     LETTER XCVI   96   To Colonel RIVERS  at Quebec   Pall Mall  January 3   I HAVE but a moment  my dear Ned  to tell you  that without so much as asking your leave  and in spite of all your wise admonitions  your lovely sister has this morning consented to make me the happiest of mankind  to morrow gives me all that is excellent and charming in woman       You are to look on my writing this letter as the strongest proof I ever did  or ever can give you of my friendship  I must love you with no common affection to remember at this moment that there is such a man in being  perhaps you owe this recollection only to your being brother to the loveliest woman nature ever formed  whose charms in a month have done more towards my conversion than seven years of your preaching would have done  I am going back to Clarges Street  Adieu       Yours   c   JOHN TEMPLE     LETTER XCVII   97   To Colonel RIVERS  at Quebec   Clarges Street  January 3   I AM afraid you knew very little of the sex  my dear brother  when you cautioned me so strongly against loving Mr  Temple  I should perhaps  with all his merit  have never thought of him but for that caution       There is something very interesting to female curiosity in the idea of these very formidable men  whom no woman can see without danger  we gaze on the terrible creature at a distance  see nothing in him so very alarming  he approaches  our little hearts palpitate with fear  he is gentle  attentive  respectful  we are surprized at this respect  we are sure the world wrongs the dear civil creature  he flatters  we are pleased with his flattery  our little hearts still palpitate but not with fear       In short  my dear brother  if you wish to serve a friend with us  describe him as the most dangerous of his sex  the very idea that he is so  makes us think resistance vain  and we throw down our defensive arms in absolute despair       I am not sure this is the reason of my discovering Mr  Temple to be the most amiable of men  but of this I am certain  that I love him with the most lively affection  and that I am convinced  notwithstanding all you have said  that he deserves all my tenderness       Indeed  my dear prudent brother  you men fancy yourselves extremely wise and penetrating  but you don t know each other half so well as we know you  I shall make Temple in a few weeks as tame a domestic animal as you can possibly be  even with your Emily       I hope you won t be very angry with me for accepting an agreable fellow  and a coach and six  if you are  I can only say  that finding the dear man steal every day upon my heart  and recollecting how very dangerous a creature he was        I held it both safest and best  To marry  for fear you should chide           Adieu   Your affectionate   c   LUCY RIVERS       Please to observe  mamma was on Mr  Temple s side  and that I only take him from obedience to her commands  He has behaved like an angel to her  but I leave
