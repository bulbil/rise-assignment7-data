silly things  I thought them so at that time   Mr  Reeves soon after was sent for out by Sir Charles  I did not like his looks on his return   Dinner being ready to be served  and Sir Charles  who was still with the gentleman  summoned to it  he desir d we would walk down  and he would wait upon us by the time we were seated   Some new trouble  thought I  of which I am the cause  I doubt   Presently came in Sir Charles  unaffectedly smiling and serene —God bless you  Sir  thought I —His looks pleased me better than my cousin s   But  my dear  there is something going forward  that I cannot get out of my cousin  I hoped I should  when I got home  The Gentleman to whom Sir Charles was called out  was certainly that Bagenhall  Mr  Reeves cannot deny that  I guessed it was  by Sir Charles s sending in for Mr  Reeves  It must be about me   We had several charming conversations  Sir Charles was extremely entertaining  So unassuming  so lively  so modest  it was delightful to see the attention paid to him by the servants as they waited at table    7 They watched every look of his  I never saw love and reverence so agreeably mingled in servants faces in my life  And his commands were delivered to them with so much gentleness of voice and aspect  that one could not but conclude in favour of both  that they were the best of Servants to the best of Masters   Mr  Grandison was very gallant in his speeches to me  but very uncivil with his eyes   Lord L  said but little  but what he did say  deservedly gained attention   Every body reverenced Dr  Bartlett  and was attentive when he spoke  and would  I dare say  on his own account  had not the Master of the house  by the regard he paid him  engaged every one s veneration for him  Many of the questions which Sir Charles put to him  as if to inform himself  it was evident he could himself have answered  Yet he put them with an air of teachableness  if I may so express myself  and received the Doctor s answers to them with as much satisfaction  as if he were then newly enlightened by them —Ah  my Lucy  you imagine  I dare say  that this admirable man lost nothing in my eyes  by this his polite condescension  Reserve  and a politeness that had dignity in it  shewed that the fine Gentleman and the Clergyman were not separated in Dr  Bartlett —Pity they should be in any of the function   Sir Charles gave Lord G  an opportunity to shine  by leading the discourse into circumstances and details  which Lord G  could best recount  My Lord has been a traveller  He is a connoisseur in Antiquities  and in those parts of nice Knowlege  as I  a woman  call it  with which the Royal Society here  and the learned and polite of other nations  entertain themselves   Lord G  appeared to advantage  as Sir Charles managed it  under the awful eye of Miss Grandison  Upon my word  Lucy  she makes very free with him  I whisper d her  that she did—A very Miss How  said I     8 To a very Mr  Hickman  re whispered she —But here s the difference  I am not determined to have Lord G  Miss How yielded to her mother s recommendation  and intended to marry Mr Hickman  even when she used him worst  One time or other  archly continued she the whisper  holding up her spread Hand  and with a countenance of admiration  my Lord G  is to shew us his collection of Butterflies  and other gaudy insects  Will you make one —  Of the gaudy insects  whispered I —  Fie  Harriet —One of the party  you know  I must mean  Let me tell you  I never saw a collection of these various insects  that I did not the more admire the Maker of them  and of all us insects  whatever I thought of the collectors of the minute ones —Another word with you  Harriet—These little playful studies may do well enough with persons who do not want to be more than indifferent to us  But do you think a Lover ought to take high delight in the painted wings of a Butterfly  when a fine Lady has made herself all over Butterfly to attract him —Eyes off  Sir Charles —for he looked  tho  smilingly  yet earnestly  at us  as we whisper d behind the Countess s chair  who heard what was said  and was pleased with it   LETTER II  Miss BYRON  In continuation   Thursday Morning  Mar  2   I Should have told you  that Miss Grandison did the honours of the table  and I will go round it  for I know you expect I should  But I have not yet done with Lord G —Poor man  he is excessively in Love  I see that  Well he may  What man would not with
