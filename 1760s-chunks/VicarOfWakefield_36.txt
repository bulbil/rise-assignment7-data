In this manner that night  the first of our real misfortunes  was spent in the bitterness of complaint  and ill supported sallies of enthusiasm  I determined  however  to find out our betrayer  wherever  Page  184  he was  and reproach his baseness  The next morning we missed our wretched child at breakfast  where she used to give life and chearfulness to us all  My wife  as before  attempted to ease her heart by reproaches    Never    cried she    shall that vilest stain of our family again darken those harmless doors  I will never call her daughter more  No  let the strumpet live with her vile seducer  she may bring us to shame  but she shall never more deceive us         Wife    said I    do not talk thus hardly  my detestation of her guilt is as great as yours  but ever shall this house and this heart be open to a poor returning repentant sinner  The sooner she returns from her transgression  the more welcome shall she be to me  For the first time the very best may err  art may persuade  and novelty spread out its charm  The first fault is the child of simplicity  but every other the offspring of guilt  Yes   Page  185  the wretched creature shall be welcome to this heart and this house  tho  stained with ten thousand vices  I will again hearken to the music of her voice  again will I hang fondly on her bosom  if I find but repentance there  My son  bring hither my bible and my staff  I will pusue her  wherever she is  and tho  I cannot save her from shame  I may prevent the continuance of iniquity      Page   unnumbered   CHAP  XVIII   The pursuit of a father to reclaim a lost child to virtue   THO  the child could not describe the gentleman s person who handed his sister into the post chaise  yet my suspicions fell entirely upon our young landlord  whose character for such intrigues was but too well known  I therefore directed my steps towards Thornhill castle  resolving to upbraid him  and  if possible  to bring back my daughter  but before I had reached his seat  I was met by one of my parishioners  who said he saw a young lady resembling my daughter in a post chaise with a gentleman  whom  by the description  I could only guess to be Mr  Burchell  and that they drove very fast  This information  however  did by no  Page  188  means satisfy me  I therefore went to the young  Squire s  and though it was yet early  insisted upon seeing him immediately  he soon appeared with the most open familiar air  and seemed perfectly amazed at my daughter s elopement  protesting upon his honour that he was quite a stranger to it  I now therefore condemned my former suspicions  and could turn them only on Mr  Burchell  who I recollected had of late several private conferences with her  but the appearance of another witness left me no room to doubt of his villainy  who averred  that he and my daughter were actually gone towards the wells  about thirty miles off  where there was a great deal of company  Hearing this  I resolved to pursue them there  I walked along with earnestness  and enquired of several by the way  but received no accounts  till entering the town  I was met by a person on horseback  whom I remembered to have seen at the  Squire s  and he assured me that if I followed them to the races  which were but thirty miles farther  I might depend  Page  189  upon overtaking them  for he had seen them dance there the night before  and the whole assembly seemed charmed with my daughter s performance  Early the next day I walked forward to the races  and about four in the afternoon I came upon the course  The company made a very brilliant appearance  all earnestly employed in one pursuit  that of pleasure  how different from mine  that of reclaiming a lost child to virtue  I thought I perceived Mr  Burchell at some distance from me  but  as if he dreaded an interview  upon my approaching him  he mixed among a crowd  and I saw him no more  I now reflected that it would be to no purpose to continue my pursuit farther  and resolved to return home to an innocent family  who wanted my assistance  But the agitations of my mind  and the fatigues I had undergone  threw me into a fever  the symptoms of which I perceived before I came off the course  This was another unexpected stroke  as I was more than seventy miles distant from home  however  I retired  Page  190  to a little ale house by the road side  and in this place  the usual retreat of indigence and frugality  I laid me down patiently to wait the issue of my disorder  I languished here for near three weeks  but at last my constitution prevailed  though I was unprovided with money to defray the expences of my
