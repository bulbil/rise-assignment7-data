But the commodore  who is very choleric  and does not like  to be jeered  fell into a main high passion  and stormed like a perfect  hurricane  swearing that he knew a devil from a jackdaw as well as  e er a man in the three kingdoms  He owned  indeed  that the birds were  found  but denied that they were the occasion of the uproar  For my own  part  master  I believe much may be said on both sides of the question   though to be sure  the devil is always going about  as the saying is    This circumstantial account  extraordinary as it was  never altered one  feature in the countenance of Mr  Pickle  who  having heard it to an  end  took the pipe from his mouth  saying  with a look of infinite  sagacity and deliberation   I do suppose he is of the Cornish Trunnions   What sort of a woman is his spouse    Spouse   cried the other    odds heart  I don t think he would marry the queen of Sheba   Lack a day  sir  he won t suffer his own maids to be in the garrison   but turns them into an out house every night before the watch is set   Bless your honour s soul  he is  as it were  a very oddish kind of a  gentleman  Your worship would have seen him before now  for  when he  is well  he and my good master Hatchway come hither every evening  and    6 22 15  3 45 PM   drink a couple of cans of rumbo a piece  but he has been confined to  his house this fortnight by a plaguy fit of the gout  which  I ll assure  your worship  is a good penny out of my pocket    At that instant  Mr  Pickle s ears were saluted with such a strange  noise  as even discomposed the muscles of his face  which gave immediate  indications of alarm  This composition of notes at first resembled  the crying of quails  and croaking of bull dogs  but as it approached  nearer  he could distinguish articulate sounds pronounced with great  violence  in such a cadence as one would expect to hear from a human  creature scolding through the organs of an ass  it was neither speaking  nor braying  but a surprising mixture of both  employed in the utterance  of terms absolutely unintelligible to our wondering merchant  who had  just opened his mouth to express his curiosity  when the starting up at  the well known sound  cried   Odd s niggers  there is the commodore with  his company  as sure as I live   and with his apron began to wipe the  dust off an elbow chair placed at one side of the fire  and kept sacred  for the ease and convenience of this infirm commander  While he was thus  occupied  a voice  still more uncouth than the former  bawled aloud    Ho  the house  a hoy   Upon which the publican  clapping a hand to each  side of his head with his thumbs fixed to his ears  rebellowed in the  same tone  which he had learned to imitate   Hilloah   The voice again  exclaimed   Have you got any attorneys aboard   and when the landlord  replied   No  no   this man of strange expectation came in  supported by  his two dependents  and displayed a figure every way answerable to  the oddity of his character  He was in stature at least six feet high   though he had contracted a habit of stooping  by living so long on  board  his complexion was tawny  and his aspect rendered hideous by a  large scar across his nose  and a patch that covered the place of  one eye  Being seated in his chair  with great formality the landlord  complimented him upon his being able to come abroad again  and having in  a whisper communicated the name of his fellow guest  whom the commodore  already knew by report  went to prepare  with all imaginable despatch   the first allowance of his favourite liquor  in three separate cans  for  each was accommodated with his own portion apart   while the lieutenant  sat down on the blind side of his commander  and Tom Pipes  knowing his  distance  with great modesty took his station in the rear   After a pause of some minutes  the conversation was begun by this  ferocious chief  who  fixing his eye upon the lieutenant with a  sternness of countenance not to be described  addressed him in these  words   D   my eyes  Hatchway  I always took you to be a better seaman  than to overset our chaise in such fair weather  Blood  didn t I tell  you we were running bump ashore  and bid you set in the ice brace  and  haul up a wind     Yes   replied the other  with an arch sneer   I do  confess as how
