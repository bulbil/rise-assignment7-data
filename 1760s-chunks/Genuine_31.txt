she could never sufficiently acknowledge the favour  She imagined that Mr  Whitefield and Mr  Wesley were the only two good men in the world  but she then began to think there was a third  a young saint both in thought and deed   After he had thus insinuated himself into her good graces  he began to feel her pulse upon the score of matrimony  Nothing ever appeared so inanimate and rigid at first  but when he began to talk of spiritual love  unsullied with lustful thoughts  she gave ear to him  and was at length of opinion  that a woman might enter into the state of matrimony only  without being irretrievably damned  provided there were always seperate beds  He entirely acquiesced in whatever she said  and after about half a year s spiritual courtship  they took each other for better for worse   He left her as soon as he could possess himself of her money  telling her  that she neither wanted gold  or a young fellow to   148 carry her to heaven  and that  as she had fixed her mind entirely on spiritual things  it was doing her a great kindness to take temptations far out of the way   The captain again returned to London  where meeting with an old flame  he took a lodging with her  and lived snug for some time  but his cash circulating too fast at the gaming table  he was obliged to have recourse to drawing upon several friends for money  but few or them answered his bills  and what little money he procured from them  with the utmost difficulty  lasted but a short time  He married six different wives in three months  whose fortunes  put together  made but two hundred pounds  and their ages three hundred years   He now introduced himself to the acquaintance of one Stroud  who had found a comfortable means of livelihood  by hiring houses  furnishing them upon credit  and disposed of the furniture  He engaged with him in his plan  which at first proved better than the wife trade  for   149 in less than six weeks  they cleared two thousand pounds   They did not  however continue long successful  for soon after Stroud was taken up for one of those frauds  which captain R—fs thought a sufficient hint for him to decamp  Accordingly he went to Paris  having no other dependence than the ready money he had carried with him thither   He first paid his addresses to Miss ELLIOT  as one whom he most ardently desired to make his wife  but she had too much penetration  as she was already acquainted with his character from several of his intimates in the city where she resided  to suffer herself  who had taken a firm resolution of never entering into the married state  to listen to the overtures he had made he•  She was not averse to his person  and would have been very willing to have been his mistress  had his finances been answerable to the high demands she made on her lovers  but as he was low in cash  she thought it best to give him his congè at first  and accordingly  ordered her servants   150 to deny her to him  as often as became  till after some time being weary of these repeated denials  he resolved to leave off frequenting her house  and was never afterwards seen there   Our heroine had now lived near a twelve month with the duke de N—NOIS  who was extremely fond of her  and she had always employed every means her invention could suggest to her  to increase his affection towards her  But as people of an uneven temper cannot possibly be supposed always to act consistent to their true interest  so neither did Miss ELLIOT  she having the misfortune to incur her keeper s displeasure  by being discovered in an intrigue with his grace s secretary  for which he dismissed her  and she prepared to set out immediately for her native country   I cannot take leave of Paris  whither I have accompanied our heroine  without some few remarks on the poverty and pride of the French  whose ambition and vanity are evidently without a parallel  as the following example will clearly evince     151Walking one day in the gardens of Versailles  all eyes were in a minute on her  and she was not less attentive to the many objects that surrounded her  They were all in masquerade to her  even if she had before known them  for not only the women were painted  but even the men  The fops and petit maitres wore patches and rouge  After she had been presented to some of la premiere noblesse  as an English lady of fashion  she asked the duke  who was with her  concerning many of those whom she saw  A gentleman  with a red feather  first attracted her observation  She asked who he was  taking him for some foreign ambassador  The duke replied  he was a chevalier de St  Louis  who had nothing more than a pension of three hundred livres to live on  Miss ELLIOT S curiosity then led her to inquire if he followed any business  but she was answered in the negative  it being too great a disgrace on a native of France  to be of any
