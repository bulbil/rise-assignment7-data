 ourselves  I have abundant reason  I am sure  to say  that  when I was   most disappointed  I was nearer my happiness  for had I made my escape    which was so often my chief point in view  and what I had placed my   heart upon  I had escaped the blessings now before me  and fallen    perhaps headlong  into the miseries I would have avoided  And yet  after   all  it was necessary I should take the steps I did  to bring on this   wonderful turn  O the unsearchable wisdom of God   And how much ought   I to adore the divine goodness  and humble myself  who am made a poor   instrument  as I hope  not only to magnify his graciousness to this fine   gentleman and myself  but also to dispense benefits to others  Which God   of his mercy grant          In the agreeable manner I have mentioned  did we pass the time in our   second happy tour  and I thought Mrs  Jewkes would have sunk into the   ground  when she saw Mr  Williams brought in the coach with us  and   treated so kindly  We dined together in a most pleasant  easy  and frank   manner  and I found I need not  from my master s generosity  to be under   any restraint  as to my conduct to this good clergyman  For he  so often   as he fancied I was reserved  moved me to be free with him  and to him    and several times called upon me to help my father and Mr  Williams  and   seemed to take great delight in seeing me carve  as  indeed  he does in   every thing I do       After dinner we went and looked into the chapel  which is a very pretty   one  and very decent  and  when finished as he designs it  against his   next coming down  will be a very pretty place       My heart  my dear mother  when I first set my foot in it  throbbed a   good deal  with awful joy  at the thoughts of the solemnity  which  I   hope  will in a few days be performed here  And when I came up   towards the little pretty altar piece  while they were looking at a   communion picture  and saying it was prettily done  I gently stept into   a corner  out of sight  and poured out my soul to God on my knees  in   supplication and thankfulness  that  after having been so long absent   from divine service  the first time I entered into a house dedicated to   his honour  should be with such blessed prospects before me  and   begging of God to continue me humble  and to make me not unworthy of   his mercies  and that he would be pleased to bless the next author of my   happiness  my good master       I heard my master say  Where s Pamela  And so I broke off sooner than I   would  and went up to him       He said  Mr  Williams  I hope I have not so offended you by my conduct   past   for really it is what I ought to be ashamed of   as that you will   refuse to officiate  and to give us your instructions here to morrow    Mr  Peters was so kind  for the first time  to offer it  but I knew it   would be inconvenient for him  and  besides  I was willing to make this   request to you an introduction to our reconciliation       Sir  said he  most willingly  and most gratefully  will I obey you    Though  if you expect a discourse  I am wholly unprepared for the   occasion  I would not have it  replied he  pointed to any particular   occasion  but if you have one upon the text  There is more joy in Heaven   over one sinner that repenteth  than over ninety nine just persons that   need no repentance  and if it makes me not such a sad fellow as to be   pointed at by mine and the ladies  servants we shall have here  I shall   be well content   Tis a general subject  added he  makes me speak of   that  but any one you please will do  for you cannot make a bad choice    I am sure       Sir  said he  I have one upon that text  but I am ready to think  that   a thanksgiving one  which I made on a great mercy to myself  if I may be   permitted to make my own acknowledgments of your favour the subject of   a discourse  will be suitable to
