Mrs  Jervois  and had satisfied himself that they were actually man and wife  Methinks I am glad for Miss Jervois s sake  that her mother has changed her name  They lived not happily together since their last enterprize  For the man  who had long been a sufferer from poverty  was in fear of losing one half at least of his wife s annuity  by what passed on that occasion  and accused her of putting them upon the misbehaviour he was guilty of  which had brought upon him  he said  the resentments of a man admired by all the world   The attorney  who visited Sir Charles from these people  at their request  waited on him again  in their names  with hopes that they should not suffer in their annuity  and expressing their concern for having offended him   Mrs  O Hara also requested it as a favour to see her daughter   Sir Charles commissioned the attorney  who is a man of repute  to tell them  that if Mrs  O Hara would come to St  James s Square next Wednesday about five o clock  Miss Jervois should be introduced to her  and she should be welcome to bring with her her husband  and Captain Salmonet  that they might be convinced he bore no ill will to either of them     7 Adieu  till by and by  Miss Grandison is come  in one of her usual hurries  to oblige me to be present at the visit to be made her this afternoon  by the Earl of G  and Lady Gertrude  his sister  a maiden lady advanced in years  who is exceedingly fond of her nephew  and intends to make him heir of her large fortune   Friday Night   THE Earl is an agreeable man  Lady Gertrude is a very agreeable woman  They saw Miss Grandison with the young Lord s eyes  and were better pleased with her  as I told her afterwards  than I should have been  or then they would  had they known her as well as I do  She doubted not  she answered me  but I should find fault with her  and yet she was as good as for her life she could be   Such an archness in every motion  Such a turn of the eye to me on my Lord G s assiduities  Such a fear in him of her correcting glance  Such an half timid  half free parade when he had done any thing that he intended to be obliging  and now and then an aiming at raillery  as if he was not very much afraid of her  and dared to speak his mind even to her  On her part  on those occasions  such an air  as if she had a learner before her  and was ready to rap his knuckles  had nobody been present to mediate for him  that tho  I could not but love her for her very archness  yet in my mind  I could  for their sakes  but more for her own  have severely chidden her   She is a charming woman  and every thing she says and does becomes her  But I am so much afraid of what may be the case  when the lover is changed into the husband  that I wish to myself now and then  when I see her so lively  that she would remember that there was once such a man as Captain Anderson  But she makes it a rule  she says  to remember nothing that will vex her   Is not my memory  said she once  given me for my   8 benefit  and shall I make it my torment  No  Harriet  I will leave that to be done by you wise ones  and see what you will get by it   Why this  Charlotte  replied I  the wife ones may have a chance to get by it—They will very probably  by remembring past mistakes  avoid many inconveniencies into which forgetfulness will run you lively ones   Well  well  returned she  we are not all of us born to equal honour  Some of us are to be set up for warnings  some for examples  And the first are generally of greater use to the world than the other   Now  Charlotte  said I  do you destroy the force of your own argument  Can the person who is singled out for the warning  be near so happy  as she that is set up for the example   You are right as far as I know  Harriet  But I obey the present impulse  and try to find an excuse afterwards for what that puts me upon  And all the difference in this  as to the reward  I have a joy  You a comfort  But comfort is a poor word  and I can t bear it   So Biddy in the Tender Husband would have said  Charlotte  But poor as the word is with you and her  give me comfort rather than joy  if they must be separated  But I see not but that a woman of my Charlotte s happy turn may have both   She tapped my cheek—Take that  Harriet  for making a Biddy of me  I believe  if you
