 which has  even to this day  continued to be beneficial to his posterity   He now  at length  saw his country civilized  the people paid their taxes without insurrections  the nobility learned a just subordination  the laws alone were suffered to pass sentence  towns began to separate from the castles of the nobility  commerce every day increased  foreigners either feared England  or sought its alliance  and the spirit of faction was happily extinguished at home  He was at peace with all Europe  and he had issued out a general pardon to his own subjects  It was in this situation of things that he died of the gout in his stomach  having lived fifty two years and reigned twenty three  Since the times of Alfred  England had not seen such another King  He rendered his subjects powerful and happy  and wrought a greater change in his kingdom  than it was possible to expect could be effected in so short a time  If he had any fault  it was  that  having begun his reign with oeconomy  as he grew old  his desires seemed to change their object  from the use of money  to the pleasure of hoarding it  but we can easily him  as he only saved for the public  the royal coffers being then the only treasury of the state  and  in proportion to the King s sinances  the public might be said to be either rich or indigent   I am   c     226  LETTER XXIX   NEVER did Prince come to the throne with a conjuncture of so many fortunate circumstances in his favour as Henry VIII  who now took upon him the government of the kingdom  His prudent father left him a peaceable kingdom  prudent ministers  and a well stored treasury  All factions were extinguished  and all divisions united n his person  he by the father s side claimed from the house of Lancaster  and by the mother s from the house of York  He was at peace with all Europe  and his subjects were every day growing more powerful and more wealthy  commerce and arts had been introduced in the former reign  and they seemed to find in England a favourable reception  The young King himself was beautiful in person  expert in polite exercises  and loved by his subjects  The old King  who was himself a scholar  had him instructed in all the learning of the times  so that he was perfectly versed in school divinity at the age of eighteen   Yet  from this beginning  you must not expect to read the history of a good Prince  All these advantages were either the gifts of nature  of fortune  or of his father  with all these happy talents  Henry VIII  wanted the two great requisites in forming every good character  wisdom and virtue  The learning he had  if it might be called by that name  served only to inflame his pride  but not controul his vicious affections  The love of his subjects was testified by their adulations  and served as another meteor to lead him astray  His vast wealth  instead of relieving his subjects  or increasing his power  only contributed to supply   227 his debaucheries  or gratify the rapacity of the ministers of his pleasures  But happy for him  had his faults rested here  he was a tyrant  humanity takes the alarm at his cruelty  and  whatever fortunate events might have been the consequence of his designs  no good man but must revolt at the means he took for their accomplishment   The first act of injustice which marked his reign  was his prosecution of Empson and Dudley  the Judges whom his father had constituted to inquire into cases of treason  and levy fines proportionable to the offence  Their conduct was examined  but  nothing being found against them that could amount to a capital conviction  a false accusation was produced  and they were convicted of having plotted against the new King  and received sentence to be beheaded  which was executed accordingly   These two Judges had been long hated by the people  though apparently without cause  they only put the laws in execution against criminals  and  instead of their lives  deprived the guilty of their fortunes  This action of an unjust compliance with popular clamour was followed by another still more detrimental to the nation  yet more pleasing to the people  the spirit of chivalry and conquest was not yet quite extinguished in the nation  France was still an object of desire  and Henry was resolved once more to strike 〈◊〉 the crown  It was in vain that one of his old prudent counsellors objected  that conquests on the continent would only be prejudicial to the kingdom  and that England  from its situation  was not destined for extensive empire  the young King  deaf to all remonstrances  and perhaps inspired by the voice of the people  resolved to lead an army into that kingdom  The consequence of the campaign   228 was an useless victory and an empty triumph  The French fled without fighting  a truce was concluded between the two Kings  and Henry returned home to dissipate  in more peaceful follies  the large sums which had been amassed for very different purposes by his father   But
