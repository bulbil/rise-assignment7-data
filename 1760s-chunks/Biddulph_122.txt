 as I am sure his friendship for Mr Arnold and you will make him endeavour to settle them to the best of his power   My lady V——’s politeness and generosity would not suffer her to mention the particulars of the methods proposed  but I have reason to believe  my good lord V——  will interest himself rather farther than I wish   When my lord and Mr Arnold  she proceeded  had talked over these matters for some time  in which my lord had much ado to get the better of Mr Arnold’s obstinacy  he told him  that I should undertake to explain his situation to you and lady Bidulph  That he made no doubt of your tenderness in forgetting all that was past  and being willing to embrace his fortunes  let them be what they would  for  said he  I am sure Mrs Arnold will think herself happier with you  on three hundred pounds a year  than she would with twice so many thousands without you   Oh  madam  said I  interrupting her  my lord has read my very heart   My lady smiled and went on  Lady Bidulph  said my lord  is so good a woman  that as she must look on you in the light of a repenting sinner  you may be assured of her pardon and favour  That he may rest satisfied of  answered my mother  My income is not considerable  and I have never been able to lay any thing by  but if Mr Arnold can be extricated from his present difficulties  so as to be able to retire quietly into the country  I will share that little with him   My lady V——’s eyes moistened  mine were quite suffused  I assure you  said lady V——  it was not without abundance of arguments used by my lord  and downright quarrelling on my side  that Mr Arnold could be prevailed on to consent that any other application should be made on his part  than that of acquainting you with his penitence  and communicating his resolution  together with his motives for it  of never seeing you more   He says  Sir George Bidulph never was his friend  and  as he supposes him more now his enemy than ever  he would be sorry to be under any obligations to him   My mother  who never conceals her thoughts  answered directly  of that I believe he need not be apprehensive  Sir George is not very    liberal  he would have persuaded his sister against returning to her husband  and I am sure will not be willing to contribute towards making their reunion happy  Besides  as he is now going to be married  he troubles himself with little else than his intended bride   Lady V—— seemed shocked  I was sorry my mother had spoken so freely of Sir George  to one who was an entire stranger both to him and her  but she is so good  that even her errors proceed from virtue   Well  said lady V——  we have now seen the worst side of the prospect  let us turn our eyes towards the pleasanter view  What do you mean to do  Mrs Arnold   Mean  madam  said I  To go directly to my husband   Well  well  replied she  smiling  that I suppose  but how do you purpose to settle your little household matters   I think  said my mother  the best thing you can do  is  to go directly down to my house in Wiltshire  You know that  and the furniture are mine  during my life  they go to your brother afterwards  Send for your two children and honest Martha  dispose of your house in town  and all your effects here  as well as at South park and in Essex—let the produce be applied to the payments of debts  as far as it will go  You will then have your jointure to receive  to which I will add two hundred pounds a year  which will enable you  by degrees  to pay off the rest of your debts  and I do not see why you may not live comfortably besides   Extremely well  said my lady  with Mrs Arnold’s good management  especially as they will not have the expence of house rent  I am sure my lord will willingly undertake to manage Mr Arnold’s affairs in town for him  and I would have you both get into the country as fast as you can   I am entirely of your opinion  lady V——  said my mother  What do you think  child  Dear madam  I think that I am the happiest woman breathing  Such a parent as you  such a friend as lady V——  and such a husband  as I promise myself Mr Arnold will prove—How can I be otherwise than happy  I am ready to do  to do joyfully  whatever you direct  Dear lady V——  ought not I to see poor Mr Arnold immediately   Why  said lady V——  I would not have you surprize him  he is to dine with us to day  and I will prepare him to receive you in the afternoon at my house  if you chose it   By all means  my good lady V——  I
