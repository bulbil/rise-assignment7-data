me  from him  that with equal admiration of my virtues and my charms  he laid himself and his fortune at my feet  and was ready to lead me to the altar  if I could condescend so far as to become his wife  I required three days to make up my mind on the subject  In this interval  I made inquiries about the gentleman  and hearing a good character of him  notwithstanding the deranged state of his finances  it was my determination to marry him without more ado  so that the preliminaries were soon ratified by a definitive treaty   Don Manuel de Xerica  for that was my husband s name  took me immediately after the ceremony to his castle  which had an air of antiquity highly flattering to his family pride  He told a story about one of his ancestors who built it in days of yore  and because it was not founded the day before yesterday  jumped to a conclusion that there was not a more ancient house in Spain than that of Xerica  But nobility  like perishable merchandise  will run to decay  the castle  shored up on this side and on that  was in the very agony of tumbling to pieces  what a buttress for Don Manuel and for his old walls was his marriage with me  More than half my savings were laid out on repairs  and the residue was wanted to set us going in a genteel style among our country neighbours  Behold me  then  you who can believe it  landed on a new planet  transformed into the presiding genius of a castle  the Lady Bountiful of my parish  our stage machinery could never have furnished such a change  I was too good an actress not to have supported my new rank and dignity with appropriate grace  I assumed high airs  theatrical grandeurs  a most dignified strut and demeanour  all which made the bumpkins conceive a wonderful idea of my exalted origin  How would they not have tickled their fancies at my expense  had they known the real truth of the case  The gentry of the neighbourhood would have scoffed at me most unmercifully  and the country people would have been much more chary of the respect they shewed me   It was now near six years that I had lived very happily with Don Manuel  when he ended ways  means  and life together  My legacy consisted of a broken fortune to splice  and your sister Beatrice  then more than four years old  to maintain  The castle  which was our only tangible resource  was unfortunately mortgaged to several creditors  the principal of whom was one Bernard Astuto  Cunning by name  and cunning by nature  He practised as an attorney at Valencia  and bore his faculties in all the infamy of pettifogging  law and equity conspired in his person to push the trade of cozening and swindling to the utmost extremity  To think of falling into the clutches of such a creditor  A gentleman s property under the gripe of such a claw as this attorney s affords much the same sport as a lamb to a wolf or a dove to a kite  Nearly after the fashion of these beasts and birds of prey  did Signor Astuto  when informed of my husband s death  hover over his victim  concealing his fell purpose under the ambush of the law  The whole estate would have been swallowed up in pleadings  affidavits  demurrers  and rejoinders  but for the light thrown upon the proceedings by my lucky star  under whose influence the plaintiff was turned at once into defendant  and was left without a reply to the arguments of these all  powerful eyes  I got to the blind side of him in an interview  which I contrived during the progress of our litigation  Nothing was wanting on my part  I own it frankly  to fill him brimful of the tender passion  an ardent longing to save my goods  chattels  and domain  made me practise upon him  to my own disgust  that system of coquettish tactics and flirtation which had drawn so many former fools into an ambuscade  Yet  with all the resources of a veteran  I was very near letting the attorney escape  He was so barricaded by mouldy parchments  so immured in actions and informations  as scarcely to seem susceptible of any love but the love of law  The truth  however  was  that this moping pettifogger  this porer over ponderous abridgments  this scrawler of acts and deeds  had more young blood in him than I was aware of  and a trick of looking at me out of the corner of his eye  He professed to be a novice in the art of courtship  My whole heart and soul  madam  said he  have been wedded to my profession  and the consequence has been  that the uses and customs of gallantry have seemed weary  stale  flat  and unprofitable to me  But though not a man of outward show  I am well furnished with the stock in trade of love  To come to the point at once  if you can resolve in your mind to marry me  we will make a grand bonfire of the whole lawsuit  and I will give the go by to those rascally creditors  who have joined issue with me
