soon reached  the very centre of greatness and magnificence  and  now  the long lost  Earl of Salisbury once more appeared in becoming state amidst the nobles  of England  shining like the great light of heaven when just emerged  from a dark and baleful eclipse  His ancient friends embraced him  his  peers crowded round him  impatient to learn the story of his wonderful  deliverance  Not so the crasty Hubert  he heard of his arrival with  terror  and beheld him with confusion and dismay  The young king  hastened to congratulate his noble kinsman  who sunk upon his knee   loudly calling for justice and redress  Henry raised him  and demanded  the cause and purpose of his petition  The Earl collected his great  spirit  and  with locks of terror and disdain  pointed to Hubert  whilst  silence and suspence possessed the croud of nobles   Come forth   said  he         thou wicked author of my wrongs  come forth  and meet the vengeance due  to thy treachery —Here stands the wretched caitiff   such this arm shall  prove him  who basely seized the fatal moment of my absence to destroy  my peace and happiness for ever  Bear witness for me  ye warlike Barons  and Nobles of this land  with what zealous loyalty I laboured to support  the cause of Henry  and to establish our rightful King on that royal  feat  for him and for our country have I encountered the toils and  desperate calamities of war  the fury of proud foes and formidable  hosts  the rage of storms and waves  and the dangers of the tempestuous  ocean  Scarcely have these shattered limbs supported the painful task of  honour  and wonderful hath my deliverance been  And what is my  recompence  Whilst I fought in Gascoigne  this pernicious courtier  who  never experienced the hazards and distresses of the field  never knew  aught but the luxurious ease of a palace  contrived the ruin of the  brave harrassed soldier  He chose out his minion  his nephew  the  unworthily ennobled Raymond  he filled the royal ears with false and  malicious tales of my death  he sent his creature to seize my castle  my  power  and  my extended domain  and to insult my unhappy Countess with his  adulterous love  he hath abused her weakness  he hath deceived her  credulity  or perhaps by force possessed himself of her bed  I seek not  for reparation  my wrongs wist not admit of this  but I call for just  punishment  for vengeance due to that deadly wound my honour hath thus  sustained  To the justice of my liege Lord I fly —to your royal justice   rather than to the influence which Salisbury still maintains  and the  power which he still commands in England         Henry was embarrassed and disordered by the boldness of this address   The precipitation with which he had yielded to the desires of Hubert now  appeared in the true light  and covered him with confusion  He  prepared to accost the Earl in such soothing terms  as he could command  in this disorder of his thoughts  when the favourite  versed in all the  refined arts of dissimulation  hastily prevented him  and thus assumed  the semblance of a generous impatience of all censure or suspicion         That I rejoice at the happy arrival of Earl William  the saints are  witnesses  that I believed him dead surely cannot be deemed a crime   when such repeated assurances were received  that he had shared the fate  of his unhappy countrymen  What though I too indulgently consented to  the wishes of my nephew  and obtained him permission to woo the gentle  Countess  whom all the land regarded as a widow  What force  what fraud   what injury was meditated  What injustice hath been committed  What vile  dishonest purposes have been pursued  that vengeance is so loudly  denounced  The soul of Raymond is noble  and his procedure hath been  honourable  True  he sought the Countess  he found her deep in sorrow   he indulged her sorrow  nor urged his passion with the importunity of  violent love  He waited  if  happily  time and his tender cares might  move the Countess to listen to his suit  but  thanks to the interposing  providence of heaven  his suit could not prevail —Go  Lord William   repair to thy princely castle  there thy wise waits to receive thee   there shalt thou find her unassailed and unpolluted  Go  and be happy   and  when thou reflectest on thine own credulity  learn to forgive those  who too easily received the false story of thy death         The Earl gazed in silence  doubting  yet willing to believe these happy  tidings  Hubert repeated his assurances with an aspect steady and  composed  By  my Holidame   exclaimed the King         it rejoiceth us that Lord William hath now found his suspicions false   not
