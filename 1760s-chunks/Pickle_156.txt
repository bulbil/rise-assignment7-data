last detected the  ruffians who have persecuted me so much  I caught them in the fact of  suffocating me with cold water  and by the Lord  I will be revenged  or  may I never live to finish my Cleopatra  For the love of God  open the  door  and I will make that conceited pagan  that pretender to  taste  that false devotee of the ancients  who poisons people with  sillykicabies and devil s dung  I say  I will make him a monument of my  wrath  and an example to all the cheats and impostors of the faculty   and as for that thick headed insolent pedant  his confederate  who  emptied my own jordan upon me while I slept  he had better have been in  his beloved Paris  botching schemes for his friend the Pretender  than  incur the effects of my resentment  Gadsbodikins  I won t leave him a  windpipe for the hangman to stop  at the end of another rebellion    Pickle told him his conduct had been so extravagant as to confirm the  whole company in the belief that he was actually deprived of his senses   on which supposition  Mr  Jolter and the doctor had acted the part  of friends  in doing that which they thought most conducive to his    6 22 15  3 45 PM   recovery  so that their concern merited his thankful acknowledgment   instead of his frantic menaces  that  for his own part  he would be the  first to condemn him  as one utterly bereft of his wits  and give orders  for his being secured as a madman  unless he would immediately give a  proof of his sanity by laying aside his sword  composing his spirits   and thanking his injured friends for their care of his person   This alternative quieted his transports in a moment  he was terrified at  the apprehension of being treated like a bedlamite  being dubious of  the state of his own brain  and  on the other hand  had conceived such  a horror and antipathy for his tormentors  that  far from believing  himself obliged by what they had done  he could not even think of them  without the utmost rage and detestation  He  therefore  in the most  tranquil voice he could assume  protested that he never was less out  of his senses than at present  though he did not know how long he might  retain them  if he should be considered in the light of a lunatic  that   in order to prove his being Compos mentis  he was willing to sacrifice  the resentment he so justly harboured against those who  by their  malice  had brought him to this pass  but  as he apprehended it would  be the greatest sign of madness he could exhibit to thank them for  the mischiefs they had brought upon him  he desired to be excused from  making any such concession  and swore he would endure everything rather  than be guilty of such mean absurdity   Peregrine held a consultation upon this reply  when the governor and  physician strenuously argued against any capitulation with a maniac  and  proposed that some method might be taken to seize  fetter  and convey  him into a dark room  where he might be treated according to the rules  of art  but the Capuchin  understanding the circumstances of the case   undertook to restore him to his former state  without having recourse to  such violent measures  Pickle  who was a better judge of the affair  than any person present  opened the door without further hesitation  and  displayed the poor painter standing with a woeful countenance  shivering  in his shirt  which was as wet as if he had been dragged through the  Dender   a spectacle which gave such offence to the chaste eyes of the  Hebrew s mistress  who was by this time one of the spectators  that she  turned her head another way  and withdrew to her own room  exclaiming  against the indecent practices of men   Pallet  seeing the young gentleman enter  ran to him  and  taking him by  the hands  called him his best friend  and said he had rescued him from  those who had a design against his life  The priest would have produced  his parings and applied them to his nose  but was hindered by Pickle   who advised the patient to shift himself  and put on his clothes  This  being done with great order and deliberation  Mr  Jolter who  with the  doctor  had kept a wary distance  in expectation of seeing some storage  effects of his distraction  began to believe that he had been guilty of  a mistake  and accused the physician of having misled him by his false  diagnostic  The doctor still insisted upon his former declaration  assuring him  that although Pallet enjoyed a short interval for the  present  the delirium would soon recur  unless they would profit by this  momentary calm  and order him to be blooded  blistered  and purged with  all imaginable despatch   The governor  however  notwithstanding this caution
