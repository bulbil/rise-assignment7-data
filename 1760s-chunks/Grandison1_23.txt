have wished  A large pacquet  however  for Selby House   Lady Betty received us most politely  She had company with her  to whom she introduced us  and presented me in a very advantageous character   Shall I tell you how their first appearance struck me  and what I have since heard and observed of them     52 The first I shall mention was Miss Cantillon  very pretty  but visibly proud  affected  and conceited   The second Miss Clements  plain  but of a fine understanding  improved by reading  and who haveing no personal advantages to be vain of  has  by the cultivation of her mind  obtained a preference in every one s opinion over the fair Cantillon   The third was Miss Barnevelt  a Lady of masculine features  and whose mind belied not those features  for she has the character of being loud  bold  free  even fierce when opposed  and affects at all times such airs of contempt of her own Sex  that one almost wonders at her condescending to wear petticoats   The gentlemens names were Walden and Singleton  the first  an Oxford scholar of family and fortune  but quaint and opinionated  despising every one who has not had the benefit of an University education   Mr  Singleton is an harmless man  who is  it seems  the object of more ridicule  even down to his very name  among all his acquaintance  than I think he by any means ought  considering the apparent inoffensiveness of the man  who did not give himself his intellects  and his constant good humour  which might intitle him to better quarter  the rather too as he has one point of knowlege  which those who think themselves his superiors in understanding  do not always attain  the knowlege of himself  for he is humble  modest  ready to confess an inferiority to every one  And as laughing at a jest is by some taken for high applause  he is ever the first to bestow that commendation on what others say  tho  it must be owned  he now and then mistakes for a jest  what is none  Which  however  may be generally more the fault of the speakers than of Mr  Singleton  since he takes his cue from their smiles  especially when those are seconded by the laugh of one of whom he has a good opinion     53 Mr  Singleton is in possession of a good estate which makes amends for many defects  He has a turn  it is said  to the well managing of it  and nobody understands his own interest better than he  by which knowlege  he has opportunities to lay obligations upon many of those  who behind his back think themselves intitled  by their supposed superior sense  to deride him  And he is ready enough to oblige in this way  But it is always on such securities  that he has never given cause for spendthrifts to laugh at him on that account   It is thought that the friends of the fair Cantillon would not be averse to an alliance with this gentleman  While I  were I his sister  should rather wish  that he had so much wisdom in his weakness  as to devote himself to the worthier Pulcheria Clements  Lady Betty s wish as well as mine  whose fortune  tho  not despicable  and whose humbler views  would make her think herself repaid the obligation she would lay him under  by her acceptance of him   No body  it seems  thinks of an husband for Miss Barnevelt  She is sneeringly spoken of rather as a young fellow  than as a woman  and who will one day look out for a wife for herself  One reason indeed  she every where gives  for being satisfied with being a woman  which is  that she cannot be married to a WOMAN   An odd creature  my dear  But see what women get by going out of character  Like the Bats in the fable  they are look d upon as mortals of a doubtful species  hardly owned by either  and laugh d at by both   This was the company  and all the company  besides us  that Lady Betty expected  But mutual civilities had hardly passed  when Lady Betty  having been called out  return d  introducing  as a gentleman  who would be acceptable to every one  Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  He is  whisper d she to me  as he   54 saluted the rest of the company  in a very gallant manner  a young Baronet of a very large estate  the greatest part of which has lately come to him by the death of a grandmother  and two uncles  all very rich   When he was presented to me  by name  and I to him  I think myself very happy  said he  in being admitted to the presence of a young Lady  so celebrated for her graces of person and mind  Then  addressing himself to Lady Betty  Much did I hear  when I was at the last Northampton races  of Miss Byron  But little did I expect to find report fall so short of what I see   Miss Cantillon bridled  play d
