 I called for a Bible  and  since this world was incapable   of a drop of consolation  I wished to know if the next had any   in store      As I read  the whole of the letter and of the facts contained   therein appeared as so many seals and veils that removed from   before my eyes  and discovered depths under depths  and heavens   above heavens  to my amazed apprehension  I had no vision  no   revelation of these matters   but the conviction was impressed as   strongly on my soul as though an angel of God himself had re    vealed them to me      How this came to pass I know not  Homer gives to his heroes   a sight into futurity  at the time that their spirits are breaking   away from the shackles of flesh and blood   and it is not unlikely   that the eye of the soul  when wholly turned from all carnal and   earthly objects  can penetrate with the greater scope and clarity   into concerns that are merely celestial and divine      I have now told you the whole of my dreary history  my friends    till I met with our Harry   and the rest our Harry can tell      But Harry was in no manner of vein at present for entertaining    or receiving entertainment  from any one  His eyes were swelled   with weeping  his spirits totally depressed  and getting up  as   with the burden of fourscore years on his shoulders  he retired   slowly and silently to his apartment      On an evening  after coffee  as the earl stood fondly fooling with   his Harry  as one child with another  he turned to Mr  Clinton    and said How came it to pass  my brother  that Jesus suffered   near four thousand years to elapse before he became incarnate for   the salvation of the world  although it was by him alone that the   world could be saved       We may as well demand of God  said Mr  Clinton  why he suffered   near four days of creation to elapse before he compacted yon   glorious body of far beaming light   for this matter was barely   a type  and the sun himself but a shadow of the Christ that was to   come  But did the world want light before light became incor    porated in its illustrious circumscription  No  my lord  Jesus    who was from eternity the illumination of the dark immensity of         394 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      nature   Jesus  who alone is the living light of spirit  soul  and   sentiment  the perpetual fountain of the streams of beauty and   truth  he said Let there be light  and instantly  through the   darkness of a ruined world  the internity of his ever living light   kindled up an externity of corporal irradiation  that has its effluence   from him  and cannot be but by him      Now as a day is as a thousand years  and a thousand years as a   day  in the sight of God  you see that the fourth day of creation    wherein the light of this outward world was compacted into the   glorious body of the sun  precisely answers to the four thousandth   year wherein Jesus  the light of eternity  was to become embodied   and incarnate in Christ the son of righteousness      But as the world wanted not light before the sun opened his first   morning in the east   neither did it want the means of salvation   before the blessed doctrine of Messiah was promulged upon earth       All sorts of sectarians  all persons of selfish and little minds    would make a monopoly of the Saviour  they would shut him   up into a conventicle  and say to their God  Thus far shalt thou   go  and no farther   But he is not so to be confined  The spirit of   our Jesus bloweth wide and where he listeth   and he is at once both   the purifier and redeemer  as well of all nations  as also of all nature      Accordingly we see that the Turks  who are wholly unblessed by   true religion or liberty  who live the slaves of slaves  without a form   of civil government  temporally subjected to the will of a tyrant    and spiritually to the worship of a sensual impostor  yet want not the   feelings of our Jesus in their heart      Even the wild Indians  who never listened to the toll of a bell    nor ever were called into any court of civil judicature  these want   not their attachments  their friendships  their family feelings  nor
