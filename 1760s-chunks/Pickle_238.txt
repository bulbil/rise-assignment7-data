associates  This motion of his furnished my woman with an opportunity of  making her retreat  and  when he returned at night  the coast was clear   and he found nobody in the house  but a porter  who had been left to  take care of the furniture  He was so enraged at this disappointment   that he made a furious noise  which raised the whole neighbourhood   reinforced his crew with the authority of a justice of the peace   tarried in the street till three o clock in the morning  discharged a  lodging he had hired at a barber s shop opposite to the house from which  I had escaped  and retired with the comfortable reflection of having  done everything which a man could do to retrieve me    The hurry of spirits and surprise I had undergone in effecting this  retreat  produced such a disorder in my constitution  that I began  to fear I should be delivered before I could be provided with the  necessaries for the occasion  I signified my apprehension to Mr     6 22 15  3 45 PM   S    who  with infinite care and concern  endeavoured to find a more  convenient place  and  after all his inquiries  was obliged to fix upon  a paltry apartment in the city  though his tenderness was extremely  shocked at the necessity of choosing it  However  there was no remedy   nor time to be lost  To this miserable habitation I was carried in a  hackney coach  and  though extremely ill  bore my fate with spirit and  resignation  in testimony of my sincere and indelible attachment to  my lover  for whose case and pleasure  I could have suffered every  inconvenience  and even sacrificed my life    Immediately after I had taken possession of my wretched apartment  I  was constrained by my indisposition to go to bed  and send for necessary  help  and in a few hours a living pledge of my love and indiscretion saw  the light  though the terrors and fatigue I had undergone had affected  this little innocent so severely  that it scarce discovered any  visible signs of life  My grief at this misfortune was inexpressible  I  forthwith despatched a message to the dear  the anxious father  who flew  to my arms  and shared my sorrow  with all the gentleness of love  and parental fondness  yet our fears were  for that time  happily  disappointed by the recovery of our infant daughter  who was committed  to the charge of a nurse in the neighbourhood  so that I could every day  be satisfied in my inquiries about her health  Thus I continued a whole  fortnight in a state of happiness and tranquility  being blessed with  the conversation and tender offices of my admirer  whose love and  attention I wholly engrossed  In a word  he gave up all business and  amusement  and concentrated all his care and assiduity in ministering to  my ease and satisfaction  and sure I had no cause to regret what I had  suffered on his account    But this my agreeable situation was one day disturbed by a most  alarming accident  by which my life was drawn into imminent danger  The  room under my bed chamber took fire  I immediately smelt it  and saw the  people about me in the utmost perplexity and consternation  though they  would not own the true cause of their confusion  lest my health should  suffer in the fright  Nevertheless  I was so calm in my inquiries  that  they ventured to tell me my suspicion was but too just  upon which I  gave such directions as I thought would secure me from catching cold   in case there should be a necessity for removing me  but the fire being  happily extinguished  I escaped that ceremony  which might have cost me  my life  Indeed  it was surprising that the agitation of my spirits did  not produce some fatal effect upon my constitution  and I looked upon my  deliverance as the protection of a particular providence    Though I escaped the hazard of a sudden removal  I found it was high  time to change my lodgings  because the neighbours rushing into the  house  upon the alarm of fire  had discovered my situation  though they  were ignorant of my name  and I did not think myself safe in being  the subject of their conjectures  Mr  S    therefore  procured another  compartment  with better accommodation  to which I was carried as soon  as my health would admit of my removal  and soon after my lord wrote  to me by the hands of my lawyer  earnestly entreating me to drop my  prosecution  and come home  but I would not comply with his request  and  nothing was farther from my intention than the desire of receiving any  favours at his hands    Thus repulsed  he set on foot a most accurate search for my person  in  the course of which he is said to have detected several ladies and young    6 22 15  3 45 PM   girls
