  Your dutiful and honest DAUGHTER                LETTER XII         DEAR MOTHER       Well  I will now proceed with my sad story  And so  after I had dried   my eyes  I went in  and began to ruminate with myself what I had best to   do  Sometimes I thought I would leave the house and go to the next   town  and wait an opportunity to get to you  but then I was at a loss to   resolve whether to take away the things he had given me or no  and how   to take them away  Sometimes I thought to leave them behind me  and only   go with the clothes on my back  but then I had two miles and a half    and a byway  to the town  and being pretty well dressed  I might come to   some harm  almost as bad as what I would run away from  and then may be    thought I  it will be reported  I have stolen something  and so was   forced to run away  and to carry a bad name back with me to my dear   parents  would be a sad thing indeed   O how I wished for my grey russet   again  and my poor honest dress  with which you fitted me out   and hard   enough too it was for you to do it   for going to this place  when I   was not twelve years old  in my good lady s days  Sometimes I thought of   telling Mrs  Jervis  and taking her advice  and only feared his command   to be secret  for  thought I  he may be ashamed of his actions  and   never attempt the like again  And as poor Mrs  Jervis depended upon him    through misfortunes  that had attended her  I thought it would be a sad   thing to bring his displeasure upon her for my sake       In this quandary  now considering  now crying  and not knowing what to   do  I passed the time in my chamber till evening  when desiring to be   excused going to supper  Mrs  Jervis came up to me  and said  Why must I   sup without you  Pamela  Come  I see you are troubled at something  tell   me what is the matter       I begged I might be permitted to be with her on nights  for I was afraid   of spirits  and they would not hurt such a good person as she  That   was a silly excuse  she said  for why was not you afraid of spirits   before    Indeed I did not think of that   But you shall be my   bed fellow with all my heart  added she  let your reason be what it   will  only come down to supper  I begged to be excused  for  said I    I have been crying so  that it will be taken notice of by my   fellow servants  and I will hide nothing from you  Mrs  Jervis  when we   are alone       She was so good to indulge me  but made haste to come up to bed  and   told the servants  that I should be with her  because she could not   rest well  and would get me to read her to sleep  for she knew I loved   reading  she said       When we were alone  I told her all that had passed  for I thought    though he had bid me not  yet if he should come to know I had told  it   would be no worse  for to keep a secret of such a nature  would be  as   I apprehended  to deprive myself of the good advice which I never wanted   more  and might encourage him to think I did not resent it as I ought    and would keep worse secrets  and so make him do worse by me  Was I   right  my dear mother       Mrs  Jervis could not help mingling tears with my tears  for I cried all   the time I was telling her the story  and begged her to advise me what   to do  and I shewed her my dear father s two letters  and she praised   the honesty and editing of them  and said pleasing things to me of you   both  But she begged I would not think of leaving my service  for    said she  in all likelihood  you behaved so virtuously  that he will   be ashamed of what he has done  and never offer the like to you again    though  my dear Pamela  said she  I fear more for your prettiness than
