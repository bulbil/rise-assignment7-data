the most careful governante     I once thought  yes  that I did  Miss Nancy  how you had a better spirit  and a more politer taste  than to coquet it with a player—mercy upon us  what is our family fallen too  if this is the case  and so you re in love with the fellow  are you  I say  love too  I ll tell you what  child  when once any fine woman  like you  condescends to give her company to people of fashion  who can pay her well for it  why there s no harm done—but for a lady to fall in love  it s just like a tradesman dealing all upon honour  they had better shut up shop at once  my dear     Miss ANN   Lord  Madam  how you talk  as if I ever loved a man in my life  you know I never did  and yet you know I have had as fine men   Page  141  as ever put laced cloaths on  and did I ever love any of um  how should I  I have had too many and seen too much of them  to love them▪ Indeed  I used to tell them I did  what then  that was no more than rehearsing one s part you know — as to love—why now  Madam  you know you have gone out a nursing  and have a sweet creature it was  and yet at the same time it was ready to make you sick  Why so it is with us girls of the town  we kiss men  and fondle them  and make babies of them  and tell them they are sweet creatures  and yet  at the same time  they make us almost sick—what then  it don t last long  and though the service may be hard  it s soon over  and if the wages are good  what does it signify     GOVERNESS   But who would receive wages from a player     Miss ANN   Why  now  didn t you but yesterday read in one of those six penny blue covered books  there  that we take in monthly  and a charming libry they make  that s certain  — how that a great Roman Catholic Emperor  laid a tax upon peoples making water  and how his son found fault with him for it  because it was a base thing  and didn t the father  as the book says  take up a piece of gold that was gathered by the tax  and bid his son examine  if it smelt of chamber ly  So  madam  what does it signify  if we girls can but get money  who it  Page  142  comes from  do you think my mercer can tell one body s guinea from another     GOVERNESS   Yes  child  but what guineas can you get from a show man     Miss ANN   Why  mun  he no more minds money  than I do modesty  but will give it away as unconcerned  as I do my hair combings  Besides ma am  the case is this  I shan t always look so well as I do now  for these cursed washes I use  for all they do give one s neck and face such a fine whiteness  yet they make one s skin in a morning  look all crumpled  like a washer woman s fingers  and turns one s flesh as yellow  as a pease pudding  Now  you must know  that this young fellow  Ned  will always have a good salary from the Playhouse  because he is devilish comical  to be sure  tho  he has not all the wit in the world neither—what then — the fitter for my purpose—if I can but persuade him to marry me—why shouldn t I be made an honest woman of  and I will too — I have got some money  and I d give it all  if I could but be made an honest woman  for it don t signify talking  but I can no more look a modest woman in the face  as I should do  than I can say my prayers  I wonder what s the meaning of it  however  I don t despair   cause I know Ned s but a Nicodemus  and a girl may get him to do any thing  we are to sup together to night     Page  143  GOVERNESS   Are ye  then I suppose you are to go to bed together to night  but not at my house  Nan—no  by all that s honourable  I never will consent to so undervaluement a connection —A player  lye with my relation —no — as to your having an intrigue with a man of fashion  why it s what no lady need be ashamed of  and indeed few are—for that s natural  and therefore no sin in it  but shall any of our family  ever stoop so low  as to lay the cloath for an actor s ordinary  I detest such business  But see  there s Harris from the Shakespear at the door  some gentleman has sent for you
