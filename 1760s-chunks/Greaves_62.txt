of the family thinks his interest is concerned in supporting the imposture  The melancholy produced from her confinement  and the vivacity of her resentment under ill usage  were  by the address of Anthony  and the prepossession of his domestics  perverted into the effects of insanity  and the same interpretation was strained upon her most indifferent words and actions   The tidings of Miss Darnel s disorder was carefully circulated in whispers  and soon reached the ears of Mr  Sycamore  who was not at all pleased with the information  From his knowledge of Anthony s disposition  he suspected the truth of the report  and  unwilling to see such a prize ravished as it were from his grasp  he  with the advice and assistance of his myrmidons  resolved to set the captive at liberty  in full hope of turning the adventure to his own advantage  for he argued in this manner â€” If she is in fact compos mentis  her gratitude will operate in my behalf  and even prudence will advise her to embrace the proffered asylum from the villany of her uncle  If she is really disordered  it will be no great difficulty to deceive her into marriage  and then I become her trustee of course    The plan was well conceived  but Sycamore had not discretion enough to keep his own counsel  From weakness and vanity  he blabbed the design  which in a little time was communicated to Anthony Darnel  and he took his precautions accordingly  Being infirm in his own person  and consequently unfit for opposing the violence of some desperadoes  whom he knew to be the satellites of Sycamore  he prepared a private retreat for his ward at the house of an old gentleman  the companion of his youth  whom he had imposed upon with the fiction of her being disordered in her understanding  and amused with a story of a dangerous design upon her person  Thus cautioned and instructed  the gentleman had gone with his own coach and servants to receive Aurelia and her governante at a third house  to which she had been privately removed from her uncle s habitation  and in this journey it was that she had been so accidentally protected from the violence of the robbers by the interposition and prowess of our adventurer   As he did not wear his helmet in that exploit  she recognised his features as he passed the coach  and  struck with the apparition  shrieked aloud  She had been assured by her guardian that his design was to convey her to her own house  but perceiving in the sequel that the carriage struck off upon a different road  and finding herself in the hands of strangers  she began to dread a much more disagreeable fate  and conceived doubts and ideas that filled her tender heart with horror and affliction  When she expostulated with the duenna  she was treated like a changeling  admonished to be quiet  and reminded that she was under the direction of those who would manage her with a tender regard to her own welfare  and the honour of her family  When she addressed herself to the old gentleman  who was not much subject to the emotions of humanity  and besides firmly persuaded that she was deprived of her reason  he made no answer  but laid his finger on his mouth by way of enjoining silence   This mysterious behaviour aggravated the fears of the poor hapless young lady  and her terrors waxed so strong  that when she saw Tom Clarke  whose face she knew  she called aloud for assistance  and even pronounced the name of his patron Sir Launcelot Greaves  which she imagined might stimulate him the more to attempt something for her deliverance   The reader has already been informed in what manner the endeavours of Tom and his uncle miscarried  Miss Darnel s new keeper having in the course of his journey halted for refreshment at the Black Lion  of which being landlord  he believed the good woman and her family were entirely devoted to his will and pleasure  Aurelia found an opportunity of speaking in private to Dolly  who had a very prepossessing appearance  She conveyed a purse of money into the hands of this young woman  telling her  while the tears trickled down her cheeks  that she was a young lady of fortune  in danger  as she apprehended  of assassination  This hint  which she communicated in a whisper while the governante stood at the other end of the room  was sufficient to interest the compassionate Dolly in her behalf  As soon as the coach departed  she made her mother acquainted with the transaction  and as they naturally concluded that the young lady expected their assistance  they resolved to approve themselves worthy of her confidence   Dolly having enlisted in their design a trusty countryman  one of her own professed admirers  they set out together for the house of the gentleman in which the fair prisoner was confined  and waited for her in secret at the end of a pleasant park  in which they naturally concluded she might be indulged with the privilege of taking the air  The event justified their conception  on the very first day of their watch they saw her approach  accompanied by her duenna  Dolly and her attendant immediately tied their horses to a stake  and retired into a thicket  which Aurelia did not fail to enter
