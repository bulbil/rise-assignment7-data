the manner of modern voyagers   Having heard much of Kentish Town  I conceived a strong desire to see that celebrated place  I could have wish d indeed to satisfy my curiosity without going thither  but that was impracticable  and therefore I resolved to go  Travellers have two methods of going to Kentish Town  they take coach which costs nine pence  or they may go a foot which costs nothing  in my opinion  a coach is by far the most eligible convenience  but I was resolved to go on foot  having considered with my self  that going in that manner would be the cheapest way   As you set out from Dog house bar  you enter upon a fine level road railed in on both sides  commanding on the right a fine prospect of groves  and fields  enamelled with flowers  which would wonderfully charm the sense of smelling  were it not for a dunghill on the left  which mixes its effluvia with their odours  This dunghill is of much greater antiquity than the road  and I must not omit a piece of injustice I was going to commit upon this occasion  My indignation was levelled against the makers of the dunghill for having brought it so near the road  whereas it should have fallen upon the makers of the road for having brought that so near the dunghill   After proceeding in this manner for some time  a building resembling somewhat a triumphal arch salutes the traveller s view  This structure however   232 is peculiar to this country  and vulgarly call d a turnpike gate  I could perceive a long inscription in large characters on the front  probably upon the occasion of some triumph  but being in haste I left it to be made out by some subsequent adventurer who may happen to travel this way  so continuing my course to the west  I soon arrived at an unwalled town called Islington   Islington is a pretty neat town  mostly built of brick  with a church and bells  It has a small lake  or rather pond in the midst  tho  at present very much neglected  I am told it is dry in summer  if this be the case  it can be no very proper receptacle for fish  of which the inhabitants themselves seem sensible  by bringing all that is eaten there from London   After having surveyed the curiosities of this fair and beautiful town I proceeded forward  leaving a fair stone building called the White Conduit House on my right  here the inhabitants of London often assemble to celebrate a feast of hot rolls and butter  seeing such numbers  each with their little tables before them  employed on this occasion  must no doubt be a very amusing sight to the looker on  but still more so to those who perform in the solemnity   From hence I parted with reluctance to Pancrass  as it is written  or Pancridge as it is pronounced  but which should be both pronounced and written Pangrace  This emendation I will venture meo arbitrio  〈 in non Latin alphabet 〉 in the Greek language   233 signifies all  which added to the English word grace  maketh all grace  or Pangrace  and indeed this is a very proper appellation to a place of so much sanctity as Pangrace is universally esteemed  However this be  if you except the parish church and its fine bells  there is little in Pangrace worth the attention of the curious observer   From Pangrace to Kentish town is an easy journey of one mile and a quarter  The road lies through a fine champain country  well watered with beautiful drains  and enamelled with flowers of all kinds  which might contribute to charm every sense  were it not that the odoriferous gales are often more impregnated with dust than perfume   As you enter Kentish town  the eye is at once presented with the shops of artificers  such as venders of candles  small coal  and hair brooms  there are also several august buildings of red brick  with numberless sign posts  or rather pillars  in a peculiar order of architecture  I send you a drawing of several  vide A  B  C  This pretty town probably borrows its name from its vicinity to the county of Kent  And indeed it is not unnatural that it should  as there are only London and the adjacent villages that lie between them  Be this as it will  perceiving night approach I made a hasty repast on roasted mutton  and a certain dried fruit called potatoes  resolving to protract my remarks upon my return  And this I would very willingly have done  but was prevented by a circumstance which in truth I had for some time foreseen  for night coming   234 on  it was impossible to take a proper survey of the country  as I was obliged to return home in the dark   Adieu   LETTER CXIX  To the same   AFTER a variety of disapointments  my wishes are at length fully satisfied  My son so long expected is arrived  at once  by his presence banishing my anxiety  and opening a new scene of unexpected pleasure  His improvements in mind and person have far surpass d even the sanguine expectations of a father  I left him a boy  but he is returned a man
