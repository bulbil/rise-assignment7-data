I told them the contents of the Letters  as we walked   They were greatly affected  as I thought they would be  which made me lead them out  Lord G  joined us in our walk  as well as in our concern  so that the dear Harriet had none but comforters left about her  who enabled her to support her spirits  for Mrs  Shirley and Mrs  Selby had always applauded the preference their beloved child was so ready to give to Clementina  because of her malady  tho  it is evident  against their wishes  There never were three nobler women related to each other than Mrs  Shirley  Mrs  Selby  and Miss Byron  But Mr  Selby is by no means satisfied  that my brother  loving Harriet  as he evidently does  should be so ready to leave her  and go to Italy  His censure arises from his Love to my brother and to his niece  But I need not tell you  that  tho  a man Page  110 he has not a soul half so capacious as that of either of the three Ladies I have named   At our return from our little walk  it was lovely to see Harriet take her Emily aside  to comfort her  and to plead with her in favour of my brother s obligations  as afterwards she did against her uncle  How the generous creature shone in my eyes  and in those of every one present   When she and I were alone  she took grateful notice of the concluding part of the third Letter  where she is mentioned with so much tenderness  and in a manner so truly worthy of the character of the politest of men  as well respecting herself as her Sex  charging himself with vanity and presumption  but to suppose to himself  that Miss Byron wanted his compassion  or had the tender regard for him  that he avows for her  She pleased herself  that he had not seen the very great esteem she had for him  as you and I had done  And how could he  you know  said she  for he and I were not often together  and I was under obligation enough to him to make him attribute my regard to gratitude  But it is plain  proceeded she  that he loves the poor Harriet—Don t you think so  and perhaps would have given her a preference to all other women  had he not been circumstanced as he was  Well  God bless him  added she  he was my first Love  and I never will have any other—Don t blame me for this declaration  my dear Lady G  My Grandmamma  as well as you  once chid me for saying so  and called me romancer—But is not the man Sir Charles Grandison   But  alas  with all these appearances  it is easy to see  that this amiable creature s solitary hours are heavy ones  She has got a habit of sighing  She rises with swelled eyes  Sleep forsakes her  Her appetite fails  And she is very sensible of all this  as she shews  by the pains she takes to conceal the alteration   And must Harriet Byron  blessed with beauty so Page  111 unequalled  health so blooming  a temper so even  passions so governable  generous and grateful  even to heroism —Superior to every woman in frankness of heart  in true delicacy  and in an understanding and judgment beyond her years—Must she be offered up  as a victim on the altar of hopeless Love —I deprecate such a fate —I cannot allow the other Sex such a triumph  tho  the man be my brother  It is  however  none  on the contrary  it is apparently a grief to his noble and truly manly heart  that so excellent a creature cannot be the sole mistress of it   Mr  Deane came hither this morning  He is a valuable man  He opened his heart to me about an hour ago  He always  he says  designed Miss Byron for the heiress of the principal part of his possessions  and he let me know his circumstances  which are great  It is  I am convinced  true policy to be good  Young and old  rich and poor  dote upon Miss Byron  You remember what her uncle says in his ludicrous Letter to her  covertly praising her  by pretending to find fault with her  that he is more noted for being the uncle of Miss Byron  than she is for being his niece  tho  of so long standing in the county  And I assure you  he is much respected too  But such beauty  such affability  a character so benevolent  so frank  so pious  yet so chearful and unaffected  as hers is  must command the veneration and love of every one   Mr  Deane is extremely apprehensive of her declineing health  He believes her in a consumption  and has brought a physician of his intimate acquaintance to visit her  But she  and we all are convinced  that medicine will not reach her case  And she affected to be startled at his supposing she was in so bad a way  on purpose  as she owned  to avoid his kind importunity to
