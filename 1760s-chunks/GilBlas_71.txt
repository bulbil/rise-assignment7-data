folks  With this hint  the old procuress waddled out of sight   You may be sure this message put me in no small flutter  Where now was the morality of Marcos  I waited for night with impatience  and  calculating the time of Dr Oloroso s going to bed  took my station at his door  There I set up my caterwauling  till you might hear me ever so far off  to the eternal honour of the master who instructed me in that imitative art  A moment after Mergelina opened the door softly with her own dear hands  and shut it again with me on the inside  We went into the hall  where our last concert had been performed  It was dimly lighted by a small lamp  which twinkled in the chimney  We sat down side by side  and began our tender parley  each of us overcome by our emotions  but with this difference  that hers were all inspired by pleasure  while mine were somewhat tainted by fear  In vain did the divinity of my adorations assure me that we had nothing to fear from her husband  I felt the access of an ague  which unmanned my vigour  Madam  said I  how have you eluded the vigilance of your directress  After what I have heard of Dame Melancia  I could not have conceived it possible for you to contrive the means of sending me any intelligence  much less of seeing me in private  Donna Mergelina smiled at this remark  and answered  You will no longer be surprised at our being together to night  when I tell you what has passed between my duenna and me  As soon as she came to her place  my husband paid her a thousand compliments  and said to me  Mergelina  I consign you to the guidance of this wary lady  herself an abstract of all the virtues  in this glass you may look without a blush  and array yourself in habits of wisdom  This extraordinary personage has for these twelve years been a light to the ways of an apothecary s wife of my acquaintance  but how has she been a light to them     why  as ways never were enlightened before  she turned a very slippery piece of mortal flesh into a downright nun   This panegyric  not belied by the austere mien of Dame Melancia  cost me a flood of tears  and reduced me to despair  I fancied the din of eternal lectures from morning till night  and daily rebukes too harsh to be endured  In short  I laid my account in a life of wretchedness  beyond the patience of a woman  Keeping no measures in the expectation of such cruel sufferings  I said bluntly to the duenna  the moment I was alone with her  You mean  no doubt  to exercise your tyranny most wantonly on my poor person  but I cannot bear much severity  I warn you before hand  I give you  moreover  fair notice  that I shall be as savage as you can be  My heart cherishes a passion  which not all your remonstrances shall tear from it  so you may act accordingly  Watch me as closely as you please  it is hard if I cannot outwit such an old thing as you  At these taunting words  I thought this saracen in petticoats was going to give me a specimen of her discipline  But so far from it  she smoothed her brow  relaxed her surly features  and primming up her mouth into a smile  promulgated this comfortable doctrine  Your temper charms me  and your frankness calls for a return  We must have been made for one another  Ah  lovely Mergelina  little do you fathom my character  to be deceived by the fine compliments of your husband the Doctor  or by my Tartar contour  There never was a creature more fortified against moral prejudices  My inducement for getting into the service of jealous husbands is to lend myself to the enjoyments of their pretty wives  Long have I trodden the stage of life in masquerade  and I may call myself doubly happy  in the spiritual rewards of virtue  and the temporal indulgences of the opposite side  Between ourselves  mine is the system of all mankind in the long run  Real virtue is a very expensive article  plated goods look just as well  and are within the reach of all purchasers   Put yourself under my direction  We will make Doctor Oloroso pay the piper to our dancing  or I am no duenna  By my troth  he shall go the way of Signor Apuntador and all mankind  There is no reason why the forehead of a physician should be smoother than the brow of an apothecary  Poor dear Apuntador  What fun have we had with him  his wife and I  A charming woman  that wife of his  A dear little creature  open to all mankind  and prejudiced by none  Well  she is at peace  and has not left her fellow behind her  Take my word  short as her time was  she made the most of it  Let me see how many rampant chaps have been brought to their bearings in that house  without the dear deluded husband being waked out of his evening s nap  Now  madam
