I think I could have preferred    with her  any condition that could have befallen me  had I considered   only myself  But  sir  I was very far from having any encouragement to   expect her favour  and I had much more reason to believe  that  if she   could have hoped for your goodness  her heart would have been too much   pre engaged to think of any body else  And give me leave further to   say  sir  that  though I tell you sincerely my thoughts  were I only to   consider myself  yet  when I consider her good  and her merit  I should   be highly ungenerous  were it put to my choice  if I could not wish her   in a condition so much superior to what I could raise her to  and so   very answerable to her merit       Pamela  said my master  you are obliged to Mr  Williams  and ought to   thank him  He has distinguished well  But  as for me  who had like to   have lost you by his means  I am glad the matter was not left to his   choice  Mr  Williams  added he  I give you Pamela s hand  because I know   it will be pleasing to her  in token of her friendship and esteem for   you  and I give you mine  that I will not be your enemy  but yet I must   say  that I think I owe this proper manner of your thinking more to your   disappointment  than to the generosity you talk of       Mr  Williams kissed my hand  as my master gave it him  and my master   said  Sir  you will go home and dine with me  and I ll shew you my   little chapel  and do you  Pamela  look upon yourself at liberty to   number Mr  Williams in the list of your friends       How generous  how noble  was this  Mr  Williams  and so had I  had tears   of pleasure in his eyes  I was silent  But Mr  Williams said  Sir  I   shall be taught  by your generosity  to think myself inexcusably wrong    in every step I took  that could give you offence  and my future life   shall shew my respectful gratitude       We walked on till we came to the coach  where was my dear father    Pamela  said my master  tell Mr  Williams who that good man is  O  Mr    Williams  said I  it is my dear father  and my master was pleased to   say  One of the honestest men in England  Pamela owes every thing that   she is to be  as well as her being  to him  for  I think  she would not   have brought me to this  nor made so great resistance  but for the good   lessons  and religious education  she had imbibed from him       Mr  Williams said  taking father s hand  You see  good Mr  Andrews  with   inexpressible pleasure  no doubt  the fruits of your pious care  and now   are in a way  with your beloved daughter  to reap the happy effects of   it   I am overcome  said my dear father  with his honour s goodness  But   I can only say  I bless God  and bless him       Mr  Williams and I being nearer the coach than my master  and he   offering to draw back  to give way to him  he kindly said  Pray  Mr    Williams  oblige Pamela with your hand  and step in yourself  He bowed    and took my hand  and my master made him step in  and sit next me  all   that ever he could do  and sat himself over against him  next my father    who sat against me       And he said  Mr  Andrews  I told you yesterday that the divine you saw   was not Mr  Williams  I now tell you  this gentleman is  and though I   have been telling him  I think not myself obliged to his intentions  yet   I will own that Pamela and you are  and though I won t promise to love   him  I would have you       Sir  said Mr  Williams  you have a way of overcoming  that hardly all   my reading affords an instance of  and it is the more noble  as it is   on this side  as I presume  the happy ceremony  which  great as your   fortune is  will lay you under an obligation to so much virtue and   beauty  when the lady becomes yours  for you
