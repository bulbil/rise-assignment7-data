my dear Lady Beauchamp   said I  lifting her hand to my lips  permit me to give you joy  All doubts and misgivings so triumphantly got over  so solid a foundation laid for family harmony —What was the moment of your nuptials to this  Sir Harry  I congratulate you  You may  and I believe you have been  as happy as most men  but now  you will be still happier   Indeed  Sir Harry  said she  you provoked me in the morning  I should not else—  Sir Harry own d himself to blame  and thus the Lady s pride was set down softly   She desired Sir Harry to write  before the Day concluded  the invitation of return  to Mr  Beauchamp  and to do her all the credit in it that she might claim from the last part of the conversation  but not to mention any thing of the first   She afterwards abated a little of this right spirit  by saying  I think  Sir Harry  you need not mention anything of the arrears  as I may call them—But only the future 600 l  a year  One would surprize him a little  you know  and be twice thanked—  Surprizes of such a nature as this  my dear Dr  Bartlett  pecuniary surprizes —I don t love them—They are double taxes upon the gratitude of a worthy heart  Is it not enough for a generous mind to labour under a sense of obligation —Pride  vain glory  must be the motive of such narrow minded benefactors  A truly beneficent spirit cannot take delight in beholding the quivering lip indicating the palpitating heart  in seeing the downcast countenance  the up lifted hands  and working muscles  of a fellow creature  who  but for unfortunate accidents  would perhaps himself have had the will with the power of shewing a more graceful benevolence   I was so much afraid of hearing farther abatements of Lady Beauchamp s goodness  so willing to depart with favourable impressions of her for her own sake    38 and at the same time so desirous to reach the Hall that night  that I got myself excused  though with difficulty  staying to dine  and  accepting of a dish of chocolate  I parted with Sir Harry and my Lady  both in equal good humour with themselves and me   Could you have thought  my dear friend  that I should have succeeded so very happily  as I have done  in this affair  and at one meeting   I think that the father and step mother should have the full merit with our Beauchamp of a turn so unexpected  Let him not therefore ever see this letter  that he may take his impression of the favour done him  from that which Sir Harry will write to him   My cousin Grandison  whom I hoped to find here  left the Hall on Tuesday last  tho  he knew of my intention to be down  I am sorry for it  Poor Everard  He has been a great while pretty good  I am afraid he will get among his old acquaintance  and then we shall not hear of him for some months perhaps  If you see him in town  try to engage him  till I return  I should be glad of his company to Paris  if his going with me  will keep him out of harm s way  as it is called   Saturday  April 1   I HAVE had compliments sent me by many of my neighbours  who had hoped I was come to reside among them  They professed themselves disappointed on my acquainting them  that I must go up early on Monday morning  I have invited myself to their Saturday Assembly at the Bowling green house   Our reverend friend Mr  Dobson has been so good as to leave with me the Sermon he is to preach tomorrow on the opening of the church  It is a very good discourse  I have only exceptions to three or four compliments he makes to the patron  in as many different places of it  I doubt not but he will have the goodness to omit them   I have already looked into all that has been done in   39 the church  and all that is doing in the house and gardens  When both have had the direction and inspection of my dear Dr  Bartlett  need I say  that nothing could have been better   HALDEN is just arrived from my Lord  with a Letter  which has enabled me to write to Lady Mansfield his Lordship s high approbation of all our proceedings  and that he intends some one early day in next week to pay to her  and Miss Mansfield  his personal compliments   He has left to me the article of Settlements  declaring  that his regard for my future interest is all that he wishes may be attended to   I have therefore written as from himself  that he proposes a jointure of 1200 l  a year  peny rents  and 400 guineas a year for her private purse  and that his Lordship desires  that Miss Mansfield will make a present to her sister of whatever she may be intitled to in her own right  Something was mentioned to me at Mansfield house of a thousand pounds
