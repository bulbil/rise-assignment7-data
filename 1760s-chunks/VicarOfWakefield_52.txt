of a fine country  through which we passed  to observe how much kinder heaven was to us  than we were to each other  and that the misfortunes of nature s making were very few  I assured her  that she should never perceive any change in  Page  56  my affections  and that during my life  which yet might be long  she might depend upon a guardian and an instructor  I armed her against the censures of the world  shewed her that books were sweet unreproaching companions to the miserable  and that if they could not bring us to enjoy life  they would teach us to endure it     The hired horse that we rode was to be put up that night at an inn by the way  within about five miles from my house  and as I was willing to prepare my family for my daughter s reception  I determined to leave her that night at the inn  and to come for her  accompanied by my daughter Sophia  early the next morning  It was night before we reached our appointed stage  however  after seeing her provided with a decent apartment  and having ordered the hostess to prepare proper refreshments  I kissed her  and proceeded towards home  My heart caught new sensations of pleasure  Page  57  the nearer I approached that peaceful mansion  As a bird that has been frighted from its nest  my affections out went my haste  and hovered round my little fire side  with all the rapture of expectation  I called up the many fond things I had to say  and anticipated the welcome I was to receive  I already felt my wife s tender embrace  and smiled at the joy of my little ones  As I walked but slowly  the night wained apace  The labourers of the day were all retired to rest  the lights were out in every cottage  no sounds were heard but of the shrilling cock  and the deep mouthed watch dog  at hollow distance  I approached my little abode of pleasure  and before I was within a furlong of the place  our honest mastiff came running to welcome me     It was now near mid night that I came to knock at my door  all was still and silent  my heart dilated with unutterable happiness   Page  58  when  to my amazement  the house was bursting out in a blaze of fire  and every apperture was red with conflagration  I gave a loud convulsive outcry  and fell upon the pavement insensible  This alarmed my son  who perceiving the flames  instantly waked my wife and daughter  and all running out  naked  and wild with apprehension  recalled me to life with their anguish  But it was only to objects of new terror  for the flames had  by this time  caught the roof of our dwelling  part after part continuing to fall in  while the family stood  with silent agony  looking on  as if they enjoyed the blaze  I gazed upon them and upon it by turns  and then looked round me for my two little ones  but they were not to be seen  O misery      Where    cried I    where are my little ones    —   They are burnt to death in the flames    says my wife calmly    and I will die with them    —That moment I heard the cry of the babes within  who were just awaked  Page  59  by the fire  and nothing could have stopped me    Where  where  are my children    cried I  rushing through the flames  and bursting the door of the chamber in which they were confined    Where are my little ones    —   Here  dear papa  here we are    cried they together  while the flames were just catching the bed where they lay  I caught them both in my arms  and snatched them through the fire as fast as possible  while just as I was got out  the roof sunk in    Now    cried I  holding up my children    now let the flames burn on  and all my possessions perish  Here they are  I have saved my treasure  Here  my dearest  here are our treasures  and we shall yet be happy    We kissed our little darlings a thousand times  they clasped us round the neck  and seemed to share our transports  while their mother laughed and wept by turns   Page  60  I now stood a calm spectator of the flames  and after some time  began to perceive that my arm to the shoulder was scorched in a terrible manner  It was therefore out of my power to give my son any assistance  either in attempting to fave our goods  or preventing the flames spreading to our corn  By this time  the neighbours were alarmed  and came running to our assistance  but all they could do was to stand  like us  spectators of the calamity  My goods  among which were the notes I had reserved for my daughters fortunes  were
