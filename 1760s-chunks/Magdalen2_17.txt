changed the conversation  and asked me if I had any scruple to shew her the colonel s will—I replied  that I could have no scruple to shew her any thing  as I was sensible she could never have a desire that was not founded on the strictest propriety  and therefore immediately produced it from my bosom—   98  My dear   says she    you are very good  and yet be assured I should not make this request on any account  was I not convinced that you wish as cordially as myself that the testator s recovery may prevent the will from being ever carried into execution     Indeed  madam   returned I — Harriot   interrupted she    let minds that doubt each other s candour break out into professions of regard  and sentimental exclamations  it is below us  however  my love  to enter into a vindication of our motives  since any argument to prove them just would be tacitly to acknowlege that it was possible for them to be otherwise  We will not  my dearest girl  even wrong the rectitude of our own principles by implication  nor be the first to deny ourselves that merit which has been hitherto granted us by every   99 body else   —So saying  she opened the will  which is very short  containing little more than a general reason for the colonel s appointing me his heir  and leaving a miniature of himself set in diamonds to his mother  his horses  arms  and watch  to his father  his library to Louisa  a diamond ring to yourself  some trifling remembrances to other friends  and his cloaths and about two hundred pounds among the servants     Short as the will was  my dear mama  I could scarcely stand the shock of reading it  there is something so awful in a will  you know  even where one s self is not concerned  but when it is made by a person for whom one entertains an esteem  when a partiality is absolutely shewn in one s own favour  and when there is another person by  who is infinitely more entitled to a preference  it   100 must be inexpressibly distressing to us if we are not wholly divested of sentiment and delicacy  You cannot  therefore  imagine my confusion  when I found the colonel had left me two thousand pounds in money  the magnificent service of plate  which had been his godfather  Harley s  and the Buckinghamshire estate  which is seven hundred pounds a year  and which was formerly his great aunt Ingoldsby s  Mrs  Mildmay saw my anxiety  and kindly pitied it  restoring me the paper  and acknowleging she had been to blame in suffering her curiosity to carry her so far—   But  my dear Harriot   says she   a mother will pay but little attention to decorum in any thing which concerns the conduct of her children   After this  we had a long conversation about the colonel  in which Mrs  Mildmay seemed so highly pleased with his behaviour to me  that I was somewhat re assured  and   101 had fresh opportunities of admiring the greatness of her generosity  Notwithstanding this  the circumstances of the will rendered me excessive awkward  till we were flattered with some certain hopes of the colonel s recovery  From that moment I breathed a free er air  and considered myself as less an interloper in the family  he is now  thank God  in a very fine way  and has borne the fresh shock of his sister s abrupt departure  with a much greater share of fortitude than could be expected     And now  my dear mama  how do you do  and what do you say to the boldness of your girl  in thus presuming to talk to you upon such a point as the foregoing subject  Do you condemn her of temerity  or approve her for candour  do you imagine that she has grown forward on your indulgence  or do you think that she has made only a   102 proper use of your tenderness  and treated you with the openness which is doubly your due from the closeness of your relation  and the greatness of your indulgence  I wish I knew your sentiments  for  as you have always studied to anticipate every desire of mine  I should be a monster indeed if I hesitated but an instant to comply with your inclinations  The whole family here  my dear mama  are impatient to see you—Mrs  Mildmay longs  she says  to talk with you about the colonel  and you know who—the old gentleman repeatedly tells me  that the value of a friend is only to be experienced in the day of adversity  and the colonel hopes that nothing at the Hall has given you any cause of disgust  Come to us then  dear madam  for your company is greatly wanted  and by none  you may believe  so much as your daughter  the colonel s tenderness oppresses me  the amiable   103 Louisa s fate distracts me  and Mrs  Mildmay s goodness is insupportable  Come then  madam  to her rescue  the arms of maternal affection are always fraught with peace  and  if they bring comfort in proportion to
