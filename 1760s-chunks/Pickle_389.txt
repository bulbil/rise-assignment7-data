the knowledge of this  anecdote  which gave umbrage to his pride  while it stimulated his  desire of doing something in return for the obligation  He inquired into  the present circumstances of the prisoner  and understanding that he was  indisposed  and but indifferently provided with the common necessaries  of life  though still deaf to all offers of assistance  began to be  extremely concerned at the account of this savage obstinacy and pride   which would  he feared  exclude him from the privilege of relieving him  in his distress  However  he resolved to leave no expedient untried   that might have any tendency to surmount such destructive prejudice   and entering the jail  was directed to the apartment of the wretched  prisoner  He knocked softly at the door  and  when it was opened   started back with horror and astonishment  The figure that presented  itself to his view was the remains of his once happy friend  but  so miserably altered and disguised  that his features were scarce  cognisable  The florid  the sprightly  the gay  the elevated youth  was  now metamorphosed into a wan  dejected  meagre  squalid spectre  the  hollow eyed representative of distemper  indigence  and despair  Yet his  eyes retained a certain ferocity  which threw a dismal gleam athwart the  cloudiness of his aspect  and he  in silence  viewed his old companion  with a look betokening confusion and disdain  As for Gauntlet  he could  not  without emotion  behold such a woeful reverse of fate  in a person  for whom he entertained the noblest sentiments of friendship  gratitude   and esteem  his sorrow was at first too big for utterance  and he shed a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   flood of tears before he could pronounce one word   Peregrine  in spite of his misanthropy  could not help being affected  with this uncommon testimony of regard  but he strove to stifle his  sensations  His brows contracted themselves into a severe frown  his  eyes kindled into the appearance of live coals  He waved with his hand  in signal for Godfrey to be gone  and leave such a wretch as him to the  miseries of his fate  and  finding nature too strong to be suppressed   uttered a deep groan  and wept aloud   The soldier  seeing him thus melted  unable to restrain the strong  impulse of his affection  sprung towards  and clasping him in his arms    My dearest friend  and best benefactor   said he   I am come hither to  humble myself for the offence I was so unhappy as to give at our  last parting  to beg a reconciliation  to thank you for the case and  affluence I have enjoyed through your means  and to rescue you  in spite  of yourself  from this melancholy situation  of which  but an hour ago   I was utterly ignorant  Do not deny me the satisfaction of acquitting  myself in point of duty and obligation  You must certainly have had some  regard for a person in whose favour you have exerted yourself so much   and if any part of that esteem remains  you will not refuse him an  opportunity of approving himself in some measure worthy of it  Let  me not suffer the most mortifying of all repulses  that of slighted  friendship  but kindly sacrifice your resentment and inflexibility to  the request of one who is at all times ready to sacrifice his life for  your honour and advantage  If you will not yield to my entreaties  have  some regard to the wishes of my Sophy  who laid me under the strongest  injunctions to solicit your forgiveness  even before she knew how much I  was indebted to your generosity  or  if that consideration should be of  no weight  I hope you will relax a little for the sake of poor Emilia   whose resentment hath been long subdued by her affection  and who now  droops in secret at your neglect    Every word of this address  delivered in the most pathetic manner   made an impression upon the mind of Peregrine  He was affected with the  submission of his friend  who  in reality  had given him no just  cause to complain  He knew that no ordinary motive had swayed him to a  condescension so extraordinary in a man of his punctilious temper  He  considered it  therefore  as the genuine effect of eager gratitude and  disinterested love  and his heart began to relent accordingly  When he  heard himself conjured in the name of the gentle Sophy  his obstinacy  was quite overcome  and when Emilia was recalled to his remembrance   his whole frame underwent a violent agitation  He took his friend by the  hand  with a softened look  and  as soon as he recovered the faculty  of speech  which had been overpowered in the conflict of passions that  transported him  protested  that he retained no vestige of animosity   but considered him in the light of an affectionate comrade  the ties of  whose friendship adversity could not unbind
