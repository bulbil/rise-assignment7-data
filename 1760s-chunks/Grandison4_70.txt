 let him railly   I shall be so much importuned to stay longer than I ought  or will stay  that I may as well fix a peremptory day at once  Will you  my ever indulgent   175 friends  allow me to set out for Selby house on Friday next  Not on a Sunday  as Lady Betty Williams advises  for fear of the odious waggons  But I have been in a different school  Sir Charles Grandison  I find  makes it a tacit rule with him  Never to begin a journey on a Sunday  nor  except when in pursuit of works of mercy or necessity  to travel in time of Divine Service  And this rule he observed last Sunday  tho  he reached us here in the evening  O my grandmamma  How much is he  what you all are  and ever have been —But he is now pursuing a work of mercy  God succeed to him the end of his pursuit   But why tacit  you will ask  Is Sir Charles Grandison ashamed to make an open appearance in behalf of his Christian duties  He is not  For instance  I have never seen him sit down at his own table  in the absence of Dr  Bartlett  or some other clergyman  but he himself says grace  and that with such an easy dignity  as commands every one s reverence  and which is succeeded by a chearfulness that looks as if he were the better pleased for having shewn a thankful heart   Dr  Bartlett has also told me  that he begins and ends every day  either in his Chamber  or in his Study  in a manner worthy of one who is in earnest in his Christian profession  But he never frights gay company with grave maxims  I remember  one day  Mr  Grandison asked him  in his absurd way  Why he did not preach to his Company now and then  Faith  Sir Charles  said he  if you did  you would reform many a poor ignorant sinner of us  since you could do it with more weight  and more certainty of attention  than any parson in Christendom   It would be an affront  said Sir Charles  to the understanding  as well as education  of a man who took rank above a peasant  in such a country as this  to seem to question whether he knew his general duties  or not  and the necessity of practising what he knew   176 of them  If he should be at a loss  he may once a week be reminded  and his heart kept warm  Let you and me  cousin Everard  shew our conviction by our practice  and not invade the clergyman s province   I remember  that Mr  Grandison shewed his conviction by his blushes  and by repeating the three little words  You and me  Sir Charles   Sunday Evening   O MY dear friends  I have a strange  a shocking piece of intelligence to give you  Emily has just been with me in tears  She begged to speak with me in private  When we were alone  she threw her arms about my neck  Ah  madam  said she  I am come to tell you  that there is a person in the world that I hate  and must and will hate  as long as I live  It is Lady Olivia —Take me down with you into Northamptonshire  and never let me see her more   I was surprised   O madam  I have found out  that she would  on Thursday last  have killed my guardian   I was astonished  Lucy   They retired together  you know  madam  My guardian came from her  his face in a glow  and he sent in his sister to her  and went not in himself till afterwards  She would have had him put off his journey  She was enraged because he would not  and they were high together  and at last she pulled out of her stays  in fury  a poniard  and vowed to plunge it into his heart  He should never  she said  see his Clementina more  He went to her  Her heart failed her  Well it might  you know  madam  He seized her hand  He took it from her  She struggled  and in struggling her wrist was hurt  that s the meaning of the broad black ribband —Wicked creature  to have such a thought in her heart —He only said  when he had got it from her  Unhappy  violent woman  I return not this instrument   177 of mischief  You will have no use for it in England—And would not let her have it again   I shuddered  O my dear  said I  he has been a sufferer  we are told  by good women  but this is not a good woman  But can it be true  Who informed you of it   Lady Maffei herself  She thought that Sir Charles must have spoken of it  And when she found he had not  she was sorry she had  and begged I would not tell any body  But I could not keep it from you  And she says
