mysterious dogma of the political creed  Taycho then assured them that the   43 whole army of the Mantchoux was put to the sword  and that Bron xi tic would carry the war within three weeks  into the heart of China  he gave them goblets of horseblood from Myn than  and tickled their ears and their noses  they snorted approbation  licked his toes  and sunk into a profound lethargy   From this  however  they were soon arroused by unwelcome tidings from Fatsisio  Yaff rai had proceeded in his route until he was stopped by a vast lake  which he could not possibly traverse without boats  corkjackets  or some such expedient  which could not be supplied for that campaign  Ya loff had sailed up the river to Quib quab  which he found so strongly fortified by nature  that it seemed rashness even to attempt a landing  especially in the face of an enemy more numerous than his own detachment  Land  however    44 he did  and even attacked a fortified camp of the Chinese  but  in spite of all his efforts  he was repulsed with considerable slaughter  He sent an account of this miscarriage to Taycho  giving him to understand  at the same time  that he had received no intelligence of Yaff rai s motions  that his troops were greatly diminished  that the season was too far advanced to keep the field much longer  and that nothing was left them but a choice of difficulties  every one of which seemed more insurmountable than another  Taycho having deliberated on this subject  thought it was necessary to prepare the monster for the worst that could happen  as he now expected to hear by the first opportunity  that the grand expedition of Fatsisio had totally miscarried  He resolved therefore to throw the blame upon the shoulders of Ya loff and Yaff rai    45 and stigmatize them as the creatures of Fika kaka  who had neither ability to comprehend the instructions he had given  nor resolution to execute the plan he had projected  For this purpose he ascended the rostrum  and with a rueful length of face opened his harangue upon the defeat of Ya loff  The Hydra no sooner understood that the troops of Japan had been discomfited  than it was seized with a kind of hysteric fit  and uttered a yell so loud and horrible  that the blind fold Dairo trembled in the most internal recesses of his palace  the Cuboy Fika kaka had such a profuse evacuation  that the discharge is said to have weighed five Boll ah  equal to eight and forty pounds three ounces and two pennyweight averdupois of Great Britain  Even Taycho himself was discomposed —In vain he presented the draught of yeast  and the goblet   46 of blood —in vain his pipers soothed the ears  and his tall fellows tickled the nose of the blatant beast  It continued to howl and grin  and gnash its teeth  and writhe itself into a thousand contortions  as if it had been troubled with that twisting of the guts called the iliac passion  Taycho began to think its case desperate  and sent for the Dairo s chief physician  who prescribed a glyster of the distilled spirit analogous to your Geneva  but no apothecary nor old woman in Meaco would undertake to administer it on any consideration  the patient was such a filthy  aukward  lubberly  unmanageable beast —   If what comes from its mouths  said they  be so foul  virulent  and pestilential  how nauseous  poisonous  and intolerable must that be which takes the other course    —When Taycho s art and foresight were at a stand  accident   47 came to his assistance  A courier arrived  preceded by twelve postilions blowing horns  and he brought the news that Quib quab was taken  The orator commanded them to place their horns within as many of the monster s long ears  and blow with all their might  until it should exhibit some signs of hearing  The experiment succeeded  The Hydra waking from its trance  opened its eyes  and Taycho seizing this opportunity  hollowed in his loudest tone    Quib quab is taken    This note being repeated  the beast started up  then  raising itself on its hind legs  began to wag its tail  to frisk and fawn  to lick Taycho s sweaty socks  in fine  crouching on its belly  it took the orator on its back  and proceeding through the streets of Meaco  brayed aloud    Make way for the divine Taycho  Make way for the conqueror of Quib quab    —But the gallant   48 Ya loff  the real conqueror of Quib quab  was no more —He fell in the battle by which the conquest was atchieved  yet not before he saw victory declare in his favour  He had made incredible efforts to surmount the difficulties that surrounded him  At length he found means to scale a perpendicular rock  which the enemy had left unguarded  on the supposition that nature had made it inaccessible  This exploit was performed in the night  and in the morning the Chinese saw his troops drawn up in order of battle on the plains of Quib quab  As their numbers greatly exceeded the Japonese  they did not decline the trial  and in a little time
