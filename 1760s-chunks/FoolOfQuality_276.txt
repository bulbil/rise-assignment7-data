and shall we not receive   evil   O Friend and Saviour of sinners   if thou lovest whom thou   chastenest  and receivest those whom thou dost scourge  when   death shall have put a period to the sufferings of mortality  may I   not humbly look to find grace at the footstool of the throne of thy   mercy      At length our child died this morning  and we buried him in our   hovel  and watered his grave with the tears that we shed for him    and for each other  The rest  sir  you know  till this angel of   God was sent to accomplish the prediction of my Peggy in all its   fulness      Here Homely concluded   and after a pause and a deep sigh Mr    Fenton demanded   Have you told me the whole of your history    Mr  Homely  I have so  please your honour  through every par    ticular of any signification  I am sorry for it  Pray think again    Did you never meet with any adventure that is yet unrecited     Did you never save any person at your own peril  Xo  sir  O    now I recollect       Some two or three and twenty years ago  as I fled from the   bailiffs who pursued me  as I told you  for the bail of my brother  I   came to the river Avon   the flood was great and rapid after the         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  207     late rains  and I thought of looking for a place of smoother water   for my passage  when a gentleman and lady  attended by a train   of servants  came riding along the banks  As they rode  chatting   and laughing  a fowler  who  vas concealed in a copse just at hand    let fly at a bird  whereupon the fiery horse that the gentleman   was on took fright  and  with a bound  suddenly plunged into the   current  whereat the lady gave a loud shriek  and fell senseless to   the ground  The horse rose without his rider  and swam down the   stream  Soon after the rider appeared  and the attendants were   divided between their care of the lady and their lamentations for   their master on the edge of the bank  Then  seeing no other   help  my heart smote me  and I cast myself in without reflection    I kept aloof  however  for fear he should grapple at me  and   sink us both together   so I supported and shoved him before   me toward land  till  having reached the bank  I laid hold on it   with one hand  and with the other raised him up within the   reach of his servants  who had stretched themselves flat upon the   brink to receive him   then  being already drenched  and having   nothing further to do  I turned and swam over  and so made my   escape      Did you ask the name of the party whom you saved in the   manner you say  No  truly  sir  there was no leisure for such   an inquiry  Why did you not wait for the recompense that was so   justly your due for so great a deliverance   Recompense      lease   your honour  I could have done no less for the beggar that begs   at the comer      Noble  noble fellow   exclaimed Mr  Fenton   I am he I am he   whom you saved that day  my brother   And so saying  he arose   and caught Homely in his arms  and pressed and pressed him over   again to his bosom   while Harry  all impatient  seized hold of   Homely also  and struggled hard to get him to himself from his   father      When they were something composed  and all again seated Ab    Homely   says Mr  Fenton  I have sent and made many inquiries   after you  but not for many years after the day in which you saved   me  I hated  I loathed you  for having prolonged my life to such a   misery as no other man ever endured  Oh  that lady   that lady     But no matter for the present  and  so saying  he wiped the swelling   tear from his eye   Tell me  Homely that devil  Sir Freestone   I am not of a malicious temper  and yet I wish for nothing more   than full vengeance on his head  Don t you believe that he went   to you with a felonious intention of defrauding you of your property    Believe it  sir  I can swear it
