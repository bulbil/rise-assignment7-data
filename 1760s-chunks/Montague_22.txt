happiness worth a reasonable man s pursuit  and the choicest gift of heaven  it is a softer  tenderer friendship  enlivened by taste  and by the most ardent desire of pleasing  which time  instead of destroying  will render every hour more dear and interesting       If  as you possibly will  you should call me romantic  hear a man of pleasure on the subject  the Petronius of the last age  the elegant  but voluptuous St  Evremond  who speaks in the following manner of the friendship between married persons        I believe it is this pleasing intercourse of tenderness  this reciprocation of esteem  or  if you will  this mutual ardor of preventing each other in every endearing mark of affection  in which consists the sweetness of this second species of friendship        I do not speak of other pleasures  which are not so much in themselves as in the assurance they give of the intire possession of those we love  this appears to me so true  that I am not afraid to assert  the man who is by any other means certainly assured of the tenderness of her he loves  may easily support the privation of those pleasures  and that they ought not to enter into the account of friendship  but as proofs that it is without reserve         Tis true  few men are capable of the purity of these sentiments  and  tis for that reason we so very seldom see perfect friendship in marriage  at least for any long time  the object which a sensual passion has in view cannot long sustain a commerce so noble as that of friendship        You see  the pleasures you so much boast are the least of those which true tenderness has to give  and this in the opinion of a voluptuary       My dear Temple  all you have ever known of love is nothing to that sweet consent of souls in unison  that harmony of minds congenial to each other  of which you have not yet an idea       You have seen beauty  and it has inspired a momentary emotion  but you have never yet had a real attachment  you yet know nothing of that irresistible tenderness  that delirium of the soul  which  whilst it refines  adds strength to passion       I perhaps say too much  but I wish with ardor to see you happy  in which there is the more merit  as I have not the least prospect of being so myself       I wish you to pursue the plan of life which I myself think most likely to bring happiness  because I know our souls to be of the same frame  we have taken different roads  but you will come back to mine  Awake to delicate pleasures  I have no taste for any other  there are no other for sensible minds  My gallantries have been few  rather  if it is allowed to speak thus of one s self even to a friend  from elegance of taste than severity of manners  I have loved seldom  because I cannot love without esteem       Believe me  Jack  the meer pleasure of loving  even without a return  is superior to all the joys of sense where the heart is untouched  the French poet does not exaggerate when he says                                                           Amour   Tous les autres plaisirs ne valent pas tes peines         You will perhaps call me mad  I am just come from a woman who is capable of making all mankind so  Adieu   Yours   ED  RIVERS     LETTER XXII   22   To Miss RIVERS  Clarges Street   Silleri  Sept  25   I HAVE been rambling about amongst the peasants  and asking them a thousand questions  in order to satisfy your inquisitive friend  As to my father  though  properly speaking  your questions are addressed to him  yet  being upon duty  he begs that  for this time  you will accept of an answer from me        The Canadians live a good deal like the ancient patriarchs  the lands were originally settled by the troops  every officer became a seigneur  or lord of the manor  every soldier took lands under his commander  but  as avarice is natural to mankind  the soldiers took a great deal more than they could cultivate  by way of providing for a family  which is the reason so much land is now waste in the finest part of the province  those who had children  and in general they have a great number  portioned out their lands amongst them as they married  and lived in the midst of a little world of their descendents       There are whole villages  and there is even a large island  that of Coudre  where the inhabitants are all the descendents of one pair  if we only suppose that their sons went to the next village for wives  for I find no tradition of their having had a dispensation to marry their sisters       The corn here is very good  though not equal to ours  the harvest not half so gay as in England  and for this reason  that the lazy creatures leave the greatest
