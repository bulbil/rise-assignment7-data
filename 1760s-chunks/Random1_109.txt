in the ship  I got leave to go ashore  next day  with the gunner  who recommended me to a Jew  that bought my ticket  at the rate of 40 per cent  discount  and having furnished myself with what necessaries I wanted  returned on board in the evening  and to my great surprize  found my old antagonist Crampley walking upon deck —Tho  I did not fear his enmity  I was shocked at his appearance  and communicated my sentiments on that subject to Mr  Tomlins the surgeon  who told me  that Crampley  by the dint of some friends about the admiral  had procured a commission constituting him lieutenant on board the Lizzard  and advised me  now he was my superior officer    315 to behave with some respect towards him  or else he would find a thousand opportunities of using me ill —This advice was a bitter potion to me  whom pride and resentment had rendered utterly incapable of the least submission to  or even of reconciliation with the wretch  who had  on many occasions  treated me so inhumanly  However  I resolved to have as little connexion as possible with him  and to ingratiate myself as much as I could with the rest of the officers  whose friendship might be a bulwark to defend me from the attempts of his malice   In less than a week we sailed on a cruize  and having got round the east end of the island  had the good fortune to take a Spanish Barcolongo  with her prize  which was an English ship bound for Bristol  that sailed from Jamaica a fortnight before  without convoy  All the prisoners who were well  were put on shore on the north side of the island  the prizes were manned with Englishmen  and the command of the Barcolongo  given to my friend the master s mate  with orders to carry them into Port Morant  and there to remain until the Lizzard s cruize should be ended  at which time she would touch at the same place in her way to Port Royal —With him I was sent to attend the wounded Spaniards as well as Englishmen  who amounted to sixteen  and to take care of them on shore  in a house that was to be hired as an hospital —This destination gave me a great deal of pleasure  as I would  for some time  be freed from the arrogance of Crampley  whose inveteracy against me had already broke out on two or three occasions  since he was become a lieutenant —My mess mate  who very   316 much resembled my uncle  both in figure and disposition  treated me on board of the prize  with the utmost civility and confidence  and among other favours  made me a present of a silver hilted hanger  and a pair of pistols mounted with the same metal  which fell to his share in plundering the enemy —We arrived safely at Morant  and going ashore  pitched upon an empty store house  which we hired for the reception of the wounded  who were brought to it next day  with beds and other necessaries  and four of the ship s company appointed to attend them  and obey me   CHAP  XXXVI   A strange adventure—in consequence of which I am extremely happy—Crampley does me ill offices with the captain  But his malice is defeated by the good nature and friendship of the surgeon—we return to Port Royal—our captain gets the command of a larger ship  and is succeeded by an old man—Brayl is provided for—we receive orders to sail for England   WHEN my patients were all in a fair way  my companion and commander  whose name was Brayl  carried me up the country to the house of a rich planter  with whom he was acquainted  where we were sumptuously entertained    317 and in the evening set out on our return to the ship  When we had walked about a mile by moon light  we perceived a horseman behind us  who coming up  wished us good even  and asked which way we went  His voice  which was quite familiar to me  no sooner struck my ear  than  in spite of all my resolution and reflection  my hair bristled up  and I was seized with a violent fit of trembling  which Brayl mis interpreting  bid me be under no concern  for he would stand by me —I told him  he was mistaken in the cause of my disorder  and addressing myself to the person on horse back  said     I could have sworn by your voice  that you was a dear friend of mine  if I had not been certain of his death  —  To this  after some pause  he replied    There are many voices as well as faces that resemble one another  but pray  what was your friend s name    I satisfied him in that particular  and gave a short detail of the melancholy fate of Thomson  not without many sighs and some tears  A silence ensued which lasted some minutes  and then the conversation turned on indifferent subjects  till we arrived at a house on the road  where the horseman alighted  and begged with so much earnestness  that we would go in and drink a bowl of punch with him
