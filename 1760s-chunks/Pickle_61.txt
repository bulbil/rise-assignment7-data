 divination  but were he  or Merlin himself  to rise from the dead now   when such deceit and dissimulation prevail  they would not be able to  earn their bread by the profession     O  Sir   said she  turning  full upon him   without doubt they would adopt new maxims   tis  no disparagement in this enlightened age for one to alter one s  opinion     No  sure  madam   replied the youth  with some  precipitation   provided the change be for the better     And should  it happen otherwise   retorted the nymph  with a flirt of her  fan   inconstancy will never want countenance from the practice of  mankind    True  madam   resumed our hero  fixing his eyes upon her    examples of levity are every where to be met with    Oh Lord  sir    cried Emilia  tossing her head   you ll scarce ever find a fop without  it    By this time his companion  seeing him engaged with one of the ladies   entered into conversation with the other  and  in order to favour his  friend s gallantry  conducted her into the next apartment  on pretence  of entertaining her with the sight of a remarkable piece of painting   Peregrine  laying hold on this opportunity of being alone with the  object of his love  assumed a most seducing tenderness of look  and     6 22 15  3 45 PM   heaving a profound sigh  asked if she had utterly discarded him from  her remembrance  Reddening at this pathetic question  which recalled the  memory of the imagined slight he had put upon her  she answered in great  confusion   Sir  I believe I once had the pleasure of seeing you at a  ball in Winchester     Miss Emilia   said he  very gravely   will you  be so candid as to tell me what misbehaviour of mine you are pleased to  punish  by restricting your remembrance to that single occasion     Mr   Pickle   she replied  in the same tone   it is neither my province  nor inclination to judge your conduct  and therefore you misapply your  question when you ask such an explanation of me    At least  resumed our  lover   give me the melancholy satisfaction to know for what offence  of mine you refused to take least notice of that letter which I had the  honour to write from Winchester by your own express permission     Your  letter   said miss  with great vivacity   neither required  nor  in my  opinion  deserved an answer  and to be free with you  Mr  Pickle  it  was but a shallow artifice to rid yourself of a correspondence you had  deigned to solicit    Peregrine  confounded at this repartee  replied that howsoever he might  have failed in point of elegance or discretion  he was sure he had not  been deficient in expressions of respect and devotion for those charms  which it was his pride to adore   As for the verses   said he   I own  they were unworthy of the theme  but I flattered myself that they would  have merited your acceptance  though not your approbation  and been  considered not so much as the proof of my genius  as the genuine  effusion of my love     Verses   cried Emilia with an air of  astonishment   what verses  I really don t understand you    The young gentleman was thunderstruck at this exclamation  to which   after a long pause  he answered   I begin to suspect  and heartily wish  it may appear  that we have misunderstood each other from the beginning   Pray  Miss Gauntlet  did you not find a copy of verses inclosed in that  unfortunate letter     Truly  sit   said the lady   I am not so much of  a connoisseur as to distinguish whether that facetious production  which  you merrily style as an unfortunate letter  was composed in verse or  prose  but methinks  the jest is a little too stale to be brought upon  the carpet again   So saying  she tripped away to her companion  and  left her lover in a most tumultuous suspense  He now perceived that her  neglect of his addresses when he was at Winchester  must have been owing  to some mystery which he could not comprehend  and she began to suspect  and to hope that the letter which she received was spurious  though  she could not conceive how that could possibly happen  as it had been  delivered to her by the hands of his own servant   However  she resolved to leave the task of unravelling this affair to  him  who  she knew  would infallibly exert himself for his own as well  as her satisfaction  She was not deceived in her opinion  he went up  to her again at the staircase
