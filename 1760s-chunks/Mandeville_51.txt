to wish you had never met  all my hopes are in your resolution  I dare expect nothing from Lady Julia s       To the Earl of Belmont   September 10      My Lord        YOUR Lordship s absence  and the death of my mother  which renders my estate more worthy Lady Julia  has hitherto prevented my explanation of an unguarded expression  which I find has had the misfortune to displease you  I am far from intending    Your Lordship intirely mistakes me    No man can be more sensible of the honor of your Lordship s alliance  or of Lady Julia s uncommon perfections  but a light way of talking  which one naturally acquires in the world  has led me          2 25       undesignedly into some appearance of disrespect to a state  of the felicity of which I have not the least doubt      I flatter myself your Lordship will  on cooler reflexion  forgive an unguarded word  and allow me to hope for the honor of convincing you and the Lady  by my future conduct  that no man has a higher idea of matrimonial happiness  than     My Lord    Your Lordship s   Most devoted   and very obedient Servant    Fondville          2 26         To Lord Viscount Fondville      My Lord        I Readily admit your Lordship s apology  as I am under no apprehension any man can intend to slight the alliance of one who has always endeavoured his character should be worthy his birth  and the rank he has the honor to hold in his country        As I love the plainest dealing in affairs of such consequence  I will not a moment deceive your Lordship  or suffer you to engage in a pursuit  which  if I have any influence over my daughter  will be unsuccessful  not from any disesteem of your Lordship  but because I have another view for her  the disappointment of which would destroy all my hopes of a happy evening of life  and embitter my last hours  I have long intended her  with her own approbation  which her filial piety gives me no          2 27       room to doubt  for the son of my friend  the heir of an earldom  and of an affluent fortune  and  what I much more value  of uncommon merit  and one of the first families in the kingdom      I am sure your Lordship will not endeavour to oppose a design  which has been long formed  is far advanced  and on which I have so much set my heart     I am  my Lord  with great Regard  Your Lordship s very obedient and devoted Servant  Belmont      I have long  my dear Mr  Mandeville  suspected my Lord s design in favour of Lord Melvin  of which there is not now the least doubt  Our coming away from his father s  on his arrival  was a circumstance          2 28       which then struck me extremely  Lady Julia s stay there  on this supposition  would have been ill suited to the delicacy of her sex and rank  Yet I am astonished my Lord has not sooner told her of it  but there is no accounting for the caprice of age  How shall I tell my dear Mr  Mandeville my sentiments on this discovery  How shall I  without wounding a passion which bears no restraint  hint to him my wishes  that he would sacrifise that love  which can only by its continuance make him wretched  to Lady Julia s peace of mind  That he would himself assist her to conquer an inclination which is incompatible with the views which the most indulgent of parents entertains for her happiness  Views  the disappointment of which  he has declared  will embitter his last hours  Make one generous effort  my amiable friend  it is glorious to conquer where conquest is most difficult  think of Lord Belmont s friendship  of his almost        2 29       parental care of your fortune  of the pleasure with which he talks of your virtues  and it will be impossible for you to continue to oppose that design on which his hopes of a happy evening of life are founded  Would you deny a happy evening to that life to which thousands owe the felicity of theirs      It is from you  and not Lady Julia  I expect this sacrifice  the consideration which will most strongly influence you to make it  will for ever prevent her  it pains me to wound your delicacy  by saying I mean the difference of your fortunes  From a romantic generosity  she will think herself obliged to that perseverance  which the same generosity now calls loudly on you to decline  If you
