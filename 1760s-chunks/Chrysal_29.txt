seen through  and a stop put to them   before I could receive the stipulated profit  The stores I bought   for them were intercepted by our fleets   and  to conclude all  the   enemy  by one stretch of arbitrary power  refused to pay any debts   and appropriated the funds provided for that purpose to the present   support of the war          10 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     This finisiied my ruin   I had not only lent them all my own   fortune  but had also borrowed much more to supply them  on   confidence in their promises   than I was now able to pay      In this situation  the advice of my father returned fuU upon me   and aggravated my distress  But I had no time for reflection     the horrors of a jail stared me full in the face  which I had no way   to avoid but by flight  the equivocalness of my character having   made every honest man who was able to assist me afraid of being   concerned with me  I therefore immediately raised all the   money I possibly could  and embarked secretly in a ship of my   own for Jamaica   Heaven  to make its justice the more signal    using my blackest guilt aa a chain to draw me to the vengeance I   deserved      I must stop here and look back  to give you an account of an   afifair which the precipitancy of my ruin prevented my mentioning   in its proper order      Much as such a complicated scene as I have described must have   taken up my time and engrossed my thoughts  I had still found   leisure for guilt of another nature  though ultimately springing   from the same cause      I had told you that my father had acquired his own fortune by   industry   but as the greatest industry requires a foundation to   work upon  his had been assisted by the person to whom he served   his apprenticeship  who  knowing his abilities  and confiding in his   honesty  upon the decline of his own health established him in   partnership with his only son  whom he thought too young to   conduct so extensive a business      My father faithfully executed this great trust  and continued the   partnership  till his observation of my unfortunate disposition   determined him to make me quit trade   when it was dissolved    without the least breach in that real friendship which had so long   subsisted between them  Though I did not obey my father s   desire  yet my vanity would not admit a thought of recommencing   the partnership  as it would have been but a curb on my favourite   schemes  and have implied a want of assistance which  in my own   opinion  I was far above  On the contrary  I rather declined too   close a connection with him in business  as I feared he might have   taken upon him to interpose his advice against anjrthing which his   narrow  fearful temper might disapprove in my great designs   but   as I kept up every other appearance of regard  and even respefet for   him  this shyness was not observed  nor any coolness occasioned by   it in the intercourse of intimacy between us      But for this conduct I had another motive  besides regard for   him  He had an only daughter  enriched with every beauty and   virtue that could mark the favourite work of Heaven   she was   about four years younger than I  which difference of age had given   me an opportunity of treating her with such a fondness from her   veiy infancy as raised a real love in her grateful heart  as her beauties   did the strongest one it was capable of feeling in mine  Our fathers   had seen this growing attachment with the greatest pleasure from   the beginning  and encouraged it between us  our mothers both   died in our infancy   joining in the general opinion that the union         ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA 11     which had always been between their families would be com    pleted by the intermarriage of their children   an opinion that was   then my pride  and seemed a pleasure to the young Amelia s honest   heart  that was above disguise      But my father s death  before she was of an age to imdertake the   cares of such an awful state  and a long iUness of her father s after    during which her filial piety and love would not admit a thought   of anything that should interfere with her tender regard for him    prevented my happiness from being accomplished while there was   any obstacle that could hinder my evil genius from defeating   it
