my judgment  My master  whose courage was better than his cause  held the threats of Don Lope in derision  A blockhead  exclaimed he  bursting into a loud fit of laughter  Our knights errant used to tilt for the beauty of their mistresses  this fellow would engage in the lists for the forlorn hope of virtue in his  he is more ridiculous than his prototypes   Velasco s retiring  in vain opposed by Moncade  occasioned no interruption to the merriment  The party  without thinking further about it  kept the ball up briskly  and did not part till they had made free with the next day  We went to bed  that is  my master and myself  about five o clock in the morning  Sleep sat heavy on my eyelids  and  as I thought  was taking permanent possession thereof  but I reckoned without my host  or rather without our porter  who came and waked me in an hour  to say that there was a lad inquiring for me at the door  Oh  thou infernal porter  muttered I indistinctly  through the interstices of a long yawn  do you consider that I have but now got to bed  Tell the little rascal that I am just asleep  he must come again by  and by  He insists  replied Cerberus  on speaking with you instantly  his business cannot wait  As that was the case I got up  put on nothing but my breeches and doublet  and went down  stairs  swearing and gaping  My friend  said I  be so good as to let me know what urgent affair procures me the honour of seeing you so early  I have a letter  answered he  to deliver personally into the hands of Signor Don Matthias  to be read by him without loss of time  it is of the last consequence to him    pray show me into his room  As I thought the matter looked serious  I took the liberty of disturbing my master  Excuse me  said I  for waking you  but the pressing nature         What do you want  interrupted he  just in my style with the porter  Sir  said the lad who was at my elbow  here is a letter from Don Lope de Velasco  Don Matthias looked at the cover  broke it  and after reading the contents  said to the messenger of Don Lope    My good fellow  I never get up before noon  let the party be ever so agreeable  judge whether I can be expected to be stirring by six in the morning for a small sword recreation  You may tell your master  that if he chooses to kick his heels at the spot till half past twelve  we will come and see how he looks there    carry him that answer  With this flippant speech he plunged down snugly under the bed clothes and fell fast asleep again as if nothing had happened   Between eleven and twelve he got up and dressed himself with the utmost composure  and went out  telling me that there was no occasion for my attendance  but I was too much on the tenterhooks about the result to mind his orders  I sneaked after him to Saint Jerome s meadow  where I saw Don Lope de Velasco waiting for him  I took my station to watch them  and was an eye witness to all the circumstances of their rencounter  They saluted  and began their fierce debate without delay  The engagement lasted long  They exchanged thrusts alternately  with equal skill and mettle  The victory  how ever  was on the side of Don Lope  he ran my master through  laid him helpless on the ground  and made his escape  with apparent satisfaction at the severe reprisal  I ran up to the unfortunate Don Matthias  and found him in a most desperate situation  The sight melted me  I could not help weeping at a catastrophe to which I had been an involuntary contributor  Nevertheless  with all sympathy  I had still my little wits about me  Home went I in a hurry  without saying a word  I made up a bundle of my own goods and chattels  inadvertently slipping in some odd articles belonging to my master  and when I had deposited this with the barber  where my dress as a fine gentleman was still lodged  I published the news of the fatal accident  Any gaper might have it for the trouble of listening  and above all  I took care to make Rodriguez acquainted with it  He would have been extremely afflicted  but that his own proceedings in this delicate case required all his attention  He called the servants together  ordered them to follow him  and we went all together to Saint Jerome s meadow  Don Matthias was taken up alive  but he died three hours after he was brought home  Thus ended the life of Signor Don Matthias de Silva  only for having taken a fancy to reading supposititious love letters unseasonably       CH  IX     A new service  after the death of Don Matthias de Silva   Some days after the funeral  the establishment was paid up and discharged  I fixed my head quarters
