I m sure I never committed murder  except in the way of my  profession  nor wronged any man whatsomever since I first went to sea    This same Davy Jones  according to the mythology of sailors  is the  fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep  and is  often seen in various shapes  perching among the rigging on the eve of  hurricanes  shipwrecks  and other disasters  to which a seafaring life  is exposed  warning the devoted wretch of death and woe  No wonder then  that Trunnion was disturbed by a supposed visit of this demon  which  in  his opinion  foreboded some dreadful calamity   CHAPTER XIV    He is also  by their device  engaged in an Adventure with the Exciseman   who does not find his Account in his own Drollery   Howsomever preposterous and unaccountable that passion may be which  prompts persons  otherwise generous and sympathizing  to afflict  and perplex their fellow creatures  certain it is  our confederates  entertained such a large proportion of it  that not satisfied with the  pranks they had already played  they still persecuted the commodore  without ceasing  In the course of his own history  the particulars of  which he delighted to recount  he had often rehearsed an adventure of  deer stealing  in which  during the unthinking impetuosity of his  youth  he had been unfortunately concerned  Far from succeeding in that  achievement  he and his associates had  it seems  been made prisoners   after an obstinate engagement with the keepers  and carried before  a neighbouring justice of the peace  who used Trunnion with great  indignity  and with his companions committed him to jail   His own relations  and in particular an uncle on whom he chiefly  depended  treated him during his confinement with great rigour and  inhumanity and absolutely refused to interpose his influence in his  behalf  unless he would sign a writing  obliging himself to go to  sea within thirty days after his release  under the penalty of being  proceeded against as a felon  The alternative was  either to undergo  this voluntary exile  or remain in prison disowned and deserted by  everybody  and  after all  suffer an ignominious trial  that might end  in a sentence of transportation for life  He therefore  without much  hesitation  embraced the proposal of his kinsman  and  as he observed   was  in less than a month after his discharge  turned adrift to the  mercy of the wind and waves   Since that period he had never maintained any correspondence with his  relations  all of whom had concurred in sending him off  nor would he    6 22 15  3 45 PM   ever pay the least regard to the humiliations and supplications of some  among them  who had prostrated themselves before him  on the advancement  of his fortune  but he retained a most inveterate resentment against  his uncle  who was still in being  though extremely old and infirm  and  frequently mentioned his name with all the bitterness of revenge   Perry being perfectly well acquainted with the particulars of this  story  which he had heard so often repeated  proposed to Hatchway that  a person should be hired to introduce himself to the commodore  with a  supposititious letter of recommendation from this detested kinsman  an  imposition that  in all likelihood  would afford abundance of diversion   The lieutenant relished the scheme and young Pickle having composed an  epistle for the occasion  the exciseman of the parish  a fellow of great  impudence and some humour  in whom Hatchway could confide  undertook to  transcribe and deliver it with his own hand  and also personate the  man in whose favour it was feigned to be written  He  accordingly  one  morning arrived on horseback at the garrison  two hours at least  before Trunnion used to get up  and gave Pipes  who admitted him  to  understand  that he had a letter from his master  which he was ordered  to deliver to none but the commodore himself  This message was no sooner  communicated  than the indignant chief  who had been waked for the  purpose  began to curse the messenger for breaking his rest  and swore  he would not budge till his usual time of turning out  This resolution  being conveyed to the stranger  he desired the carrier to go back and  tell him  he had such joyful tidings to impart  that he was sure the  commodore would think himself amply rewarded for his trouble  even if he  had been raised from the grave to receive them   This assurance  flattering as it was  would not have been powerful  enough to persuade him  had it not been assisted with the exhortations  of his spouse  which never failed to influence his conduct  He therefore  crept out of bed  though not without great repugnance  and wrapping  himself in his morning gown  was supported down stairs  rubbing his eye   yawning fearfully  and grumbling in the way  As soon as he popped his  head into the parlour
