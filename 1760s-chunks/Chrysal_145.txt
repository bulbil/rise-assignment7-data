is but a   trifle neither  as such matters go now  Your grace knows that my   husband has a place under the Lord Mayor  Now  it just came   into my head that  when his lordship comes to wait upon the king   to be knighted  it would be no bad joke if his majesty could be   prevailed on to knight my husband also          Ha   ha   ha   And so madam has a mind to be a lady   Why    with all my heart  There is no great matter in it  to be sure  and   I see no reason why you should not have that title as well as a   chandler or shoemaker s wife  Indeed  the candidates for knight    hood have run so very low of late that a man of honour should be   ashamed to accept of it  But that is no concern of mine  I get   the money and where I can do that  I care not if it was from Jack   Ketch   let others look to that  Well  since you have taken a   fancy to stick a fool s feather in your cap  tell your good man    when he Imeels by his master at the important ceremony  not to be   too hasty to rise  and I ll take care that your ambition shall be   satisfied  though I do not know what we must do then  Your         ADVENTVBES OF A GUINEA 155     ladyship will never condescend to put on my shoes  or take away the   bed  pan  so that I believe I must look out for another servant          Your grace is pleased to joke   but you are very well convinced   that I have no ambition above your service  and shall ever be   proud to perform the meanest oflEices about you  Indeed  in this   aSair  I have more respect to your grace s honour than to myself    While I wait upon you  and I would not give up that to be made a   countess   I am but your servant  let me be called by what title   I will   but then I think it is not proper that you should be waited   on by common servants  like any other person of your apparent   rank  As you are the fountain of all honour and nobility  you   should have nobles to attend you as well as knights  if I could have   my wish  And it was this tenderness of your grace s honour that   made me so particularly aflEected at what happened yesterday          Yesterday   I do not understand you  What happened yes    terday           Your grace may remember that you were so kind some tiine ago   as to obtain leave for me  from the lord of the manor  to build a   little poultry house in a comer of yonder common field  I accord    ingly set the masons to work  ajii  liking the situation  thought it   was no great trespass to enlarge the yard a little  and build a lodge    with a room or two   where I could have my clothes washed  and   drink a dish of tea with a friend at any time when I might have a   mind to be retired  But  behold  after the wall of the yard was   built  and the lodge raised as high as the first storey  the bailiff of   the manor happened to come by  and  seeing what I intended    had the insolence to fly into a passion  and  saying it was an en    croachment beyond the leave I had obtained  obliged the workmen   to pull down every stone they had laid  though I myself  on receiving   notice of it  went there  and told him it was by your grace s order    and for your own use  and alleged the expense you had been at    But it was all to no purpose  for he would not leave the place till   his orders were executed  Nor was this all  He has had the   assurance also to send me word this very morning that he will   distrain the cows that you desired me to put to graze in that field    if I do not directly pay for their pasture  according to the rate he is   pleased to charge  which is more than I have been able to make of   the milk  though  by your grace s recommendation  I have had   such good customers for it   so that instead of the profit I expected   to make for you of your dairy  your grace is like to be a loser          Insolent
