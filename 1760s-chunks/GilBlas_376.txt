 No  my lovely child  replied I  we hope not to lose you by marriage  but to find a husband for you in the neighbourhood   There is one ready to your hands  said Beatrice  Seraphina made a conquest one day at mass  Her suitor has declared his passion  and asked my consent  I told him that his acceptance depended on her father and her god father  and here you are to determine for yourselves   What is the character of this village lordling  said Scipio  Is he not  like his fellows  the little tyrant of the soil  and insolent to those who have no pedigree to boast  The furthest from it in the world  answered Beatrice  the young man is gentle in his temper and polished in his manners  handsome withal  and somewhat under thirty  You paint him in flattering colours  said I to Beatrice  what is his name  Don Juan de Jutella  replied Scipio s wife  it is not long since be came to his inheritance  he lives on his own estate  about a mile off  with a younger sister  of whom he takes care  I once knew something of his family  observed I  it is one of the best in Valencia  I care less for lineage  cried Scipio  than for the qualities of the heart and mind  this Don Juan will exactly suit us  if he is a good sort of man  He is belied else  said Seraphina  with a blushing interest in our conversation  the inhabitants of Lirias  who know him well  say all the good of him you can conceive  I smiled at this  and her father  not less quick sighted  saw plainly that her heart had a share in the testimony of her tongue   The gentleman soon heard of our arrival  and paid his respects to us within two days  His address was pleasing and manly  so as to prepossess us in his favour  He affected merely to welcome us home as a neighbour  Our reception was such as not to discourage the repetition of his visit  but not a word of Seraphina  When he was gone  Beatrice asked us how we liked him  We could have no objection to make  and gave it as our opinion that Seraphina could not dispose of herself better   The next day  Scipio and I returned the visit  We took a guide  and luckily  for otherwise it might have puzzled us to find the place  It was not till our actual arrival that it was visible  for the mansion was situated at the foot of a mountain  in the middle of a wood  whose lofty trees hid it from our view  There was an antique and ruinous appearance about it  which spoke more for the descent than the wealth of its proprietor  On our entrance  however  the elegance of the interior arrangement made amends for the dilapidated grandeur of the outer walls   Don Juan received us in a handsome room  where he introduced his sister Dorothea  a lady between nineteen and twenty years of age  She was a good deal tricked out  as if she had primed and loaded herself for conquest  in expectation of our visit  Thus presenting all her charms in full force  she did by me much as Antonia had done before  but I managed my raptures so discreetly  that even Scipio had no suspicion  Our conversation turned  as on the preceding day  on the mutual pleasure of good neighbourhood  Still he did not open on the subject of Seraphina  nor did we attempt to draw him out  During our interview  I often cast a side glance at Dorothea  though with all the reserve of delicate apprehension  whenever our eyes met  the citadel of my heart was ready to surrender  To describe the object of my love justly  as well as feelingly  her beauty was not of the most perfect kind  her skin was of a dazzling whiteness  and her lips united the colour with the fragrance of the rose  but her features were not so regular and well proportioned as might have been wished  yet  altogether  she won my heart   In short  I left the mansion of Jutella a different man from what I was on entering it  so that  returning to Lirias with my whole soul absorbed in Dorothea  I saw and spoke only of her  How is this  master  said Scipio with a look of astonishment  you seem to be very much taken with Don Juan s sister  Can you be in love with her  Yes  my friend  answered I  to my shame be it spoken  Since the death of Antonia  how many lovely females have passed in review before me with indifference  and must my passions be irresistibly kindled at this time of life  Indeed  sir  replied the son of Coselina  you may bless your stars  instead of squabbling with yourself  you are not so old as to make your sacrifice at the shrine of love a by word  and time has not yet ploughed such furrows on your brow  as to render hopeless the desire of pleasing  When you see Don Juan next  ask him boldly for his sister  he cannot refuse her to
