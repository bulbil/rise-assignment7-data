to break off acquaintance with the greatest part of those   she at present conversed with  and now being admitted to entertain her   with more freedom and seriousness than ever  he resolved to sound her   sentiments on that score  and try to discover how far she could relish   the retirements of a country life       Accordingly  the next visit he made to her  he began to represent  in   the most pathetick terms he was able  the true felicity that two people    who loved each other  might enjoy when remote from the noise and   interruption of a throng of giddy visitors   The deity of soft desires     said he   flies the confused glare of pomp and publick shews  it is in   the shady bowers  or on the banks of a sweet purling stream  he spreads   his downy wings  and wafts ten thousand nameless pleasures on the fond    the innocent  and the happy pair        He was going on  but she interrupted him with a loud laugh   Hold    hold   cried she   was there ever such a romantick description  I wonder   how such silly ideas come into your head   Shady bowers  and purling   streams   Heavens  how insipid  Well   continued she   you may be the   Strephon of the woods  if you think fit  but I shall never envy the   happiness of the Chloe that accompanies you in these fine recesses    What  to be cooped up like a tame dove  only to coo  and bill  and   breed  O it would be a delicious life indeed        Mr  Trueworth now perceived  to his no small vexation  the late   seriousness he had observed in Miss Betsy  and which had given him so   much satisfaction  was no more than a short lived interval  a sudden   start of reason and recollection  soon dissipated  and that her temper    in reality  was still as light  as wild  and as inconsiderate as ever    The ridicule with which she treated what he said  did not  however    hinder him from proceeding in the praise of a country life  but   happening to say  that innocence could no where else be so secure  she   presently took up the word and with a disdainful air replied  that   innocence in any one but an idiot  might be secure in any place  to   which he retorted  that reason was at some times absent  even in those   who had the greatest share of it at others       Many smart repartees passed between them on this subject  in most of   which Miss Betsy had the better  but Mr  Trueworth  not willing to give   up the point  reminded her that Solomon  the most luxuriant  and withal   the wisest of men  pronounced  that all the gaieties and magnificence of   the earth were vanity and vexation of spirit   He did so   replied she    with a scornful smile   but it was not till he had enjoyed them all  and   was grown past the power of enjoying yet farther  when I am so  it is   possible I may say the same        Mr  Trueworth  finding she was pretty much stung at some things he had   said  and conscious that in his discourse he had in some measure forgot   the respect due from a lover to his mistress  would not pursue the   topick any farther  but  as artfully as he could  turned the   conversation on things more agreeable to Miss Betsy s way of thinking    he could not  however  after they had parted  forbear ruminating on the   contempt she had shewn of a country life  and was not so easy as the   submissiveness of his passion made him affect to be  on taking leave    This was  however  a matter of light moment to him  when compared with   what soon after ensued       I believe  that from the last letter of Miss Forward to Miss Betsy  the   reader may suspect it was not by a kinsman she was maintained  but it is   proper to be more particular on that affair  and shew how that   unfortunate creature  finding herself utterly discarded by her father    and abandoned to the utmost distresses  accepted the offer made her by a   rich Jew merchant  of five guineas a week to be his mistress       But  as few woman who have once lost the sense of honour  ever recover   it again  but  on the contrary  endeavour to lose all sense of shame   also  devote themselves to vice  and act whatever interest or   inclination prompts them to  Miss
