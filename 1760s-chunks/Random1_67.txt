violence with all the strength that rage and resentment could inspire —During this struggle  another horseman came up  who seeing a lady so unworthily used  dismounted and flew to my assistance —My ravisher  mad with disappointment  or provoked with the reproaches of the other gentleman  quitted me  and running to his horse  drew a pistol from the saddle and fired it at my protector  who happily receiving no damage  went up  and with the butt end of his whip  laid him prostrate on the ground  before he could use the other  which his antagonist immediately seized  and clapping to the  squire s breast  threatned to put him to death for his cowardice and treachery  Upon this I interposed and begged his life  which was granted to my request  after he had asked pardon  and swore his intention was only to obtain a kiss —However  my defender thought proper to unload the other pistol  and throw away the flints  before he gave him his liberty —This courteous stranger conducted me home  where my father having learned the signal service he had done me  loaded him with caresses  and insisted on his lodging that night at our house —If the obligation he had conferred upon me justly inspired me with sentiments of gratitude  his appearance and conversation seemed to intitle him to somewhat more —He was about the age of two and twenty  among the tallest of the middlesize    188 had chesnut coloured hair which he wore tied up in a ribbon  a high polished fore head  a nose inclining to the aquiline  lively blue eyes  red pouting lips  teeth as white as snow  and a certain openness of countenance —but what need I describe any more particulars of his person  I hope you will do me the justice to believe I do not flatter  when I say he was the exact resemblance of you  and if I had not been well acquainted with his family and pedigree  I should have made no scruple of concluding him your brother —He spoke little  and seemed to have no reserve  for what he said was ingenuous  sensible  and uncommon —In short  said she  bursting into tears  he was formed for the ruin of our sex —His behaviour was modest and respectful  but his looks were so significant that I could easily observe  he secretly blessed the occasion that introduced him to my acquaintance —We learned from his discourse that he was eldest son of a wealthy gentleman in the neighbourhood  to whose name we were no strangers  that he had been to visit an acquaintance in the country  from whose house he was returning home  when my shrieks brought him to my rescue —All night long my imagination formed a thousand ridiculous expectations  There was so much of knight errantry in this gentleman s coming to the relief of a damsel in distress  with whom he immediately became enamoured  that all I had read of love and chivalry recurred to my fancy  and I looked upon myself as a princess in some region of romance  who being delivered from the power of a brutal giant or satyr by a generous Oroondates  was bound in gratitude  as well as led by inclination  to yield up my affections to   189 him without reserve  In vain did I endeavour to chastise these foolish conceits by reflexions more reasonable and severe  The amusing images took full possession of my mind  and my dreams represented my hero sighing at my feet  in the language of a despairing lover —Next morning after breakfast he took his leave  when my father begged the favour of a further acquaintance with him  to which he replied by a compliment to him  and a look to me so full of eloquence and tenderness  that my whole soul received the soft impression —In a short time he repeated his visit  and as a recital of the particular steps he pursued to ruin me  would be too tedious and impertinent  let it suffice to say  he made it his business to insinuate himself into my esteem  by convincing me of his own good sense  and at the same time flattering my understanding  This he performed in the most artful manner  by seeming to contradict me often through misapprehension  that I might have an opportunity of clearing myself  the more to my own honour —Having thus secured my good opinion  he began to give me some tokens of a particular passion founded on a veneration for the qualities of my mind  and as an accidental ornament  admir d the beauties of my person  till at length  being fully persuaded of his conquest  he chose a a proper season for the theme  and disclos d his love in terms so ardent and sincere  that it was impossible for me to disguise the sentiments of my heart  and he received my approbation with the most lively transport  After this mutual declaration  we contrived to meet more frequently  which we did in private interviews  where we enjoy d the conversation of one another  in all   190 the elevation of fancy and impatience of hope  that reciprocal adoration can inspire —He professed his honourable intentions  of which I made no question  lamented the avaritious disposition of his father  who had destin d him for the arms of another  and vowed eternal fidelity with such an appearance of candour and devotion
