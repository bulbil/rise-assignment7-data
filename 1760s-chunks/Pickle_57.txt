she considered the whole as the production of Mrs  Trunnion s  particular pique  and represented it to her husband as an insult that he  was bound in honour to resent  by breaking off all correspondence with  the commodore and his family  This was a bitter pill to Gamaliel  who   through a long course of years  was so habituated to Trunnion s company   that he could as easily have parted with a limb as have relinquished the  club all at once  He therefore ventured to represent his own incapacity  to follow her advice  and begged that he might  at least  be allowed to  drop the connection gradually  protesting that he would do his endeavour  to give her all manner of satisfaction   Meanwhile preparations were made for Peregrine s departure to the  university  and in a few weeks he set out  in the seventeenth year  of his age  accompanied by the same attendants who lived with him at  Winchester  His uncle laid strong injunctions upon him to avoid the  company of immodest women  to mind his learning  to let him hear of  his welfare as often as he could find time to write  and settled  his appointments at the rate of five hundred a year  including his  governor s salary  which was one fifth part of the sum  The heart of  our young gentleman dilated at the prospect of the figure he should make  with such a handsome annuity the management of which was left to his  own discretion  and he amused his imagination with the most agreeable  reveries during his journey to Oxford  which he performed in two days   Here  being introduced to the head of the college  to whom he had been  recommended  accommodated with genteel apartments  entered as gentleman  commoner in the books  and provided with a judicious tutor  instead of  returning to the study of Greek and Latin  in which he thought himself  already sufficiently instructed  he renewed his acquaintance with some  of his old school fellows  whom he found in the same situation  and was  by them initiated in all the fashionable diversions of the place   It was not long before he made himself remarkable for his spirit and  humour  which were so acceptable to the bucks of the university  that he  was admitted as a member of their corporation  and in a very little time  became the most conspicuous personage of the whole fraternity  Not that  he valued himself upon his ability in smoking the greatest number  of pipes  and drinking the largest quantity of ale  these were  qualifications of too gross a nature to captivate his refined ambition   He piqued himself on his talent for raillery  his genius and taste   his personal accomplishments  and his success at intrigue  Nor were his  excursions confined to the small villages in the neighbourhood  which  are commonly visited once a week by the students for the sake of carnal  recreation  He kept his own horses  traversed the whole country in  parties of pleasure  attended all the races within fifty miles of  Oxford  and made frequent jaunts to London  where he used to be  incognito during the best part of many a term   The rules of the university were too severe to be observed by a youth  of his vivacity  and therefore he became acquainted with the proctor  betimes  But all the checks he received were insufficient to moderate    6 22 15  3 45 PM   his career  he frequented taverns and coffee houses  committed midnight  frolics in the streets  insulted all the sober and pacific class of  his fellow students  the tutors themselves were not sacred from his  ridicule  he laughed at the magistrate  and neglected every particular  of college discipline  In vain did they attempt to restrain his  irregularities by the imposition of fines  he was liberal to profusion   and therefore paid without reluctance  Thrice did he scale the windows  of a tradesman  with whose daughter he had an affair of gallantry  as  often was he obliged to seek his safety by a precipitate leap  and one  night would  in all probability  have fallen a sacrifice to an ambuscade  that was laid by the father  had not his trusty squire Pipes interposed  in his behalf  and manfully rescued him from the clubs of his enemies   In the midst of these excesses  Mr  Jolter  finding his admonitions  neglected and his influence utterly destroyed  attempted to wean his  pupil from his extravagant courses  by engaging his attention in some  more laudable pursuit  With this view he introduced him into a club  of politicians  who received him with great demonstrations of regard   accommodated themselves more than he could have expected to his jovial  disposition  and while they revolved schemes for the reformation of the  state  drank with such devotion to the accomplishment of their  plans  that  before parting  the cares of their patriotism were quite  overwhelmed   Peregrine  though he could not approve of their doctrine  resolved to  attach himself for some time to their company  because he perceived  ample subject for his ridicule
