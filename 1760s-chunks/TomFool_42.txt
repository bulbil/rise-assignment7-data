Man of Wit and Humour  is a Character eagerly sought after  like the great Prize in the Lottery  and the World will put in  because each Individual thinks he may pretend to it  But that s not the Thing  every Lady is not born to be a Toast  nor every Man to be a Genius   One Thing that led me to aim at so pleasing a Title was  I had a prodigious Share of Spirits  and from my Induction   179at College  to this present Time  they never failed me   I was forced  indeed  to leave the University sooner than I expected  on Account of the first Piece of Wit I ever attempted  I put a Piece of hot Coal on my Tutor s Shoe  as the old Fellow lay asleep  it happened to lame him indeed  but that was more than I intended   When I returned to my Father s  I was ordered to prepare myself to make the grand Tour  but an Aunt of mine objecting to him  how weak it was in Parents sending their Sons Abroad  before they had seen their own Country  I had Liberty allowed me to go with her to Tunbridge   I was soon take Notice of for my vast Spirits  and made Principal in most Parties of Pleasure  until the satyrical Talent which I possessed  made me be thought too severe a Companion  and I was in Consequence of that left out of several future Invitations   This pleased me  for I was fond of being dreaded  I lampooned away  and enjoyed the Anxiety which it gave to several at the Spaw  who would have poisoned me if they dared  I had imbibed the Opinion from several Ladies of Fashion    180that to give Pain was the greatest Pleasure imaginable   My Father had been some Years a Widower  and just as I came of Age  dying  left me a large unincumbered Estate  with some Thousands in ready Money  then I began to execute my Plan  which was  to be the tip top Fellow for Fun  Frolick  Wit and Humour upon the Town   I gave over all Thoughts of going abroad  being conscious that my own Country could furnish me with Curiosities enow for Entertainment  however  that I might not be disesteemed for a Deficiency of Taste  I employed Persons  who understood those Things  to furnish me with a proper Quantity of Pictures  Etchings  Medals  Bronzes  Cameo s  Intaglias  Antiques and Petrifactions   While my House  Cabinets and Curiosities were fitting up in London  I went to an Estate I had in Cornwall  with half a Dozen excessive droll Fellows  to practise all the Species of Wit and Humour I intended to be excellent in   After being absent a Year  I burst on the Town a Prodigy  I was allowed to be the greatest Genius that ever embellished an Evening s Conversation  I could take off Ryan  and the blind Man with his   181Bladder and String  I could play upon my Coat s Skirt like a Bag pipe  and make an old Woman s Face upon my Hand  I could make a Fiddle go like a German Flute  and grunt with my Mouth like an Organ  could do all the London Cries  and play a Solo upon a Broomstick  sound a Trumpet from the Corner of my Hat  and play a Voluntary by snapping my Fingers  I was the best Hand in England upon the Saltbox  and nobody sung the Welch Song like me  then I could growl like Quin  and squint like Parson Whitfield  and every Body allowed  at my own Table  I said as many good Things as any Man in England   There we was one Thing very remarkable about me  which was  tho  I had an excessive Share of Spirits  they never hurried me into any particular Extravagancies  I detested Gaming  as to tossing up for the Reckoning now and then  or buying a few Lottery Tickets  just to make Presents with  those were Trifles not worth talking of  and what would not hurt any Body  but I was determined never to be taken in  So  tho  I have had all the tip top Women of the Town  they never had me  they loved me as a clever Fellow  but I was too knowing   182to be a Keeper  I have  indeed  sometimes made one Lady a Present of a Piece of Plate  and folded up a Bank bill two or three Times  and flung it by way of Frolick at another  What then  I was not scheemed out of it  tho  I used to lie with them  they never had a Penny from me  as to any Thing else  who the Devil would deny giving a fine Woman now and the forty or fifty Guineas  provided a Man was not made their Dupe  which they honestly confessed to me I was not  they could not finesse me   While I was amusing myself in this Manner  I received a little Damage from a Gentleman  whose Wife I had toasted as a Demirep  I retired into the Country a little while to recruit both my Constitution and Circumstances  for tho  I had not been very high
