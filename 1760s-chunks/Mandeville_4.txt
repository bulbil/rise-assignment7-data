Lord Belmont and my father to Acton Grange  and shall not return till Thursday     H  Mandeville      To George Mordaunt  Esq   Friday      WE returned yesterday about six in the evening  and the moment we alighted  my Lord leading us into the garden           1 18       an unexpected scene opened on my view  which recalled the idea of the fabulous pleasures of the golden age  and could not but be infinitely pleasing to every mind uncorrupted by the false glare of tinsel pomp and awake to the genuine charms of simplicity and nature      On a spacious lawn  bounded on every side by a profusion of the most odoriferous flowering shrubs  a joyous band of villagers were assembled  the young men drest in green  youth  health  and pleasure in their air  led up their artless charmers  in straw hats adorned with the spoils of Flora  to the rustic sound of the tabor and pipe  Round the lawn  at equal intervals  were raised temporary arbors of branches of trees  in which refreshments were prepared for the dancers  and between the arbors  seats of moss for their parents  shaded from the sun by green awnings on poles  round          1 19       which were twined wreaths of flowers  breathing the sweets of the spring  The surprize  the gaiety of the scene  the flow of general joy  the sight of so many happy people  the countenances of the enraptured parents  who seemed to live over again the sprightly season of youth in their children  with the benevolent pleasure in the looks of the noble bestowers of the feast  filled my eyes with tears  and my swelling heart with a sensation of pure yet lively transport  to which the joys of courtly balls are mean      The ladies  who were sitting in conversation with some of the oldest of the villagers  rose at our approach  and  my Lord giving Lady Anne Wilmot s hand to my father and honoring me with Lady Julia s  we mixed in the rustic ball  The loveliest of women had an elegant simplicity in her air and habit which became the scene           1 20       and gave her a thousand new charms  she was drest in a straw coloured lutestring night gown  the lightest gauze linen  a hat with purple ribbons  and a sprig of glowing purple amaranthus in her bosom  I know not how to convey an idea of the particular stile of beauty in which she then appeared     Youth  health  sprightliness  and innocence  all struck the imagination at once     Paint to yourself the exquisite proportion  the playful air  and easy movement of a Venus  with the vivid bloom of an Hebe     however high you raise your ideas  they will fall infinitely short of the divine original      The approach of night putting an end to the rural assembly  the villagers retired to the hall  where they continued dancing  and our happy party passed the rest of the evening in that sweet and lively conversation  which is never to be found but amongst          1 21       those of the first sense and politeness  united by that perfect confidence which makes the most trifling subjects interesting  none of us thought of separating  or imagined it midnight  when  my father opening a window  the rising sun broke in upon us  and convinced us on what swift and downy pinions the hours of happiness flit away  Adieu   H  Mandeville      To George Mordaunt  Esq   Belmont      NO  my friend  I have not always been this hero  too sensible to the power of beauty  I have felt the keenest pangs of unsuccessful love  but I deserved to suffer  my passion was in the highest degree criminal  and I blush  though at this distance of time  to lay open my heart          1 22       even to the indulgent eyes of partial friendship      When your father s death called you back to England  you may remember I continued my journey to Rome  where a letter from my father introduced me into the family of Count Melespini  a nobleman of great wealth and uncommon accomplishments  As my father  who has always been of opinion that nothing purifies the manners  like the conversation of an amiable  well educated  virtuous woman  had particularly entreated for me the honour of the Countess s friendship  whom he had known almost a child  and to whom he had taught the English language  I was admitted to the distinction of partaking in all her amusements  and attending her every where in the quality of Cecisbeo  To the arts of the libertine  however fair  my heart had          1 23
