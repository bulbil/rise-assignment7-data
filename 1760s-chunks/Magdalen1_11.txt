company  nevertheless  through an injudicious degree of tenderness both to me and their daughter  took every opportunity of leaving us together  naturally enough supposing that we should be best pleased to be left to the uninterrupted enjoyment of each other s conversation  after supper  particularly  they withdrew to their own apartment so early  that Louisa and I had at least three or four hours to the good before we could reasonably think of retiring  I need not tell you  Melmoth  that when two young people are left together for   64 any length of time  that some familiarities will pass  though even both are actuated by the best inclinations  Would it not  for instance  have been surprizing if  circumstanced as I was with Louisa  I had sat with her for two or three hours  without ever ravishing a kiss  presuming to sink upon her neck  or attempt to clasp her in my arms  when she even condescendingly acknowledged how tenderly she loved me  Would it not also have been equally surprizing had she repulsed those little effusions of transport at the very instant that they were excited by her own confession  and  in a manner  authorized by the consideration of the union which was so shortly to take place  A contrary behaviour would have been as unnatural as it was impossible  and virtue neither expected nor required more than the restriction of our transports within some sensible bounds     65But alas  Melmoth  who can strike a line to the passions  or pretend to tell the impetuous tide of youth    go no farther than this  —For my own part  as I shall answer it before God  I never in my life was more divested of sinister designs—I considered Louisa in quite a different light from any of those women with whom I had formerly trifled  and set her down as a lady  whose reputation was immediately connected with my own—I saw her  besides  the only daughter of an honourable family  which it would be unpardonable to disgrace  and the friendship which my sister entertained for her  was a circumstance of itself sufficient to have prevented me even from once thinking about the possibility of attaining her upon any terms that were not strictly honourable     You have often  my dear Melmoth  called me the most sentimental libertine   66 you ever knew  and once  in a conversation with my sister Haversham  assured her  notwithstanding all my follies  that I was above laying any unmanly schemes for the seduction of innocence  in this you did me nothing more than justice—You yourself know that  in one half of my amours  the advances were so palpable on the wrong side  that there was no creditable method of getting off  even had I been the most sanctified puritan in the kingdom —You will  therefore  naturally credit my account  and believe that I am infinitely above any disingenuous attempts either to palliate or disguise my part in this unfortunate transaction   I had been now a full week down at Louisa s  and company from various places was impatiently expected to attend at the approaching solemnity  when  last night  she and I sitting  as usual    67 to enjoy all the delicious nonsense  which generally makes up the principal part of love conversations  we happened accidentally to mention a suit of night cloaths which she had just received from London  and which  she said  became her excessively  as I expressed a desire to see them on her  she retired immediately to her room  and  in about a quarter of an hour  came down so irresistably ravishing  that I was no longer my own master  Imagine to yourself  Melmoth  with all your boasted apathy of disposition  a woman  such as I have repeatedly described Miss Mildmay  dressed in a flowing robe of white sattin  with her fine black hair hanging carelessly down her neck  and every thing in the most voluptuous disorder—Imagine this  I say  and tell me honestly whether you could have beheld her without emotion —If you could  you must either be something more or less than human—For my part I was   68 mere flesh and blood—I snatched her to my bosom with a phrenzy of the most passionate admiration  and almost stifled her with kisses—The extatic tenderness with which she received my embrace entirely destroyed my recollection  and a cursed sopha lying most conveniently ready to assist the purposes of my rashness  I proceeded from liberty to liberty till she was actually undone   The guilty triumph thus compleated  we were both in an instant perfectly sensible of our indiscretion—Louisa stalked to her chair with a mingled air of the most fixed astonishment and distress  and preserved a profound silence for some minutes  till  at last  unable to endure the conflict in her bosom any longer  she hid her face in a handkerchief  and gave loose to a violent flood of tears  For my own part  Melmoth  I was equally tortured by shame and regret—for the   69 first time in my life  I felt such a mortification at succeeding with a fine woman  that I could not for the soul of me say a syllable of comfort to her  The miseries which I easily foresaw must arise from this unfortunate lapse  crouded at once upon my imagination  so that that
