 security of twenty five thousand pounds     6 22 15  3 45 PM    This intended victim to that villain s avarice no sooner arrived in  town  full of hopes of money to carry on his cause  and of agreeably  surprising his friend and protector Mr  M    with so seasonable and  unexpected a reinforcement  than an unforeseen difficulty arose   concerning the payment of G   s six thousand pound bond  That money was  to have been raised out of the estate of a lunatic  which could not be  done without the leave of the Court of Chancery  to whom an account must  have been given of the intended application of it  While preparations  were making to rectify this omission  G   immediately carried Mr  A    again into the country  lest he should happen to be undeceived by some  means or other    In the meantime  this wicked machination was providentially discovered  by Mr  M    before it could be carried into execution  by means of the  jealousies that arose among the conspirators themselves  and was  at the  same time  confirmed to him by a person whom the very agent for the A    party had entrusted with the secret  M   no sooner detected it  than he  communicated his discovery to one of Mr  A   s counsel  a man of great  worth  and immediately thereupon took proper measures to defeat it  He  then found means to lay open to Mr  A   himself the treacherous scheme  that was laid for his destruction  He was highly sensible of it  and  could never afterwards reflect on the snare that he had so unwarily been  drawn into  and had so narrowly escaped  without a mixture of horror   shame  and gratitude to his deliverer    The consummate assurance of the monsters who were engaged in this plot   after they had been detected  and upbraided with their treachery  is  scarce to be paralleled  for they not only owned the fact of spiriting  Mr  A   away in the manner above mentioned  but justified their doing it  as tending to his service  They also maintained  that they had actually  secured the twenty five thousand pounds for him  though they never could  name any one person who was to have advanced the money  No man was more  active in this scheme than H    nor any man more solicitous to keep  Mr  A   up in the false impressions he had received  or in projecting  methods to ruin his protector  than he    Among many other expedients for that purpose  a most malicious attempt  was made to lodge an information against him  for treasonable practices   with the secretary of state  notwithstanding the repeated proofs he had  given of his loyalty  and  as a preparatory step to his accusation  a  letter  which this traitor dictated  was copied by another person  and  actually sent to the earl of C    importing  that the person who copied  the letter had an affair of consequence to communicate to his lordship   if he would appoint a time of receiving the information  But that  person  upon full conviction of the villainy of the scheme  absolutely  refused to proceed further in it  so that his malice once more proved  abortive  and before he had time to execute any other contrivance of the  same nature  he was imprisoned in this very jail for debt    Here  finding his creditors inexorable  and himself destitute of all  other resource  he made application to the very man whom he had injured  in such an outrageous manner  set forth his deplorable case in the most  pathetic terms  and entreated him  with the most abject humility  to  use his influence in his behalf  The distress of this varlet immediately  disarmed M   of his resentment  and even excited his compassion  Without  sending any answer to his remonstrances  he interceded for him with his  creditors  and the person to whom he was chiefly indebted  refusing to    6 22 15  3 45 PM   release him without security  this unwearied benefactor joined with the  prisoner in a bond for above two hundred and forty pounds  for which he  obtained his release    He was no sooner discharged  however  than he entered into fresh  combinations with G   and others  in order to thwart his deliverer in  his schemes of raising money  and otherwise to distress and deprive him  of liberty  for which purpose  no art or industry  perjury not excepted   hath been spared  And  what is still more extraordinary  this perfidious  monster having found money to take up the bond  in consequence of which  he regained his freedom  hath procured a writ against M    upon that  very obligation  and taken assignments to some other debts of that  gentleman  with the same Christian intention  But hitherto he hath  by  surprising sagacity and unshaken
