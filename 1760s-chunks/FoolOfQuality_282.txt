hero led up the dance  and Louisa and Sir         304 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      William were appointed the next in course  in order to do the   principal honours to the two young strangers      In the intervals of dancing  Lady Louisa took occasion to say to   Harry You are a great stranger  sir   but we desire you should   be so  since we did not treat you with the respect that your merit   should have commanded  That  madam  answered Harry  is not   wholly the cause of my distance   but there are persons whose   loveliness is more formidable to me  than a whole regiment of sabred   hussars with their fierce looking moustaches      Harry had no sooner said this than his heart smote him with   remorse   for  though Louisa was indeed lovely  and he felt for her   the propensities and tenderness of a brother  yet she was not of that   species of beauty that was formed to fix his heart   and he secretly   reproached himself for having attempted to raise the vanity or draw   the affections of an innocent girl  with no other view than of making   a parade of his own talents a measure  he justly adjudged  unbe    coming a man of a spark of honour or integrity      As soon as the dances were ended  and that all had mixed  and   chatted  and roved about a while  Harry observed Sir William   coming towards him in a little fluster  What is the matter  my   friend  says Harry   pray  what has discomposed you   Tell me  my   dear Harry  that jackanapes in the blue and gold  do you know   who he is   I protest  had it not been for the respect I owe the   presence  I would have chastised him on the spot  The dance was   no sooner done than he came up with a most provoking sauciness in   his look  I wonder  sir  said he  at the insolence of one of your   rank   you ought to have had more modesty than to suffer yourself   to be paired with a lady so far above you        cried Harry  taking Sir William very lovingly under the arm    pass this matter over  my sweet friend  I beseech you  That is   young Lord Bottom  the very person who  I am pretty confident    contrived the honour of the pasquinade on my back this day  But   he is brother to the sweet girl with whom you danced  For her   sake  for my sake  forgive him  I entreat you   but  above all  forgive   him for the sake of his dear father  the Earl of Mansfield  one of the   noblest nobles  and one of the worthiest men that ever stepped on   English ground  He has been these two years past abroad upon an   embassy   and  while he is promoting the interests of the public  has   left his own household unchastened and unguided      Here the converse of the friends was suddenly broken off  The   lord chamberlain came  and  tapping Harry on the shoulder  told   him that the queen desired to speak with him      When he had with a lowly reverence advanced to the throne   You are  said the queen  the most accomplished cavalier that ever I   beheld   and  had I sufficient youth and beauty  I would choose you   for my knight  to bear my fame through the world  I would rather    said Harry  that your majesty would employ me on some more   dangerous enterprise  How is that  said the queen  Why    answered Harry  your majesty s champion could have little or   nothing to do  as all would willingly acknowledge the justice of   his cause      You are  cried the queen  the loveliest and the sweetest fellow         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  305     I ever knew  My eye has followed you all along  and marked   you for my own  and I must either beg or steal you from our good   friend your father  I therefore want no token to put me in mind   of you  but you may want some token to keep your friends in your   memory  Here are two pictures the one is the portrait of our   master and sovereign lord  the other is the picture of the woman who   sits before you  lowly  simple  unadorned   choose which you please      Give me the plain picture  cried Harry  with a kind of rapture     it shall henceforth become my riches and my ornament
