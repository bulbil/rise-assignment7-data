your honour s lordship   and I used to wrestle every day behind our house      The rest of the girls now pressed for their share of Harry  and   it was with difficulty that he divided himself with any satisfactory   equality among them  as they all kissed him so close  and seemed   so loth to part      At length Harry s watch reminded him that it was time to   attend his father  and as he parted they shouted after him Long   life  and health  and honours to our townsman  our own boy  our   own dear  sweet child       In the mean time Mr  Meekly had returned home  with his heart   full of tidings  to the earl  When Harry arrived breakfast was on   table  and he perceived that his father had been in tears   but no   notice was taken of the affair at the charnel house on either part      When breakfast was over  Harry called in John  Mr  John    says he  can you tell me how many families there are in this village   of yours  Twenty five families exactly  my lord  Then Harry   turned to his father and said If your lordship will be pleased to         346 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      lend me five hundred guineas for the present  I will pay you very   honestly the hour that my uncle comes to the country  Why    sirrah   cried the earl pleasantly  what right has your uncle to pay   your debts  especially to such a great amount as you speak of    O  my lord  answered Harry  I have already squandered away   above fifty thousand pounds of his money   and this is but a trifle    which I am sure I may very safely add to the rest      Here the earl looked truly astonished  Fifty thousand pounds     he exclaimed   Impossible  Harry  Why  you had neither such   ponds nor lakes as mine in London  wherein you might make ducks   and drakes of them  How in the world could you contrive it    Where did you dispose of them       In hospitals and in prisons  my father  answered Harry  In   streets and highways  among the wretched and indigent  supplying   eyes to the blind  and limbs to the lame  and cheerfulness to the   sorrowful and broken of heart   for such were my uncle s orders      Let me go  let me go from this place  my lord   cried Meekly     this boy will absolutely kill me if I stay any longer  He over    powers  he suffocates me with the weight of his sentiments      Well  Harry  said the earl  go to my desk   here is the key of   the drawer on the left hand  and I make you a present of the key   and the contents   perhaps you may find there nearly as much as   will answer your present exigencies      Harry went  and  opening the drawer  was astonished to see   it quite full of gold  However  he took no more than just the sum   proposed   and  returning to his father  said What shall I do    my lord  with that vast heap of money  Why  you extravagant   rogue  replied the earl  there is not as much in it as will pay the   debt you have contracted with one man  0  cried Harry  I am   quite easy upon that score   I will never affront my uncle by the   offer of a penny  And don t you think  said the earl  that we have   got poor among us in the country as well as you have in the city    Harry  I believe you may have got some  my lord  but then   I am much more difficult than you may think  in the objects on   whom I would choose to confer charity  I look upon the money   amassed by the wealthy  to have been already extracted from the   earnings of the poor  the poor farmer  the poor craftsman  the   hard handed peasant  and the day labourer  whose seven children   perhaps subsist on the milk of a couple of cows  Wherefore  the   objects on whom we bestow these gatherings ought at least to be   something poorer  and more worthy of compassion than those from   whom the money was exacted  So saying  he stepped out      Amazing boy   cried Mr  Meekly   how new  and yet how just   was that observation   I am  cried the earl  as it were in a kind   of
