the boy for the beer  lay upon the table  he   gave it to him  saying   Here  my good boy  take this  and divide it   with your brother  to buy apples   Then turning to the nurse  took his   leave of her with this compliment   Well  Mrs  Bushman  I believe you   are a very honest careful woman  and shall not fail to remember you   whenever it comes in my way  In the mean time   added he  putting a   crown piece into her hands   take this  and make merry with your   husband   The poor woman was so transported  that she knew not how to   thank him sufficiently  she made twenty curtsies  crying   Heavens bless   you  Sir  you are a right noble gentleman  I am sure  Marry  such   guests come not every day   And with such like expressions of gratitude    followed him till he was quite out of hearing       What now could this enquiring lover think  Where was the least room for   any conjecture in favour of Miss Betsy s innocence  to gain entrance   into his breast  He had seen the child  had heard by whom  and in what   manner it was delivered  the charge given with it  and the promises made   for its future protection  and whether the nurse was really so weak as   to be imposed upon by this pretence of charity  or whether bribed to   impose it upon others  the facts  as related in the letter  appeared to   be so plain  from every circumstance  as to admit no possibility of a   doubt       A marriage with Miss Betsy was  therefore  now quite out of the question   with him  the manner of entirely breaking off with her  was the only   thing that puzzled him  Loth was he to reproach her with the cause  and   equally loth to be deemed so inconstant as to quit her without a   justifiable one  He remained in this dilemma for the space of two days    at the expiration of which  after much debating with himself  he wrote    and sent to her  by a servant  the following epistle             To Miss Betsy Thoughtless            Madam            The very ill success I have met with  in the only business which        brought me to this town  has determined me to quit it with all        possible expedition  and not to think of a return  till I find        myself in a disposition more capable of relishing its pleasures         You have given me  Madam  too many instances how little agreeable        my presence has ever been  not to convince me  that I stand in no        need of an apology for not waiting on you in person  and that this        distant way of taking my leave will be less unwelcome to you than a        visit  which perhaps would only have interrupted your more gay        amusements  and broke in  for some moments  on that round of        pleasures  with which you are perpetually encompassed  May you long        enjoy all the felicities the manner you chuse to live in can        bestow  while I retire to solitude  and  lost in contemplation on        some late astonishing occurrences  cry out with the poet                  There is no wonder  or else all is wonder              If I speak in riddles  a very small retrospect on some remarkable        passages in your own conduct  will serve for the solution  but that        might probably be imposing on yourself too great a task  I shall        therefore trouble you no farther than to assure you  that though I        cease to see you  I shall never cease to be  with the most friendly        wishes  Madam  your very humble servant            C  TRUEWORTH        Mr  Trueworth having dispatched this letter  which he doubted not but   would finish all his concerns with Miss Betsy  thought he had nothing   more to do than to take leave of the friends he had in town
