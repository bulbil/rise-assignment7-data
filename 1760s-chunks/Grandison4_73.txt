were going to put  Miss Byron may come to hear the substance of a conversation that is of a very delicate nature—As I know not what will be the result of my journey abroad  I should think myself a very selfish man  and a very dishonourable one to two Ladies of equal delicacy and worthiness  if I sought to involve  as I hinted before  in my own uncertainties  a young Lady whose prudence and great qualities must make herself and any man happy  whom she shall favour with her hand        To be still more explicit  proceeded he  With what face could I look up to a woman of honour and delicacy  such a one as the Lady before whom I now stand  if I could own a wish  that  while my honour has laid me under obligation to one Lady  if she shall be permitted to accept of me  I should presume to hope  that another  no less worthy  would hold her favour for me suspended  till she saw what would be the issue of the first obligation  No  madam  I could sooner die  than offer such indignity to BOTH  I am fettered  added he  but Miss Byron is free  And so is the Lady abroad  My attendance on her at this time  is indispensable  but I make not any conditions for myself—My reward will be in the consciousness of having discharged the obligations that I think myself under  as a man of honour        183 The countess s voice changed in repeating this speech of his  And she stopt to praise him  and then went on   You are THE man  indeed  Sir —But then give me leave to ask you  As I think it very likely that you will be married before you return to England  Whether now that you have been so good as to speak favourably of my son  and that you call Miss Byron Sister  you will oblige him with a recommendation to that sister      The Countess of D  shews  by this request  her value for a young Lady who deserves it  and the more  for its being  I think  Excuse me  madam  a pretty extraordinary one  But what a presumption would it be in me  to suppose that I had SUCH an interest with Miss Byron  when she has relations as worthy of her  as she is of them      You may guess  my dear  said the Countess  that I should not have put this question  but as a trial of his heart  However  I asked his pardon  and told him  that I would not believe he gave it me  except he would promise to mention to Miss Byron  that I had made him a visit on this subject  Methinks  Lucy  I should have been glad that he had not let me know that he was so forgiving     And now  my dear  said the Lady  let me turn about —She did  and put one arm round my neck  and with my own handkerchief wiped my eyes  and kissed my cheek  and when she saw me a little recovered  she addressed me as follows   Now  my good young creature   O that you would let me call you daughter in my own way  for I think I must always call you so  whether you do  or not  let me ask you  as if I were your real mother     Have you any expectation that Sir Charles Grandison will be yours      Dear madam  Is not this as hard a question to be put to me  as that which you put to him     184 Yes  my dear—full as hard  And I am as ready to ask your pardon  as I was his  if you are really displeased with me for putting it  Are you  Miss Byron  Excuse me  Mrs  Reeves  for thus urging your lovely cousin  I am at least entitled to the excuse Sir Charles Grandison made for me  that it is a demonstration of my value for her   I have declared  madam  returned I  and it is from my heart  that I think he ought to be the husband of the Lady abroad  And tho  I prefer him to all the men I ever saw  yet I have resolved  if possible  to conquer the particular regard I have for him  He has in a very noble manner offered me his friendship  so long as it may be accepted without interfering with any other attachments on my part  And I will be satisfied with that   A friendship so pure  replied the Countess  as that of such a man  is consistent with any other attachments  My Lord D  will  with his whole Soul  contribute all in his power to strengthen it  He admires Sir Charles Grandison  He would think it a double honour to be acquainted with him through you  Dearest Miss Byron  take another worthy young man into your friendship  but with a tenderer name  I shall then claim a fourth place in it for myself  O my dear  What a
