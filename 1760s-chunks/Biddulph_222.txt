the manuscript  and feared it was lost  However  he said  he would search her papers and  if he recovered it  it should be at his service   After some time  the gentleman informed the editor  that he had made the strictest scrutiny into his mother’s papers  and could find nothing relative to the subject of Mrs Arnold  excepting a few loose sheets  which seemed to have been the foul copy of the beginning of her narrative  and  at the same time  put them into his hands   These the editor offers to the publick  as he received them  without any alteration or addition     CECILIA’S NARRATIVE   c  Being a Supplement to Mrs Arnold’s Journal  I set out on my return to England  immediately after the receipt of her last journal  the melancholy close of which had exceedingly terrified and afflicted me   Immediately on my arrival in London  I flew to the dear friend of my heart  she was still at her house  in Pall mall   I found the dear Sidney alone  in her bed chamber  She had been prepared to receive me  but though I had endeavoured to arm myself with resolution for this affecting interview  I was not mistress of myself at the sight of her   The tears I shed did not spring from that sweet emotion  which long severed friends feel at seeing each other again  I wept in sorrow for the heavy misfortunes of the best of women   But Mrs Arnold  still herself  and superior to adversity  received me with the tenderest marks of friendship  and with a composure that amazed me   Piety  meekness  and patience  were ever Mrs Arnold’s characteristics  and they now all appeared blended  and so strongly impressed on her beautiful face  that I could not look at her without admiration   As I was astonished to find her so calm under so trying an affliction  I could not help expressing myself to that purpose  but Mrs Arnold checked me  with this reply  ‘I have been set up as a mark  my Cecilia  let me fulfil the intention of my Maker  by shewing a perfect resignation to His will  I hope  my task is almost finished  and that he will soon permit me to return to the dust from which I came ’  Frederick Hildy had arrived from Ireland above a fortnight before  with Master Faulkland  a beautiful child of about five years old  They were both lodged in Mrs Arnold’s house   She told me  that Sir George Bidulph and Mr Warner had set out    together for Holland  immediately after the receipt of the letter  which informed them of Mrs Faulkland’s being alive   My brother  said Mrs Arnold  thought it necessary himself to be the bearer of news so fatal in its import to his friend  He hoped besides he should be able to return and stand his trial for having killed Major Smyth  as there is no doubt of his being acquitted  all Mr Bond’s family being now convinced  from Mrs Faulkland’s own confession  that there was nothing premeditated in this fatal event  and that what Mr Faulkland did  was in defence of his own life   I have writ  continued she  to Mr Faulkland  to endeavour to console him under our mutual misfortune   At my request  she shewed me a copy  of this letter  wherein she assured him  she would take the tenderest care of his son  ’till the child could be delivered safe into his hands  and conjured him  for that child’s sake  to be careful of his own interest and preservation  adding  that as their ill fated marriage was an absolute secret to every one but the persons immediately concerned  she hoped he would not suffer the thoughts of it to break in upon his future quiet  and concluded with beseeching him to forget her  as they were never more to meet   This was the substance of what she wrote  There were no murmurings at her fate  no womanish complainings  mixed with the tender  yet noble sentiments of her heart  She endeavoured to conceal her own anguish under the mask of contentment  that Mr Faulkland might the better support this final destruction of all his hopes   I asked her  whether she had heard since from Mr Faulkland  She told me she had as yet received no answer from him to this letter  but that she had heard severally from Sir George and Mr Warner  who both informed her  that Mr Faulkland  after his first transports of surprize and grief were over  at receiving this new and unexpected blow  had grown more calm  and seemed inclined to return with them to England  Sir George added  in the last letter she had from him  that they only waited ’till Mr Warner had accomplished the business that he had to do in Holland  and hoped  before a fortnight was at an end  to return home  and to have the pleasure of conducting Mr Faulkland back   It is ten days  continued Mrs Arnold  since I received this account  and I flatter myself  that they may now be on their journey homeward     Mrs Arnold said  that she waited but for
