and gave her a strong invitation to go and see her   This invitation our heroine thought sit to comply with  and while they were drinking tea  the abandoned prostitute found means to convey what she imagined to be arsenick into Miss ELLIOT S tea  unperceived  It was by good luck no other than a chymical preparation  innocent in itself  though violent in the operation  This our heroine experienced  for in about half an hour she turned very sick  and was obliged to call a chair to carry her home  When all was over  sensible that her illness was the effect of the resentment of Captain R—rt s mistress  she resolved to break off all further intercourse with him  for fear that her rival should some time or other be more successful in an attempt on her life  She therefore told Captain R—rts her reasons for desiring him to discontinue his visits  and she was so cautious  that she absolutely refused ever to admit of his visits any more  though he offered to  and did in reality turn off his former mistress     115About this time our heroine s sister  who  as we have seen in the former part of this history  had used her very ill  by running away with the barber  and taking with her the most valuable things given to her by Miss ELLIOT  having met with great misfortunes  was  through a complicated series of cross accidents  reduced to ply the streets in the night  soliciting any body for a glass of wine  or a beef steak  and brought to the greatest necessity in an hospital  found means to convey a letter to Miss ELLIOT  begging her assistance in the humblest manner  and expressing great compunction for her former misbehaviour   Our heroine no sooner received the account of FANNY S unhappy situation  than her heart was moved with pity and compassion for her sufferings  and she resolved to give her that succour which she  as a sister  had a right to expect from her  She accordingly flew to the hospital where her sister was  and if she compassionated her unhappy situation before  what were the emotions of her heart when she saw her extended on a bed almost in a   116 dying condition  She approached her  and bade her take courage  for that she was ready to assist her to the utmost of her power  She accordingly gave the nurse who attended her a crown  and desired her to acquaint the governor of the hospital  that she was come to fetch her sister away  in order to carry her to a place  where she would be more at ease during her recovery  A chair was then called  and Miss ELLIOT S sister  being wrapped up in blankets  was put into it  and in that manner conveyed to a proper lodging already provided for her  As soon as she was well enough to sit up  she gave Miss ELLIOT a faithful account of all that had happened to her after her elopement with the barber  She related how he had stripped her of every thing  and left her with child  that she had  by the interest of friends  procured its admission into the Foundling hospital  that after a variety of adventures  attended with different success  she became at length reduced to the lowest state of prostitution  and having contracted a distemper very common among ladies of her   117 stamp  she with difficulty procured a letter of admission into the hospital  where she had found a way of acquainting her sister with her deplorable state   Our heroine then asked her what she intended to do to procure a subsistence  as she perceived  by her discourse  that she intended to live more chastly than she had heretofore done  This question puzzled her not a little  but Miss ELLIOT soon relieved her from her anxiety  by telling her  that she would allow her fifty pounds per annum  if she would retire somewhere into the country where she was not known  This FANNY joyfully acquiesced in  and as soon as her health would permit   she went down into Wales  where she changed her name  and really became a pattern of the most rigid virtue   And here I cannot help making the following few reflections on the unhappiness so essentially connected with the life of a prostitute  which  tho  it is most desp•••ble  is certainly most piteous  and if persons would but candidly reflect on the too general cause of prostitution  they   118 would smooth the wrinkled brow of contempt  and from the frown of disdain  dissolve into the tear of compassion   It may be affirmed from universal experience  that loss of female virtue oftner proceeds from weakness than from vice  an inoffensive weakness  which inclines to an implicit reliance on the deluding vows of some perjured debauchee  or alluring protestations of some insinuating rake   When virtue is once lost  the descent down the precipice of vice is very rapid  conscious guilt  and bad example  insensibly hurl the distracted mind  not only into absolute dissipation  but total depravity  Hence follow a dissolution of morals  a disregard to decency  and all the train of amiable qualities that can adorn beauty in a state of innocence  and then succeeds every mental deformity that can tarnish a lovely
