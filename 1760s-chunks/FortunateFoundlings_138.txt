to imagine  He knocked at the gate  which being opened by the   porter  and he desiring to speak with his master  was answered with many   impertinent questions  as  who he came from  what his business was  and   such like interrogatories which the sawciness of servants generally put   to persons such as this fellow took Horatio to be by his appearance  But   he had no sooner desired he would tell Dorilaus that he came from   Russia  and brought intelligence of Horatio  than his tone of voice and   behaviour was quite changed   Our traveller was now carried into a   parlour and entreated to sit down  and the late surly porter called   hastily for one of the servants  bidding him  with the utmost joy  run   in and inform his master that here was a person come from Russia that   could give him news of colonel Horatio       This a little raised the lately depressed spirits of Horatio  as it   assured him his name was not unknown in that family  nor had been   mentioned with indifference       He attended but a very little time before he was shewed up into   Dorilaus s apartment  who was just opening his mouth to enquire if   Horatio were yet living  and in what condition  when he saw it was   himself  Surprize and joy rendered him incapable either of speaking to   him  or hearing the apologies he was beginning to make for having   disobeyed his commands   but he fell upon his neck and gave him an   embrace  which dissipated all Horatio s fears  and left him no room to   doubt if his peace was made       No words were exchanged between them for a considerable time  but  oh my   dear son  my ever loved Horatio  on the one side  my more than father    patron  on the other   at length the tumultuous rapture of so unexpected   a meeting and reception  giving way to a more peaceful calm   Dorilaus   made Horatio relate all the particulars had happened to him  and when he   had ended  now  said he  I will reward the sincerity I easily perceive   you have made use of in this narrative  by acquainting you  in my turn    with secrets you are far from having any notion of  and which  I   believe  will compensate for all your sufferings  and make you own    that while you seemed to groan under the utmost severities of fortune    she was preparing for you all the blessings in her power to give  and   even more than your ambition aimed at  But I have first a message to   dispatch  continued he  at my return you shall know all       With these words he went out of the room  but came back in a moment    and  after renewing his embraces to Horatio  revealed to him the whole   secret of his birth  with all had happened to Louisa till the time of   their happy meeting in Paris       With what pleasing wonder the soul of Horatio was filled at this   discovery  is much more easy to conceive than describe  so I shall leave   it to the reader s imagination to guess what it was he felt and spoke on   so extraordinary an occasion  While he was pouring out the transports it   occasioned in the most grateful thanks to heaven  and his new found   father  Louisa entered  Dorilaus having sent to the baron de Palfoy s    where he knew she was  to let her know a messenger from Russia was   arrived with news of her brother   they instantly knew each other    though it was upwards of four years since they were separated  and in   that time the stature of both considerably increased   nothing could   exceed the joy of these amiable twins   never was felicity more perfect    which yet received addition on Horatio s part  when Louisa told him    that it was as much as Charlotta could do to restrain herself from   coming with her to hear what account the supposed messenger had brought       Dorilaus on this immediately sent to let her know his son was well  and   expected in Paris the next day  for he would not suffer him to appear   before her  or the baron  till a habit was made for him more agreeable   to his condition than that he arrived in  It is certain that the   impatience of a lover would have made Horatio gladly wave this ceremony    but he would not a second time dispute the commands of such a father       But wherefore should I delay the attention of my reader  who  I doubt   not  but easily perceives by this time how things will end  so I shall
