tenderness in distant respect  Though her person demands particular regard even among the beauties of Circassia  yet is her mind far more lovely  How very different is a woman who thus has cultivated her understanding  and been refined into delicacy of sentiment  from the daughters of the east  whose   258 education is only formed to improve the person  and make them more tempting objects of prostitution  Adieu   LETTER LVII  From Hingpo to Lien Chi Altangi  by the way of Moscow   WHEN sufficiently refreshed after the fatigues of our precipitate flight  my curiosity  which had been restrained by the appearance of immediate danger  now began to revive  I longed to know by what distressful accidents my fair fugitive became a captive  and could not avoid testifying a surprize how so much beauty could be involved in the calamities from whence she had been so lately rescued   Talk not of personal charms  cried she with emotion  since to them I owe every misfortune  look round on the numberless beauties of the country where we are  and see how nature has poured its charms upon every face  and yet by this profusion heaven would seem to shew how little it regards such a blessing  since the gift is lavished upon a nation of prostitutes   I perceive you desire to know my story  and your curiosity is not so great as my impatience to gratify it  I find a pleasure in telling part misfortunes to any  but when my deliverer is pleased with the relation  my pleasure is prompted by duty     259 I   was born in a country far to the west  where the men are braver  and the women more fair than those of Circassia  where the valour of the hero is guided by wisdom  and where delicacy of sentiment points the shafts of female beauty  I was the only daughter of an officer in the army  the child of his age  and as he used fondly to express it  the only chain that bound him to the world  or made his life pleasing  His station procured him an acquaintance with men of greater rank of fortune than himself  and his regard for me induced him to bring me into every family where he was acquainted  Thus I was early taught all the elegancies and fashionable foibles of such as the world calls polite  and though without fortune myself  was taught to despise those who lived as if they were poor   My intercourse with the great  and my affectation of grandeur procured me many lovers  but want of fortune deterred them all from any other views than those of passing the present moment agreeably  or of meditating my future ruin  In every company I found myself addressed in a warmer strain of passion  than other ladies who were superior in point of rank and beauty  and this I imputed to an excess of respect  which in reality proceeded from very different motives   Among the number of such as paid me their addresses  was a gentleman  a friend of my father  rather in the decline of life  with nothing remarkable either in his person or address to recommend   260 commend him  His age which was about forty  his fortune which was moderate  and barely sufficient to support him  served to throw me off my guard  so that I considered him as the only sincere admirer I had   Designing lovers in the decline of life are ever most dangerous  Skilled in all the weaknesses of the sex  they seize each favourable opportunity  and by having less passion than youthful admirers  have less real respect  and therefore less timidity  This insidious wretch used a thousand arts to succeed in his base designs  all which I saw  but imputed to different views  because I thought it absurd to believe the real motives   As he continued to frequent my father s  the friendship between them became every day greater  and at last from the intimacy with which he was received  I was taught to look upon him as a guardian and a friend  Though I never loved  yet I esteemed him  and this was enough to make me wish for an union  for which he seemed desirous  but to which he feigned several delays  while in the mean time  from a false report of our being married  every other admirer forsook me   I was at last however awakened from the delusion  by an account of his being just married to another young lady with a considerable fortune  This was no great mortification to me  as I had always regarded him merely from prudential motives  but it had a very different effect upon my father  who  rash and passionate by nature  and besides stimulated by a mistaken notion of military honour  upbraided his friend in such   261 terms  that a challenge was soon given and accepted   It was about midnight when I was awakened by a message from my father  who desired to see me that moment  I rose with some surprize  and following the messenger  attended only by another servant  came to a field not far from the house  where I found him  the assertor of my honour  my only friend and supporter  the tutor and companion of my youth  lying on one side covered over
