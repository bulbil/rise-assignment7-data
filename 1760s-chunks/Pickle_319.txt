all that  mortification which a youth of his pride and sensibility may be supposed  to feel from such a disagreeable necessity  he one day heard himself  called by name  as he crossed the park  and  turning  perceived the wife  of Captain Gauntlet  with another lady  He no sooner recognized the kind  Sophy  than he accosted her with his wonted civility and friendship   but his former sprightly air was metamorphosed into such austerity  or  rather dejection of feature  that she could scarce believe her own eyes   and  in her astonishment   Is it possible   said she   that the gay Mr   Pickle should be so much altered in such a short space of time   He made    6 22 15  3 45 PM   no other reply to this exclamation  but by a languid smile  and asked  how long she had been in town  observing  that he would have paid his  compliments to her at her own lodgings  had he been favoured with  the least intimation of her arrival  After having thanked him for his  politeness  she told him  it was not owing to any abatement of her  friendship and esteem for him  that she had omitted to give him that  notice  but his abrupt departure from Windsor  and the manner in which  he quitted Mr  Gauntlet  had given her just grounds to believe that they  had incurred his displeasure  which suspicion was reinforced by his long  silence and neglect from that period to the present time  She observed  it was still farther confirmed  by his forbearing to inquire for Emilia  and her brother   judge  then   said she   if I had any reason to  believe that you would be pleased to hear that I was in town  However   I will not detain you at present  because you seem to be engaged about  some particular business  but  if you will favour me with your company  at breakfast to morrow  I shall be much pleased  and honoured to boot   by the visit   So saying  she gave him a direction to her lodgings   and he took his leave  with a faithful promise of seeing her at the  appointed time   He was very much affected with this advance of Sophy  which he  considered as an instance of her uncommon sweetness of temper  he  felt strange longings of returning friendship towards Godfrey  and the  remembrance of Emilia melted his heart  already softened with grief and  mortification  Next day he did not neglect his engagement  and had the  pleasure of enjoying a long conversation with this sensible young lady   who gave him to understand that her husband was with his regiment  and  presented to him a fine boy  the first fruits of their love  whom they  had christened by the name of Peregrine  in memory of the friendship  which had subsisted between Godfrey and our youth   This proof of their regard  notwithstanding the interruption in their  correspondence  made a deep impression upon the mind of our adventurer   who having made the warmest acknowledgments for this undeserved mark  of respect  took the child in his arms  and almost devoured him with  kisses  protesting before God  that he should always consider him with  the tenderness of a parent  This was the highest compliment he could pay  to the gentle Sophy  who again kindly chid him for his disdainful and  precipitate retreat  immediately after her marriage  and expressed an  earnest desire of seeing him and the captain reconciled  He assured her   nothing could give him greater satisfaction than such an event  to which  he would contribute all that lay in his power  though he could not help  looking upon himself as injured by Captain Gauntlet s behaviour   which denoted a suspicion of his honour  as well as contempt for his  understanding  The lady undertook for the concession of her husband   who  she told him  had been extremely sorry for his own heat  after  Mr  Pickle s departure  and would have followed him to the garrison  in  order to solicit his forgiveness  had he not been restrained by certain  punctilios  occasioned by some acrimonious expressions that dropped from  Peregrine at the inn   After having cleared up this misunderstanding  she proceeded to give an  account of Emilia  whose behaviour  at that juncture  plainly indicated  a continuance of affection for her first lover  and desired  that  he would give her full powers to bring that matter also to an  accommodation   For I am not more certain of my own existence   said  she   than that you are still in possession of my sister s heart   At    6 22 15  3 45 PM   this declaration  the tear started in his eye  But he shook his head   and declined her good offices  wishing that the young lady might be much  more happy than ever he should be able to make her   Mrs  Gauntlet  confounded at these expressions  and moved by the
