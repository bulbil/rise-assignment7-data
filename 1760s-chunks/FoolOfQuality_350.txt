chaplain shall  this minute  unite you by   ties that death alone can sunder  Alas   my precious babes  1 little   expected that your nuptials should be celebrated by tears and   wailings   But better these than no nuptials  When you are once   joined  I shall care little for myself  And  if we meet no more   here  we may yet meet hereafter  as happily as the barbarians who   tear us asunder      The chaplain was then summoned  and  having performed his   office  no congratulations nor salutations ensued  save a kiss and a   sigh of mine on the hand of my angel  The marquis then called   me  and  drawing me down to him  he pressed me ardently to his   bosom  cried O my Harry   O my Harry   burst into tears  and   dismissed me      Mean while  all was in bustle and hurry throughout the palace    No festival was prepared  no bridal bed laid  Horses  arms  and car    riages  were all the cry   and the marchioness  with an anguishing   heart  but amazing resolution  issued her orders with a presence of   mind that seemed serene in the midst of tempest      I then sent for my brave fellows  with orders to double their   arms  and to double their ammunition  They came accordingly    It was now within three hours of day  All was despatched all in   readiness   the carriages were at the gate  Silence sat on every   tongue  and a tear on every cheek  I threw myself at my mother s   feet  I clasped  I clung to them   she wept aloud over me  but   neither of us uttered a word  When  rending myself away I took   my sobbing Louisa under my arm  seated her gently in her chariot    placed myself to support her  and away we drove      When we got clear of the town  and were speeding on the way    my Louisa started and cried out O how fast how very fast they   take me from you  my mamma   Whither  whither do they carry   me  perhaps never to return  never to meet again  I answered   not  but kissed her head  and drew her gently to me  and she   seemed more at ease  But  after a while  I felt her agitation at   my bosom  and she exclaimed From my birth to this hour of woe    my blessed mamma  never was I from those dear arms of yours     shall I ever  shall I ever again behold those eyes that used to look   with such fondness upon me       Here I could no longer contain  but taking her hands between   mine  and weeping upon them  I said Will you then  my angel   are you resolved upon breaking the heart of your Harry    no   says she   no   not for worlds upon worlds would I break   that dear and feeling heart  the heart of my heart  the heart of   which I became enamoured  She then leaned her head fondly over    and in a while fell fast asleep   while my arms gently encircled and     o c2         388 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      my soul hovered over her  as the wings of a turtle over her new    begotten      When she awoke  and found herself so endearingly situated  she   gave me a look that overvalued the ransom of a monarch   she   kissed my hands in turns  she kissed the skirts of my garments  O    she cried  I will endeavour  I will do my best to be more composed     I know I ought not to repine  I am too rich too happy  I   ought to wish for nothing more  I ought to wish for no one more     since my Harry is so near me  since I have him to myself  But   but and here her lovely lips began again to work  and the drops   that trembled in her living brilliants could hardly be restrained   from breaking prison  Soon after the grief of her heart over    weighed her spirits  and she fell asleep into my arms  that opened   of themselves to receive her      On setting up for the night  I rejoiced to find that my Louisa   was something more easy   and that her repose on the way had   greatly deducted from the fatigue that I apprehended      At length we reached Calais  and immediately sent to the beach   to engage a ship for wafting us over to the land of freedom
