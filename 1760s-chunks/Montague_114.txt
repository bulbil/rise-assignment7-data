     I am afraid Emily knows your secret  she has been in tears almost ever since we came  the servant is going to the post office  and I have but a moment to tell you we will stay here till your arrival  which you will hasten as much as possible       Adieu   Your affectionate  J  FITZGERALD     LETTER CLXXXVII   187   To Colonel RIVERS  at Bellfield  Rutland   Rose hill  Sept  18   IF I was not certain of your esteem and friendship  my dear Rivers  I should tremble at the request I am going to make you       It is to suspend our marriage for some time  and not ask me the reason of this delay       Be assured of my tenderness  be assured my whole soul is yours  that you are dearer to me than life  that I love you as never woman loved  that I live  I breathe but for you  that I would die to make you happy       In what words shall I convey to the most beloved of his sex  the ardent tenderness of my soul  how convince him of what I suffer from being forced to make a request so contrary to the dictates of my heart       He cannot  will not doubt his Emily s affection  I cannot support the idea that it is possible he should for one instant  What I suffer at this moment is inexpressible       My heart is too much agitated to say more       I will write again in a few days       I know not what I would say  but indeed  my Rivers  I love you  you yourself can scarce form an idea to what excess       Adieu  Your faithful  EMILY MONTAGUE     LETTER CLXXXVIII   188   To Miss MONTAGUE  Rose hill  Berkshire   Bellfield  Sept  20   NO  Emily  you never loved  I have been long hurt by your tranquillity in regard to our marriage  your too scrupulous attention to decorum in leaving my sister s house might have alarmed me  if love had not placed a bandage before my eyes       Cruel girl  I repeat it  you never loved  I have your friendship  but you know nothing of that ardent passion  that dear enthusiasm  which makes us indifferent to all but itself  your love is from the imagination  not the heart       The very professions of tenderness in your last  are a proof of your consciousness of indifference  you repeat too often that you love me  you say too much  that anxiety to persuade me of your affection  shews too plainly you are sensible I have reason to doubt it       You have placed me on the rack  a thousand fears  a thousand doubts  succeed each other in my soul  Has some happier man       No  my Emily  distracted as I am  I will not be unjust  I do not suspect you of inconstancy   tis of your coldness only I complain  you never felt the lively impatience of love  or you would not condemn a man  whom you at least esteem  to suffer longer its unutterable tortures       If there is a real cause for this delay  why conceal it from me  have I not a right to know what so nearly interests me  but what cause  are you not mistress of yourself       My Emily  you blush to own to me the insensibility of your heart  you once fancied you loved  you are ashamed to say you were mistaken       You cannot surely have been influenced by any motive relative to our fortune  no idle tale can have made you retract a promise  which rendered me the happiest of mankind  if I have your heart  I am richer than an oriental monarch       Short as life is  my dearest girl  is it of consequence what part we play in it  is wealth at all essential to happiness       The tender affections are the only sources of true pleasure  the highest  the most respectable titles  in the eye of reason  are the tender ones of friend  of husband  and of father  it is from the dear soft ties of social love your Rivers expects his felicity       You have but one way  my dear Emily  to convince me of your tenderness  I shall set off for Rose hill in twelve hours  you must give me your hand the moment I arrive  or confess your Rivers was never dear to you       Write  and send a servant instantly to meet me at my mother s house in town  I cannot support the torment of suspense       There is not on earth so wretched a being as I am at this moment  I never knew till now to what excess I loved  you must be mine  my Emily  or I must cease to live     LETTER CLXXXIX   189   To Captain FITZGERALD  Rose hill  Berkshire   Bellfield  Sept  20   ALL I feared has certainly happened  Emily has undoubtedly heard of this proposal
