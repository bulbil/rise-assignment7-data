  he shall receive his discharge from me to morrow morning  before he puts a finger in the fricandeaus  thus you will have nothing more to fear either from his poisonous sauces or bewitching tongue  Yet it goes rather against the grain with me to part with so good a cook  but I sacrifice the interests of my own belly to the preservation of your precious person  You need not  said I  take on so for his loss  he had no exclusive patent  and I will send to Valencia for a cook  who shall outcook all his fine cookery  According to my promise I wrote immediately to Don Alphonso  to let him know that our kitchen wanted a prime minister  and on the following day he filled up the vacancy in so worthy a manner  as reconciled Scipio at once to the change in culinary politics   Though my adroit and active secretary had assured me of Antonia s secret self congratulation on the conquest of her landlord s heart  I could not venture to rely solely on his report  I was fearful lest he should have been entrapped by false appearances  To be more certain of my bliss  I determined on speaking in person to the fair Antonia  I therefore went to Basil s house  and confirmed to him what my ambassador had announced  This honest peasant  of patriarchal simplicity and golden aged frankness  after having heard me through  did not hesitate to own that it would be the greatest happiness of his life to give me his daughter  but  added he  you are by no means to suppose that it is because you are lord of the manor  Were you still steward to Don Caesar and Don Alphonso  I should prefer you to all other suitors who might apply  I have always felt a sort of kindness towards you  and nothing vexes me  but that Antonia has not a thumping fortune to bring with her  I want not the vile dross  said I  her person is the only dowry that I covet  Your humble servant for that  cried he  but you will not settle accounts with me after that fashion  I am not a beggar  to marry my daughter upon charity  Basil de Buenotrigo is in circumstances  by the blessing of Providence  to portion her off decently  and I mean that she should set out a little supper  if you are to be at the expense of dinners  In a word  the rental of this estate is only five hundred ducats  I shall raise it to a thousand on the strength of this marriage   Just as you please  my dear Basil  replied I  we are not likely to have any dispute about money matters  We are both of a mind  all that remains is to get your daughter s consent  You have mine  said he  and that is enough  Not altogether so  answered I  though yours may he absolutely necessary  no business can be done without hers  Hers follows mine of course  replied he  I should like to catch her murmuring against my sovereign commands  Antonia  rejoined I  with dutiful submission to paternal authority  is ready without question to obey your will implicitly in all things  but I know not whether in the present instance she would do so without violence to her own feelings  and should that be the case  I could never forgive myself for being the occasion of unhappiness to her  in short  it is not enough that I obtain her hand from you  if her heart is to heave a sigh at the decision of her destiny  Oh  blessed virgin  said Basil  all these fine doctrines of philosophy are far above my reach  speak to Antonia your own self  and you wilt find  or I am very much mistaken  that she wishes for nothing better than to be your wife  These words were no sooner out of his mouth than he called his daughter  and left me with her for a few short minutes   Not to trifle with so precious an opportunity  I broke my mind to her at once  Lovely Antonia  said I  it remains with you to fix the colour of my future days  Though I have your father s consent  do not think so meanly of me as to suppose that I would avail myself of it to violate the sacred freedom of your choice  Rapturous as must be the possession of your charms  I waive my pretensions if you but tell me that your duty and not your will complies  It would be affectation to put on such a repugnance  answered she  the honour of your addresses is too flattering to excite any other than agreeable sensations  and I am thankful for my father s tender care of me  instead of demurring to his will  I am not sure whether such an acknowledgment may not be contrary to the rules of female reserve in the polite world  but if you were disagreeable to me  I should be plain spoken enough to tell you so  why  then  should I not be equally free in owning the kind feelings of my heart  At sounds like these  which I could not bear without being enraptured  I dropped on my knee before Antonia  and in the excess of my tender emotions
