first love  I have heard you speak of it  but I forget the circumstances  As I had never heard my mother make any mention of this particular  I begged she would oblige me with relating it   When I was about one and twenty  daughter  said she  a match was concluded by my father between me and a very fine gentleman  I loved him  and  as I suppose all young women do in the like circumstances  believed myself equally beloved by him  The courtship had been of a year’s standing  for you must know I was not very easily won  Every thing was settled  and the day appointed for our marriage arrived  when  instead of the bridegroom  whom we every minute expected  there came a letter from him directed to me  The contents were  that having formerly been engaged to a young lady by the most solemn vows  he had  unfortunately for them both  forgot them all on seeing me  and had broke through every obligation divine and human to obtain me  He intreated mine  and my family’s pardon  in the most pathetic manner  for having engaged our esteem so far as to consent to an union  of which he found himself unworthy  and which it was impossible for him to accomplish  for  said he  the wrongs I have done the woman  whose youth I seduced  rise to my imagination with so much horror  that  for the empire of the world  I would not complete my guilt  by devoting that hand to another  to which she only has a right  He enlarged greatly on the sufferings of his heart  in the struggle between his love for me  and his duty to the person who had his first vows  and whom  he declared  his infidelity had almost brought to the grave  He claimed my pity  both on his own and her account  and repeatedly intreated my forgiveness of his fault   The whole letter  which was very long  was so expressive of a    mind overwhelmed with despair  that I was exceedingly shocked at the reading of it  What could I say  The plea he offered for his seemingly strange conduct  was too just to admit of any objections  I own the disappointment afflicted me  but I bore it with a becoming resolution  My family were at first exceedingly exasperated against my doubly unfaithful lover  but  upon enquiring into the facts  they found the truth to be as he had represented it  The conclusion was  that  upon the very day on which he was to have been married to me  and on which he had writ me that gloomy letter  he was seized with a melancholy  with increasing on him daily  soon after ended in absolute madness  and he was obliged to be confined for the remainder for his life  The young lady lived but a short time after the melancholy fate of her lover  and died  as it was said  of a broken heart   It was a great comfort to me to reflect that my fate disposed otherwise of me than to this unhappy gentleman  for I am very sure  had these fatal events happened in consequence of my marriage with him  that I should never have survived it   This extraordinary anecdote of my mother’s life  which I had never had a hint of before  for she could not speak of it without great emotion   very much affected me  Sir George said  the story was more tragical than he had apprehended  and told my mother  that was an accident which fell out between the cup and the lip  with a vengeance   My mother continued thoughtful for a good while  and I was sorry that the memory of this melancholy story had been revived  but Sir George talked and laughed us both in spirits again   July 6  This Mr Faulkland is a princely man  he has sent me such a set of jewels  My mother says they are too fine for a private gentlewoman  but George tells her they are not a bit too fine for Mr Faulkland’s wife  and only suitable to his fortune  You know I have but few of my own  those only which were my mother’s when she was a maiden  The greatest part of her’s  and by much the finest  were presented to her by my father  but those she reserves for Sir George  against the time of his marriage  as a present for his lady  for they are family jewels   July 8  My probation is over  my Cecilia —The formidable question has been put to me  and I have answered it—Ay marry  say you  but how     In the negative  to be sure  my dear—No  no  my Cecilia  a valuable  psha  what an affected cold word that is   a lovely and most worthy man  with six thousand pounds a year  is a prize that a country girl must not expect to draw every day  Mr Faulkland  in lover like phrase  demanded from me the time of his destined happiness  I referred him to my mother  She  good and delicate as she is  referred him back to Sir George  George blurted out some
