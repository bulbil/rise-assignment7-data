 they can be brought to know their own interest   and I am sure you will use her kindly for my sake  for  excepting   this matter  which she will not own  she does not want prudence and   discretion  I will acknowledge any trouble you shall be at in this   matter the first opportunity  and am                                     Your Friend and Servant           He had said  too cunningly for me  that I would not own this pretended   love affair  so that he had provided them not to believe me  say what I   would  and as they were his tenants  who all love him   for he has some   amiable qualities  and so he had need   I saw all my plot cut out  and   so was forced to say the less       I wept bitterly  however  for I found he was too hard for me  as well in   his contrivances as riches  and so had recourse again to my only refuge    comforting myself  that God never fails to take the innocent heart into   his protection  and is alone able to baffle and confound the devices of   the mighty  Nay  the farmer was so prepossessed with the contents of   his letter  that he began to praise his care and concern for me  and to   advise me against entertaining addresses without my friends  advice   and consent  and made me the subject of a lesson for his daughter s   improvement  So I was glad to shut up this discourse  for I saw I was   not likely to be believed       I sent  however  to tell my driver  that I was so fatigued  I could not   get out so soon the next morning  But he insisted upon it  and said    It would make my day s journey the lighter  and I found he was a more   faithful servant to his master  notwithstanding what he wrote of his   reluctance  than I could have wished  I saw still more and more  that   all was deep dissimulation  and contrivance worse and worse       Indeed I might have shewn them his letter to me  as a full confutation   of his to them  but I saw no probability of engaging them in my behalf    and so thought it signified little  as I was to go away so soon  to   enter more particularly into the matter with them  and besides  I saw   they were not inclinable to let me stay longer  for fear of disobliging   him so I went to bed  but had very little rest  and they would make   their servant maid bear me company in the chariot five miles  early in   the morning  and she was to walk hack       I had contrived in my thoughts  when I was on my way in the chariot  on   Friday morning  that when we came into some town to bait  as he must do   for the horses  sake  I would  at the inn  apply myself  if I saw I any   way could  to the mistress of the inn  and tell her the case  and to   refuse to go farther  having nobody but this wicked coachman to contend   with       Well  I was very full of this project  and in great hopes  some how or   other  to extricate myself in this way  But  oh  the artful wretch had   provided for even this last refuge of mine  for when we came to put up   at a large town on the way  to eat a morsel for dinner  and I was fully   resolved to execute my project  who should be at the inn that he put up   at  but the wicked Mrs  Jewkes  expecting me  And her sister in law was   the mistress of it  and she had provided a little entertainment for me       And this I found  when I desired  as soon as I came in  to speak with   the mistress of the house  She came to me  and I said  I am a poor   unhappy young body  that want your advice and assistance  and you seem   to be a good sort of a gentlewoman  that would assist an oppressed   innocent person  Yes  madam  said she  I hope you guess right  and I   have the happiness to know something of the matter before you speak    Pray call my sister Jewkes   Jewkes  Jewkes  thought I  I have heard of   that name  I don t like it
