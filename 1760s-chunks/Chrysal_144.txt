it           A thousand guineas  please your grace    replied her woman    â   which I really think enough for it  considering everything          Do you  indeed   but I do not  Why  it is rated to me here   as worth five hundred pounds a year  and is that worth no more   than a thousand guineas   Does the fellow value his own life only   at two years  purchase           Five hundred pounds a year I How can that be   The salary   is no more than sixty   there must be some mistake in your return  t       The salary  the salary signifies nothing   it is the perqxiisitesi   The perquisites are the thing   Do you think any place is valued   by the salary   The perquisites of this place are very considerable    Let me see i Why  he buys in all the beer and gin himself  for   which he can charge what price he pleases  and then his own account   is taken fori the quantity that is drank  Ay  indeed   there must   be a mistake in my return  to be sure  but not of the kind you mean    The place is rated too low  for  with such opportunities  it must be   worth twice the sum  and I shall inquire into that matter before I   dispose of the place  A thousand guineas for such a place   I   wonder at the fellow s conscience to make such an offer          All this is very true   but then there are some circumstances   that must be considered on the other hand too  You know the   Lord  Mayor s year is almost ended  and then  who knows whether         154 ADVENTVRE8 OF A GUINEA     his successor will continue all the servants or not   This one t   certainly is most likely he will not   for  as he is a known enemy to   gambling  and has publicly declared that he will put the laws in   execution against all such practices  it cannot be thought that he   will permit a fellow who has kept a house that has been so notorious   for it  and where so many men have been brought to the gallows   and their families to beggary  to hold a place of such profit under   him  Besides  he has people of his own to provide for  who have   served his father and himself in such a manner as to deserve his   confidence and regard  so that every chance  to speak in his own   way  is against this man  which is so well known  that nobody else   would bid for the thing at all   wherefore  if I may presume to   speak my opinion  his offer should be immediately accepted          There may be something in what you say   but then  if it was   so very precarious a place  do you think some of his customers   would not inform him of it   they certainly must know it          Why  the very reason of my desiring your grace to close with   him directly is for fear they should tell him  as they undoubtedly   would  if they suspected his Intention in the least   but he conceals   it from them  for the principal motive of his quitting the business   he is in  and seeking this place is  because the greatest part of his   customers have got deeply into hia debt  which he can never expect   them to pay  while he continues his business   whereas  he thinks    if he can get this place  it will be a good excuse for his calling in his   money  and then the Lord Mayor s power will protect him from   their resentments  This is the true secret of the matter  for  if it   was not on this account  he has a much better opportunity of   getting money where he is than in any place          Well  then  be it so   make the most you can of it  and I care   not how soon the fellow is turned out after  What is the matter     What do you laugh at           I beg your grace s pardon   an odd thought just came in my   head  but it does not signify         What is it   Come  I must know it          Why  I am almost ashamed to mention it   though it
