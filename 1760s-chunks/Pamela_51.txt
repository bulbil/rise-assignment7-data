confess them to me at such an instant    Well then  thought I  this can be only to seduce me   He has promised   nothing   But I am to see what he will do  if I stay a fortnight  and   this fortnight  thought I again  is no such great matter  and I shall   see in a few days how he carries it   But then  when I again reflected   upon this distance between him and me  and his now open declaration of   love  as he called it  and that after this he would talk with me on that   subject more plainly than ever  and I shall be less armed  may be    to withstand him  and then I bethought myself  why  if he meant no   dishonour  he should not speak before Mrs  Jervis  and the odious   frightful closet came again into my head  and my narrow escape upon it    and how easy it might be for him to send Mrs  Jervis and the maids out   of the way  and so that all the mischief he designed me might be brought   about in less than that time  I resolved to go away and trust all to   Providence  and nothing to myself  And how ought I to be thankful for   this resolution   as you shall hear       But just as I have writ to this place  John sends me word  that he is   going this minute your way  and so I will send you so far as I have   written  and hope by to morrow night  to ask your blessings  at your own   poor  but happy abode  and tell you the rest by word of mouth  and so I   rest  till then  and for ever  Your dutiful DAUGHTER                LETTER XXXI         DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER       I will continue my writing still  because  may be  I shall like to   read it  when I am with you  to see what dangers I have been enabled to   escape  and though I bring it along with me       I told you my resolution  my happy resolution as I have reason to think   it  and just then he came in again  with great kindness in his looks    and said  I make no doubt  Pamela  you will stay this fortnight to   oblige me  I knew not how to frame my words so as to deny  and yet not   make him storm  But  said I  Forgive  sir  your poor distressed servant    I know I cannot possibly deserve any favour at your hands  consistent   with virtue  and I beg you will let me go to my poor father  Why  said   he  thou art the veriest fool that I ever knew  I tell you I will   see your father  I ll send for him hither to morrow  in my travelling   chariot  if you will  and I ll let him know what I intend to do for   him and you  What  sir  may I ask you  can that be  Your honour s noble   estate may easily make him happy  and not unuseful  perhaps to you  in   some respect or other  But what price am I to pay for all this   You   shall be happy as you can wish  said he  I do assure you  And here I   will now give you this purse  in which are fifty guineas  which I will   allow your father yearly  and find an employ suitable to his liking  to   deserve that and more  Pamela  he shall never want  depend upon it    I would have given you still more for him  but that  perhaps  you d   suspect I intended it as a design upon you   O sir  said I  take back   your guineas  I will not touch one  nor will my father  I am sure  till   he knows what is to be done for them  and particularly what is to become   of me  Why then  Pamela  said he  suppose I find a man of probity    and genteel calling  for a husband for you  that shall make you a   gentlewoman as long as you live   I want no husband  sir  said I  for   now I began to see him in all his black colours   Yet being so much in   his power  I thought I would a little dissemble  But  said he  you   are so pretty  that go where you will  you can never be free from the   designs of some or other of our sex  and I shall think I don t answer
