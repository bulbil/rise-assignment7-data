forsooth  a great Philosopher —I practise it in myself  and perform it to all the World  In the severest Trials  I think I should be able to exhibit myself to the Satisfaction of all Spectators  In a Gaol  I could comfort myself with these Reflections    Here I can enjoy a perfect Vacation from all Business or Care  All Solicitude after Honours  and all Anxiety about Fortune  are useless here  because incompatible with my present State  I can here give up my whole Time to Reading and Contemplation  without the Reproach of Idleness  and can here indulge my much loved Solitude  without the Imputation of a misanthrope Singularity  Here my Occupation and my Leisure are all my own  for few intrude upon the Wretch s Levee  Welcome the Interruption of those that do  for he must be a Friend indeed  who seeks us in a Gaol  Happy then  thrice happy State  which  at the same Time  proves our Virtue  and approves our Friends   Even in the Day of Sickness  and the Night of Death  could I sustain the Pains  and survey the Terrors  with an unshaken Mind  from this Soliloquy   Grant  just God  that the Vices  Errors  and Follies  of my past intemperate Youth  may be opposed  at the great Day of Account  against the humane Offices I have performed in Act  and the general Benevolence I have Page  211 always had in Will  even to the vast Circle of all created or possible Beings of the Universe  and  in this Hope  welcome thou glorious Death  so much dreaded  because so little understood   Welcome  thou Cordial to a troubled Breast   The softest Remedy  that Grief can find   The gentle Spell  that lulls our Cares to Rest   And calms the ruffling Passions of the Mind   Thou happy Minute  the first of Immortality  how have Men traduced thee  by comparing thee to a long Sleep  but Sleep is a tedious Death  while Death is but an instant Sleep     Yet  with all this Appearance of Philosophy  I am prone to Anger  Passion  and Resentment  and  though I am sufficiently aware of this Foible  and set the whole Force of my Reason against it  I am not Master enough of myself to preserve my Temper sometimes  upon the slightest Provocation  even of the Folly of a Child  Now what is the Reason of such a remarkable Inconsistency in my Character  has been the Subject of this Hour s Contemplation  and I have attributed it to this  that Nature must universally prevail  and will always be found too strong for Art  In the first Instances  I mentioned to you  I owe my Philosophy to an happy Turn of Constitution and Genius  to a certain Carelessness about  and sovereign Contempt Page  212 for  the Things of this Life  when they are out of my Power  though nobody enjoys them more  when they are within my Reach  and an elevated Hope  and strong Conviction of the Enjoyments of the other World  by the frequent Contemplation of which I have happily improved Nature into an Habit of Philosophy  But  in the latter Case  I am almost afraid Art will never be able to conquer Nature  though  at some Times  it may govern  or disguise it  because  perhaps  trifling Occasions do not sufficiently call upon my Philosophy to exert itself  and no Army is so soon overcome  as that which too much despises it s Enemy   Adieu   LETTER CCLVII   YOUR Letters fill me  at once  with the extremest pleasure  and the tenderest Concern  My Heart melts in me  while I read thy Thoughts  A Kind of gentle Tremor throbs my Breast  which is not to be described  nor understood by any  who have not felt the Extremes of Joy  and Grief  which I have known for thee  The little Understanding I am Mistress of is charmed with truly philosophic Sentiments  But the fond Woman is hurried into Grief and Madness  at the bare Mention Page  213 of those Subjects  which are  indeed  the real  but severe Trials of our Religion and Philosophy  I have many Times been so weak  you  perhaps  may call it cruel  as to lament the Possibility of your dying  I am certain  I shall never be able to think of your Death  either in a christian or philosophic Light  Let me intreat you never to mention it more  Indeed I cannot bear the Thought —   Forlorn of thee  whither should I betake me  where subsist   Oh  if you love me  Harry  the single Consideration of my Distress  in being torn from thee  should make you even anxious to delay your future Happiness  You would not call the Moment of our Separation an happy one  were thy Soul linked to mine  as mine to thee     Oh  the soft Commerce  oh  the tender Ties   Close twisted with the Fibres of the Heart   Which broken  break them—and drain off the Soul  Of human Joy  and make it Pain to live —  And is
