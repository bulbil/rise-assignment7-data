 and perhaps more usefully  as to public utility  chained down to their accounts  Officers  both of land and sea  are seldom much better instructed  tho  they may perhaps  pass through a few more forms  And as for knowlege of the world  women of a certain rank have an equal title to it with some of them  A learned man  as he is called  who should despise a sensible one of these professions  and disdain to converse with him  would pass for a pedant  and why not for despising   356 or undervaluing a woman of sense  who may be put on the same footing  Men  in common conversation  have laid it down for a rule of good breeding  not to talk before women of things they don t understand  by which means  an opportunity of improvement is lost  a very good one too  one that has been approved by the ablest persons who have written on the education of children  because it is a means of learning insensibly  without the appearance of a task  Common subjects afford only commonplace  and are soon exhausted  Why  then  should conversation be confined to such narrow limits  and be liable to continual repetition  when  if people would start less beaten subjects  many doubts and difficulties concerning them might be cleared up  and they would acquire a more settled opinion of things  which is what the generality much want  from an indolence that hinders them from examining  at the same time that they would be better entertained  than with talking of the weather  and such kind of insipidities      Lady W  applauding Mrs  Shirley s sentiments  Apropos  said she  let me read you the speech  taking it out of her Pocket book  of an East India officer  to a pedant  who had been displaying his talents  and running over with terms of art  and scraps of Latin  mingled with a profusion of hard words  that hardly any of the company understood  and which  at the same time that it diverted all present  cured the pretended scholar of his affectation for ever after  My Lady read it as follows      I am charmed with this opportunity  said the officer  of discoursing with a gentleman of so much wit and learning  and hope I shall have his decision in a point which is pretty nice  and concerns some Eastern manufactures  of antient and reverend etymology  Modern critics are undetermined about them  but  for my part  I have always maintained    357 that Chints  Bullbulls  Morees  and Ponabaguzzy s  are of nobler and more generous uses than Doorguzzees or Nourfurmannys  Not but I hold against Byrampauts in favour of Niccannees and Boralchauders  Only I wish  that so accurate 2 judge would instruct me  why Tapzils and Sallampores have given place to Neganepauts  And why Bejatapoutz should be more esteemed than the finer fabrick of Blue Chelloes a      A very good rebuke of affectation  said Sir Charles  and your Ladyship hints it was an efficacious one   It serves to shew  that men  in their different attainments  may be equally useful  in other words  that the knowlege of polite literature leads not to every part of useful science  I remember  that my Harriet distinguishes very properly  in some of her Letters to her Lucy  between Language and Science  and that poor Mr  Walden  that I think was his name  was pretty much disconcerted  as a pedant may sometimes be  when  and he bowed to his Harriet  he has a natural genius to contend with  She blushed  and bowed as she sat—And I remember  Sir  said she  you promised to give me your animadversions on the Letters I consented you should see  Will you be pleased to correct me  now   Correct you  my dearest Life —What a word is that  I remember  that  in the conversation in which you were obliged  against your will  to bear so considerable a part  you demonstrated  that genius  without deep learning  made a much more shining figure in conversation  than learning without genius  But  upon the whole  I was a little apprehensive  that true learning might suffer  if languages were too slightly treated  Mr  Walden made one good observation  or rather remembred it  for it was long ago made  and will be always of weight  that the knowlege of languages    358 any more than the advantage of birth  was never thought lightly of by those who had pretensions to either  The knowlege of the Latin language  in particular  let me say  is of singular use in the mastery of every science   There are who aver  that men of parts have no occasion for learning  But  surely  our Shakespeare himself  one of the greatest genius s of any country or age  who  however  is an adept in the superior learning  the knowlege of nature  would not have been a sufferer  had he had that greater share of human learning which is denied him by some critics   But  Sir Charles  said Mr  Deane  don t you think
