her all about the city  to shew her what was   128 most curious  This genteel proposal she listened to with a secret satisfaction  and accepted of it  She told him that she was a lady of quality  and wife to the duke de N—nois  that therefore  as she was not entirely at her own disposal  he must obtain her husband s consent  this piece of cunning met with the desired success  She had intimated to the duke her desire of passing for his wife  and he had gratified her request by publicly owning her for such  and all the nobility of the French court  who were very fond of her company  always gave her the appellation of dutchess   The count  who was N—nois s particular friend  communicated to him his intention of accompanying Miss ELLIOT to all the places of note in Paris  and its environs  and the duke  who looked on his mistress to be another LUCRETIA  gave his consent without hesitation  Thus was our heroine carried about by CZATORISKI to every place worthy or notice  and every body remarked  that she was   129 oftner seen in his company than in that of her husband   It was in one of these excursions  that he began to entertain a notion that it would not be altogether impossible to succeed in a scheme he had formed of attacking the fortress of her chastity  This he contrived in the following manner  he had often heard her say how happy she conceived the French ladies must be  who were not kept under that restraint which the English ladies were  adding  that if any thing could make her wish not to be an English woman  it would be that of enjoying more liberty  and at the same time said  that the faults committed by the fair sex  in regard to the fidelity they owed their husbands  were principally owing to their too great confinement  This appeared to the count as a fair opportunity  and he answered  that to be sure she was very right in her notions  and that therefore  as she might  in some sort  be said to enjoy more liberty than many others of her own sex  he humbly conceived she ought to make the best use of her time    130 as she did not know how long she might live in that country to partake of the pleasures it afforded   This discourse would have been very disgusting to any woman  whose inclinations were not like those of Miss ELLIOT  To her it was the most delightful she ever heard  and her answer to it was such as convinced CZATORISKI  that he was not deceived in the idea he had formed of her virtue  She deferred  however  giving him too great encouragement  and kept him in suspence  till she found by a secret inquiry into his connexions  that he kept at that time no less than three mistresses  which 〈◊〉 her decline any farther intercourse with him  as she had not hitherto indulged him with any private interview   A short time a•••• this affair  she went in company with some filles de joye to a noted tavern in the city  where having supped in c•mpany with some gentlemen  about midnight they all retired to their repose  and Miss ELLIOT  who did not go there with intention to find a lover  lay by herself     131They had not been above an hour at repose  before the watch  passing by  gave the alarm of fire  our heroine would have been the first to make her escape  could she have effected it  but being in the dark  could not find her way out of the room  The fire  which happened about ten doors from the house were she was  being soon extinguished by proper assistance  the alarmed neighbourhood retired to thier respective habitations   The male lodgers of this nocturnal residence returned  as they thought  to their proper beds  but one of them  missing his own chamber  which was next to Miss ELLIOT s  entered hers  and went to bed to her   The mistake was not immediately discovered  though our heroine was far from being displeased  particularly when her unknown lover exclaimed    What bliss  What ecstasy  What sensations   This induced her to believe  she was not the imagined object of the warm embrace  However  as she conceived her lover   132 might from the first have taken her for his own mistress  she resolved not to clear up the mystery     At day break  she was awaked by a mumbling clamour in the next room  by a female voice  lamenting the hard fortune of being obliged to pass the night with an impotent old dotard  while her companion kept time with the music of her note  being more under the influence of Morpheus than Venus   Our heroine  desirous of knowing the cause of this disorder  arose  and perceived a gentleman  whom she had observed at supper  at the otherside of the threshold  her curiosity now led her to inquire how he came to depute another to supply his place  and the mystery being unraveled  she was highly entertained with the mistake  The truth was  a gentleman had an intrigue with his own wife without knowing it
