her eyes fixed to the ground  in a determined  sullen silence  till she met with a purchaser  I asked my young bargain if the lady she was looking at was her mother  Alas  she is  indeed  sir  replied the girl  for the love of God  do not let me be parted from her  Well  then  my distressed little damsel  said I  if it will give you any pleasure  there is no more to do than to settle you both in the same quarters  and then you will give over your murmuring  On the very moment I went up to the mother  with the intention of cheapening her  but no sooner did I cast my eyes on her face  than I knew again  with what emotion you may guess  the very form and pressure of Lucinda  Just heaven  said I within myself  this is my mother  Nature whispers it in my ear  and can I doubt her evidence  On her part  whether a keen resentment of her woes pointed out an enemy in every object on which she glanced  or else it might be my dress that disfigured me          or else I might have grown a little older in about a dozen years since she had seen me         but however historians may account for it  she did not know me  But I knew her  and bought her  the pair were sent home to my house   When they were safely lodged  I wished to surprise them with the pleasure of ascertaining who I was  Madam  said I to Lucinda  is it possible that my features should not strike you   Tis true  I wear whiskers and a turban  but is Raphael less your son for that  My mother thrilled through all her frame at these words  looked at me with an eager gaze  my whole self rushed into her recollection  and into each other s arms we affectionately flew  I then caressed  in moderated ecstasies  her daughter  who perhaps knew as much about having a brother as I did about having a sister  Tell the truth  said I to my mother  in all your theatrical discoveries  did you ever meet with one so truly natural and dramatic as this  My dear son  answered she  in an accent of sorrow  the first sight of you after so long a separation overwhelmed me with joy  but the revulsion was only the more deeply distressing  In what condition  alas  do I again behold you  My own slavery is a thousand times less revolting to my feelings than the disgraceful habiliments         Heyday  By all the powers  madam  interrupted I with a hearty laugh  I am quite delighted with your newly acquired morality  this is excellent in an actress  Well  well  as heaven is my judge  my honoured mamma  you are mightily improved in your principles  if my transformation astounds your religious eyesight  So far from quarrelling with your turban  consider me rather as an actor  playing a Turkish character on the stage of the world  Though a conformist  I am just as much a Mussulman as when I was in Spain  nay  in the bottom of my heart  I never was a more firm believer in our Christian creed than at the present moment  When you shall become acquainted with all my hair breadth escapes  since I have been domesticated in this country  you will not be rigorous in your censure  Love has been the cause of my apostasy  and he who worships at that shrine may be absolved from all other infidelities  I have a little of my mother in me  take my word for it  Another reason besides ought to moderate your disgust at seeing me under my present circumstances  You were expecting to experience a harsh captivity in Algiers  but you find in your protector a son  with all the tenderness and reverence befitting his relation to you  and rich enough to maintain you here in plenty and comfort  till a favourable opportunity offers of returning with safety into Spain  Admit  therefore  the force of the proverb  which says that evil itself is good for something   My dear son  said Lucinda  since you fully intend one day to go back into your own country  and to throw off the mantle of Mahomet  my scruples are all satisfied  Thanks to heaven  continued she  I shall be able to carry back your sister Beatrice safe and sound into Castile  Yes  madam  exclaimed I  so you may  We will all three  as soon as the season may serve  go and throw ourselves into the bosom of our family  for I make no matter of doubt but you have still in Spain other indisputable evidences of your prolific powers  No  said my mother  I have only you two  the offspring of my body  and you are to know that Beatrice is the fruit of a marriage  manufactured in as workmanlike a manner as any within the pale of the church  And pray  for what reason  replied I  might not my little sister have been just as contraband as myself  How did you
