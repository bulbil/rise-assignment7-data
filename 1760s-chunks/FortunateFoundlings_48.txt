grounds of suspicion  which hitherto they had been so fortunate as   to avoid       It was in one of those appointments  when entered into a very tender   conversation  they forgot themselves so far as to suffer the moon to   rise upon them  the stillness of the evening  and the little company   which happened to be there that night  seemed to indulge their   inclinations of continuing in so sweet a recess   they were seated on a   bench at the foot of a large tree  when Charlotta  in answer to some   tender professions he had been making  said  depend on this  Horatio    that as you are the first who has ever been capable of making me   sensible of love  so nothing shall have power to change my sentiments   while you continue to deserve  or to desire I should think of you as I   now do  He shall not long continue to desire it   cried a voice behind   them  and immediately rushed from the other side of the thicket a man   with his sword drawn  and ran full upon Horatio  who not having time to   be upon his guard  had certainly fallen a victim to his rival s fury    had not a gentleman seized his arm  and  by superior strength  forced   him some paces back   Are you mad  monsieur  said he  do you forget the   place you are in  or the danger you so lately escaped for an enterprize   of this nature       Mademoiselle Charlotta  now a little recovered from her first  surprize    and knowing it was young monsieur de Coigney who had given her this   alarm  had presence enough of mind to ask how he dared  after he knew   her own and father s resolution  to disturb her  or any company she had   with her  he made no reply  but reflecting that there were other ways   than fighting  by which he might be revenged  went hastily away with   that friend who had hindered him from executing his rash purpose  but   they could hear that he muttered something which seemed a menace against   them both       How impossible is it to express the consternation our lovers now were   in  they found by the repetition monsieur de Coigney made of the words   she spoke  that what they had so long and so successfully laboured to   conceal  was now betrayed   betrayed to one who would not fail to make   the most malicious use of the discovery  and doubted not but the affair   would become the general talk  perhaps to the prejudice of Charlotta s   reputation  but the least thing either could expect  was to be   separated for ever       Horatio  full of disturbed emotions  conducted his disconsolate mistress   to the gate of the Tuilleries  and there took a farewel of her  which he   had too much reason to fear would be his last  at least for a long time    He was tempted by his first emotions to seek de Coigney  and call him to   account for the affront he had put upon him  and either lose his own   life  or oblige the other to secrecy  but then he considered  that there   was some probability he would not dare to own that he had given himself   any concern about mademoiselle Charlotta  after the injunction laid on   him by his father  much less as he had attempted a duel in her cause    having  as has been already mentioned  been before guilty of a like   offence against the laws  which in that country are very strict  on   account of madame de Olonne  and this prevailed with him to be passive   as to what had happened  till he should hear how the other would behave    and find what turn the affair would take       Charlotta in the mean time was in the most terrible anxieties   she   could not imagine what had brought monsieur de Coigney  who she thought   had been many miles distant  so suddenly to Paris  but on making some   private enquiry  she was informed  that having met some difficulty in   the execution of his office  he had taken post  in order to lay his   complaints before the king  and had arrived that very day   She now   blamed her own inadvertency in holding any discourse with Horatio  of a   nature not proper to be over heard  in a place so public as the   Tuilleries  where others  as well as he  might have possibly been   witnesses of what was said       Young monsieur de Coigney suffered little less from the turbulence of   his nature  and the mortification it gave his vanity  to find a person    whom he looked upon as
