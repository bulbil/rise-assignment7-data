Court of Chancery for the protection of her person and fortune  But an hint of this nature distressed her for many days  unknown to me  Had I been acquainted that she took it so heavily  I would not have made her unhappy for one day   I have looked out among the quality for a future husband for her  But  where can I find one with whom I think she will be happy  There are many who would be glad of her fortune  As I said  her fortune is too large  It is enough to render every man s address to her suspected  and to make a guardian apprehensive  that her person  agreeable as it is  and every day improving  and her mind opening to a•vantage   14 every hour of her life  would be but the second  if the second  view of a man professing to love her  And were she to marry  what a damp would the slights of an husband give to the genius of a young lady  whose native modesty would always make her want encouragement   I have also cast an eye over the gentry within my knowledge  But have not met with one whom I could wish to be the husband of my Emily  So tender  so gentle  so ductile  as she is  a fierce  a rash  an indelicate  even a careless or indifferent man  would either harden her heart  or shorten her life  And as the latter would be much more easy to be effected than the former  what must she suffer before she could return indifference for disrespect  and reach the quiet end of it   See what a man Sir Walter Warkyns is  My sister only could deal with such an one  A superiority in her so visible  he must fear her  Yet a generosity so great  and a dignity so conspicuous  in her whole behaviour  as well as countenance  he must love her  Every body s respect to her  would oblige love and reverence from him  But my weak hearted  diffident Emily  what would she do with such a man   What would she do with a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  What with such a man  as Mr  Greville  as Sir Hargrave describes him  I mention these men  for are not there many such   I am not apt to run into grave declamations against the times  And yet  by what I have seen abroad  and now lately since my arrival  at home  and have heard from men of greater observation  and who have lived longer in the world  than I have  I cannot but think  that Englishmen are not what they were  A wretched effeminacy seems to prevail among them  Marriage itself is every day more and more out of fashion  and even virtuous women give not the institution so much of their countenance  as to discourage by their contempt   15 the free livers  A good woman  as such  has therefore but few chances for happiness in marriage  Yet shall I not endeavour  the more endeavour  to save and serve my Emily   I have one encouragement  since my happy acquaintance with Miss Byron  to think that the age is not entirely lost to a sense of virtue and goodness  See we not how every body reveres her  Even a Sir Hargrave Pollexfen  a Greville  a Fenwick  men of free lives  adore her  And at the same time she meets with the love of all good men  and the respect of women  whether gay or serious  But I am afraid  that the first attraction with men  is her beauty  I am afraid  that few see in that admirable young lady what I see in her  A mind great and noble  A sincerity beyond that of women  A goodness unaffected  and which shews itself in action  and not merely in words  and outward appearance  A wit lively and inossensive  And an understanding solid and useful  All which render her a fit companion  either in the social or contemplative hour  And yet she thinks herself not above the knowlege of those duties  the performance of which makes an essential of the female character   But I am not giving a character of Miss Byron to you  my good Dr  Bartlett  who admire her as much as I do   Do you think it impossible for me to procure for my Emily such a guardian and companion as Miss Byron  on her return to Northamptonshire  would make her —Such worthy relations as she would introduce her to  would be a further happiness to my ward   I am far from undervaluing my sister s good qualities  But if Emily lives with her  she must live also with me  Indeed the affairs in which I am engaged for other people  if I may call those who have a claim upon me for every instance of my friendship  other people  will occasion me to be often absent    16 But still  while Grandison hall  and St  James s Square  are the visible places of residence equally of the guardian and ward  Emily s mother will tell the world  that we live together   Miss Jervois does not choose to return to Mrs  Lane
