there was one way of life in which a person of my talents could not fail of making a great figure —I guessed his meaning  and told him once for all  I was fully determined against any alteration in point of religion  therefore if his proposal regarded the church  he might save himself the trouble of   52 explaining it  He shook his head and sighed  saying     Ah  son  son  what a glorious prospect is here spoiled  by your stubborn prejudice  Suffer yourself to be persuaded by reason  and consult your temporal welfare  as well as the concerns of your eternal soul —I can  by my interest  procure your admission as a noviciate into this convent  where I will superintend and direct you with a truly paternal affection  —  Then he launched out into the praises of a monastic life  which no noise disturbs  no cares molest  and no danger invades—where the heart is weaned from carnal attachments  the grosser appetites subdued and chastised  and the soul wafted to the divine regions of philosophy and truth  on the wings of studious contemplation —But his eloquence was lost upon me  whom two considerations enabled to withstand his temptations  namely  my promise to my uncle  and my aversion to an ecclesiastical life  for as to the difference of religion  I looked upon it as a thing of too small moment to come in competition with a man s fortune —Finding me immoveable on this head  he told me  he was more sorry than offended at my noncompliance  and still ready to employ his good offices in my behalf —   The same erroneous maxims  said he  that obstruct your promotion in the church  will infallibly prevent your advancement in the army  but if you can brook the condition of a servant  I am acquainted with some people of rank at Versailles  to whom I can give you letters of recommendation  that you may be entertained by some one of them  in quality of maitre d  hotel  and I do not doubt that your qualifications   53 will soon entitle you to a better provision  —  I embraced his offer with great eagerness  and he appointed me to come back in the afternnoon  when he would not only give me the letters  but likewise introduce me to a capuchin of his acquaintance  who intended to set out for Paris next morning  in whose company I might travel  without being at the expence of one livre during the whole journey  This piece of good news gave me infinite pleasure  I acknowledged my obligation to the benevolent father  in the most grateful expressions  and he performed his promise to a tittle  in delivering the letters  and making me acquainted with the capuchin  with whom I departed next morning by break of day     It was not long before I discovered my fellowtraveller to be a merry facetious fellow  who  notwithstanding his profession and appearance of mortification  loved good eating and drinking better than his rosary  and paid more adoration to a pretty girl than to the Virgin Mary  or St  Genevive —He was a thick brawny young man  with red eye brows  a hook nose  a face covered with freckles  and his name was Frere Balthazar  His order did not permit him to wear linnen  so that having little occasion to undress himself  he was none of the cleanliest animals in the world  and his constitution was naturally so strong scented  that I always thought it convenient to keep to the windward of him in our march —As he was perfectly well known on the road  we fared sumptuously without any cost  and the fatigue of our journey was much alleviated by the good humour of my companion  who sung an infinite number of catches on the subjects of love and wine —We took up our lodging the first night   54 at a peasant s house  not far from Abbe Ville  where we were entertained with an excellent ragout  cooked by our landlord s daughters  one of whom was very handsome  After having eat heartily  and drank a sufficient quantity of vin du Pais  we were conducted to a barn  where we found a couple of carpets spread upon clean straw for our reception —We had not lain in this situation above half an hour  when we heard somebody knock softly at the door  upon which Balthazar got up  and let in our host s two daughters  who wanted to have some private conversation with him in the dark  when they had whispered together some time  the capuchin came to me  and asked if I was insensible to love  or so hard hearted as to refuse a share of my bed to a pretty maid  who had a tendresse for me —I must own  to my shame  that I suffered myself to be overcome by my passion  and with great eagerness seized the occasion  when I understood that the amiable Nanette was to be my bedfellow —In vain did my reason suggest the respect I owed to my dear mistress Narcissa  the idea of that lovely charmer  rather increased than allayed the ferment of my spirits  and the young Paisanne had no reason to complain of my remembrance —Early in the morning  the kind creatures left us to our repose  which lasted till eight
