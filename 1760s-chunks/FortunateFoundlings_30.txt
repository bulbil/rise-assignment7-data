a sea nymph  and   mademoiselle de Blois  in that of a Minerva  ornamented and decorated   according to their several characters  had also their share of   admiration       Nor did the marchionesses of Vallois and Lucerne  both in the garb of   shepherdesses  serve as mere foils to those I have mentioned  there was   something  even in this plainness that shewed the elegance of the   wearer s taste       The prince of Conde  the dukes of Berry  Vendosine and Chartres  the   young marquis de Montbausine  the counts de Chenille  de Ranbeau  and   the baron de Roche  had all of them habits extremely rich and well   fancied  as were many others of whom it would be too tedious to make   particular mention  and be likewise digressive to the matter I take upon   me to relate  I shall therefore only say  that there was not one person   of either sex  who did not endeavour to set themselves forth to all   possible advantage       Those gentlemen who attended the Chevalier St  George were at their   liberty to appear in what habit they pleased  Horatio knowing his   charming Charlotta was a nymph of the forest  chose to be a hunter  and   was accordingly dressed in green  with a little cap on his head and a   javelin in his hand  as Acteon is generally portrayed  and indeed had he   studied what garb would have become him best  he could not have fixed on   one more proper for that purpose       Fine madamoiselle de Sanserre at least thought him more worthy her   regard than any of those  the richness of whose habits made her know   were of a higher rank   she took particular notice of him  made him   dance with her  and said a thousand gallant things to him  but he could   very well have dispensed with hearing them  and found little   satisfaction in any thing that deprived him of entertaining his dear   Charlotta  who he easily knew by her air and shape from all those who   were habited in the same manner  As he doubted not  however  but the   person who had thus singled him out was a lady of condition  he returned   her civilities with a politeness which was natural to him  but which had   received great improvements since his arrival in France  She was no less   charm d with his conversation than she had been with his person  and   impatient to know who he was  made an offer of shewing him her face on   condition he would pluck off his mask at the same time  but this he   would by no means agree to  because still hoping to get rid of her  and   have some discourse with mademoiselle Charlotta  he did not think proper   he should be known by any other  who might perhaps make remarks on his   behaviour  and therefore excused himself from complying with her desires   in terms as obliging as the circumstance would admit       As she had displayed all her talents of wit and eloquence to engage him    she looked on the little curiosity she had been able to inspire in him   as an affront  and vexed she had thrown away so much time on an   insensible  as she called him  flung hastily away  and joining with some   other company  left him at liberty to pursue his inclinations       This lady had been a royal mistress  but not having the good fortune to   be made a mother  was not honoured with any title  her being forsaken by   the king  who indeed had few amours of any long continuance  did not in   the least abate the good opinion she had of her beauty  and to fee   herself followed by a train of lovers being the supreme pleasure of her   life  she spared nothing to attract and engage  whenever she failed in   this expectation it was a severe mortification  but her vanity and the   gaity of her humour would not suffer it to prey upon her spirits for   above a minute  and she diverted the shock of a rebuff in one place by   new attempts to conquer in another  therefore it is probable thought no   more of Horatio after she had turned from him       He now carefully avoided all that might interrupt his wishes  and seeing   Charlotta had just broke off some conversation she had been entertained   with  made what haste he could to prevent her from being   re engaged   She immediately knew him  and as their mutual innocence   made them perfectly free in expressing themselves to each other  she   told him she was glad he was come  that they would keep together the   whole masquerade  provided he did not think it a confinement  to prevent
