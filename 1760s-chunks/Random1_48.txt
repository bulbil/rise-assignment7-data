and such offers don t occur every day    I acquiesc d in this observation  and enquir d how he intended to proceed  At this he rubb d his chin  and said    Why  truly I must be oblig d to some friend or other—do you know nobody that would lend me a small sum for a day or two  —  I assur d him  I was such an utter stranger in London  that I did not believe I could borrow a guinea  if my life depended upon it —   No  said he  that s hard—that s hard—I wish I had any thing to pawn upon my soul  you have got excellent linen  feeling the sleeve of my shirt  how many shirts of that kind have you got  —  I answer d    six ruffled and six plain  —  At which 〈◊〉 testified great surprize  and swore that no gentleman ought to have more than four—   How many d ye think I have got  continued he   but this and another as I hope to be sav d —I dare say we shall be able to raise a good firm out of your superfluity—let me see—let me see—each of these shirts are worth eighteen shillings at a moderate computation—now suppose we pawn them   131 for half price—eight times eight is sixty four  that s three pound four—z—ds  it will do—give me your hand  —   Softly  softly  Mr  Jackson  said I  don t dispose of my linen without my consent  first pay me the crown you owe me  and then we shall talk of other matters  —  He protested he had not above one shilling in his pocket  but that he would pay me out of the first money raised from the shirts—This piece of assurance incensed me so much  that I swore I would not part with him until I had received satisfaction for what I had lent him  and as for the shirts I would not pawn one of them to save him from the gallows —At this expression he laughed aloud  and then complained  it was damned hard  that I should refuse him a trifle  that would infallibly enable him not only to make his own fortune  but mine also —   You talk of pawning my shirts  said I  what would you think of selling this hanger  Mr  Jackson  I believe it would fetch a good round sum  —   No  hang it  said he  I can t appear decently without my hanger  or by G—d it should go  —  However  seeing me inflexible with regard to my linen  he at length unbuckled his hanger  and shewing me the sign of three blue balls  desired me to carry it thither and pawn it for two guineas —This office I would by no means have performed  had I seen any likelihood of having my money otherwise  but not willing  out of a piece of false delicacy  to neglect the only opportunity I should  perhaps  ever have  I ventured into a pawn broker s shop  where I demanded two guineas on the pledge  in the name of Thomas Williams —   Two guineas   said the pawn broker  looking at the hanger    132 this piece of goods has been here several times before  for thirty shillings  however  since I believe the gentleman to whom it belongs will redeem it  he shall have what he wants    and accordingly he paid me the money  which I carried to the house where I had left Jackson  and calling for change  I counted out to him seven and thirty shillings  reserving the other five for myself —After looking at the money some time  he said    D—n it  it don t signify—this won t do my business  so you may as well take half a guinea or a whole one  as the five shillings you have kept  —  I thanked him kindly  but refused to accept of any more than was my due  because I had no prospect of repaying it —Upon which he stared in my face  and told me  I was excessively raw  or I would not talk in that manner —   Blood   cried he  I have a very bad opinion of a young fellow who won t borrow of his friend  when he s in want— tis the sign of a speaking spirit —Come  come  Random  give me back the five shillings  and take this half guinea  and if ever you are able to pay me  I believe you will  if not  d—n me  if ever I ask it  —  When I reflected on my present necessity  I suffered myself to be persuaded  and after making my acknowledgments to Mr  Jackson  who offered to treat me with a play  I returned to my lodgings with a much better opinion of this gentleman than I had in the morning  and at night  imparted my day s adventure to Strap  who rejoiced at my good luck  saying    I told you  if he was a Scotchman you was safe enough—and who knows but this marriage may make us all —You have heard  I suppose  as how a countryman   133 of
