her month should be up  and her brats disposed of  would  spread her attractions to the public  provided she could profit by her  person  and  in the usual way  make a regular progress from St  James s  to Drury Lane  She apprehended  for these reasons  that their compassion  would be most effectually shown  in leaving her to perish in her present  necessity  and that the old gentleman would be unpardonable  should  he persist in his endeavours to relieve her  A third member of this  tender hearted society  after having asked if the young woman was  handsome  and being answered in the negative  allowed that there was a  great deal of reason in what had been said by the honourable person who  had spoke last  nevertheless  she humbly conceived her sentence would  admit of some mitigation   Let the bantlings   said she   be sent to the  hospital  according to the advice of her grace  and a small collection  be made for the present support of the mother  and  when her health  is recovered  I will take her into my family  in quality of an upper  servant  or medium between me and my woman  for  upon my life  I can t  endure to chide or give directions to a creature  who is  in point of  birth and education  but one degree above the vulgar    This proposal met with universal approbation  The duchess  to her  immortal honour  began the contribution with a crown  so that the rest  of the company were obliged to restrict their liberality to half the  sum  that her grace might not be affronted  And the proposer  demanding  the poor woman s name and place of abode  the old mediator could not  help giving her ladyship a verbal direction  though he was extremely  mortified  on more accounts than one  to find such an issue to his  solicitation   Peregrine  who   though humorous as winter  had a tear for pity  and  a hand open as day for melting charity   was shocked at the nature and  result of this ungenerous consultation  He contributed his half crown   however  and  retiring from the company  betook himself to the lodgings  of the forlorn lady in the straw  according to the direction he had  heard  Upon inquiry  he understood that she was then visited by some  charitable gentlewoman  who had sent for a nurse  and waited the return  of the messenger  and he sent up his respects  desiring he might be  permitted to see her  on pretence of having been intimate with her late  husband   Though the poor woman had never heard of his name  she did not think  proper to deny his request  and he was conducted to a paltry chamber  in the third story  where he found this unhappy widow sitting upon a  truckle bed  and suckling one of her infants  with the most piteous  expression of anguish in her features  which were naturally regular  and sweet  while the other was fondled on the knee of a person  whose  attention was so much engrossed by her little charge  that  for the  present  she could mind nothing else  and it was not till after the  first compliments passed betwixt the hapless mother and our adventurer   that he perceived the stranger s countenance  which inspired him with  the highest esteem and admiration  He beheld all the graces of elegance  and beauty  breathing sentiment and beneficence  and softened into the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   most enchanting tenderness of weeping sympathy  When he declared the  cause of his visit  which was no other than the desire of befriending  the distressed lady  to whom he presented a bank note for twenty pounds   he was favoured with such a look of complacency by this amiable phantom   who might have been justly taken for an angel ministering to the  necessities of mortals  that his whole soul was transported with love  and veneration  Nor was this prepossession diminished by the information  of the widow  who  after having manifested her gratitude in a flood of  tears  told him  that the unknown object of his esteem was a person of  honour  who having heard by accident of her deplorable situation  had  immediately obeyed the dictates of her humanity  and come in person to  relieve her distress  that she had not only generously supplied her with  money for present sustenance  but also undertaken to provide a nurse for  her babes  and even promised to favour her with protection  should  she survive her present melancholy situation  To these articles of  intelligence she added  that the name of her benefactress was the  celebrated Lady     to whose character the youth was no stranger  though  he had never seen her person before  The killing edge of her charms was  a little blunted by the accidents of time and fortune  but no man of  taste and imagination  whose nerves were not quite chilled with the  frost of age
