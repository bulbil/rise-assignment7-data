to the full  Why not —O my grandmother  What with the talk of the young country Lady  that same Miss Byron  for they put her upon talking a great deal  what with the famous scholar  who  however  being a learned   97 man  could not be so merry as us  what with Sir Hargrave  I could live and die with Sir Hargrave  You never knew  my grandmother  such a bright man as Sir Hargrave  and what with one thing  and what with another  we boxed it about  and had rare fun  as I told you—So that when I got home  and went to bed  I did nothing but dream of being in the same company  and three or four times waked myself with laughing      There  Lucy —Will this do for Mr  Singleton  It is not much out of character  I assure you   Monday Afternoon   THIS knight  this Sir Rowland Meredith —He is below  it seems  his nephew in his hand  Sir Rowland  my Sally tells me  in his gold button and button hole coat  and full buckled wig  Mr  Fowler as spruce as a bridegroom  What shall I do with Sir Rowland   What  my Lucy  can there be in the addresses of these men  that even those who are indifferent to us  can put one s spirits in an hurry  But  my dear  it is painful to be obliged to deny the earnest suits of those who declare a Love for us   Expect another Letter next post  And so you will if I did not bid you  for have I missed one yet   Adieu  my Lucy   H  B   LETTER XVI  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    Monday Night  Tuesday  Morn  Feb  6   7   SIR Rowland and his nephew  tea being not quite ready  sat down with my cousins  and the knight  leaving Mr  Fowler little to say  expatiated so handsomely   98 on his nephew s good qualities  and great passion for me  and on what he himself proposed to do for him in addition to his own fortune  that my cousins  knowing I liked not the gentlemen in our own neighbourhood  and thought very indifferently of Sir Hargrave  were more than half inclined to promote the addresses of Mr  Fowler  and gave them both room to think so   This favourable disposition set the two gentlemen up  They were impatient for tea  that they might see me   By the time I had sealed up my Letters  word was brought me  that tea was ready  and I went down   The knight  it seems  as soon as they heard me coming  jogged Mr  Fowler—Nephew  said he  pointing to the door  see what you can say to the Primrose of your heart —This is now the Primroseseason with us in Caermarthen  Mr  Reeves   Mr  Fowler  by a stretch of complaisance  came to meet and introduce me to the company  tho  at home  The knight nodded his head after him  smiling  as if he had said  Let my nephew alone to gallant the Lady to her seat   I was a little surprised at Mr  Fowler s approaching me the moment I appeared  and with his taking my hand  and conducting me to my seat  with an air  not knowing how much he had been raised by the conversation that had passed before   He bowed  I courtesied  and looked a little sillier than ordinary  I believe   Your servant  young Lady  said the knight  Lovelier  and lovelier  by Mercy  How these blushes become that sweet face —But  forgive me  madam  it is not my intent to dash you   Writing  Miss Byron  all day  said Mrs  Reeves  We have greatly missed you   My cousin seemed to say this  on purpose to give me time to recover myself     99 I have blotted several sheets of paper  said I  and had just concluded   I hope  madam  said the knight  leaning forward his whole body  and peering in my face under his bent brows  that we have not been the cause of hastening you down   I stared  But as he seemed not to mean any thing  I would not help him to a meaning by my own overquickness   Mr  Fowler had done an extraordinary thing  and sat down  hemmed  and said nothing  looking  however  as if he was at a loss to know whether he or his uncle was expected to speak   The cold weather was then the subject  and the two gentlemen rubbed their hands  and drew nearer the fire  as if they were the colder for talking of it  Many hems passed between them  now the uncle looking on the nephew  now the nephew on the uncle  At last they fell into talk of their new built house at Caermarthen  and the furnishing of it   They mentioned afterwards their very genteel neighbourhood  and gave the characters of half a dozen people  of whom
