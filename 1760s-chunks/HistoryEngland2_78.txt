trembling   210 under the dread of an invasion  a few mercenarie brought in for their defence  who  in turn  becam formidable to the natives  all these circumstance concurred to exasperate the people  but there was n object on whom to wreck their vengeance  but th unhappy Byng  who  in a manner  was already devoted to destruction  War was now proclaimed wit the usual solemnity  though it was now but a denun¦ciation after having struck the blow  The Hanove¦rians were sent back to their own country  and th preparations were made for trying Admiral Byng i the usual form  On the twenty eighth day of December his tryal began before a Court Martial  i the harbour of Portsmouth  where  after a scrutiny of several days  his Judges came to a resolution  tha he had not done his utmost  during the engagement to destroy the enemy  which it was his duty to hav engaged  They therefore unanimously were of opi¦nion  that he fell under the twelfth article of war which positively ordered death to any person  who in the time of action should withdraw  keep back or not come into fight  or who should not do his utmost  through either motives of cowardice  negligence  or disaffection  He was therefore adjudge to be shot on board such ship as the Lords of th Admiralty should please to direct  but his Judges  a the same time  recommended him to mercy  as they could not tell the motives of his keeping aloof  By such a sentence they expected to have satisfied the national animosity against him  and yet to screen themselves from the consciousness of severity  Whatever the government might wish to do is uncertain  but the cry of vengeance was too loud to be disregarded  his Majesty therefore referred the sentence to the twelve Judges  who were unanimously of opinion that the sentence was legal  wherefore the King resolved that he should suffer the extremity of the law  Still  however  there was another attempt made   211 to save him  One of those who had been his Judges at Portsmouth  and was also a member of the house of commons  informed that assembly  that he  as well as some others who had sat upon the Admiral s tryal  desired to be released from the oath of secrecy imposed upon Courts Martial  that they might disclose the grounds on which sentence of death had passed upon Admiral Byng  and  perhaps  discover such circumstances as might shew the sentence to be improper  To this the house paid little regard  but his Majesty thought fit to respite the execution  till the scruples of the Court Martial should be more clearly explained  A bill therefore past the house of commons for releasing them from their oath  but when it came to be debated among the Lords  and after the members of the Court Martial were examined touching their reasons  the Peers found no reason for passing the bill  and it was rejected  The Admiral being thus abandoned to the stroke of justice  resolved at least  by the bravery of his dying  in some measure  to shew the injustice of the imputation of his being a coward  He maintained to the last his natural serenity  and  on the day fixed for his execution  when the boats belonging to the fleet  being manned and armed  attended this solemnity in the harbour  the Admiral advanced from the cabbin  where he had been imprisoned  to the deck  the place appointed for execution  with a composed step  and resolute countenance  He then delivered a paper  containing the following address    A few moments will now deliver me from virulent persecution  and frustrate the malice of my enemies  Nor need I envy them a life subject to the sensations my injuries  and the injustice done me  must create  Persuaded I am  that justice will be done to my reputation hereafter  The manner and cause of raising and keeping up the popular clamour and prejudice against me  will be seen through  I shall be considered as a victim destined to divert the indignation  212and resentment of an injured and deluded people from th Proper objects  My enemies themselves must now thin me innocent  Happy for me  at this my last momen… that I know my own innocence  and am conscious that n part of my country s misfortunes can be owing to me  … heartily wish the shedding my blood may contribute to th happiness and service of my country  but I cannot resig my just claim to a faithful discharge of my duty  accordin to the best of my judgment  and the utmost exertion of n ability for his Majesty s honour  and my country s servic… I am sorry that my endeavours were not attended wit more success  and that the armament under my comman proved too weak to succeed in an expedition of such mo¦ment  Truth has prevailed over calumny and falshoo and justice has wiped off the ignominious stain of my per¦sonal want of courage  and the charge of disaffection  M heart acquits me of these crimes  but who can be presump¦tuously sure of his own judgment  If my crime is a error of judgment  or differing in opinion from my judges and if yet the error of judgment should be on their sid… God forgive them  as I do
