of the Lady   A Spanish husband  surely  Harriet  not a French one  according to our notions   That gentleman  and that  are her brothers  We have been in pursuit of them two days  for they gave out  in order  no doubt  to put us on a wrong scent  that they were to go to Antwerp   And it seems  my dear  that Sir Hargrave  and his collegue had actually sent some of their servants that way  which was the reason that they were themselves attended but by one   The gentleman told Sir Charles that there was a third villain in their plot  They had hopes  he said  that he would not escape the close pursuit of a manufacturer at Abbeville  whose daughter  a lovely young creature  he had seduced  under promises of marriage  Their government  he observed  were great countenancers of the manufacturers at Abbeville  and he would have reason  if he were laid hold of  to think himself happy  if he came off with being obliged to perform his promises   This third wretch must be Mr  Bagenhall  The Lord grant  say I  that he may be laid hold of  and obliged to make a ruined girl an honest woman  as they phrase it in LANCASHIRE  Don t you wish so  my dear  and let me add  that had the relations of the injured Lady compleated their intended vengeance on   252 those two Libertines  A very proper punishment  I ween  for all Libertines   it might have helped them to pass the rest of their lives with great tranquillity  and honest girls might  for any contrivances of theirs  have passed to and from masquerades without molestation   Sir Hargrave and his companion intended  it seems  at first  to make some resistance  four only  of the seven  stopping the chaise  But when the other three came up  and they saw who they were  and knew their own guilt  their courage failed them   The seventh man was set over the post boy  whom he had led about half a mile from the spot they had chosen as a convenient one for their purpose   Sir Hargrave s servant was secured by them at their first attack  but after they had disarmed him and his masters  he found an opportunity to slip from them  and made the best of his way to the road  in hopes of procuring assistance for them   While Sir Charles was busy in helping the bruised wretches on their feet  the seventh man came up to the others  followed by Sir Hargrave s chaise  The assailants had retired to some distance  and  after a consultation together  they all advanced towards Sir Charles  who  binding his servants be on their guard  leapt on his horse  with that agility and presence of mind  for which  Mr  Beauchamp says  he excels most men  and leading towards them  Do you advance  gentlemen  said he  as friends  or otherwise —Mr  Lowther took a pistol in each hand  and held himself ready to support him  and the servants disposed themselves to obey their master s orders   Our enmity  answered one of them  is only to these two inhospitable villains  Murder  as we told you  was not our design  They know where we are to be found  and that they are the vilest of men  and have not been punished equal to their demerits  Let them on their knees asks this gentleman s pardon    253 pointing to the husband of the insulted Lady  We insist upon this satisfaction  and upon their promise  that they never more will come within two leagues of Abbeville  and we will leave them to your protection   I fancy  Harriet  that these women frightening heroes needed not to have been urged to make this promise   Sir Charles  turning towards them  said  If you have done wrong  gentlemen  you ought not to scruple asking pardon  If you know yourselves to be innocent  tho  I should be loth to risque the lives of my friend and servants  yet shall not my countrymen make so undue a submission   The wretches kneeled  and the seven men  civilly saluting Sir Charles and Mr  Lowther  rode off  to the joy of the two delinquents  who kneeled again to their deliverer  and poured forth blessings upon the man whose life  so lately  one of them sought  and whose preservation he had now so much reason to rejoice in  for the sake of his own safety   My brother himself could not but be well pleased that he was not obliged to come to extremities  which might have ended fatally on both sides   By this time Sir Hargrave s post chaise was come up  He and his collegue were with difficulty lifted into it  My brother and Mr  Lowther went into theirs  and being but a small distance from Paris  they proceeded thither in company  the poor wretches blessing them all the way  and at Paris found their other servants waiting for them   Sir Charles and Mr  Lowther saw them in bed in the lodgings that had been taken for them
