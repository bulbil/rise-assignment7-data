one still more numerous  commanded   24 by the Earl of Essex  who fought from principle  and who only wished to bring the King to reason   When the King advanced from Nottingham  and approached near Shrewsbury  he drew up his little army  and made them a speech     I promise  said he to the soldiers  in the presence of Almighty God  and as I hope for his blessing and protection  that I will ever defend the Protestant religion  and in that religion am resolved to live and die  The laws of the land  and the rights of my subjects  shall ever be the measure of my government  and  if Heaven prospers this little army raised for their King s defence  I promise to rule by parliaments alone  and by every equitable administration  When I fail in these particulars  then let me be abandoned of men  and in this resolution I hope for the assistance of all good men  end am confident of the protection of Providence      Essex  on the other hand  was resolved to set up his head quarters at Worcester  and await the King  where  in a few days  a skirmish ensued in favour of the Royalists  and the battle of Edge hill  fought some time after  seemed to confirm the King s superiority  The Queen had brought him soldiers from Holland  with ammunition and arms  and immediately departed in order to furnish more  Yet still the parliament was not discouraged  their demands seemed to increase in proportion to their losses  and  as they were defeated in the field  they grew more obstinate in the cabinet  They condemned of high treason such governors of towns as gave up their fortresses to the King  while he  on the contrary  offered new terms of peace upon every advantage  But  though his desire to spare his subjects was laudable  as a man  yet his long negotiations were faulty  as a warrior  he wasted that time in altercation and proposal  which should have been employed in vigorous exertions in the field  Upon the whole  his first campaign seemed to promise him success  his   25 generals were mostly victorious  and his army far superior to the enemy in point of discipline  On the side of the parliament  the great Hampden was slain in the battle of Chaldgrave field  and on the other hand  on the King s part  the gallant Lord Faulkland was killed at the battle of Newbury  These were the two greatest  bravest  and wisest men of their time  who thus fell  as if  by the kindness of Providence  to prevent their seeing the miseries  and the slaughter in which their country was shortly to be involved   Hampden was the person who had refused paying ship money  and withstood the power of the crown  his inflexible integrity gained him the esteem even of his enemies  and his humanity and benevolence  the affection of all that knew him more intimately   But Faulkland was still a greater character than he  He added to Hampden s severe principles all the politeness and elegance then known in Europe  He had withstood the King while he saw him making an ill use of his power  but  when he perceived the design of the parliament to change religion  he changed his side  and stedfastly attached himself to the crown  From the beginning of the civil war his natural chearfulness and vivacity grew clouded  and he became sad  pale  and negligent of his person  the morning of the battle it was seen he desired to die  and he professed that the miseries of his country had already almost broken his heart  He added  that he was weary of the times  and should leave them before night  He was shot with a musquet in the belly  and his body was the next morning found among an heap of the slain  His writings  his justice  and his courage  deserved such a death of glory  and they lound it  If there be happiness in death  it must be in such an end  falling in battle for our King and our principles     26 Each battle served only to weaken the royal party  and to unite the parliament more strongly together  the King and his followers were held together only by secular motives  the parliament had long been actuated by one still stronger  that of religion  this had hitherto been the secret spring of all their commotions  and now they fairly threw by the mask  united themselves to the church of Scotland  and signed the solemn league and covenant  which established Puritanism  and laid the foundation of a new republic  The King  to oppose the designs of the Westminster parliament  called one at Oxford  where it assembled  and England now saw what it had never before seen  two parliaments sitting at one and the same time  From this partial parliament he received some supplies  after which it was prorogued  and never after convened  The war went on with its usual fury  and skirmishes on both sides were frequent  which served to desolate the kingdom without deciding victory  Each county joined that side to which it was addicted from motives of conviction  interest or fear  while
