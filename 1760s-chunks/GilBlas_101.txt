with the little barber  in a very close connection with whom I began to live  It seemed to promise more pleasure than with Melendez  As I was in no want of money  it was time enough to think of another place  besides  I had got to be rather nice on that head  I would not go into service any more  but in families above the vulgar  In short  I was determined to inquire very strictly into the character of a new place  The best would not be too good  such high pretensions did the late valet of a young nobleman think himself entitled to assume above the common herd of servants   Waiting till fortune should throw a situation in my way  worthy to be honoured by my acceptance  I thought I could not do better than to devote my leisure to my charming Laura  whom I had not seen since the pleasant occurrence of our double discovery  I could not venture on dressing as Don Caesar de Ribera  it would have been an act of madness to have assumed that style but as a disguise  Besides that my own suit was not much out of condition  all smaller articles had propagated miraculously in the aforesaid bundle  I made myself up  therefore  with the barber s aid  as a sort of middle man between Don Caesar and Gil Blas  In this demi  character  I knocked at Arsenia s door  Laura was alone in the parlour where we had met last  Ah  is it you  cried she  as soon as she saw me  I thought you were lost  You have had leave to come and see me for this week  but it seems you are modest  and do not presume too much on your license   I made my apology on the score of my master s death  with my own engagements consequent thereupon  and I added  in the spirit of gallantry  that in my greatest perplexities  my lovely Laura had always been foremost in my thoughts  That being so  said she  I have no more reproaches to make  and I will frankly own that I have thought of you  As soon as I was acquainted with the untimely end of Don Matthias  a plan occurred to me  probably not quite displeasing to you  I have heard my mistress say some time ago  that she wanted a sort of man of business  a good arithmetician  to keep an exact account of our outgoings  I fixed my affections on your lordship  you seem exactly calculated for such an office  I feel myself  answered I  a steward by inspiration  I have read all that Aristotle has written on finance  and as for reducing it to the modern system of book  keeping         But  my dear girl  there is one impediment in the way  What impediment  said Laura  I have sworn  replied I  never again to live with a commoner  I have sworn by Styx  or something else as binding  If Jupiter could not burst the links of such an oath  judge whether a poor servant ought not to be bound by it  What do you mean by a commoner  re joined the impetuous abigail  for what do you take us actresses  Do you take us for the ribs of the limbs of the law  for attorneys  wives  I would have you to know  my friend  that actresses rank with the first nobility  being only common to the uncommon  and therefore  though common  uncommonly illustrious   On that footing  my uncommon commoner  said I  the post you have destined for me is mine  I shall not lower my dignity by accepting it  No  to be sure  said she  backwards and forwards between a puppy of fashion and a she wolf of the stage  why  it is exactly preserving an equilibrium of rank in the creation  We are sympathetic animals  just on a level with the people of quality  We have our equipages in the same style  we give our little suppers on the same scale  and on the broad ground we are just of as much use in civil society  In fact  to draw a parallel between a marquis and a player through the space of four and twenty hours  they are just on a par  The marquis  for three  fourths of the time  ranks above the player by political courtesy and sufferance  the player  during his hour on the stage  overtops the marquis in the part of an emperor or a king  which he better knows how to enact  Thus there seems to be a balance between natural and political nobility  which places us at least on a level with the live lumber of the court  Yes  truly  replied I  you are a match for one another  there is no gainsaying it  Bless their dear hearts  the players are not men of straw  as I foolishly believed  and you have made my mouth water to serve such a worshipful fraternity  Well  then  resumed she  you have only to come back again in two days  That time will be sufficient to incline my mistress in your favour  I will speak up for you  She is a little
