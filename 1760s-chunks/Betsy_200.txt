 Sir Frederick   seemed extremely struck at these words  but recovering himself as soon   as he was able   I thought  Madam   cried he   you were entirely at your   own disposal     I am so  Sir   answered she   but I love my brothers    and will do nothing without their approbation     Ah  cruel fair   cried   he   little do you know the delicacy of my passion  I must owe you   wholly to yourself  your brothers  no doubt  will favour my desires  but   it is your own free will alone can make me blessed  Tell me not  then    of brothers   continued he   but generously say you will be mine        Miss Betsy was about to make some reply  when word was brought that a   servant of the elder Mr  Thoughtless desired to speak with her  on which   she arose hastily  and went to the top of the stair case  to hear what   message he had to deliver to her  and was pleasingly surprized when he   told her that his master desired the favour of her company to supper   immediately at his house  As she never had an invitation there before    she was at a loss to guess what could have caused so sudden an   alteration  she asked the fellow what company was there  he told her    only Mr  Francis and another gentleman  whose name he knew not  but   believed they wanted her on some affairs concerning the late Mr    Goodman  because  as he was waiting  he heard them often mention that   gentleman and Lady Mellasin       Though she could not conceive on what purpose she was to be consulted on   any thing relating to Mr  Goodman  yet she was extremely glad that any   occasion had happened to induce her brother to send for her to his   house  and ordered the man to acquaint his master that she would not   fail to wait upon him with as much expedition as a chair could bring   her       On her return to Sir Frederick  she told him she had received a summons   from her elder brother  which she was under an indispensable necessity   of complying with  so desired he would defer  till another opportunity    any farther discourse on the subject they had been talking of  Having   said this  she called hastily for her fan and gloves  and at the same   time gave orders for a chair  Sir Frederick seemed very much confounded    but  finding that any attempt to detain her would be impracticable  took   his leave  saying   You are going to your brother s  Madam   To which   she answering  she was so   I beg then  Madam   rejoined he   that you   will not mention any thing concerning me  or the passion I have for you    till I have the honour of seeing you again  Be assured   continued he     I have mighty reasons for this request  and such as  I flatter myself    you will allow to be just   He said no more  but  perceiving she was   ready  led her down stairs  and having put her into a chair  went into   that which waited for himself  little satisfied with the success of his   visit       Though the motives on which Miss Betsy s company was desired in so much   hurry  by a brother who had never before once invited her  may seem   strange  yet as that incident was but the consequence of other matters   which yet remain untold  regularity requires they should first be   discussed                CHAPTER X       Contains an account of some transactions which  though they may not be   very pleasing in the repetition  nor are of any great consequence to   Miss Betsy  would render this history extremely deficient if omitted          As Lady Mellasin has made so considerable a figure in the former parts   of this history  the reader may  perhaps  now begin to think she has   been too long neglected  it is  therefore  proper to proceed directly to   some account how that guilty and unfortunate woman behaved  after being   driven in the manner already related from the house of her much injured   husband  Mr  Goodman was advised by his lawyers to be extremely private   in the prosecution he was going to commence against her  and by no means   to let her know the secret of her criminal conversation with Marplus had   been discovered to him  this seemed a caution necessary to be observed    in order to prevent her
