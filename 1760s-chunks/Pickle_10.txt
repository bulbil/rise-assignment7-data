were invited to the entertainment  sure I am  she  displayed to the best advantage all the engaging qualities she  possessed  her affability at dinner was altogether uncommon  her  attention to the guests was superfluously hospitable  her tongue was  sheathed with a most agreeable and infantine lisp  her address was  perfectly obliging  and though conscious of the extraordinary capacity  of her month  she would not venture to hazard a laugh  she modelled her  lips into an enchanting simper  which played on her countenance all  day long  nay  she even profited by that defect in her vision we have  already observed  and securely contemplated those features which were  most to her liking  while the rest of the company believed her regards  were disposed in a quite contrary direction  With what humility of  complaisance did she receive the compliments of those who could not help  praising the elegance of the banquet  and how piously did she seize that  opportunity of commemorating the honours of her sire  by observing that  it was no merit in her to understand something of entertainments  as she  had occasion to preside at so many  during the mayoralty of her papa   Far from discovering the least symptom of pride and exultation when the  opulence of her family became the subject of conversation  she assumed  a severity of countenance  and  after having moralized on the vanity  of riches  declared that those who looked on her as a fortune were very  much mistaken  for her father had left her no more than a poor five  thousand pounds  which  with what little she had saved of the interest  since his death  was all she had to depend on  indeed  if she had placed  her chief felicity in wealth  she should not have been so forward in  destroying her own expectations  by advising and promoting the event  at which they were now so happily assembled  but she hoped she should  always have virtue enough to postpone any interested consideration  when  it should happen to clash with the happiness of her friends  Finally   such was her modesty and self denial that she industriously informed  those whom it might concern  that she was no less than three years older  than the bride  though had she added ten to the reckoning  she would  have committed no mistake in point of computation   To contribute as much as lay in her power to the satisfaction of  all present  she in the afternoon regaled them with a tune on the  harpsichord  accompanied with her voice  which  though not the most  melodious in the world  I dare say  would have been equally at their  service could she have vied with Philomel in song  and as the last  effort of her complaisance  when dancing was proposed  she was prevailed  on  at the request of her new sister  to open the ball in person   In a word  Mrs  Grizzle was the principal figure in this festival   and almost eclipsed the bride  who  far from seeming to dispute the  pre eminence  very wisely allowed her to make the best of her talents   contenting herself with the lot to which fortune had already called    6 22 15  3 45 PM   her and which she imagined would not be the less desirable if her  sister in law were detached from the family   I believe I need scarce advertise the reader that  during this whole  entertainment  the commodore and his lieutenant were quite out of their  element  and this  indeed  was the case with the bridegroom himself   who being utterly unacquainted with any sort of polite commerce  found  himself under a very disagreeable restraint during the whole scene   Trunnion  who had scarce ever been on shore till he was paid off  and  never once in his whole life in the company of any females above the  rank of those who herd on the Point at Portsmouth  was more embarrassed  about his behaviour than if he had been surrounded at sea by the whole  French navy  He had never pronounced the word  madam  since he was born   so that  far from entering into conversation with the ladies  he would  not even return the compliment  or give the least note of civility  when they drank to his health  and  I verily believe  would rather have  suffered suffocation than allowed the simple phrase   your servant   to  proceed from his mouth  He was altogether as inflexible with respect to  the attitudes of his body  for  either through obstinacy or bashfulness   he sat upright without motion  insomuch that he provoked the mirth of  a certain wag  who  addressing himself to the lieutenant  asked whether  that was the commodore himself  or the wooden lion that used to stand at  his gate   an image  to which  it must be owned  Mr  Trunnion s person  bore no faint resemblance   Mr  Hatchway  who was not quite so unpolished as the commodore  and had  certain notions that seemed to approach the ideas of common life  made  a
