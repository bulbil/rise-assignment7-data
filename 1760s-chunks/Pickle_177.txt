Spuyl or music houses  which  by the connivance of the  magistrates  are maintained for the recreation of those who might  attempt the chastity of creditable women  if they were not provided  with such conveniences  To one of these night houses did our travellers  repair  under the conduct of the English merchant  and were introduced  into such another place as the ever memorable coffee house of Moll King   with this difference  that the company here were not so riotous as the  bucks of Covent Garden  but formed themselves into a circle  within  which some of the number danced to the music of a scurvy organ and a few  other instruments  that uttered tunes very suitable to the disposition  of the hearers  while the whole apartment was shrouded with clouds of  smoke impervious to the view  When our gentlemen entered  the floor was  occupied by two females and their gallants  who  in the performance of  their exercise  lifted their legs like so many oxen at plough and the  pipe of one of those hoppers happening to be exhausted  in the midst of  his saraband  he very deliberately drew forth his tobacco box  filling  and lighting it again  without any interruption to the dance   Peregrine being unchecked by the presence of his governor  who was too  tender of his own reputation to attend them in this expedition  made up  to a sprightly French girl who sat in seeming expectation of a customer   and prevailing upon her to be his partner  led her into the circle  and  in his turn took the opportunity of dancing a minuet  to the admiration    6 22 15  3 45 PM   of all present  He intended to have exhibited another specimen of his  ability in this art  when a captain of a Dutch man of war chancing to  come in  and seeing a stranger engaged with the lady whom  it seems   he had bespoke for his bedfellow  he advanced without any ceremony  and  seizing her by the arm  pulled her to the other side of the room  Our  adventurer  who was not a man to put up with such a brutal affront   followed the ravisher with indignation in his eyes  and pushing him on  one side  retook the subject of their contest  and led her back to the  place from whence she had been dragged  The Dutchman  enraged at the  youth s presumption  obeyed the first dictates of his choler  and lent  his rival a hearty box on the ear  which was immediately repaid with  interest  before our hero could recollect himself sufficiently to lay  his hand upon his sword  and beckon the aggressor to the door   Notwithstanding the confusion and disorder which this affair produced  in the room  and the endeavours of Pickle s company  who interposed   in order to prevent bloodshed  the antagonists reached the street  and  Peregrine drawing  was surprised to see the captain advance against  him with a long knife  which he preferred to the sword that hung by his  side  The youth  confounded at this preposterous behaviour  desired him   in the French tongue  to lay aside that vulgar implement  and approach  like a gentleman  But the Hollander  who neither understood the  proposal  nor would have complied with this demand  had he been made  acquainted with his meaning  rushed forward like a desperado  before his  adversary could put himself on his guard  and if the young gentleman had  not been endued with surprising agility  his nose would have fallen a  sacrifice to the fury of the assailant  Finding himself in such imminent  jeopardy  he leaped to one side  and the Dutchman passing him  in the  force of his career  he with one nimble kick made such application to  his enemy s heels  that he flew like lightning into the canal  where he  had almost perished by pitching upon one of the posts with which it is  faced   Peregrine having performed this exploit  did not stay for the captain s  coming on shore  but retreated with all despatch  by the advice of his  conductor  and next day embarked  with his companions  in the skuyt   for Haerlem  where they dined  and in the evening arrived at the ancient  city of Leyden  where they met with some English students  who  treated them with great hospitality  Not but that the harmony of the  conversation was that same night interrupted by a dispute that arose  between one of those young gentlemen and the physician  about the  cold and hot methods of prescription in the gout and rheumatism  and  proceeded to such a degree of mutual reviling  that Pickle  ashamed  and incensed at his fellow traveller s want of urbanity  espoused the  other s cause  and openly rebuked him for his unmannerly petulance   which  he said  rendered him unfit for the purposes  and unworthy of the  benefit  of society  This unexpected declaration overwhelmed the doctor  with amazement and confusion  he was instantaneously deprived of his  speech  and  during the remaining part
