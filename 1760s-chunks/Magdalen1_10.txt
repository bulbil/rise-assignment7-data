 IF possible  my charming friend  I shall be down with you in Oxfordshire by the day which I hope will make you the happiest of women  and I wish with all my soul I could get my mama s permission to go down sooner  as I do not at all approve of trusting you so much in company with a man of whom you are so passionately fond  till the ceremony takes place  You tell me that you and he sit up for hours together  and enjoy the most exquisite tete a tetes after the family are in bed—Take care  my dearest Louisa  take care  these tete a tetes are very dangerous things to a woman of your circumstances  and an insidious lover might  in   57 some unguarded moment  reap such an advantage from them  as should make my sweet friend an absolute dependant on his mercy  both for happiness and reputation   Do not imagine  my dear girl  that I am here insinuating any improper doubts of your discretion  I know you have as much prudence as any young woman in England—but  believe me  Louisa  I should tremble for any young woman in England whom I saw in your circumstances  Your lover is a man endued with every art of persuasion and every advantage of person—he is in a few days to be your husband  and  from the nature of his connexion  as well as from the excess of your tenderness  must possess the most unlimited share of your confidence  If  therefore  in some unhappy moment  he should be uncommonly importunate for an anticipation   58 of his happiness  my beautiful friend might find it difficult to withstand his solicitations  the tenderness of her heart might possibly prevail over the force of her understanding  and  to establish a momentary repose in his bosom  she might  perhaps  with a madness of generosity  destroy the everlasting tranquility of her own   Of all the stages in a woman s life  none is so dangerous as the period between her acknowledgement of a passion for a man  and the day set apart for her nuptials  Her mind  during that interval  is susceptible of impressions unusually tender  and the happy lover is admitted to a number of familiarities  which are in themselves the strongest temptations  Without any premeditated design  he is frequently inflamed by the unreserved softness which his mistress assumes in the unsuspecting confidence   59 of her heart  and  unable  perhaps  to resist the impetuosity of his wishes  he endeavours to make the most of his opportunity  Secure of pardon  even if he gives the most palpable offence  he proceeds with boldness to the accomplishment of his purpose  and too many have been the unhappy young women who found themselves undone  before they entertained even a distant fear of destruction   It is no uncommon circumstance among the men  my dearest Louisa  to try how far there is a possibility of carrying their power over a believing woman  and  greatly as they seem to be obliged by the sacrifice which we make them  I do not imagine there was ever a case in which one of them liked us the better for so convincing a proof of our affection—whereas  on the contrary    60 we have numberless instances where that very proof has excited their disgust  and induced them to cast us off   Like a detested Sin   as poor Monimia says  to the irreparable injury both of our peace and our characters  Even where our permitting a lover to anticipate the rights of a husband no way interrupts the treaty of marriage  still it lessens us so much in his opinion  that he ever after suspects our fidelity  and imagines that what proceeded entirely from a passionate regard for himself  was the actual result either of levity or constitution  This single supposition is of itself sufficient to imbitter all the sweets of the hymenaeal union  to blast all the roses round the pillows of love  and to plant perpetual thorns in their stead       61Excuse me  my dearest Louisa  for my anxiety on this occasion—By my uneasiness judge of my friendship  and be assured you are no less tender than happiness or honour to the bosom of your  HARRIOT BEAUCLERK     62  LETTER VI  Sir ROBERT HAROLD to CHARLES MELMOTH  Esq      FINAL destruction seize on all the world   —Perhaps  Melmoth  there is not a fellow this moment existing so compleatly miserable as I—I have succeeded  fatally succeeded  with this amiable wretch  and both of us must bid adieu to happiness for ever     In my last letter I told you how this beautiful woman had entirely conquered all my indifference by the ineffable sweetness of her manner  and that I now longed for the day of our marriage with as much impatience as if I had from the first been passionately smitten  The little separation from her after her departure from Bath  gave an inconceiveable spur to my inclination    63 and the bewitching air of softness with which she received me on my going down to her father s  so compleatly did the business  that I wondered at my own stupidity in being so long insensible of her perfections   The good old people  notwithstanding they seemed highly delighted with my
