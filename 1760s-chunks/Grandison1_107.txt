to go back  my Lucy  with my current narrative  having been thrown behind hand by the long Letters I have been obliged to write  to give you an account of my distress  of my deliverance  of the characters of this noble brother and sister  and a multitude of coincidences and reflexions  which all my dear friends expect  as they fall in  from the pen of their Harriet  And this Letter shall therefore be a kind of diary of that week  only that I will not repeat what my cousin Revees has told me he has written   On Monday I was conducted home in safety  by my kind protector  and his amiable sister   Mrs  Reeves  Lady Betty  and Miss Clements  are in Love with them both   My cousin has told you  how much they disappointed us  in declining to stay dinner  What shall we   263 do  if they are not as fond of our company as we are of theirs  We are not used to be slighted  you know  And to be slighted by those we love  there can be no •earing of that  But I hope this will not be the case   At tea  the name of Sir Rowland Meredith carried me instantly down   Mr  Reeves had old the good Knight  on his calling on the Friday  Saturday  Sunday  and on this day  b•f•re we returned from Colnebrooke▪ that I had been over fatigued at the Masquerade on Thursday night  And so I was   and was gone a little way out of town  Ca•ried he should have said  I was carried with a w•tness   Sir Rowland took notice  that I must have had a smart illness for the time  by my alter d countenance  You are  and must be  ever lovely  Miss Byron  But I think you look not quite so serene  you don t look so composed as you used to do  But I was afraid you were denied to my longing sight  I was afraid you would let your papa go down to Caermarthen  without giving him an opportunity to bless his cross girl  It is in vain  I fear  to urge you—He stopt  and look d full in my face—Pray  Sir Rowland  said I  how does my brother Fowler   Why  ay  that s the duce of it  Your brother Fowler  But as the honest man says  so say I  I will not teaze you  But never  never  will you have—But no more of that—I come to take my leave of you  I should have set out this very morning  could I have seen you on Saturday or Yesterday  But I shall go to morrow morning early  You are glad of that  madam  I am sure   Indeed  Sir Rowland  I shall always respect and value you  And I hope I shall have your good wishes  Sir—  Yes  yes  madam  you need not doubt it  And I will humble all the proud women in Wales  by telling them of Miss Byron     264 You tell me  my Lucy  that you were all moved at one of the conversations I gave you between the Knight  Mr  Fowler  and myself   Were I to be as particular in my account of what passed on Sir Rowland s taking leave of me  as I was on that other occasion  and were you to judge by the effect his honest tenderness had on me  as I craved his blessing  and as he blessed me  the big tears  unheeded by himself  straying down his reverend cheeks  I think you would have been in like manner affected   Mr  Fowler is to go down after him—If—if—if  said the Knight  looking fervently in my face—  I should be glad  I said  to see  and to wish my brother a good journey   Tuesday morning early I had a kind enquiry after my rest  from Miss Grandison  in her brother s name  as well as in her own  And about eleven o clock came the dear Lady herself  She would run up stairs to me  following Sally—In her dressing room  say you —She shall not come down   She entered with the maid—Writing  my dear  said she  I one day hope  my Harriet  you will shew me all you write —There  there  sitting down by me  no bustle  And how does my fair friend —Well—I see very well—To a Lover—or of a Lover—that s the same thing —  Thus  sweetly familiar  ran she on   Mrs  Reeves entered  Excuse me  madam  said Miss Grandison  This is but one of my flying visits▪ as I call them  My next shall be to you  But perhaps I may not make it in form neither  We are relations  you know  How does Mr  Reeves  He is a good man  At home —  He is  madam  and will be rejoiced—  I know he will—Why  madam  this our Byron  our Harriet  I should say  looks charmingly —You had best lock her up  There are many more Sir Hargrave s in the world  than
