my    uncle Toby  No  replied Dr  Slop —he would have an old house over his head  Pray is the Inquisition an antient building  answered my uncle Toby or is it a modern one —I know nothing of architecture  replied Dr  Slop —An  please your Honours  quoth Trim  the Inquisition is the vilest—Pri thee spare thy description  Trim  I hate the very name of it  said my father —No matter for that  answered Dr  Slop —it has its uses  for tho  I m no great advocate for it  yet in such a case as this  he would soon be taught better manners  and I can tell him  if he went on at that rate  would be flung into the Inquisition for his pains  God help him then  quoth my uncle Toby  Amen  added Trim  for  heaven above knows  I have a poor brother who has been fourteen years a captive in it —I never heard one word of it before  said    my uncle Toby  hastily —How came he there  Trim —O  Sir  the story will make your heart bleed —as it has made mine a thousand times —but it is too long to be told now —your Honour shall hear it from first to last some day when I am working beside you in our fortifications —but the short of the story is this —That my brother Tom went over a servant to Lisbon —and then married a Jew s widow  who kept a small shop  and sold sausages  which  some how or other  was the cause of his being taken in the middle of the night out of his bed  where he was lying with his wife and two small children  and carried directly to the Inquisition  where  God help him  continued Trim  fetching a sigh from the bottom of his heart —the poor honest lad lies confined at this hour —he was as honest a soul  added Trim      pulling out his handkerchief  as ever blood warm d —  —The tears trickled down Trim s cheeks faster than he could well wipe them away —A dead silence in the room ensued for some minutes —Certain proof of pity   Come  Trim  quoth my father  after he saw the poor fellow s grief had got a little vent —read on —and put this melancholy story out of thy head —I grieve that I interrupted thee —but pri thee begin the sermon again —for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse  as thou sayest  I have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the Apostle has given   Corporal Trim wiped his face  and returning his handkerchief into his pocket     and  making a bow as he did it —he began again    The SERMON     HEBREWS xiii  18   —For we trust we have a good Conscience —   TRust  trust we have a good conscience  Surely if there is any thing in this life which a man may depend upon  and to the knowledge of which he is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence  it must be this very thing —whether he has a good conscience or no     I am positive I am right  quoth Dr  Slop       If a man thinks at all  he cannot well be a stranger to the true state of this account —he must be privy to his own thoughts and desires —he must remember his past pursuits  and know certainly the true springs and motives  which  in general  have governed the actions of his life     I defy him  without an assistant  quoth Dr  Slop     In other matters we may be deceived by false appearances  and  as the wise man  complains  hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon the earth  and with labour do we find the things that are before us  But here the mind has all the evidence and facts within herself —is conscious of the web she has wove —knows its texture and    fineness  and the exact share which every passion has had in working upon the several designs which virtue or vice has plann d before her     The language is good  and I declare Trim reads very well  quoth my father     Now —as conscience is nothing else but the knowledge which the mind has within herself of this  and the judgment  either of approbation or censure  which it unavoidably makes upon the successive actions of our lives   tis plain you will say  from the very terms of the proposition —whenever this inward testimony goes against a man  and he stands self accused —that he must necessarily be a guilty man —And  on the contrary  when the report is favourable on his side  and his heart condemns    him not —that it is not a mater of trust  as the Apostle intimates —but a matter of certainty and fact  that the conscience is good  and that the man must be good also     Then the Apostle is altogether in the wrong  I suppose  quoth Dr  Slop  and the Protestant divine is in the right  Sir  have patience
