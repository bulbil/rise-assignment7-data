Mr  Clement  if   so be that your name be Clement  I wish you a mighty good    morning      She was not long abroad  and on her return I observed a   kind of heavenly radiance that seemed to beam throughout   her countenance  from whence I prophesied all manner of happy   success  But continuing silent for some time  and looking eagerly         THE FOOL OF QUALITY  117     at me  she suddenly threw herself into my bosom  and burst into   tears      Ah  Hammy   she cried  I had hopes I was very stout   but   frail nature  in spite of grace  confesses me a coward  I thought   I could have seen you perish with patience  with delight  provided   I saw a happy immortality before you  But now that your suf    ferings are at hand  I find them insupportable  I tremble also for   your faith  lest it should not support you under the impending trial    Yes  Hammy  all is over  All is finished  my love  and the hand of   our God is in it  Our dear Miss Hodginses were not to blame   the   eldest died suddenly since we saw them  and the youngest is with a   distant relation in the country  We have nothing further to hope    neither to fear  from this world  Our God has shut us out by every   door  and will neither permit the friendship  the humanity  or   charity of others  neither our own industry or ingenuity  to yield us   a morsel of bread   to convince us that we are his  and that all   things are his   that when he openeth his hand there is plenty on   every side  but when he pleaseth to shut there is no resource  What   say you  then  my husband   Are you willing to run this last short   course   The prize is glorious  unspeakable  and lies within a very   few paces of your grasp  You must run it  my husband  and your   repugnance would but serve to make it insufferable  But patience   and courage would give you strength to endure   and a little further   conformity to the will of our Disposer would turn all the bitterness   into delight  Our time is done  our task is finished   we are already   brought to nothing  that our all may be in God      Yes  I answered  it is evident from a chain of successive proofs    I see the hand of God in all that concerns us   and I am pleased   with any instances of his notice and attention  whatever his final   purpose may be  I will no longer struggle with his omnipotence     nor make my ignorance a sounding line for his unbottomed wisdom    If to see you and our little innocent thus famishing by the hour   if    in contemplating your wants and imagining your pains  I feel an   anguish above what death can give   why  let it be   rend  heart    into a thousand pieces   A period must at length be put to our   sufferings  and all beyond shall be peace  or what God pleases  But   do you  Arabella  do you lead the way  my patroness  my director     I will endeavour to keep the brightness of your example in view     that neither here  nor hereafter  I may lose sight of her  without   whom  here or hereafter  I think I cannot be happy      About nine the next morning our landlady entered  followed by   two constables and two appraisers  Thus authorized  as she ima    gined  the first thing she did was to search our pockets for money    but without effect   as we had expended our last penny the day   before for bread  She  however  found my wife s case of scissors    and other implements for her business   and gathering up our boxes    linen  handkerchiefs  and a variety of articles which we never had a   notion of converting into money  she laid them all before the   appraisers   who  on frequent consultation  valued the same to four   pounds nine shillings  my wife s gown included  being nine and    thirty shillings more than we owed  But this  our honest landlady   very prudently observed  was scarce sufficient for costs and other         118 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      damages which she had suffered  or might have suffered  or might   yet suffer on our accounts      Thus we were turned out  almost naked  to
