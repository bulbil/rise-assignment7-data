to break in upon another    My baker  barber  brewer  butcher  hatter  hosier  and tailor  are   unquestionably of use  though I have not the honour of being ac    quainted with one of them   and hitherto I have deemed it sufficient   to send my servants to entertain and pay them their bills  without   admitting them to a tete a tete  as at present      He now rejoined  with a little warmth My lord  we pardon your   indelicacy in consideration of your error  The venerable body now   present might be admitted to a tete a tete with the first estate of   this kingdom  without any condescension on the part of majesty    And  would you allow yourself to be duly informed  I should soon   make you sensible that we have actually done you the honour   which we intended by this visit      Permit me to repeat  that the wealth  prosperity  and importance   of every thing upon earth  arises from the TILLER  the MANUFAC    TURER  and the MERCHANT   and that  as nothing is truly estimable   save in proportion to its utility  these are consequently very far   from being contemptible characters  The tiller supplies the manu    facturer  the manufacturer supplies the merchant  and the merchant   supplies the world with all its wealth  It is thus that industry is   promoted  arts invented and improved  commerce extended  super    fluities mutually vended   wants mutually supplied   that each man   becomes a useful member of society  that societies become further   of advantage to each other   and that states are enabled to pay and   dignify their upper servants with titles  rich revenues  principalities    and crowns      The merchant  above all  is extensive  considerable  and re    spectable  by his occupation  It is he who furnishes every comfort    convenience  and elegance of life   who carries off every redundance                26 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      who fills up every want   who ties country to country  and clime to   clime  and brings the remotest regions to neighbourhood and con    verse   who makes man to be literally the lord of the creation  and   gives him an interest in whatever is done upon earth   who furnishes   to each the product of all lands  and the labours of all nations     and thus knits into one family  and weaves into one web  the   affinity and brotherhood of all mankind      I have no quarrel  I cried  to the high and mighty my lords  the   merchants  if each could be humbly content with the profits of his   profession  without forming themselves into companies  exclusive of   their brethren  our itinerant merchants and pedlars  I confess my    self an enemy to the monopolies of your chartered companies   and city corporations   and I can perceive no evil consequence to   the public or the state  if all such associations were this instant   dissolved      Permit me  he mildly replied  once for all  to set your lordship   right in this matter  I am sensible that the gentlemen of large   landed properties are apt to look upon themselves as the pillars   of the state  and to consider their interests  and the interests of the   nation  as very little beholden to or dependent on trade   though   the fact is  that those very gentlemen would lose nine parts in ten   of their returns  and the nation nine tenths of her yearly revenues    if industry and the arts  promoted  as I said  by commerce  did not   raise the products of lands to tenfold their natural value  The   manufacturer  on the other hand  depends on the landed interest   for nothing save the materials of his craft   and the merchant is   wholly independent of all lands  or  rather  he is the general patron   thereof  I must further observe to your lordship  that this bene    ficent profession is by no means confined to individuals  as you   would have it  Large societies of men  nay  mighty nations  may   and have been merchants  When societies incorporate for such a   worthy purpose  they are formed as a foetus within the womb of   the mother  a constitution within the general state or constitution     their particular laws and regulations ought always to be con    formable to those of the national system   and  in that case  such   corporations greatly conduce to the peace and good order of   cities and large towns  and to the general power and prosperity
