 and told us he had got one  and that it waited at the   gate  We then  indeed  knocked at Lord      s door  and being answered   from the windows by the servants  in a very impertinent manner  I   believe we might utter some words not very respectful either of his   lordship or his sister  whose behaviour in this affair I am as yet   entirely ignorant how to account for        The bishop paused a considerable time  but on Mr  Bloomacre s repeating   what he had said before  concerning bringing the young lady herself to   vouch the truth of what he had related to his lordship  replied  that   there was no occasion for troubling either her or himself any farther    that he believed there had been some mistake in the business  and that   he should think no more of it  on which Mr  Bloomacre took his leave       Though the bishop had not mentioned the name of Lord      to Mr    Bloomacre  as the person who had brought this complaint against him  yet   he was very certain  by all circumstances  that he could be indebted to   no other for such a piece of low malice  and this  joined to some other   provocations he had received from the ill will of that nobleman  made   him resolve to do himself justice       He went directly from the deanry in search of the two gentlemen who had   been with him in the Abbey when he happened to meet Miss Betsy  and    having found them both  they went to a tavern together  in order to   consult on what was proper to be done  for the chastisement of Lord        s folly and ill nature       Both of them agreed with Mr  Bloomacre  that he ought to demand that   satisfaction which every gentleman has a right to expect from any one   who has injured him  of what degree soever he be  excepting those of   royal blood  Each of them was so eager to be his second in this affair    that they were obliged to draw lots for the determination of the choice    he who had the ill luck  as he called it  to draw the shortest cut    would needs oblige them to let him be the bearer of the challenge  that   he might at least have some share in inflicting the punishment  which   the behaviour of that unworthy lord so justly merited       The challenge was wrote  the place appointed for meeting was the field   behind Montague House  but the gentleman who carried it  brought no   answer back  his lordship telling him only that he would consider on the   matter  and let Mr  Bloomacre know his intentions       Mr  Bloomacre  as the principal  and the other as his second  were so   enraged at this  that the latter resolved to go himself  and force a   more categorical answer  He did so  and Lord      having had time to   consult his brother  and  as it is said  some other friends  told him   he accepted the challenge  and would be ready with his second at the   time and place appointed in it       Mr  Bloomacre did not go home that whole day  therefore knew nothing of   the message that had been left for him by Mr  Goodman  till it was too   late to comply with it  but this seeming remissness in him was not all   that troubled the mind of that open and honest hearted guardian of Miss   Betsy  Mr  Trueworth and Mr  Staple had both been at his house the day   before  the former  on hearing his mistress was abroad  left only his   compliments  and went away  though very much pressed to come in by Miss   Flora  who seeing him through the parlour window  ran to the door   herself  and intreated he would pass the evening there  Mr  Staple came   the moment after  and met his rival coming down the steps that led up to   the door  Mr  Trueworth saluted him  in passing  with the usual   complaisance  which the other returned in a very cool manner  and   knocked hastily at the door   I imagine   said he to the footman who   opened it   that Miss Betsy is not at home  by that gentleman s having   so early taken leave  but I would speak with Mr  Goodman  if he be at   leisure        He was then shewed into the back parlour  which was the room where Mr    Goodman generally received those persons who came to him upon business
