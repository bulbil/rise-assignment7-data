 It is very happy  reply d I  that we do not all of us like the same person  I mean not to disparage Sir Hargrave  but I have compassion for the Ladies who sigh for him in secret  One woman only can be his wife  and perhaps she will not be one of those who sigh for him  especially were he to know that she does   Perhaps not  reply d Miss Cantillon  But I do assure you  that I am not one of those who sigh for Sir Hargrave   The Ladies smiled   I am glad of it  madam  said I  Every woman should have her heart in her own keeping  till she can find a worthy man to bestow it upon   Miss Barnevelt took a tilt in heroics  Well  Ladies  said she  you may talk of Love and Love as much as you please  but it is my glory  that I never knew what Love was  I  for my part  like a brave man  a gallant man  One in whose loud praise fame has crack d half a dozen trumpets  But as to your milksops  your dough baked Lovers  who stay at home and strut among the women  when glory is to be gain d in the martial field  I despise them with all my heart  I have often wish d that the foolish heads of such fellows as these  were all cut off in time of war  and sent over to the heroes to fill their cannon with  when they batter in breach  by way of saving ball   I am afraid  said Lady Betty  humouring this romantic speech  that if the heads of such persons were as soft as we are apt sometimes to think them  they would be of as little service abroad as they are at home     83 O  madam  replied Miss Barnevelt  there is a good deal of lead in the heads of these fellows  But were their brains  said the shocking creature  if any they have  made to fly about the ears of an enemy  they would serve both to blind and terrify him   Even Mr  Singleton was affected with this horrid speech  for he clapt both his hands to his head  as if he were afraid of his brains   Lady Betty was very urgent with us to pass the evening with her  but we excused ourselves  and when we were in the coach  Mr  Reeves told me  that I should find the Baronet a very troublesome and resolute Lover  if I did not give him countenance   And so  Sir  said I  you would have me do  as I have heard many a good woman has done  marry a man  in order to get rid of his importunity   And a certain cure too  let me tell you  cousin  said he  smiling   We sound at home  waiting for Mr  Reeves s return  Sir John Allestree  A worthy sensible man  of plain and unaffected manners  upwards of fifty   Mr  Reeves mentioning to him our past entertainment and company  Sir John gave us such an account of Sir Hargrave  as helped me not only in the character I have given of him  but let me know that he is a very dangerous and enterprising man  He says  that laughing and light as he is in company  he is malicious  ill natured  and designing  and sticks at nothing to carry a point on which he has once set his heart  He has ruined  Sir John says  three young creatures already under vows of marriage   Sir John spoke of him as a managing man  as to his fortune  He said  That tho  he would at times be lavish in the pursuit of his pleasures  yet that he had some narrownesses which made him despised  and that most by those for whose regard a good man would principally wish  his neighbours and tenants   Could you have thought  my Lucy  that this laughing    84 fine dressing man  could have been a man of malice  of resentment  of enterprize  a cruel man  Yet Sir John told two very bad stories of him  besides what I have mentioned  which prove him to be all I have said   But I had no need of these stories to determine me against receiving his addresses  What I saw of him was sufficient  though Sir John made no manner of doubt  on being told by Mr  Reeves  in confidence  of his application to him for leave to visit me  that he was quite in earnest  and  making me a compliment  added  that he knew Sir Hargrave was inclined to marry  and the more  as one half of his estate  on failure of issue male  would go at his death to a distant relation whom he hated  but for no other reason than for admonishing him  when a school boy  on his low and mischievous pranks   His estate  Sir John told my cousin  is full as considerable as reported  And Mr  Reeves  after Sir John went away  said  What a glory will it be to you
