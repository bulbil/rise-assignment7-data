and all Ages of Men  even from their childish Years  which would be an Institution of admirable Service to the World   Read the whole nineteenth Epistle  and the Comment upon it  I fancy there are some Passages in both  which will strike and please my dear Fanny  and  in order to leave the Impression on your Mind  I shall put an End to this Letter  with the Addition only of an Allusion to one of Prior s Poems    So thinking on thy charming Youth   c      Henry   Page  142  LETTER CCXXVIII  HENRY to FRANCES   I SUPPOSE  by my not hearing from you last Post  that you do not get my Letters regularly  which  I hope  is owing to your being retired to the Rock  though you have  at present  extreme bad Weather for Bathing  I have a melancholy Prospect before me for my Wheat Harvest  and I have the greatest Quantity  and the best in this Country  most of which is lodged by the Rain  and shedding by the Wind  Mais vive la Philosophie   I hope to have a Letter from you To day  but cannot get it  before this goes to the Post  So I shall go on with my Pliny  which I never read  but when I am to write to you  and  as I undertook this Work merely for your Amusement  so I find it now  for that Reason  if I had no other  the pleasantest Manner of reading  It is certainly the most improving Method too  and  if I had a great Fortune  I would allow a good Salary to a Librarian  who should antecede my Study  and mark out to me only those Passages  which were remarkable or ingenious  improving or entertaining  as I would give my new Shoes to a Servant to wear first  The Person  I would employ for this Purpose  should Page  143 rather be one of a refined Taste than of deep Learning  and of more natural Understanding than great acquired Knowledge  In short  my dearest Fanny  you should be my Minerva  my Preceptor  for even from your Fragments I might hope to grow rich in Wisdom  and to be polished into Virtue  This last Expression has made a Sentiment occur to me  that there is a certain refined Taste   Parsons may call it Grace  if they will  which  unless born with a Man  the best disposed Christian will be but an heavy  unformed Lump of Morality  What is that Reverence for the Antients  that humane Love for our Cotemporaries  that generous Benevolence for Posterity  that tender Sense for another s Sorrow  that high Relish for a Stranger s Happiness  and  lastly  that noble  philosophic  heart thrilling  and religious Ardor  which possesses the whole Soul with enthusiastic Rapture  upon the Contemplation of the astonishing Greatness of the Works of Providence  and the infinite Goodness of their incomprehensible Author  What are all these refined Pleasures owing to  I say  but to a natural Taste and quick Relish for Virtue  to a certain gifted Capacity  large enough to comprehend the whole intellectual Universe  that is  all Mankind  past  present  and to come  and reaches so high  as to embrace even God himself  all which a plain  good Man has no more Idea of  Page  144 than we can of the Pleasures of a sixth Sense  Addison has somewhat the same Turn of Thought with Regard to Piety  when he says    that some People want Parts to be devout  and could as soon make an Epic Poem  as a fervent Prayer     But to return to Pliny  who is properly enough introduced after such a Subject  as carried me beyond myself just now   The twenty first Epistle of the fourth Book is an extreme pretty one  I wept for the Helvidiae  not so much for their Death  as for Pliny s Grief at it   In the next Epistle there is a poetical Witticism in the Allusion of the Arrow  which is  I think  the first Instance of that Kind  I have met with in this Author   I am charmed with the whole twenty third Epistle  That truly noble and philosophic Exclamation  wishing for that Stage of Life  when he might live to himself  transports me  There is nothing  for which I despise a Person so much  as the paltry Wish to be younger  a childish Longing for a Bib and Bells again  He must have spent his Life very ill  or mean to do so  who would desire to return back to any Aera of it  for we are  at any Stage  capable of Virtue   In the twenty eighth Epistle  Pliny has mistaken the Matter  with regard to Painting  for  Page  145 I think  it is a much easier Matter to copy a Picture  than to draw from the Life   In the last Epistle of this fourth Book  he mentions a Spring  which ebbed and flowed  There is a Well some Miles from this  which is reported to do the same  I never examined into it  but shall ride
