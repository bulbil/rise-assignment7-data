Mrs  SELBY    Dear Madam   I Am broke in upon by a most impertinent visiter  Such  at this time  must have been the dearest friend I have in the world  You will be so good as to excuse my attendance till dinner time  For the past two hours I thought every moment of disengaging myself  or I should have sent sooner   Ever Yours   c   What visiter  said I  can make a man stay  against his mind —Who can get rid politely of an impertinent visiter  if Sir Charles Grandison cannot  on a previous engagement —But come  madam  I attend you —Down we went   My uncle was out of patience  I was sorry for it  I tried to make the best of it  yet  but to pacify him  should  perhaps  have had petulance enough myself to make the worst of it —Oy  oy  with all my heart  said he  in answer to my excuses  let us hear what Sir Charles has to say for himself  But  old as I am  were my dame Selby to give me another chance  no man on earth  I can tell you  should keep me from a previous engagement with my mistress  It is kind of you  Harriet  to excuse him  however  Love hides a multitude of saults     70 My aunt said not one syllable in behalf of Sir Charles  She is vexed  and disappointed   We made a very short breakfasting  and looked upon one another as people who would have helped themselves  if they could  Mr  Deane  however  would engage  he said  that we should be fatisfied with Sir Charles s excuses  when we came to hear them   But  my dear  this man  this visiter  whoever he is  must be of prodigious importance  to detain him  from an engagement that I had hoped might have been thought a first engagement —yet owned to be impertinent  And must not the accident be very uncommon  that should bring such a one  a stranger as Sir Charles is  in his way  Yet this might very well happen  my uncle observes  at an inn  whither we thought fit to send him   Now I think of it  I was strangely disturbed last night in my imperfect slumbers  Something  I thought  was to happen to prevent me ever being his  But hence  Recollection  I chase thee from me  Yet when realities disturb  shadows will officiously obtrude on the busy imagination as realities   Friday  12 o Clock   My grandmamma is come—Lucy  Nancy  are come—O how vexed at our disappointment and chagrin are my two cousins  But my grandmamma joins with Mr  Deane  to think the best  I have stolen up  But here  he is come  How shall I do to keep my anger  He shall find me below  I will see how he looks  at entrance among us—If he is careless—If he makes slight excuses—    71  LETTER XVIII  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   Friday  Two o Clock   I Am stolen up again  to tell you how it is  I never will be petulant again—Dear Sir  forgive me  How wicked in us all  but my grandmamma and Mr  Deane  to blame a man who cannot be guilty of a wilful fault  The fault is all my aunt s and mine—Was my aunt ever in fault before   We were all together when he entered  He addressed himself to us  in that noble manner  which engages every body in his favour  at first sight  How  said he  bowing to every one  have I suffered  in being hindered  by an unhappy man  from doing myself the honour of attending you sooner   You see  my dear  he made not apologies to me  as if he supposed me disappointed by his absence  I was afraid he would  I know I looked very grave   He then particularly addressed himself to each  to me first  next to my grandmamma  and taking one of her hands between both his  and bowing upon it  I rejoice to see you  madam  said he—Your last favours will ever be remembered by me  with gratitude  I see you well  I hope  Your Miss Byron will be well  if you are  and our joy  looking round him  will then be complete   She bowed her head  pleased with his compliment  so were my aunt  and Lucy  and Nancy  I was still a little sullen  otherwise I should have been pleased too  that he made my health depend on that of my grandmamma   Madam  said he  turning to my aunt  I am afraid I made you wait for me at breakfast  A most impertinent visiter  He put me out of humour  I dared not to let you and yours  looking at me  see  how   72 much I could be out of humour  I am naturally passionate  But passion is so ugly  so deforming a thing  that  if I can help it  I will never  by those
