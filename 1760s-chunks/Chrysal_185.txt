the money in the   kingdom into our own hands  so that now they dare not provoke   us too far  though I own I do suspect that the design of the present   rulers is to get out of our power as soon as this war is over  if our   old friends do not counteract their dfsigns          But all this time this talking signifies nothing to our affairs     what do they say to them   What reasons do they give for en    couraging these outrages  in breach of treaties and contempt of   justice           In truth  my friend  a great many  that are more just than   agreeable  more easily exclaimed against than refuted  In answer   to your alleging the faith of treaties  they insist that they strictly   observe the sense and spirit of them  while you only cavil about   the words  it being absurd to think that any nation should bind   up its own hands in the manner you pretend   or  even if that was   the meaning of the treaty at the time when it was made  that your   abuse of the indulgence given by it makes it necessary to retract   it now  and they express the most indignant surprise at your in    sisting so strongly upon one article  which  at best  is but doubtful    and would be in itself absurd  in the sense you wrest it to  while you   break through so many  the meaning of which you do not even   pretend to dispute          Then we will dispute no longer about them   we wiU enforce   their observation by the same methods that originally obtaiued   them          Ay  if that could be   but  my friend  I cannot flatter you   I   am afraid those means are out of your power  You were then really    mighty states  respectable for your power  and dreadful for your   valour   but the case is now altered  I need not say how         Ungrateful English  to forget how we rescued them from popery     1 Alludes to the Amboyna massacre of 1623  when the Dutch tortured   many English traders to death  In 1654 they were compelled to pay   Â£300 000 compensation to the children of the victims          206 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     and slavery but the other day  Had it not been for us  they would    at best  have been but slaves to EVance          The very charge they make against you  who  they say  could   never have resisted the power of Spain  or established your liberties    if their Queen Elizabeth had not hearkened to the cries of your poor   distressed states  As for the affair you mention  though they do   not deny the benefit  they take off from the obligation by attribut    ing it to self interested motives  as  they say  you were convinced   that if anything happened to them  you must sink  of course   besides    that you have been amply paid for this  by the immense expense of   blood and treasure with which they established your barrier in the   late wars  which they evidently entered into on your account  to   the neglect of their own interest  In a word  my friend  there is   so much truth in what they say that I would not advise you to   insist upon these points any more          Confound the points  and the memories that rip them up so    What shall we do   I myself lost a ship last week  worth fifty   thousand ducats   though all the precautions possible were taken    as sending her papers by another ship  supplying her with false   bills of lading  false clearances  false consignments â€” in short  every    thing that human art could devise  And I know she was as well   sworn for  to prevent her being condemned  as human conscience   could swear   but nothing could elude the captors  or deceive or   influence the judges          But was she not insured           Not a ducat   there is nothing to be got by insuring  except the   ships are to be cast away  Oh  my ship  my ship   I will have   war          And then all your ships go at once       I am distracted  What shall we do           My friend  the
