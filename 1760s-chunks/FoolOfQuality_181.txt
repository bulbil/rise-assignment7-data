I   assure you that I have not set my eyes either on the original or   picture these twenty years      What is this you tell me   exclaimed my lord  You are not yet    as I take it  thirty years of age  Could you love  even to passion    at so very early a period       Here I found myself under the necessity of discovering to my   husband the little adventures  impressions  and sentiments of my   infancy  wherewith you are already acquainted  When I had   finished my short narrative  he seized my hand  and pressing it   passionately to his lips  and then to his burning bosom  he melted   into tears  O  my Fanny   he cried   my most noble  my adorable   creature   What a combat have you fought   what a conquest have   you gained  of grace over nature of virtue against passion   Can   you excuse me   Will you forgive me   May I hope that you will   restore me to the blessings of your friendship   May I flatter my    self that you gave me as much as you could of your affections     That  if you had been able  you would have loved me with a love   like mine      I will not distress you  my cousin  by a description of the affecting   scenes that ensued  My husband left me vastly rich  but still more   forlorn  During the first years of widowhood  I looked upon myself   as a friendless and unnecessary burden upon earth  Though I   thought of you at times  it was not without a resentment and a   tincture of aversion  for your never having deigned to inquire or   find out whether any such person as your too affectionate Fanny         TEE FOOL OF QUALITY  181     Goodall was in the land of the living  At length my physicians   and my friends  as they styled themselves  prevailed upon me once   more to enter into the light  and air  and amusements of their   world  I consented  I found my advantage in it  I gradually got   rid of the grievous oppression that lay upon my spirits  Since  all is   vanity  thought I  let us partake of the dissipation   and make it as   pleasing as we can   and accordingly you found me in the engage    ments which you honoured with your inspection yesterday      When you entered  I did not know you  The strange name of   Fenton  as well as the alteration which years had made in you  shut   you out almost wholly from my recollection  I felt myself  however    agitated  I knew not why  Something in your person and manner   renewed in my heart impressions kindred to those which were once   its sole concern  I could not look at you  I could not speak to you    without emotion  All night I lay disturbed  in vain endeavouring   to remember when or where I had seen you  At morning  a sudden   light darted in upon my mind  I got up and flew to your picture    which at once laid all open  and detected your disguise      You are much altered  cousin  Had I first seen you as you now   appear  I think my young heart would not have been so deeply   affected  The ruin  however  is still very noble  and endearingly   renews hi me the idea of what the building once was      Your abstracted air  and the change of your name  seem to   intimate some distressing situation   but if fifty thousand pounds  or   that sum doubled  will be of use to you  I shall for once think that   fortune has been of advantage to me      My most dear and generous cousin  replied Mr  Fenton  I shall never   pardon myself those griefs which the excess of my affection inad    vertently occasioned you  No brother ever loved a sister  no parent   a child  with fonder passion  The aversion which I thought you   had suddenly taken to me  was one of the most sensible afflictions of   my life   and my ignorance of what latterly became of you  can only   be accounted for by an abstract of my own story      Here Mr  Fenton called for chocolate  And  after breakfast  he   gave Lady Maitland the following affecting history of his own life   and adventures          CHAPTER XIII      STOBY OF THE HON  MB  CLINTON      THE world  my lovely cousin the world is to man as his
