 A meeting was proposed by Filmer  between Sir Charles  the mother  the aunt  and himself  at the aunt s house in Pallmall  Sir Charles was very desirous to conceal his father s frailty from the world  He met them  But before he enter d into discourse  made it his request to be allowed half an hour s conversation with Miss Obrien by herself  at the same time  praising  as it deserved  her beauty   They were in hopes  that she would be able to make an impression on the heart of so young and so lively a man  and complied  Under pretence of preparing her for so unexpected a visit  her aunt gave her cue  But  instead of her captivating him  he brought her to such confessions  as sufficiently let him into the baseness of their views   He returned to company  the young woman in his hand  He represented to the mother the wickedness of the part she had come over to act  in such strong terms  that she fell into a fit  The aunt was terrified    227 The young creature wept  and vowed that she would be honest   Sir Charles told them  That if they would give him up his father s two Letters  and make a solemn promise never to open their lips on the affair  and would procure for her an honest husband  he would give her 1000l  on the day of marriage  and  if the made a good wise  would be further kind to her   Filmer was very desirous to clear himself of having any hand in the blacker part of this plot  Sir Charles did not seem solicitous to detect and expose him  But left the whole upon his conscience  And having made before several objections to his account  which could not be so well obviated in England  he went over to Ireland with Filmer  and there very speedily settled every thing to his own satisfaction  and  dismissing him more genteelly than he deserved  took upon himself the management of that estate  directing several obvious improvements to be made  which are likely to turn to great account   On his return  he heard that Miss Obrien was ill of the small pox  He was not  for her own sake sorry for it  She suffer d in her face  but still was pretty and genteel  And she is now the honest and happy wife of a tradesman near Golden square who is very fond of her  Sir Charles gave with her the promised sum  and another 100 l  for wedding cloaths   One part of her happiness and her husband s is  that her aunt  supposing she had disgraced herself by this match  never comes near her  And her mother is return d to Ireland to her husband  greatly dissatisfied with her daughter on the same account   While these matters were agitating  Sir Charles forgot not to enquire what steps had been taken with regard to the alliance proposed between himself and Lady Frances N   He paid his first visit to the father and brother of that Lady     228 All that the sisters know of this matter  is  that the treaty was  on this first visit  entirely broken off  Their brother  however  speaks of the Lady  and of the whole family  with great respect  The Lady is known to esteem him highly  Her father  her brother  speak of him every where with great regard  Lord N  calls him the finest young gentleman in England  And so  Lucy  I believe he is  Sir Charles Grandison  Lord N  once said  knows better by non compliance  how to create friendships  than most men do by compliance   Lady L  and Miss Grandison  who  as I have before intimated  have another Lady whom they favour  once said to him  that the Earl and his son Lord N  were so constantly speaking in his praise  that they could not but think that it would at last be a match between him and Lady Frances  His answer was  The Lady is infinitely deserving  But it cannot be   I am ready to wish  he would say  what can be  that we need not—Ah  Lucy —I know not what I would say  But so it will always be with silly girls  that distinguish not between the would and the should  One of which  is  Your HARRIET BYRON   LETTER XXIV  Miss BYRON  In Continuation   I WILL proceed with the family history   Sir Charles forgot not  on his arrival in England  to pay an early visit to Lord W  his mother s brother  who was then at his house near Windsor   I have told you  that my Lord had conceived a dislike to him  and that for no other reason  but because his father loved him  Lord W  was laid up with the gout when he came  But he was instantly admitted to his stately presence  The first salutations    229 on one side  were respectful  on the other coldly civil  My Lord often survey d his kinsman from head to foot  as he sat  as if he were loth to like
