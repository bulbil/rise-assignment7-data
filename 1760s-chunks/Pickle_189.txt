of  laughter  On the other hand  when Peregrine  in consequence of having  danced with one of the minors overnight  visited her in the morning   the Platonists immediately laid hold on the occasion  tasked their  imaginations  associated ideas  and  with sage insinuations  retailed a    6 22 15  3 45 PM   thousand circumstances of the interview  which never had any foundation  in truth  They observed  that  if girls are determined to behave with  such indiscretion  they must lay their accounts with incurring the  censure of the world  that she in question was old enough to act more  circumspectly  and wondered that her mother would permit any young  fellow to approach the chamber while her daughter was naked in bed   As for the servants peeping through the key hole  to be sure it was an  unlucky accident  but people ought to be upon their guard against  such curiosity  and give their domestics no cause to employ their  penetration  These and other such reflections were occasionally  whispered as secrets among those who were known to be communicative  so  that  in a few hours  it became the general topic of discourse  and   as it had been divulged under injunctions of secrecy  it was almost  impossible to trace the scandal to its origin  because every person  concerned must have promulgated her own breach of trust  in discovering  her author of the report   Peregrine  instead of allaying  rather exasperated this contention   by an artful distribution of his attention among the competitors  well  knowing  that  should his regard be converged into one point  he would  soon forfeit the pleasure he enjoyed in seeing them at variance  for  both parties would join against the common enemy  and his favourite  would be persecuted by the whole coalition  He perceived  that  among  the secret agents of scandal  none were so busy as the physicians  a  class of animals who live in this place  like so many ravens hovering  about a carcase  and even ply for employment  like scullers at  Hungerford stairs  The greatest part of them have correspondents  in London  who make it their business to inquire into the history   character  and distemper of every one that repairs to Bath  for the  benefit of the waters  and if they cannot procure interest to recommend  their medical friends to these patients before they set out  they at  least furnish them with a previous account of what they could collect   that their correspondents may use this intelligence for their own  advantage  By these means  and the assistance of flattery and assurance   they often insinuate themselves into the acquaintance of strangers  and   by consulting their dispositions  become necessary and subservient to  their prevailing passions  By their connection with apothecaries and  nurses  they are informed of all the private occurrences in each family   and therefore enabled to gratify the rancour of malice  amuse the spleen  of peevish indisposition  and entertain the eagerness of impertinent  curiosity   In the course of these occupations  which frequently affected the  reputation of our two adventurers  this whole body fell under the  displeasure of our hero  who  after divers consultations with his  friend  concerted a stratagem  which was practised upon the faculty  in this manner  Among those who frequented the pump room  was an old  officer  whose temper  naturally impatient  was  by repeated attacks  of the gout  which had almost deprived him of the use of his limbs   sublimated into a remarkable degree of virulence and perverseness  He  imputed the inveteracy of his distemper to the malpractice of a surgeon  who had administered to him  while he laboured under the consequences  of an unfortunate amour  and this supposition had inspired him with an  insurmountable antipathy to all the professors of the medical art  which  was more and more confirmed by the information of a friend at London   who had told him  that it was the common practice among the physicians  at Bath to dissuade their patients from drinking the water  that the    6 22 15  3 45 PM   cure  and in consequence their attendance  might be longer protracted   Thus prepossessed  he had come to Bath  and  conformable to a few  general instructions he had received  used the waters without any  farther direction  taking all occasions of manifesting his hatred and  contempt of the sons of Esculapius  both by speech and gesticulations   and even by pursuing a regimen quite contrary to that which he knew they  prescribed to others who seemed to be exactly in his condition  But he  did not find his account in this method  how successful soever it may  have been in other cases  His complaints  instead of vanishing  were  every day more and more enraged  and at length he was confined to his  bed  where he lay blaspheming from morn to night  and from night to  morn  though still more determined than ever to adhere to his former  maxims   In the midst of his torture
