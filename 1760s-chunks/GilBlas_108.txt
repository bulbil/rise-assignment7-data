attempts to rid her of a cough  which might have lasted a great while longer  if the remedies had not been more fatal than the disease  Far from thinking of the holy state a second time  he gave himself up entirely to the education of his only daughter Aurora  who was then entering her twenty sixth year  and might pass for an accomplished person  With beauty above the common  she had an excellent and highly cultivated understanding  Her father was a poor creature as to intellect  but he possessed the happy talent of looking well after his affairs  One fault he had  of a kind excusable in old men  he was an incessant talker  especially about war and fighting  If that string was unfortunately touched in his presence  in a moment he blew his heroic trumpet  and his hearers might think themselves lucky if they compounded for a gazette extraordinary of two sieges and three battles  As he had spent two thirds of his life in the service  his memory was an inexhaustible depot of various facts  but the patience of the listeners did not always keep pace with the perseverance of the relater  The stories  sufficiently prolix in themselves  were still further spun out by stuttering  so that the manner was still less happy than the matter  In all other respects  I never met with a nobleman of a more amiable character  his temper was even  he was neither obstinate nor capricious  the general alternative of men in the higher ranks of life  Though a good economist  he lived like a gentleman  His establishment was composed of several men servants  and three women in waiting on Aurora  I soon discovered that the steward of Don Matthias had procured me a good post  and my only anxiety was to establish myself firmly in it  I took all possible pains to feel the ground under my feet  and to study the characters of the whole household  then regulating my conduct by my discoveries  I was not long in ingratiating myself with my master and all the servants   I had been with Don Vincent above a month  when it struck me that his daughter was very particular in her notice of me above all the servants in the family  Whenever her eyes happened accidentally to meet mine  they seemed to be suffused with a certain partial complacency  which did not enter into her silent communications with the vulgar  Had it not been for my haunts among the coxcombs of the theatrical tribe and their hangers on  it would never have entered into my head that Aurora should throw away a thought on me  but my brain had been a little turned among those gentry  from whose libertine suspicions ladies of the noblest birth are not always held sacred  If  said I  those chronicles of the age are to be believed  fancy and high blood lead women of quality a dance  in which they sometimes join hands with unequal partners  how do I know but my young mistress may caper to a tune of my piping  But no  it cannot be so  neither  This is not one of your Messalinas  who  derogating from the loftiness of ancestry  unworthily let down their regards to the dust  and sully their pure honour without a blush  but rather one of those virtuously apprehensive  yet tender hearted girls  who encircle their softness within the in surmountable pale of delicacy  yet think it no tampering with chastity  to inspire and cherish a sentimental flame  interesting to the heart without being dangerous to the morals   Such were my ideas of my mistress  without knowing exactly whether they were right or wrong  And yet when we met  she was continually caught with a smile of satisfaction on her countenance  Without passing for a fop  a man might give in to such flattering appearances  and a philosophical apathy was not to be expected from me  I conceived Aurora to have been deeply smitten with my irresistible attractions  and looked on myself henceforth in the light of a favoured attendant  whose servitude was to be sweetened by the balmy infusion of love  To appear in some measure less unworthy of the blessings  which propitious fortune had kept in store for me  I began to take better care of my person than I had done heretofore  I laid out my slender stock of money in linen  pomatums  and essences  The first thing in the morning was to prank up and perfume myself  so as not to be in an undress in case of being sent for into the presence of my mistress  With these attentions to personal elegance and other dexterous strokes in the art of pleasing  I flattered myself that the moment of my bliss was not very distant   Among Aurora s women there was one who went by the name of Ortiz  This was an old dowager  who had been a fixture in Don Vincent s family for more than twenty years  She had been about his daughter from her childhood  and still held the office of duenna  but she no longer performed the invidious part of the duty  On the contrary  instead of blazoning  as formerly  Aurora s little indiscretions  her skill was now employed in throwing them into shade  One evening  Dame Ortiz  having watched her opportunity of speaking to me with  out
