so long with the merchant  that he was desired twenty times to leave the shop  and see if he could get one cheaper elsewhere  At length I made choice of a good handsome bob  for which I paid fifteen shillings  and returned to our lodging  where Strap  in a moment  rid me of that hair which had given the school master so much offence     We got up next day betimes  having been informed that Mr  Cringer gave audience by candle light to all his dependants  he himself being obliged to attend the levee of my lord Terrier  at break of day  because his lordship made one at the minister s between eight and nine aclock —When we came to Mr  Cringer s door    107 Strap  to give me an instance of his politeness  run to the knocker  which he employed so loud and so long  that he alarmed the whole street  and a window opening up two pair of stairs in the next house  a chamber pot was discharged upon him so successfully  that the poor barber was wet to the skin  while I  being luckily at some distance  escaped the unsavoury deluge —In the mean time  a footman opening the door  and seein no body in the street but us  asked with a stern countenance  if it was I who made such a damned noise  and what I wanted —I told him I had business with his master  whom I desired to see —Upon which  he clapt the door in my face  telling me  I must learn better manners before I could have access to his master  Vexed at this disappointment  I turned my resentment against Strap  whom I sharply reprimanded for his presumption  but he not in the least regarding what I said  wrung the urine out of his perriwig  and lifting up a large stone  flung it with such force against the street door of that house from whence he had been bedewed  that the lock giving way  it flew wide open  and he took to his heels  leaving me to follow him as I could —Indeed there was no time for deliberation  I therefore pursued him with all the speed I could exert  until we found ourselves  about the dawn  in a street we did not know  Here as we wandered along  gaping about  a very decent sort of a man  passing by me  stopped of a sudden  and took up something  which having examined  he turned  and presented it to me with these words     Sir  you have dropt half a crown  —  I was not a little surprized at this instance of honesty  and told him  it did not belong to me  but he   108 bid me recollect and see if all my money was safe  upon which I pulled out my purse  for I had bought one since I came to town  and reckoning my money in my hand  which was now reduced to five guineas  seven shillings and two pence  I assured him I had lost nothing —   Well then   says he  so much the better —this is Godsend—and as you two were present when I picked it up  you are entitled to equal shares with me  —  I was astonished at these words  and looked upon this person to be a prodigy of integrity  but absolutely refused any part of the sum —   Come  gentlemen   said he  you are too modest—I see you are strangers—but you shall give me leave to treat you with a whet this cold raw morning  —  I would have declined this invitation  but Strap whispered to me  that the gentleman would be affronted  and I complied —   Where shall we go   said the stranger  I am quite ignorant of this part of the town  —  I informed him that we were in the same situation  Upon which he proposed to go into the first public house we should find open  As we walked together  he began in this manner —   I find by your tongues you are come from Scotland  gentlemen —My grandmother by the father s side was of your country  which has prepossessed me so much in its favour  that I never meet a Scotchman but my heart warms —The Scots are a very brave people —There is scarce a great family in the kingdom  that cannot boast of some exploits performed by its ancestors many hundred years ago —There s your Douglasses  Gordons  Campbels  Hamiltons —We have no such ancient families here in England —Then you   109 are all very well educated —I have known a pedlar talk in Greek and Hebrew  as well as if they had been his mother tongue—And for honesty—I once had a servant  his name was Gregory Macgregor  I would have trusted him with untold gold  —  This eulogium on my native country  gained my affection so strongly  that I believe I could have gone to death to serve the author  and Strap s eyes swam in tears  At length  as we passed through a dark narrow lane  we perceived a public house  which we entered  and found a man sitting by the fire  smoaking a pipe with a pint of purl before him
