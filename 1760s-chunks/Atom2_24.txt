endeavoured to intimidate him with threats which did not even respect the Dairo  and never failed to insult him whenever he appeared in public  It had been the custom  time immemorial  for the chief magistrate of Meaco to make an entertainment for the Dairo and his empress  immediately after their nuptials  and to this banquet all the great Quos in Japan were invited  The person who filled the chair at present  was Rhum kikh  an half witted politician  self conceited  head strong  turbulent  and ambitious  a professed worshipper of Taycho  whose oratorial talents he admired  and attempted to imitate in the assemblies of the people  where he generally excited the laughter of his audience  By dint   140 of great wealth and extensive traffick he became a man of consequence among the mob  notwithstanding an illiberal turn of mind  and an ungracious address  and now he resolved to use this influence for the glory of Taycho and the disgrace of the Ximian favourite  Legion was tutored for the purpose  and moreover  well primed with a fiery caustic spirit in which Rhum kikh was a considerable dealer  The Dairo and his young empress were received by him and his council with a sullen formality in profound silence  The Cuboy was pelted as he passed along  and his litter almost overturned by the monster  which yelled  and brayed  and hooted without ceasing  until he was housed in the city hall  where he met with every sort of mortification from the entertainer as well as the spectators  At length Mr  Orator Taycho  with   141 his cousin Lob kob  appearing in a triumphal car at the city gate  the blatant beast received them with loud huzzas  unharnessed their horses  and putting itself in the traces  drew them through the streets of Meaco  which resounded with acclamation  They were received with the same exultation within the hall of entertainment  where their sovereign and his consort sat altogether unhonoured and unnoticed   A small squadron of Chinese Fune having taken possession of a defenceless fishery belonging to Japan  in the neighbourhood of Fatsisio  the emissaries of Taycho magnified this event into a terrible misfortune  arising from the maladministration of the new Cuboy  nay  they did not scruple to affirm  that he had left the fishing town defenceless on purpose that it might be taken by the enemy  This clamour    142 however  was of short duration  The Quo Phyl Kholl  who commanded a few Fune in one of the harbours of Fatsisio  no sooner received intelligence of what had happened  than he embarked what troops were at hand  and sailing directly to the place  obliged the enemy to abandon their conquest with precipitation and disgrace   In the midst of these transactions  the peace was signed  ratified  and even approved in the great national council of the Quos  as well as in the assembly of the people  The truth is  the minister of Japan has it always in his power to secure a majority in both these conventions  by means that may be easily guessed  and those were not spared on this occasion  Yak strot  in a speech  harangued the great council  who were not a little surprised to hear him speak with such propriety and   143 extent of knowledge  for he had been represented as tongue tied  and in point of elocution  little better than the palfrey he rode  He now vindicated all the steps he had taken since his accession to the helm  he demonstrated the necessity of a pacification  explained and descanted upon every article of the treaty  and finally  declared his conscience was so clear in this matter  that when he died  he should desire no other encomium to be engraved on his tomb  but that he was the author of this peace   Nevertheless  the approbation of the council was not obtained without violent debate and altercation  The different articles were censured and inveighed against by the Fatzman  the late Cuboy Fika kaka  Lob kob  Sti phi rum poo  Nin kom poo poo  and many other Quos  but  at the long run  the influence   144 of the present ministry predominated  As for Taycho  he exerted himself in a very extraordinary effort to depreciate the peace in the assembly of the people  He had for some days pretended to be dangerously ill  that he might make a merit of his patriotism by shewing a contempt for his own life  when the good of his country was at stake  In order to excite the admiration of the public  and render his appearance in the assembly the more striking  he was carried thither on a kind of handbarrow  wrapped up in flannel  with three woollen night caps on his head  efcorted by Legion  which yelled  and brayed  and whooped  and hollowed  with such vociferation  that every street of Meaco rung with hideous clamour  In this equi did Taycho enter the assembly  where  being held up by two adherents  he  after a prelude of groans to rouse the   145 attention of his audience  began to declaim against the peace as inadequate  shameful  and disadvantageous  nay  he ventured to stigmatize every separate article  though he knew it was in the power of each individual of his hearers  to confront
