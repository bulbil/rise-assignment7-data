men of war   there drawn up around one ship  in which was displayed the dread    ful signal of the execution of the commander k The sight appalled   his soul  conscience anticipating the stroke of justice  and taking   this as an omen of his own fate  He had not time to brood over   these gloomy reflections long  when an officer came on board him    â  with an order to attend the execution in his boat  along with the   other captains   which he obeyed in a state of mind scarce less   unhappy than that of the criminal  As soon as the bloody work   was done  he waited on the chief commander  where the melancholy   in every face he met was far from relieving the anxiety of his mind    He could have no pleasure in such company  When he had ans    wered a few general questions  of course  he went away to the ship   of a captain of his intimate acquaintance to learn some account   of this shocking scene  for he had not had resolution to make   an inquiry about it   nor even to attend to the conversation of   everyone around him  which would have explained the whole      After mutual congratulations on their meeting  my master signi    fied his curiosity  which his friend promised to gratify over their   bottle  as soon as they should be alone after dinner  Accordingly    when the coast was clear    You desire information in an affair      said he    that has given our corps the deepest wound we have ever   received  The circumstances are many  and mysterious   but I   will strive to give you a notion of it in as few words as possible    for it can be no pleasure to either of us to dwell upon such a subject    In the beginning of the war  soon after you went to America  the   unfortunate man who has this day fallen a sacrifice to the humour of   the times  was sent out with a fleet to counteract the schemes of   the enemy  and relieve a fortress of ours   which they were then   besieging  This was the purport of his public orders   but it will   appear to you presently  that he must have received private ones    of a very different nature  from those  who  at that time  had the   conduct of affairs  Instead of making the expedition necessary   to have carried his orders into execution with effect  he trifled away   the time here in such a shameful manner  using every frivolous excuse   he could devise to delay his departure  that the voice of the public   was raised against him   and it was found necessary to appoint   another to the command in his place  in order to silence their   clamours   but  unfortunately for him  he sailed the very day   before his appointed successor was to have set out to supersede   him  The same  iilatory conduct threw a damp upon everything   he attempted to do  He seemed resolved upon nothing   but   though he was invested with the fullest powers to act as he saw     1 Admiral Byng  executed January 27  1757  at Portsmouth  for neglect   of duty        Byng was sent in 1756 to relieve Minorca  a French attack being   anticipated  His squadron was hastily fitted out  wretchedly manned    and inferior in every way to the French  He had been ordered to   take troops on board at Gibraltar  but General Fowke was unable to   spare a man without endangering the fortress  After an indecisive   action  a council was held and the decision arrived at unanimously to   leave Minorca to its fate          364 ADVENTURES OF A GUINEA     proper himself  called councils of war to deliberate upon every   the post trifling occasion  that he might have the sanction of their   advice to excuse his neglect  and often direct disobedience of hia   orders   for you well know that a coimcil of war always speaks the   sense of the commander        One instance of his proceeding in this manner will be sufBcient   to justify this remark  He had been ordered to call at another   fortress   in his way  and take from thence a reinforcement for the   garrison of that which he was sent to relieve  On his arrival there    instead of demanding that reinforcement peremptorily  as his   â€¢orders empowered him  and making the expedition which the   urgency of the occasion required  he showed such indifference to   the enterprise by his delays  and expressed such diffidence of his   success  that the commanding officer   took the alarm   and  follow
