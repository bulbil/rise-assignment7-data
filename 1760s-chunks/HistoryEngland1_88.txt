say  that good or bad actions are their own recompence here  true is the doctrine of holy writ  The wicked have their good things in this life  the virtuous must look for them in another   Our divines have taken much pains to vindicate the character of this vicious Prince  as if his conduct and our reformation were  in fact  united  nothing can be more absurd than this  as if the most noble designs were not often brought about by the most vicious instruments  we see even the cruelty and injustice of man employed in our holy redemption   I am   c     258  LETTER XXXII   THE alterations  in the reign of Henry  were rather separations from the Pope than a reformation of religious abuses  in the reign of his successor Edward VI  his son by Jane Seymour  and heir to the crown  the errors of Rome  in reality  began to be reformed  This Prince was but nine years old when he ascended the throne of his father  and the history of his government is rather a detail of the methods pursued by his governors to reform the abuses of religion  than a series of politics or war  and their characters  rather than his  should be the object of the historian s research   The Duke of Somerset was made Protector of the minority  and thus engrossed the whole administration  the rest of the council  which were joined with him  either sided with his views  or ineffectually opposed them  To strengthen his power  he marched against the Scots who had invaded England  their constant practice whenever they saw the country employed in faction and dispute  a slight victory  gained by him upon this occasion  acquired him popularity and power  I have more than once remarked  that  to gain the hearts of the English  it was requisite to be a conqueror  But to this character Somerset added virtues of a much more amiable kind  he was humble  civil  affable  courteous to the meanest suitor  and all the actions of his life were directed by motives of religion and honour  he  at the same time  had learned to look with contempt and detestation on the errors and corruptions of the church of Rome  and was consequently the warm friend of Archbishop Cranmer  who now undertook to make   259 a real reformation  which Henry VIII  only pretended to do   You have seen  in Henry s reign  that the only alterations he made in religion  were such as either favoured his passions or increased his power  Thus all his subjects were under a peculiar restraint  which  upon his death  was no longer continued  each took the liberty of speaking his thoughts upon religion  though the laws of the last reign were still in force  In this division of opinions  as it may easily be supposed  the Reformers prevailed  for they had the Protector of their party  to that and  therefore  they procured a general visitation of churches  and reformed numberless abuses that were almost held sacred by prescription  It was left to people s choice to go to confession  which had been hitherto deemed an indispensable duty  or to neglect that practice  It was ordered  that all images should be taken out of churches  priests were allowed to marry  the old mass was abolished  and a new liturgy drawn up  which retrenched several abuses in the service of the church  and which is the same with that now used  bating a few alterations   These reformations were evidently calculated for the benefit of the subject  but still the Popish clergy  who either were expelled their monasteries or had refused to conform  stirred up the people to rise in rebellion against them  we may judge  from the number of places in which insurrections were made  that those reformations were by no means received with universal satisfaction  There were  at once  insurrections in Wiltshire  Sussex  Hampshire  Kent  Gloucestershire  Suffolk  Warwickshire  Essex  Hertfordshire  Leicestershire  Rutlandshire  and Worcestershire  and the flames of war were rekindling through the   260 whole kingdom  The Protector  who both by principle and interest was a friend of the populace  did every thing to redress their grievances  and by that means stopped their fury for a while  In fact  they had several complaints that were founded in justice  the nobility had become possessors of the forfeited lands which belonged to the clergy  and  instead of leaving them to be cultivated by the poor  as formerly  inclosed them for the purposes of pleasure or magnificence  This necessarily drove numbers  besides the ejected friars  to the utmost streights  but  to add to their misfortunes  an act was passed against them  the most severe that had hitherto been known in England  it was enacted  that  if any person should loiter  without offering himself to work  for three days together  he should be adjudged a slave for two years to the first informer  and should be marked on the breast with the letter V  or vagabond  imprinted with an hot iron  It is not to be wondered at  therefore  that there should be a general insurrection of the people  when suffering
