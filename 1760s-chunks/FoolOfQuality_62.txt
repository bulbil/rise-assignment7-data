 The throng gave way to his ap    proach  He was mounted on a steed of foam  In an instant         THE FOOL OF QVALITY  83     he was off his horse  on the scaffold  and held Pythias straitly   embraced      You are safe  he cried you are safe  my friend  my beloved     The gods be praised  you are safe   I now have nothing but death   to suffer   and I am delivered from the anguish of those reproaches   which I gave myself  for having endangered a life so much dearer   than my own      Pale  cold  and half  speechless in the arms of his Damon  Pythias   replied in broken accents Fatal haste   cruel impatience   what   envious powers have wrought impossibilities in your favour  But   I will not be wholly disappointed  since I cannot die to save  I   will not survive you      Dionysius heard  beheld  and considered all with astonishment    His heart was touched   his eyes were opened   and he could no   longer refuse his assent to truths so incontestably approved by   their facts      He descended from his throne  He ascended the scaffold  Live    live  ye incomparable pair   he exclaimed  Ye have borne un    questionable testimony to the existence of virtue   and that virtue   equally evinces the certainty of the existence of a God to reward   it  Live happy  live renowned   andi O form me by your precepts    as you have invited me by your example  to be worthy of the   participation of so sacred a friendship      You bring your arguments quite home  Mr  Meekly  said the   earl   the understanding cannot reject what the heart so sensibly   feels  My soul deeply acknowledges the existence of virtue  with   its essential and inherent difference from vice   and this difference    I acknowledge  must as necessarily be founded in the difference   of the principles from whence they proceed   but what those prin    ciples are I know not   and I am equally a stranger to what you   intend by a man s getting out of himself in order to happiness    What am I to understand by the term SELF  Mr  Meekly       Every particle of matter  my lord  has a SELF  or distinct identity    inasmuch as it cannot be any other particle of matter  Now  while   it continues in this state of SELFISHNESS  or absolute distinction    it is utterly useless and insignificant  and is to the universe as   though it were not  It has  however  a principle of attraction    analogous or answerable to desire in the mind   whereby it en    deavours to derive to itself the powers and advantages of all other   portions of matter  But when the divine intelligence hath har    monized certain qualities of such distinct particles into certain   animal or vegetable systems  this principle of attraction in each   is overcome  for each becomes attracted and drawn as it were from   SELF   each yields up its powers to the benefit of the whole   and   then  and then only  becomes capable and productive of shape    colouring  beauty  flowers  fragrance  and fruits      Be pleased now to observe  my lord  that this operation in matter   is no other than a manifestation of the like process in mind   ana   that no soul was ever capable of any degree of virtue or happiness    save so far as it is drawn away in its affections from self   save so   far as it is engaged in wishing  contriving  endeavouring  promoting    and rejoicing in the welfare and happiness of others      D         34 THE FOOL OF QUALITY      It is  therefore  that the kingdom of heaven is most aptly  and   most beautifully  compared to a tree bearing fruit and diffusing   odours  whose root is the principle of infinite benevolence  and   whose branches are the blessed members  receiving consummate   beatitude from the act of communication      I think  indeed  said the earl  that I can form some sort of a   notion of such a society in heaven  But it would pose you  Mr    Meekly  to exemplify your position from any body of men that ever   were upon earth      Pray  pardon me  my lord   the states of Sparta and Eome de    rived their lustre and power  their whole pre eminence and praise    from this principle
