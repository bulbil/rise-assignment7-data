the happiness of calling you mine  at the expence of my mother s life  or even of her quiet       I must now submit to see my Emily in an humbler situation  to see her want those pleasures  those advantages  those honors  which fortune gives  and which she has so nobly sacrificed to true delicacy of mind  and  if I do not flatter myself  to her generous and disinterested affection for me       Be assured  my dearest angel  the inconveniencies attendant on a narrow fortune  the only one I have to offer  shall be softened by all which the most lively esteem  the most perfect friendship  the tenderest love  can inspire  by that attention  that unwearied solicitude to please  of which the heart alone knows the value        Fortune has no power over minds like ours  we possess a treasure to which all she has to give is nothing  the dear exquisite delight of loving  and of being beloved       Awake to all the finer feelings of tender esteem and elegant desire  we have every real good in each other       I shall hurry down  the moment I have settled my affairs here  and hope soon to have the transport of presenting the most charming of friends  of mistresses  allow me to add  of wives  to a mother whom I love and revere beyond words  and to whom she will soon be dearer than myself       My going to England will detain me at Montreal a few days longer than I intended  a delay I can very ill support       Adieu  my Emily  no language can express my tenderness or my impatience   Your faithful  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CXLIX   149   To JOHN TEMPLE  Esq  Pall Mall   Montreal  May 28   I CANNOT enough  my dear Temple  thank you for your last  though it destroys my air built scheme of happiness       Could I have supposed my mother would thus severely have felt my absence  I had never left England  to make her easier  was my only motive for that step       I with pleasure sacrifice my design of settling here to her peace of mind  no consideration  however  shall ever make me give up that of marrying the best and most charming of women       I could have wished to have had a fortune worthy of her  this was my wish  not that of my Emily  she will with equal pleasure share with me poverty or riches  I hope her consent to marry me before I leave Canada  I know the advantages of affluence  my dear Temple  and am too reasonable to despise them  I would only avoid rating them above their worth       Riches undoubtedly purchase a variety of pleasures which are not otherwise to be obtained  they give power  they give honors  they give consequence  but if  to enjoy these subordinate goods  we must give up those which are more essential  more real  more suited to our natures  I can never hesitate one moment to determine between them       I know nothing fortune has to bestow  which can equal the transport of being dear to the most amiable  most lovely of womankind       The stream of life  my dear Temple  stagnates without the gentle gale of love  till I knew my Emily  till the dear moment which assured me of her tenderness  I could scarce be said to live       Adieu  Your affectionate  ED  RIVERS     LETTER CL   150   To Mrs  TEMPLE  Pall Mall   Silleri  June 1   I CAN write  I can talk  of nothing but Emily  I never knew how much I loved her till she was gone  I run eagerly to every place where we have been together  every spot reminds me of her  I remember a thousand conversations  endeared by confidence and affection  a tender tear starts in spite of me  our walks  our airings  our pleasing little parties  all rush at once on my memory  I see the same lovely scenes around me  but they have lost half their power of pleasing       I visit every grove  every thicket  that she loved  I have a redoubled fondness for every object in which she took pleasure       Fitzgerald indulges me in this enthusiasm of friendship  he leads me to every place which can recall my Emily s idea  he speaks of her with a warmth which shews the sensibility and goodness of his own heart  he endeavors to soothe me by the most endearing attention       What infinite pleasure  my dear Lucy  there is in being truly beloved  Fond as I have ever been of general admiration  that of all mankind is nothing to the least mark of Fitzgerald s tenderness       Adieu  it will be some days before I can send this letter   June 4       The governor gives a ball in honor of the day  I am dressing to go  but without my sweet companion  every hour I feel more sensibly her absence   5th       We had last night
