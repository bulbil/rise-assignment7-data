 Detestable fiend  said he  whence this presumption  where are my slaves  Where is Hasem  and the women of my seraglio  The traitoresses  they shall pay dearly for thus abusing my indulgence     Page  104  The old women at this all fell upon their faces to the ground  but the first who had advanced addressing herself to speak  Avaunt  cried ← Nourjahad →   begone wretches  and rid my sight of such hideous aspects     Alas  my lord  replied the old woman  have you intirely forgot me  has time left no traces to remind you of your once beloved Cadiga  Cadiga  thou Cadiga  do not provoke me  said Nourjahad  or by Allah I ll spurn thee with my foot     The old women now all set up a lamentable cry  Miserable wretches that  Page  105  we are  said they  beating their withered breasts  it had been happy for us if we had all died in our youth  rather than have thus out lived our lord s affections     Evil betide ye  said ← Nourjahad →   who in the name of deformity are ye all  Hereupon the beldames cried out with one voice  Your mistresses  the once admired and loved partners of your bed  but the relentless hand of time has made such cruel ravage on our charms  that we do not wonder thou shouldst find it impossible to recollect us     ← Nourjahad → now began to suspect that he had been over powered by a second  Page  106  trance  Why  how long  in the devil s name  have I then flept  said he     Forty years and eleven moons  answered the lady who called herself Cadiga  Thou liest  I am sure  said Nourjahad  for it appears to me but as yesterday since I ordered thee  if thou really art Cadiga  to awake me at a certain hour  that I might enjoy the glorious entertainment prepared for me in the gardens of the Houriis     I do remember it  said Cadiga  and we your faithful slaves were to personate those beautiful virgins  Alas  alas  we are not now fit to represent those daughters  Page  107  of paradise  Thou art fitter  said ← Nourjahad →   to represent the furies  I tell thee again  it cannot be many hours since I first fell into a slumber     It may well seem so  answered Cadiga  buried as your senses have been in forgetfulness  and every faculty consigned to oblivion  that the interval of time so past must be quite annihilated  yet it is most certain that you have slept as long as I tell you     ← Nourjahad → upon this examined the faces of the old women one after the other  but finding them so totally different from what they once were  he swore that he did not believe a word they said   Page  108  Thou Cadiga  said he  the black browed Cadiga  whose enchanting smiles beguiled all hearts  thou art wonderously like her I confess     Yet that I am that identical fair one  answered she  I shall be able to convince you  from a remarkable signature which I bear on my bosom  and which still remains  though the rest of my person is so entirely changed     Saying this  she uncovered her breast  on which the figure of a rose bud was delineated by the hand of nature  Nourjahad well remembered the mark  he had once thought it a beauty  and made it the subject of an amorous sonnet   Page  109  when the bosom of the fair Cadiga was as white and as smooth as alabaster     Convinced by this proof  that these women were really what they pretended to be  ← Nourjahad → could not conceal his vexation  By the Temple of Mecca  said he  this genius of mine is no better than he should be  and I begin to suspect he is little less than an evil spirit  or he could not thus take delight in persecuting me for nothing     Ah  my lord  said Cadiga  I am not ignorant of the strange fate by which your life is governed  Hasem  your faithful Hasem  communicated the secret to me with his dying breath  Is Hasem  Page  110  dead  cried ← Nourjahad →   He is  my lord  answered Cadiga  and so is the worthy Zamgrad  What is become of my son  said ← Nourjahad →   I hope he has not shared the same fate  It were better that he had  replied Cadiga  for it is now some five and twenty years since he ran away from the governor in whose hands the wise Hasem had placed him for his education  and having in vain endeavoured to prevail on that honest man to bury you  that giving out you were deceased  he might take possession of all your wealth  finding he could not succeed in his unnatural design  he took an opportunity of breaking open your cabinet  and securing all the treasure he could find  stole
