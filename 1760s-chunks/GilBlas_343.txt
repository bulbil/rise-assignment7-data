 He no longer opposed my earnest desire of leaving Madrid  and I determined to take my measures accordingly on the very next day       CH  III     The project of retirement is prevented  and Joseph Navarro brought upon the stage again  by an act of signal service   ON my way home to my lodgings I met Joseph Navarro  whom the render will recollect as on the establishment of Don Balthasar de Zuniga  and one of my old friends  I made my bow first at a distance  then went up to him  and asked whether he knew me again  and if he would still be so good as to speak to a wretch who had repaid his friendship with ingratitude  You acknowledge then  said he  that you have not behaved very handsomely by me  Yes  answered I  and you are fully justified in laying on your reproaches thick and threefold  I deserve them all  unless indeed my guilt may be thought to have been atoned by the remorse of conscience attendant on it  Since you have repented of your misconduct  replied Navarro  embracing me  I ought no longer to hold it its remembrance  For my part  I knew not how to hug Joseph close enough in my arms  and we both of us resumed our original kind feelings towards one another   He had heard of my imprisonment and the derangement of my affairs  but of what followed he was totally ignorant I informed him of it  relating word for word my conversation with the king  without suppressing the minister s late ungracious reception of me  any more than my present purpose of retiring into my favourite obscurity  Beware of removing from the scene of action  said he  since the sovereign has shown a disposition to befriend you  there are always uses to be made of such a circumstance  Between ourselves  the Count of Olivarez has something rather unaccountable in his character  he is a very good sort of nobleman  but rather whimsical withal  sometimes  as on the present occasion  he acts in a most offensive manner  and none but himself can furnish a clue to disentangle the intricate thread of his motives and their results  But however this may be  or whatever reasons might have swayed him to give you so scurvy a reception  keep your footing here  and do not budge  he will not be able to hinder you from thriving under the royal shelter and protection  take my word for that  I will just give a hint upon the subject this evening to Signor Don Balthasar de Zuniga  my master  he is uncle to the Count of Olivarez  and shares with him in the toils and cares of office  Navarro having given me this assurance  inquired where I lived  and then we parted   It was not long before we met again  for he came to call on me the very next day  Signor de Santillane  said he  you are not without a protector  my master will lend you his powerful support  on the strength of the good character which I have given your lordship  he has promised to speak to his nephew  the Count of Olivarez  in your behalf  and I doubt not but he will effectually prepossess him in your favour  My friend Navarro not meaning to serve me by halves  introduced me two days afterwards to Don Balthasar  who said with a gracious air  Signor de Santillane  your friend Joseph has pronounced your panegyric in terms which have won me over completely to your interest  I made a low obeisance to Signor de Zuniga  and answered  that to the latest period of my life I should entertain the most lively sense of my obligation to Navarro  for having secured to me the protection of a minister  who was considered  and that for the best reasons possible  as the presiding genius  the greater luminary  or  as it were  the eye and mind of the ministerial council  Don Balthasar  at this unexpected stroke of flattery  clapped me on the shoulder with an approving chuckle  and returned my compliment by a more significant intimation  You may call on the Count of Olivarez again to morrow  and then you will have more reason to be pleased with him   For the third time  therefore  did I make my appearance before the prime minister  who  picking me out from among the mob of suitors  cast upon me a look conveying with it a simper of welcome  from which I ventured to draw a good omen  This is all as it should be  said I to myself  the uncle has brought the nephew to his proper bearings  I no longer anticipated any other than a favourable reception  and my confidence was fully justified  The count  after having given audience to the promiscuous crowd  took me with him into his closet  and said with a familiar address  My friend Santillane  you must excuse the little disquietude I have occasioned you merely for my own amusement  it was done in sport  though it was death to you  for the sole purpose of practising on your discretion  and observing to what measures your disgust and disappointment would incite you  Doubtless you must have concluded that your services were displeasing to me
