historians  Herodotus is fabulous even to a proverb  Thucydides is perplexed  obscure  and unimportant  Polybius is dry and inelegant  Livy superficial  and Tacitus a coxcomb  Guicciardini wants interest  Davila  digestion  and Sarpi  truth  In the whole catalogue of French historians  there is not one of tolerable authenticity  In the year of the period Foggien one hundred and fifty four  the tranquility of Japan was interrupted by the incroachments of the Chinese adventurers  who made descents upon certain islands belonging to the Japonese a great way to the southward of Xicoco  They even settled colonies  and built forts on some of them  while the two empires were at peace with each other  When the Japonese governors expostulated with the Chinese officers on this intrusion     73 they were treated with ridicule and contempt  then they had recourse to force of arms  and some skirmishes were fought with various success  When the tidings of these hostilities arrived at Meaco  the whole council of Twenty Eight was overwhelmed with fear and confusion  The Dairo kicked them all round  not from passion  but by way of giving an animating fillip to their deliberative faculties  The disputes had happened in the island of Fatsissio  but there were only three members of the council who knew that Fatsissio was an island  although the commerce there carried on was of the utmost importance to the empire of Japan  They were as much in the dark with respect to its situation  Fika kaka  on the supposition that it adjoined to the coast of Corea  expressed his apprehension that the Chinese would invade it with a numerous army  and was so transported    74 when Foksi roku assured him it was an island at a vast distance from any continent  that he kissed him five times in the face of the whole council  and his royal master  Got hama baba  swore he should be indulged with a double portion of kicking at his next private audience  The same counsellor proposed  that as the Fune or navy of Japan was much more numerous than the fleet of China  they should immediately avail themselves of this advantage  Quamba cun dono the Fatzman was of opinion that war should be immediately declared  and an army transported to the continent  Stiphi rum poo thought it would be more expedient to sweep the seas of the Chinese trading vessels  without giving them any previous intimation  and to this opinion admiral Nin kom poo po subscribed  not only out of deference to the superior understanding of his sage ally  who undertook    75 to prove it was not contrary to the law of nature and nations  to plunder the subjects of foreign powers  who trade on the faith of treaties  but also from his own inclination  which was much addicted to pillage without bloodshed  To him  therefore  the task was left of scouring the seas  and intercepting the succours which  they had received intelligence  were ready to sail from one of the ports of China to the island of Fatsissio  In the mean time  junks were provided for transporting thither a body of Japonese troops  under the command of one Koan  an obscure officer without conduct or experience  whom the Fatzman selected for this service  not that he supposed him possessed of superior merit  but because no leader of distinction cared to engage in such a disagreeable expedition   Nin kom poo po acted according to the justest ideas which had been    76 formed of his understanding  He let loose his cruisers among the merchant ships of China  and the harbours of Japan were quickly filled with prizes and prisoners  The Chinese exclaimed against these proceedings as the most perfidious acts of piracy  and all the other powers of Asia beheld them with astonishment  But the consummate wisdom of the sea Sey seo gun appeared most conspicuous in another stroke of generalship  which he now struck  Instead of blocking up in the Chinese harbour the succours destined to reinforce the enemy in Fatsissio  until they should be driven from their incroachments on that island  he very wisely sent a strong squadron of Fune to cruise in the open sea  midway between China and Fatsissio  in the most tempestuous season of the year  when the fogs are so thick and so constant in that latitude  as to rival the darkness of a winter    77 night  and supported the feasibility of this scheme in council  by observing  that the enemy would be thus decoyed from their harbour  and undoubtedly intercepted in their passage by the Japonese squadron  This plan was applauded as one of the most ingenious stratagems that ever was devised  and Fika kaka insisted upon kissing his posteriors  as the most honourable mark of his approbation   Philosophers have observed  that the motives of actions are not to be estimated by events  Fortune did not altogether fulfil the expectations of the council  General Koan suffered himself and his army to be decoyed into the middle of a wood  where they stood like sheep in the shambles  to be slaughtered by an unseen enemy  The Chinese succours perceiving their harbour open  set sail for Fatsissio  which they reached in safety  by changing their    78 course about one degree from the common route  while the Japonese Fune continued cruising among the fogs  until the ships were shattered
