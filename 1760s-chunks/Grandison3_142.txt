is there in her Love   Sir Charles  in Lord L  s Study  said to me  that his compassion was engaged  but his honour was free  And so it seems to be  But a generosity in return for her generosity  must bind such a mind as his   LETTER XXXI  Miss BYRON  To Miss SELBY    IN the doctor s next Letter  inclosed  you will find mention made of Sir Charles s Literary Journal  I fancy  my dear  it must be a charming thing  I wish we could have before us every line he wrote while he was in Italy  Once the presumptuous Harriet had hopes  that she might have been intitled—But no more of these hopes—It can t be helped  Lucy   Dr  Bartlett s twelfth Letter   MR  Grandison proceeds thus   The next morning I employed myself in visiting and taking leave of several worthy members of the University  with whom I had passed many very agreeable and improving hours  during my residence in this noble city  In my Literary Journal you have an account of those worthy persons  and of some of our conversations  I paid my duty to the Cardinal Legate  and the Gonfaloniere  and to three of his counsellors  by whom  you know  I had been likewise greatly honoured  My mind was not free enough to enjoy their conversation  Such a weight upon my heart  how could it  But the debt of gratitude and civility was not to be left unpaid     355 On my return to my lodgings  which was not till the evening  I found  the General had been there to enquire after me   I sent one of my servants to the palace of Porretta  with my compliments to the General  to the Bishop  and Jeronymo  and with particular enquiries after the health of the Ladies  and the Marquis  but had only a general answer  That they were much as I left them   The two young Lords  Sebastiano and Juliano  made me a visit of ceremony  They talked of visiting England in a year or two  I assured them of my best services  and urged them to go thither  I asked them after the healths of the Marquis  the Marchioness  and their beloved cousin Clementina  Signor Sebastiano shook his head  Very  very indifferent  were his words  We parted with great civilities   I will now turn my thoughts to Florence  and to the affairs there that have lain upon me  from the death of my good friend Mr  Jervois  and from my wardship  I told you in their course  the steps I took in those affairs  and how happy I had been in some parts of management  There I hope soon to see you  my dear Dr  Bartlett  from the Levant  to whose care I can so safely consign my precious trust  while I go to Paris  and attend the wished for call of my father to my native country  from which I have been for so many years an exile   There also I hope to have some opportunities of conversing with my good Mrs  Beaumont  resolving to make another effort to get so valuable a person to restore herself to her beloved England   Thus  my dear Dr  Bartlett  do I endeavour to console myself  in order to lighten that load of grief which I labour under on the distresses of the dear Clementina  If I can leave her happy  I shall be sooner so  than I could have been in the same circumstances  had I  from the first of my acquaintance with   356 the family  to the breach of all the laws of hospitality  indulged a passion for her   Yet is the unhappy Olivia a damp upon my endeavours after consolation  When she made her unseasonable visit to me at Bologna  she refused to return to Florence without me  till I assured her  that as my affairs would soon call me thither  I would visit her at her own palace  as often as those affairs would permit  Her pretence for coming to Bologna was  to induce me to place Emily with her  till I had settled every thing for my carrying the child to England  she had wrought so with Emily  as to induce her to be an earnest petitioner to me  to permit her to live with Lady Olivia  whose equis  and the glare in which she lives  had dazled the eyes of the young Lady   I was impatient to hear again from Jeronymo  and just as I was setting out for Florence  in despair of that savour  it being the second day after my farewel visit  I had the following Letter from him   I Have not been well  my dear Grandison  I am afraid the wound in my shoulder must be laid open again  God give me patience  But my life is a burden to me   We are driving here at a strange rate  They promised to keep measures with the dear creature  but she has heard that you are leaving Bologna  and raves to see you   Poor soul  She endeavoured to prevail upon her father  mother  aunt  to permit her to see you
