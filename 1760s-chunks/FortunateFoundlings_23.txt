 but none   was of greater service than the recommendation he had to colonel   Brindfield  who being in great favour with the duke of Marlborough  was   highly respected by the whole army  This gentleman made him dine   frequently with him  and testified the regard he had for Dorilaus  by   doing all the good offices he could to a youth whom he perceived by his   letter he had a great concern for  He not only introduced him to the   acquaintance of many officers of condition  but took an opportunity of   presenting him to the duke himself  giving at the same time his grace an   account that he was a gentleman whose inclinations to arms  and the   honour of serving under his grace  had made him renounce all other   advantages for the hope of doing something worthy of his favour  The   duke looked all the time he was speaking very attentively on the young   Horatio  and finding something in his air that corroborated the   colonel s description  was pleased to say  that he was charm d with his   early thirst after same  and then turning toward him  you will soon    pursued he  have an opportunity of seeing how the face of war looks    near at hand   I can tell you  that you must not always expect smiles    No  my lord  replied he  without being at all daunted at the presence of   so great a man  but where we love all countenances are agreeable       He arrived indeed opportunely to be a witness of the dangers of that   glorious campaign which brought such shame to the French  such honour to   the English  and such real advantages to the empire  Prince Eugene of   Savoy  and prince Lewis of Baden were come to the duke s quarters  which   were then at Mondesheim  to consult on proper operations  the result   was  that the duke and prince Lewis should join armies  and command each   day alternately  and that prince Eugene should head a separate army and   repair towards Philipsburg  to defend the passage of the Rhine  the   lines of Stolhoffen  and the country of Wirtenberg       The two armies joined at Westerstretton  thence proceeded by easy   marches towards Donawert  between which and Scellenberg the enemy was   encamped  Fatigued as they were  the duke made them pass over a little   river and endeavour to force the intrenchments  which enterprize   succeeded  notwithstanding all the disadvantages the confederate armies   were in  and the others were obliged to retire with great precipitation    many of whom were drowned in endeavouring to pass the Danube       In this action was our young soldier unlisted  and had the glory to be   signalized by two remarkable accidents  one was  that pressing among the   foremost in this hazardous attempt  he had his hat taken off by a cannon   ball  and the other was  that seeing a standard about to be taken by the   enemy  the person who carried it happening to be kill d  he ran among   those who were carrying it away  and being seconded by some others    retrieved that badge of English honour  and as this was done in sight of   the duke  he rode up to him directly and presented it to him  Take it   for your pains  cried he  you have ventured hard  and well deserve the   prize  There was no time for thanks  the duke  who was almost every   where at once  was immediately gone where he found his presence   necessary  and Horatio returned to take the place of the dead cornet    doubly animated by the encouragement he had received       This victory opening a way into the elector of Bavaria s dominions  that   poor country was terribly ravaged  no less than 300 towns  villages and   castles being utterly consumed by a detachment of horse and dragoons the   duke sent for that purpose  Some old officers told Horatio that now   would be the time to make his fortune if he went with these squadrons    there being many rich things which would fall to the share of the   plunderers  to which he answered  that he came to fight for the honour   of his country  and not to rob for its disgrace  This they laughed at    and endeavoured to make him sensible  that the taking away an enemy s   treasure was to take away their strength  but all they could say was   ineffectual  he was not to be perswaded out of what he thought reason   and justice  and this conversation being afterward repeated to the duke    he smil d and said  he was yet too young to know the value of money       After this  prince Lewis of Baden dividing from the duke  in order to
