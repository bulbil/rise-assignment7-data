would take care he did not catch cold  as he had been ill  And I had the   pride to hear his new coachman say  to one of his fellow servants  They   are a charming pair  I am sure   tis pity they should be parted   O   my dear father and mother  I fear your girl will grow as proud as any   thing  And  especially  you will think I have reason to guard against   it  when you read the kind particulars I am going to relate       He ordered dinner to be ready by two  and Abraham  who succeeds John    went behind the coach  He bid Robin drive gently  and told me  he wanted   to talk to me about his sister Davers  and other matters  Indeed  at   first setting out he kissed me a little too often  that he did  and I   was afraid of Robin s looking back  through the fore glass  and people   seeing us  as they passed  but he was exceedingly kind to me  in his   words  as well  At last  he said       You have  I doubt not  read  over and over  my sister s saucy letter    and find  as I told you  that you are no more obliged to her than I   am  You see she intimates  that some people had been with her  and who   should they be  but the officious Mrs  Jervis  and Mr  Longman  and   Jonathan  and so that has made me take the measures I did in dismissing   them my service   I see  said he  you are going to speak on their   behalfs  but your time is not come to do that  if ever I shall permit   it       My sister  says he  I have been beforehand with  for I have renounced   her  I am sure I have been a kind brother to her  and gave her to the   value of 3000L  more than her share came to by my father s will  when I   entered upon my estate  And the woman  surely  was beside herself with   passion and insolence  when she wrote me such a letter  for well she   knew I would not bear it  But you must know  Pamela  that she is much   incensed  that I will give no ear to a proposal of hers  of a   daughter of my Lord       who  said he  neither in person  or mind  or   acquirements  even with all her opportunities  is to be named in a day   with my Pamela  But yet you see the plea  my girl  which I made to you   before  of the pride of condition  and the world s censure  which  I   own  sticks a little too close with me still  for a woman shines not   forth to the public as man  and the world sees not your excellencies   and perfections  If it did  I should entirely stand acquitted by the   severest censures  But it will be taken in the lump  that here is   Mr  B      with such and such an estate  has married his mother s   waiting maid  not considering there is not a lady in the kingdom that   can out do her  or better support the condition to which she will be   raised  if I should marry her  And  said he  putting his arm round me    and again kissing me  I pity my dear girl too  for her part in this   censure  for  here will she have to combat the pride and slights of the   neighbouring gentry all around us  Sister Davers  you see  will never   be reconciled to you  The other ladies will not visit you  and you   will  with a merit superior to them all  be treated as if unworthy their   notice  Should I now marry my Pamela  how will my girl relish all this    Won t these be cutting things to my fair one  For  as to me  I shall   have nothing to do  but  with a good estate in possession  to brazen out   the matter of my former pleasantry on this subject  with my companions   of the chase  the green  and the assemblee  stand their rude jests for   once or twice  and my fortune will create me always respect enough  I   warrant you  But  I say  what will my poor girl do  as to her part  with   her own sex  For some company you must keep  My station will not admit   it to be with my servants  and the ladies will fly your acquaintance    and still  though my wife
