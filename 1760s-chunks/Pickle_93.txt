declined communicating with the stranger until his  character should be further explained  upon which his inviter  after  some conversation with the charlatan  assured him that he would himself  undertake for the innocence of his art  and then he was prevailed upon  to favour them with his company   In the course of the conversation  Peregrine learned that the Welshman  was a surgeon of Canterbury  who had been called in to a consultation at  Dover  and  understanding that his name was Morgan  took the liberty  of asking if he was not the person so respectfully mentioned in the   Adventures of Roderick Random   Mr  Morgan assumed a look of gravity  and importance at this interrogation  and  screwing up his mouth     6 22 15  3 45 PM   answered   Mr  Rantum  my good sir  I believe  upon my conscience and  salfation  is my very goot frient and well wisher  and he and I have  been companions and messmates and fellow sufferers  look you  but  nevertheless  for all that  peradventure he hath not pehaved with so  much complaisance and affability and respect as I might have expected  from him  pecause he hath revealed and tivulged and buplished our  private affairs  without my knowledge and privity and consent  but as  Got is my Safiour  I think he had no evil intention in his pelly  and  though there be certain persons  look you  who  as I am told  take  upon them to laugh at his descriptions of my person  deportment  and  conversation  I do affirm and maintain  and insist with my heart  and  my plood  and my soul  that those persons are no petter than ignorant  asses  and that they know not how to discern and distinguish and define  true ridicule  or  as Aristotle calls it  the to Geloion  no more  look  you  than a herd of mountain goats  for I will make pold to observe  and  I hope this goot company will be of the same opinion  that there is  nothing said of me in that performance which is unworthy of a Christian  and a shentleman    Our young gentleman and his friends acquiesced in the justness of his  observation  Peregrine particularly assured him that  from reading  the book  he had conceived the utmost regard and veneration for his  character  and that he thought himself extremely fortunate in having  this opportunity of enjoying his conversation  Morgan  not a little  proud of such advances from a person of Peregrine s appearance  returned  the compliment with a profusion of civility  and  in the warmth of  acknowledgment  expressed a desire of seeing him and his company at his  house in Canterbury   I will not pretend  or presume  kind sir   said  he   to entertain you according to your merits and deserts  but you  shall be as welcome to my poor cottage  and my wife and family  as the  prince of Wales himself  and it shall go hard if  one way or other  I  do not find ways and means of making you confess that there is some goot  fellowship in an ancient Priton  for though I am no petter than a simple  apothecary  I have as goot plood circulating in my veins as any he in  the county  and I can describe and delineate and demonstrate my pedigree  to the satisfaction of the  ole  orld  and  moreofer  by Got s goot  providence and assistance  I can afford to treat my friend with joint of  good mutton and a pottle of excellent wine  and no tradesman can peard  me with a bill    He was congratulated on his happy situation  and assured that our youth  would visit him on his return from France  provided he should take  Canterbury in his route  As Peregrine manifested an inclination of  being acquainted with the state of his affairs  he very complaisantly  satisfied his curiosity by giving him to know that his spouse had left  off breeding  after having blessed him with two boys and a girl   who were still alive and well  that he lived in good esteem with  his neighbors  and by his practice  which was considerably extended  immediately after the publication of Roderick Random  had saved some  thousand pounds  He had begun to think of retiring among his own  relations in Glamorganshire  though his wife had made objection to this  proposal  and opposed the execution of it with such obstinacy  that  he had been at infinite pains in asserting his own prerogative by  convincing her  both from reason and example  that he was king  and  priest in his own family  and that she owed the most implicit submission  to his will  He likewise informed the company that he had lately seen  his friend Roderick  who had come from London on purpose to visit him     6 22 15  3 45 PM   after having gained his lawsuit with Mr  Topeball  who was obliged to  pay Narcissa s fortune  that Mr  Random
