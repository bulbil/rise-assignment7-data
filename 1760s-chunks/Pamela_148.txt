began to unpin my handkerchief   consider  Pray sir    do   And pray  said he  do you consider  For I will see these papers    But may be  said he  they are tied about your knees  with your garters    and stooped  Was ever any thing so vile and so wicked   I fell on my   knees  and said  What can I do  What can I do  If you ll let me go up   I ll fetch them to you  Will you  said he  on your honour  let me see   them uncurtailed  and not offer to make them away  no not a single   paper   I will  sir   On your honour  Yes  sir  And so he let me go up   stairs  crying sadly for vexation to be so used  Sure nobody was ever so   served as I am       I went to my closet  and there I sat me down  and could not bear the   thoughts of giving up my papers  Besides  I must all undress me  in a   manner  to untack them  So I writ thus           SIR        To expostulate with such an arbitrary gentleman  I know will signify   nothing  and most hardly do you use the power you so wickedly have got   over me  I have heart enough  sir  to do a deed that would make you   regret using me thus  and I can hardly bear it  and what I am further   to undergo  But a superior consideration withholds me  thank God  it   does   I will  however  keep my word  if you insist upon it when   you have read this  but  sir  let me beg of you to give me time till   to morrow morning  that I may just run them over  and see what I put   into your hands against me  and I will then give my papers to you    without the least alteration  or adding or diminishing  But I should   beg still to be excused  if you please  But if not  spare them to me but   till to morrow morning  and this  so hardly am I used  shall be thought   a favour  which I shall be very thankful for        I guessed it would not be long before I heard from him and he   accordingly sent up Mrs  Jewkes for what I had promised  So I gave   her this note to carry to him  And he sent word  that I must keep my   promise  and he would give me till morning  but that I must bring them   to him  without his asking again       So I took off my under coat  and with great trouble of mind  unsewed   them from it  And there is a vast quantity of it  I will just slightly   touch upon the subjects  because I may not  perhaps  get them again for   you to see       They begin with an account of  my attempting to get away out of the   window first  and then throwing my petticoat and handkerchief into the   pond  How sadly I was disappointed  the lock of the back door being   changed  How  in trying to climb over the door  I tumbled down  and was   piteously bruised  the bricks giving way  and tumbling upon me  How    finding I could not get off  and dreading the hard usage I should   receive  I was so wicked as to think of throwing myself into the water    My sad reflections upon this matter  How Mrs  Jewkes used me upon this   occasion  when she found me  How my master had like to have been drowned   in hunting  and my concern for his danger  notwithstanding his usage   of me  Mrs  Jewkes s wicked reports  to frighten me  that I was to be   married to the ugly Swiss  who was to sell me on the wedding day to   my master  Her vile way of talking to me  like a London prostitute  My   apprehensions of seeing preparations made for my master s coming  Her   causeless fears that I was trying to get away again  when I had no   thoughts of it  and my bad usage upon it  My master s dreadful arrival    and his hard  very hard treatment of me  and Mrs  Jewkes s insulting   of me  His jealousy of Mr  Williams and me  How Mrs  Jewkes vilely   instigated him to wickedness   And down to here  I put into one parcel    hoping that would content him  But for fear it should not  I put into   another parcel the following
